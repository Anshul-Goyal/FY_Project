"'08-04-01,'1','WASHINGTON — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday suggested that President Bush should skip the opening ceremonies of the Olympics to be held in August in Beijing to protest China’s actions in Tibet, its overall human rights record and its trade policies.The speaker, a California Democrat who just returned from a meeting with the Dalai Lama in India, said Mr. Bush should consider boycotting the opening festivities, which are typically a celebration of the host country, as a way of making a statement that would not interfere with the ensuing games themselves.“The president of the United States, if he is going to give credibility to the Chinese government, he should also take the time to say to them we are very concerned, not only about human rights, which are a very important value to us, but we are also concerned about our trade situation,” Ms. Pelsoi said in an interview.Ms. Pelosi, a longtime critic of China, said German representatives had already said they would not attend the opening ceremonies and the idea has been raised by other foreign officials as a way to show support for Tibetans seeking more independence from China. Ms. Pelosi made it clear that she was not advocating any boycott of the sporting events themselves.She did say that if the International Olympic Committee wanted to portray the event as a gathering that transcended sports, its members should hold the host country to high human rights standard.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','Under organization rules, at least 66 percent of core group members must accept a standard for it to be approved, and no more than 25 percent of all voting nations can oppose it.Roger Frost, an I.S.O. spokesman in Geneva, would not confirm on Tuesday whether Microsoft’s format had been designated as meeting the organization’s standard, saying the organization would disclose the vote on Wednesday after informing its membership. The International Herald Tribune obtained the results from one of the member delegations contacted by the I.S.O.Microsoft’s request for fast-track approval of its Ooxml standard in early 2007 unleashed an intense lobbying campaign by International Business Machines and Sun Microsystems, which helped develop a rival interchangeable document format called Open Document Format.O.D.F. was the first interchangeable document format to receive I.S.O. approval in 2006, and its backers used the exclusive I.S.O. endorsement to pitch the technology to governments and large companies. O.D.F. is now being considered for use by 70 nations.Controversy over the approval process continued into this week.On Monday, the chairman of an advisory committee to the voting body, Steve Pepper, asked the I.S.O. to suspend Norway’s vote to approve Ooxml until an internal investigation could take place, saying the ballot cast did not reflect the interests of his group. “The vast majority of people were against this,” Mr. Pepper said.Ivar Jachwitz, the deputy managing director of Standards Norway, the country’s national standards organization and the person who ultimately submitted Norway’s “yes” vote for Ooxml, disputed Mr. Pepper’s assertion that most people involved in Norway’s voting process had opposed Ooxml.“We had an initial vote back in 2007 of nearly 50 people and the vast majority were in favor,” Mr. Jachwitz said. He did acknowledge that 21 members of the group last week submitted a letter asking for Norway to oppose Ooxml. “Our vote reflected the majority opinion,” Mr. Jachwitz said. “I do not see that it was improper.”Mr. Frost said he had received Mr. Pepper’s complaint, but upon investigation considered the Norwegian dispute to be an internal matter. “We have received background information from them and have no reason to question the validity of their vote,” Mr. Frost said.In Malaysia, which abstained on Ooxml, members of the country’s voting delegation barred uninvited employees of Microsoft and I.B.M. from participating in their deliberations. Sweden nullified its support of the standard last year after one member of its delegation reportedly voted twice.And some members of Germanys delegation complained that I.S.O. rules had not been properly followed and a steering committee of the country’s national standards group, called D.I.N., was called in to rule on whether rules had been followed properly. In the end, the D.I.N. decided to submit no formal second vote to I.S.O., which allowed Germany’s initial approval to stand, according to Jan Dittberner, a spokesman for D.I.N.Demands for speedy approval of Microsoft’s 6,000-page document sparked objections from many I.S.O. members, who felt the organization was being pressured by Microsoft, whose Office application suite is the standard on more than 90 percent of computers and archives around the world, according to International Data Corporation, a research group in Framingham, Mass.Contention over the outcome even influenced the remarks of representatives of countries that abstained from the vote, like the Netherlands. “This is like someone with six shopping carts of food trying to go through the express lane at a supermarket,” said Michiel Leenaars, a member of the Dutch voting delegation. “The end result of this will be confusion. The standard is simply too big. There are still a lot of questions out there.”'"
"'08-04-01,'1','“We’re hoping that we are closer to the end than the beginning,” he added.Adding to the good feelings in the financial sector, Lehman said private investors had snapped up a $4 billion offering of preferred stock — more than expected — in a move to dispel a swirl of rumors about its stability. Shares of the brokerage jumped 17 percent. UBS said it would try a similar move with $15 billion in additional funds; its shares closed up 15 percent.“Lehman demonstrated that not only could they raise the capital at a reasonable cost, but that the Fed really had succeeded at stabilizing the financial system,” Mr. Yardeni said. “Lehman was an important test of that.”Treasury yields rose as investors moved out of the ultra-safe government bonds, and the dollar advanced against the euro, signs of increased confidence among investors that Wall Street will weather the credit crisis.The Dow finished at 12,654.36, and the Nasdaq composite index closed up 3.7 percent. Markets in Europe closed higher as well, with benchmark indexes in London, Paris, and Frankfurt all gaining about 3 percent.The triple-digit swing in the Dow extends the volatility that has rocked stock markets in recent months, as jumpy investors react quickly and violently to incremental developments in the tight credit market. “Each big move we have is almost all coming out of news from that sector,” Mr. Sparks said.The S.& P. 500 just finished one of its most volatile first quarters since the Great Depression. The Dow has swung more than 100 points in 7 of the last 11 sessions.And though some observers will take Tuesday’s rally as a sign of recovery, this type of investing strategy does not have a good track record. Last fall, as Citigroup became one of the first Wall Street firms to acknowledge its mortgage-related assets had lost billions of dollars in value, markets rallied in the hopes that the worst was over. The Dow has since fallen 11.6 percent from its October high.The market gains may have been helped by a better-than-expected report on industrial activity.A closely watched manufacturing report, prepared by the private Institute for Supply Management, ticked up last month, though business is still shrinking within the industry. The gauge of manufacturing activity edged up slightly to a reading of 48.6 in March from 48.3 in February, slightly better than expected. Any reading below 50 is seen as a sign of contraction.Elevated export orders continue to offset flagging domestic demand, but manufacturers are feeling the effects of inflation: a gauge of prices paid for production materials reached its highest level in nearly six years.Spending on construction projects also improved, as overall spending fell 0.3 percent in February after declining 1 percent in January, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday. Government-financed building is increasing even as private residential construction remains in a slump.Investors were also buoyed by a drop in commodity prices, which have reached record levels in recent weeks. The declines in prices for oil, gold and wheat could translate to cheaper prices for consumers.Crude oil has fallen for three consecutive days; it dropped by 41 cents on Tuesday to just under $102 a barrel. Gasoline prices were also trading lower. Gold, which becomes more expensive in times of crisis, declined to $888 a troy ounce after reaching $1,000 two weeks ago.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','The French regulator did not identify or indicate how many individuals could face sanctions, but a person with knowledge of the complaint said it was directed at 17 people. The t regulator said that it would transmit the details of its findings to the company and the individuals concerned in the coming days and that they would have the opportunity to present evidence their defense.The EADS chief executive, Louis Gallois, insisted that those accused should be presumed innocent until a final decision was reached.“EADS will support its managers in their defense,” Mr. Gallois said in a statement. “It intends to demonstrate that it has applied standards of excellence when communicating to the market and has acted with full transparency.”The regulator’s decision to pursue its insider trading case comes at a sensitive time for EADS, which is in the midst of a major restructuring intended to cut operating costs at its Airbus division. The plane maker, based in Toulouse, France, has also been severely hurt by the sharp rise in the euro versus the dollar — the currency in which its aircraft are priced.It also comes a month after EADS and its American partner, Northrop Grumman, were awarded a $35 billion contract to supply the Air Force with 179 aerial refueling tankers — a decision that has ignited a political furor in the United States and which has been formally challenged by its rival, the Boeing Company. The French regulator’s inquiry was almost certain to trigger closer scrutiny of the tanker contract in Washington, analysts said.“It is not going to do EADS and Airbus credibility any good at all that the prosecution issue has been raised against the same senior management that is responsible for delivering the U.S. Air Force tanker program,” said Doug McVitie, managing director of Arran Aerospace, a consulting firm in Dinan, France. “This is very bad publicity at a very bad time.”EADS said Tuesday that it considered any financial risk posed by the inquiry to be “not material,” though it recognized “that these proceedings may have significant consequences on its image and reputation.”EADS has consistently maintained that share trading by its executives was in line with company regulations and was done with the approval of the compliance department and its chief financial officer, Hans-Peter Ring.A preliminary report on the case, leaked to the French media in October, indicated that the investigation had focused initially on 21 top managers, including the two co-chief executives of EADS at the time, Noël Forgeard and Thomas Enders. Mr. Enders is now the chief executive of Airbus.Mr. Forgeard, who was forced to resign in July 2006 amid the insider trading accusations, has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Calls to Mr. Forgeard and to his lawyer, Jean-Alain Michel, were not returned Tuesday.Other Airbus executives named in the October report included Fabrice Brégier, now the chief operating officer; John Leahy, the head of customer relations; and Tom Williams, the head of aircraft programs.Spokesmen for EADS and Airbus were not immediately available for comment on whether these executives remained a part of the investigation.Mr. Enders has maintained his innocence. “I categorically refute the allegations and insinuations in the press,” he said in a letter to Airbus employees dated Oct. 5.According to EADS’s internal regulations, directors may exercise their stock options during specified three-week periods each quarter, provided that they do not have any privileged information and subject to approval by the compliance officer.Such an options period was opened from Nov. 9 to Nov. 29, 2005. During that window, several board members exercised options to sell EADS shares, including Mr. Forgeard, who realized a profit of around 603,000 euros, or about $947,00 at current exchange rates, according to regulatory filings; Mr. Enders, who made 711,750 euros; Ralph Crosby, chief executive of EADS North America, who pocketed 1.35 million euros; and Jean-Paul Gut, then EADS chief operating officer, who made 667,500 euros.The next quarter, Mr. Forgeard and several of his children together exercised options worth nearly 10 million euros from March 9 to March 15, 2006, earning more than 2.5 million euros.It was not until June 2006 that EADS and Airbus acknowledged that deliveries of the A380 would be delayed by six months — sending its shares tumbling 26 percent.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','“He thought it hit someone,” Lundqvist said of Drury. “He smiled. We talk about it all year. He’s just a player who shows up at the right time, at the right spot.”Drury, true to understated form, gave all the credit to Jagr for setting up the play. “I was able to pop free in a pretty good shooting area and was able to get off a good one,” he said.The Rangers (41-27-11) have 93 points, tied with the Devils, but the Devils remain fourth in the conference with two more victories. The Rangers have three games remaining, a home-and-home Thursday and Friday with the Islanders, and a game Sunday in Newark against the Devils.The Penguins (46-26-8) missed a chance to clinch the Atlantic Division title, but remained first in the conference with 100 points, 2 ahead of Montreal. They have two games left, both against the Philadelphia Flyers, who are tied for seventh in the conference.The Rangers were coming off a 3-1 loss Sunday at Pittsburgh in the front end of this home-and-home series, and their hold on a playoff position remained precarious.The game took on a strange quality, partly because of the poor quality of the ice and partly because of how each team attacked it. The circus was performing here the past week, taking a heavy toll on the ice surface.“We couldn’t make any passes,” Jagr said. “The puck was jumping all the time. It’s the worst ice I’ve had in the last few years.”The Rangers had the edge early against a surprisingly passive Pittsburgh offense, which features three of the league’s top offensive players: Sidney Crosby, Marian Hossa and Evgeni Malkin. The Penguins had only one shot through the first period and a half.The Rangers were faring better on offense but had nothing to show for it until a five-on-three power play midway through the second period, a result of penalties on Pittsburgh forwards Ryan Whitney and Jeff Taffe.Jagr swiped a backhanded shot at the net, but the puck was deflected high in the air. Gomez waited for it to come down so he could knock it into the net, but Penguins defenseman Rob Scuderi tried to swat it away. Instead, it hit Scuderi’s glove and bounced off Fleury’s head and into the net at 11:43.The officials took a long time reviewing the play; if the puck had hit Gomez’s stick, it would have been disallowed because the stick was above the level of the crossbar. Replays confirmed it never hit Gomez’s stick.The goal held up until the Penguins turned up their offense in the third. They scored the tying goal when forward Ryan Malone skated into Rangers’ zone and passed across the crease to Maxime Talbot at 10:03.In overtime, Jagr drew a holding penalty on Pittsburgh defenseman Sergei Gonchar, setting the stage for Drury.His teammates know enough not to be amazed.Brendan Shanahan left the game after the second period with an undisclosed lower body injury. Coach Tom Renney said it was not serious. Shanahan was on the bench in overtime, meaning he would have been available for a shootout. ... The Rangers said forward Colton Orr would be out indefinitely with a fractured toe. Petr Prucha played in his place.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) — I.B.M. is under investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency over an $80 million bid it made in 2006 to modernize E.P.A. financial systems and has been suspended from seeking new contracts with all federal agencies, the company said on Monday.In addition, I.B.M. said the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of Virginia had served I.B.M. and certain employees with grand jury subpoenas requesting testimony and documents on interactions between the E.P.A. and I.B.M. employees.International Business Machines, the world’s largest provider of computer services, said it learned on Friday of the temporary suspension, which it said was tied to possible violations of ethical bidding provisions on an E.P.A. contract I.B.M. had submitted in March 2006.The temporary suspension applies to all federal agencies and I.B.M. business units. I.B.M. may continue work on existing contracts as of the date of the suspension, unless a particular agency directs otherwise, the company said in a statement.An I.B.M. spokesman, Fred McNeese, said the company had been blindsided by the government suspension.The company plans to cooperate in the investigation but will fight to limit the scope of its suspension from bidding on new contracts, he said.'"

Industrial output fell 1.2 percent in February, the trade ministry said, less than the median market forecast for a 2.1 percent drop, as production was firmer than expected among makers of machines and chemical products. Production in the electronics parts and devices industry — one of Japan’s leading industries — decreased 4.1 percent in the month, the largest decline since October 2004.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','Brad Greiner, the cofounder of -based Team Darfur and a former water polo player for U.C.L.A., said these personal and business considerations had kept some well-known athletes from joining the coalition. Many are wary of speaking out, he said.Last year, the basketball star , of the , would not sign a letter written by a teammate, Ira Newble, criticizing China for its Darfur policy, according to news reports. Mr. James, who is expected to play for the United States team in Beijing, said at the time that he needed more information. He has a $90 million endorsement contract with Nike.The decision of whether to be an advocate carries risks for lesser-known athletes as well.“This is their one time every four years to make money for a lot of sports,” said Mr. Greiner, 24, who added that the group would intensify its push to sign up top athletes in the months leading up to the Summer Games. “So they need to take that into consideration when making a decision about whether or not to speak about Darfur.”Athletes have few formal guidelines to follow when deciding whether to take a public stand while in Beijing.Rule 51 of the Olympic charter, the constitution of the Olympic movement, forbids athletes from participating in a “demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda” at Olympic sites. When the identifies a possible violation of Rule 51, it asks the Olympic Committee of the athlete’s country to investigate. Depending on the outcome, Olympians can be disqualified or sent home.The question of whether Olympic athletes will have the right to express political views in Beijing erupted in February, after news that and were planning to require that athletes sign contracts barring them from speaking about politically sensitive issues. Both countries quickly reversed course.The United States Olympic Committee permits athletes to express their opinions, provided they do not violate the charter, according to Darryl Seibel, a spokesman., who is trying to reach his fourth Olympics in swimming, said the U.S.O.C. would send subtle messages about avoiding controversial subjects during athlete media and cultural training for the Games. “It’s discouraged, that’s clearly understood,” Mr. Hall said.A 10-medal winner, Mr. Hall said he avoided speaking about politics, but he has been outspoken on subjects related to doping in sports. “There’s a time and place for the issues and causes,” he said. “The Olympic Games and politics don’t go together well.”Giselle Davies, a spokeswoman for the International Olympic Committee, said athletes would not be punished for answering reporters’ questions honestly.Some athletes said they were willing to do whatever it took to draw attention to their cause, even if it meant getting expelled from the Olympics. Emanuel Neto, who expects to make the Angolan national basketball team, said he grew up surrounded by war and famine and, as a result, has empathy for the people of Darfur. “I’ve seen what those kids are going through and it’s really, really bad,” said Mr. Neto, 23, a senior at and a member of Team Darfur. “It doesn’t matter at this point what will happen to me. What matters to me the most is that something has to be done.”Although it is uncommon for sponsors to bar athletes from expressing political views, that could change if the situation worsens in Tibet and more athletes begin to speak out, said Alison Barnwell, a former athlete marketing coordinator for the U.S.O.C. “Especially if a company does business in China, it wouldn’t surprise me at all to see them start adding in clauses that say athletes can’t make negative remarks about the situation,” she said. The free speech issue could be skirted, she said, by arguing “they didn’t want their sponsorship to become a political platform for an athlete.”Anne Putz, Reebok’s head of corporate public relations, said in a statement that the company does not prohibit its athletes from expressing personal opinions. Reebok sponsors the Norwegian cyclist Thor Hushovd, who announced last week that he may boycott the Olympic opening ceremony to protest the Chinese crackdown on Tibetans. “We support our athletes 100 percent on the field, providing them with the best products to help them achieve their goals,” Ms. Putz said. “Off the field, we never influence our athletes about their personal views.”A Nike spokesman said that the company does not limit or censor athletes’ comments. “Over the years, Nike athletes have spoken their mind on issues, and we support our athletes’ right to do so,” KeJuan Wilkins, a Nike spokesman, said in a statement.Joey Cheek, a gold-medal winner in speedskating in 2006, thinks his activism has attracted sponsors. “I think that my earning potential has probably increased because I tried to focus on things that were more than just sports,” he said. Cheek founded Team Darfur with Greiner.Many standard sponsorship contracts contain clauses that could be used to terminate an athlete’s contract in the event a corporation wanted to sever ties. Peter Carlisle, the managing director of Olympics and action sports for the Octagon agency, which represents the American swimmer , said many contracts contain language that allows companies to cancel a contract if an athlete does anything to materially damage the company or its brand. Although the clauses typically govern extreme immoral behavior, “if that language is in there, theoretically, a company could argue that something the athlete says can trigger it,” said Mr. Carlisle, adding that he would be surprised if a company invoked the clause for speaking out on human rights.In an interview with The Associated Press last month, Mr. Phelps said his mind was not on politics. “I’m looking forward to going over there and competing and representing my country the best way I can,” he said. “That’s what I’m focused on.”The U.S.O.C. requires all American participants to attend a two-day “ambassador” training course on topics like Chinese culture and Olympic values, but only minimally addresses speaking to the news media, Mr. Seibel said. He said athletes were taught that “when you go to the Olympic Games, you go as a representative of our country, as a representative of your sport, as a member of the worldwide Olympic family, and as a guest of the host country.”“And every one of those roles carry with them some important responsibilities and expectations,” he added.Mr. Hall said he received U.S.O.C. media training at previous Olympic Games. He said athletes were advised to steer clear of sensitive subjects. If a reporter asks a question about a controversial topic, he said, the trainers suggested that athletes try to redirect the question.Athletes have often used the Olympics to advance their political beliefs, said David Wallechinsky, an Olympic historian. In 1906, the Irish athlete Peter O’Connor, angered that he had been placed on the British team, climbed a flagpole and waved the Irish flag after winning a silver medal. In in 1936, two Korean athletes complained to the news media that the Japanese — who then occupied Korea — had forced them to take Japanese names and wear the Japanese uniform.Perhaps the best-known examples are the American sprinters John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who at the 1968 Games in raised their clenched fists on the medal podium during the playing of the national anthem in a salute to black power. The action enraged the Olympic organizers, and Mr. Carlos and Mr. Smith were soon ushered out of the country. Now, 40 years later, their action is celebrated as heroic.“I just don’t see how you can separate the Olympics from politics,” Mr. Wallechinsky said. “The Olympics is part of the world, period.”'"
"'08-04-01,'1','SEATTLE — Gov. Christine Gregoire of Washington is expected to sign a measure on Tuesday that would give the state some of the toughest rules in the nation restricting toxic materials used in children’s products, though it was unclear just how broad the measure would be.The bill, called the Children’s Safe Products Act, addresses the use of lead, cadmium, phthalates and other materials. It could affect items as varied as crib mobiles, toy robots and child safety seats, and it would go further than a law enacted last year in California addressing phthalates, chemicals that help make plastics malleable.Although the Washington bill passed the Democratic-controlled Legislature relatively easily last month, it has drawn increasing debate while the governor has considered whether to sign it. Ms. Gregoire, a Democrat seeking re-election this fall, has the authority to veto sections of bills, and proponents of the measure say they expect her to do one of the following: void some language, order state agencies to carry out the law with specific exceptions or demand that the Legislature make revisions before it becomes effective in 2009. Lawmakers have said they would be willing to do so.The governor’s office would not confirm what alterations Ms. Gregoire might make. Advocates said they believed the governor would reject language that could ban some safety seats or toys that have lead in largely unreachable areas, like electrical components.“We’re willing to let that go, given that the lead standards would still apply to a huge number of toys,” said Ivy Sager-Rosenthal, an environmental health advocate for the Washington Toxics Coalition.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','“There are murderers, child molesters, drug dealers who are released on bond,” said Earl Butler, an adviser to Mr. McGee. “We say there’s a hidden agenda in this. They just don’t like his style of politics.”Asked why Mr. McGee was behind bars, Joseph R. Wall, an assistant United States attorney, noted that the Federal District Court here had found that he posed a danger to the public. In that order, the court held that the government had shown evidence that he had engaged in witness tampering and intimidation.“When Mr. McGee appealed that finding,” Mr. Wall said, “the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court and upheld the detention order.”Black Wisconsinites, who account for only about 6 percent of the state’s 5.5 million people but for more than 37 percent of Milwaukee’s 600,000, have long complained about the city’s segregated neighborhoods and disparities in power, jobs and incarceration rates.Blunt, provocative and sometimes profane, Mr. McGee, 38-year-old son of a longtime alderman, was never one to shy from such issues. Elected in 2004, he led marches against white Milwaukee police officers accused of beating a biracial man, pressed for legislation requiring companies to disclose old ties to slavery and created a “rapid response team” that he said would serve to solve community problems but that his critics described as a vigilante-style shadow police force. He demanded that minority workers be employed by developers eager to build in Brewers Hill.Mikel Holt, associate publisher of The Milwaukee Community Journal, a black paper, said approvingly that Mr. McGee had been “the Rev. Jeremiah Wright of our local politics.”“He was out here talking about racism on a daily basis, challenging the system,” Mr. Holt said. “Of course, some people didn’t like him for that.”In fact, even before his current troubles, some Sixth District residents had tried to recall Mr. McGee, saying he had turned into an embarrassment. Advocates of the recall argued that he had “shamefully earned the public reputation of a scofflaw,” in part because of an arrest on charges of disorderly conduct and obstructing a police officer; had lied under oath in denying an extramarital affair; and had blurted an anti-gay slur at one of his rallies.But in the recall election, last April, he turned back his critics, winning 64 percent of the vote.Less than two months later, he was arrested and charged with a variety of felonies, including the buying of votes and the theft of money donated to his anti-recall campaign.Among other charges, Mr. McGee is also accused in federal court of demanding money from business owners here in exchange for his help in obtaining liquor licenses, zoning variances and the like. In state court, he is accused of ordering the “head busting” of someone who had burglarized a friend’s home; evidence of this charge, prosecutors say, was captured on a wiretap of his phone.To all of it, Mr. McGee, whose lawyers said he was unavailable for an interview, has pleaded not guilty.Court documents that supported the government’s request that he be held without bail say that while detained, Mr. McGee, in repeated calls that were recorded, tried to “intimidate and otherwise influence witnesses against him” in both the state and federal cases.His supporters say he is operating a “virtual office” from the Waukesha County jail, meeting with constituents and at times even developers. But along the streets of his district, one of 15 comprising about 40,000 people each, business owners and residents seem far less certain of that, saying they have no representative to go to when garbage cans overflow, potholes crop up, vagrants loiter.In a sign of the tension over taking sides in the nonpartisan runoff election on Tuesday, many said they did not wish to talk to a reporter about Mr. McGee or his opponent, Milele Coggs, who comes from a prominent black political family and finished second in the primary with 22 percent of the vote, to Mr. McGee’s 31 percent.“They’re both good people, but we just need an alderman, someone we can call,” said Stacy Hasan, 37, an owner of Ja’Stacy, a restaurant in the district. “You don’t have anyone to call.”Ms. Coggs, 30, a consultant who is the niece of G. Spencer Coggs, a Democratic state senator, finds herself in a peculiar spot, campaigning door to door against a candidate who cannot appear himself and who for some has become a symbol of a fight against racial inequality.Ms. Coggs said she tried to focus on her own campaign issues, like crime reduction, employment and including local residents in development plans. But Mr. McGee, she acknowledged, inevitably comes up.“For some people, this is not just about him and his judicial fight,” she said. “Statistically Milwaukee has one of the highest incarceration rates of black men, and he’s just a bigger example of that to many people.”Elsewhere, Mr. McGee’s very presence in the runoff seems puzzling.“My take on the whole situation is that inner-city Milwaukee remains inner-city Milwaukee because of a McGee type of attitude,” said Fred Greb, a resident of Waukesha, a predominantly white suburb. “That type of mentality is what’s causing Milwaukee’s big racial problem.”But Ms. Allison, the bookstore owner, does not see it that way. What she perceives as racism has changed little in her decades in Milwaukee, she said, other than having grown “more covert.”What would it take to change the city? “We need more Michaels,” she said. “More Michaels at City Hall, more Michaels at the school district, more Michaels at the county level.”Mr. McGee’s trial in the state case is set for May 19. Even if he wins on Tuesday, a felony conviction would make him ineligible to serve. In that case, voters would be called on again, for a special election.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','Many factors contributed to the tightening of the competition at the most selective colleges, admissions deans and high school counselors said, among them demographics. The number of high school graduates in the nation has grown each year over the last decade and a half, though demographers project that the figure will peak this year or next, which might reduce the competition a little.Other factors were the ease of online applications, expanded financial aid packages, aggressive recruiting of a broader range of young people, and ambitious students’ applying to ever more colleges.The eight Ivy League colleges mailed acceptance and rejection letters on Monday to tens of thousands of applicants. Students could learn the fate of their applications online beginning at 5 p.m. on Monday, so three of the colleges said they were not ready to make public their admissions data. But the expectation was that they would also turn out to have been more competitive than ever.“For the schools that are perceived to have the most competitive admissions processes, there has been this persistent rise in applications,” said Jeffrey Brenzel, dean of undergraduate admissions at Yale.Ten years ago, slightly fewer than 12,000 students applied to Yale, compared with the 22,813 who applied this year, Mr. Brenzel said. Yale’s admittance rate — the proportion of applicants offered admission — was nearly 18 percent in 1998, more than double the rate this year.“We’re really happy with the class,” Mr. Brenzel said of the students offered admission. “On a day like today it’s also easy to be aware of the incredible number of fantastic students who you have to turn away, because you know they would be successful here.”At Harvard, as at Yale, the applicant pool included an extraordinary number of academically gifted students. More than 2,500 of Harvard’s 27,462 applicants scored a perfect 800 on the SAT critical reading test, and 3,300 had 800 scores on the SAT math exam. More than 3,300 were ranked first in their high school class.Admissions deans and high school guidance counselors said they spent hours at this time of year reminding students who had been put on waiting lists or rejected entirely that there were other excellent colleges on their lists — and that rejection was often about the overwhelming numbers, rather than their merits as individuals.“I know why it matters so much, and I also don’t understand why it matters so much,” said William M. Shain, dean of admissions and financial aid at Bowdoin. “Where we went to college does not set us up for success or keep us away from it.”'"
"'08-04-01,'1','Business activity declined in several regions of the United States this month, according to new data released on Monday.The index from the National Association of Purchasing Management-New York showed that local business activity fell to 425.8 in March, from 427.7 in February.Separate reports also showed that business activity in the Milwaukee area and manufacturing activity in Texas also contracted in March.In the factory-heavy Midwest, business activity also shrank in March, for the second consecutive month, while a price component rose, highlighting worries of recession and inflation.The National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago business barometer rose to 48.2, from 44.5 in February, but remained below the 50 level that separates contraction from expansion.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','Consumers are confronting sticker shock at the grocery store, while farmers insist they are not getting rich because their own costs, like diesel fuel, are up. Wheat and soybean stockpiles have fallen in the last year, the government said in a separate report, meaning there is little buffer if the weather is not favorable this year and harvests are disappointing.“We’re hoping for good yields,” said David Orden, a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington. “If we get bad yields and tight commodity markets are pushed even tighter, we’ll get food prices skyrocketing, inflationary pressures and food riots in developing countries, and countries cutting off their exports.”Many of those unfortunate trends, Mr. Orden said, are happening already.Soybean producers told the government they would plant 74.8 million acres, up 18 percent from last year and just below the record high in 2006. Corn growers said they would plant 86 million acres, down 8 percent from 2007.The soybean number was a little higher than analysts had been predicting, while the corn number was a little lower. The 2007 corn crop was the biggest since 1944 as growers rushed to capitalize on the government-mandated demand for ethanol. Three years ago, before the ethanol mandates, the price was less than $2.50 a bushel.“In February, we were thinking farmers would plant as much as 90 million acres of corn,” said the Agriculture Department’s chief economist, Joseph Glauber. But the relatively high prices of soybeans might have caused some of them to switch. Soybeans also require less fertilizer, another commodity whose prices have been breaking records.Mr. Glauber cautioned that the planting report not only reflected the intentions of farmers, but could affect them too. Last year’s report underestimated actual corn plantings by three million acres. A rise in corn prices and a drop in soybean prices might inspire other farmers to change their minds.That is what the ethanol industry is hoping. “We do certainly use corn and it is going to have an impact,” said Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association. “But I’m sure the marketplace will respond to this signal.”Joe Victor, an analyst with the market research firm Allendale, said he expected corn to rise as high as $7.50 by summer.Farmers are not necessarily planting less corn for economic reasons, Mr. Victor said: “They’re going back to a more normal crop rotation. They needed to give their corn acres a bit of a rest.” Next year, he predicted, the ratio will shift again, and farmers will cut back on soybeans in favor of corn.A handful of farmers, principally in Texas and California, told the government they were planning to grow more corn. But in the heart of the Corn Belt, it was a different story. Indiana is projected to be down 800,000 acres, Illinois 600,000, Nebraska 600,000, Iowa 1 million.Ray Gaesser in Corning, Iowa, said he would devote about 48 percent of his 6,000 acres to corn, down from 52 percent last year. The rest would be soybeans.“Last year, the price ratio of corn to soybeans was telling us we should plant more corn,” said Mr. Gaesser, a former president of the Iowa Soybean Association. Now the ratio is more in line with historical norms. The result is that “many of the increased corn acres in 2007 are going back to soybeans,” he said.Mr. Gaesser sells his corn to the local ethanol plant, where he is an investor. “If corn prices get low, we make money at the plant,” he said. “If they’re high, we make money in our core business, which is agriculture.” He had already contracted to sell his corn, he said, which meant he would not benefit from any further price rises.For bakers worried about the price of flour, the plantings report offered a little relief. Wheat farmers said they planned to plant 63.8 million acres, up 6 percent, about what the commodities markets had been expecting. Cotton plantings are expected to fall 13 percent to 9.39 million acres. Cotton farmers have been abandoning the crop for corn and wheat.The Agriculture Department said farmers would devote 323.8 million acres to 19 principal crops this year, up 3.8 million acres from last year and 7.8 million acres from 2006. Some of the increase has come from land pulled out of conservation programs, some from pasture, and some from the double-cropping of wheat and soybeans.Despite the back-to-back increases, the number of acres under cultivation is still about six million below the level of a decade ago. The government is not entirely sure why that is happening, but one possibility is that some land has been swallowed up by suburban construction.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','A group of six banks, sued over the buyout of Clear Channel Communications, the radio broadcasting network, asked a New York state court on Monday to hear their request to dismiss the claims against them.Two private equity firms, Thomas H. Lee Partners and Bain Capital Partners, filed complaints last week against the banks — Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, the Credit Suisse Group, the Royal Bank of Scotland Group, Deutsche Bank and the Wachovia Corporation — to force completion of the pending $20 billion buyout of Clear Channel.The parties said the banks balked at providing financing when the debt markets deteriorated and asked for a change in terms that prevented the deal from being completed.“Plaintiffs have presented no basis for litigation, much less proceeding in an expedited manner,” the banks said in a document filed in New York State Supreme Court. The private equity firms filed the lawsuits in New York and Texas last week, and Clear Channel was later granted a temporary restraining order against the banks taking action that it contended would be reneging on their commitments.The banks were to provide more than $22 billion financing and earn more than $400 million in fees.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','“We want to make sure everyone has the opportunity to get their petition in to make the process as fair as possible,” said Christopher S. Bentley, a spokesman for the immigration agency.For the first time, the agency this year has explicitly prohibited companies from filing more than one petition for the same worker.Technology companies have become increasingly frustrated and vocal about the H-1B visa limits and the lottery selection method. In March, Bill Gates of Microsoft told the House Committee on Science and Technology that the current system “makes attracting and retaining high-skilled immigrants exceptionally challenging for U.S. firms.”Mr. Gates said Microsoft and other American companies had been forced to export jobs that could have been done in the United States to countries more welcoming to skilled foreign workers.A study in March by the National Foundation for American Policy, an immigration research group in Washington, concluded that H-1B workers helped United States technology companies generate jobs for American workers. The companies increased their employment by five workers for every H-1B visa they sought, the study found.The H-1B visas bring foreign workers, preferably with master’s degrees or doctorates, for an initial period of three years, renewable for another three years. The visas are intended to help American companies fill shortages of employees with sophisticated skills.But official figures released by Mr. Grassley show that the three biggest users of the H-1B program in 2007 were three companies based in India that perform computer and software contract work here using foreign workers, mainly Indian.The three companies — Infosys Technologies and Wipro Limited of Bangalore, and Satyam Computer Services of Hyderabad — accounted for more than 8,500 of the H-1B visas that received preliminary approval in 2007, figures show.Mr. Durbin, the Senate’s second-ranking Democrat, said in an interview on Monday that these companies had distorted the program’s purpose.“They are H-1B brokers,” Mr. Durbin said. “For a fee, they are moving these engineers to the United States for three or six years, training them and then moving them back to India to work for companies that compete with America.”Ron Hira, a professor of public policy at the Rochester Institute of Technology, said that gaps in the rules had allowed technology companies, including American ones, to misuse the program.“Basically, H-1B has been thoroughly corrupted,” Mr. Hira said. “Under H-1B you could be forced to train your own replacement,” he said, speaking of American workers.Mr. Hira pointed out that current rules do not require employers to prove a labor shortage by advertising jobs or recruiting in the United States. He said wages established for H-1B technology workers were below market levels in this country, allowing companies that use the visas to gain a competitive advantage and lowering wages over all.Mr. Durbin and Mr. Grassley have proposed requiring companies to advertise jobs with the Labor Department before applying for visas, and giving the department new monitoring authority.Infosys, in a statement, said that about 30 percent of its work for American employers was performed “at the client’s location” in this country. It said it used H-1B visas to bring in “our trained resources” for several years or less.Wipro said that 20 percent of its workers in the United States were “local employees.” It said it used H-1B visas to bring in workers “for a short duration.”'"
"'08-04-01,'1','A company called Scientific Protein Laboratories, which supplies the active ingredient in heparin to Baxter International, is also the supplier of much of the pig-derived pancreatic enzymes used by cystic fibrosis patients.Medical and drug scientists have long worried about animal-derived drugs, but they also know that the search for synthetic alternatives has often ended in frustration.“A number of pharmaceutical firms are trying to eliminate all animal-sourced products from their raw material streams,” said Dr. Robert G. Rohwer, the director of a Department of Veterans Affairs neurovirology laboratory. “It’s a very demanding task.”In the case of cystic fibrosis, though, continued as well as a history of unusual variations and impurities in the pig-derived pills, have led the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation to pursue an alternative. The foundation is working with Altus Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Mass., to develop a synthetic version of the enzyme capsules. Altus has entered the final stages of clinical studies on the drug and is planning to seek Food and Drug Administration approval next year to market its synthetic product.The company’s chief financial officer, Jonathan I. Lieber, said that to make the drug, the company uses enzymes derived from microbes that come not from animals but from bacteria and fungus. The enzymes are crystallized, then reproduced in large vats similar to those used to brew beer.Synthetic replacements are also being sought for other medical products, including the lung fluids called surfactants that are used in neonatal wards and for raw materials used in pharmaceutical production. There are also various efforts to find synthetic versions of heparin.History has shown that the risk of transmitting disease from animal-based drugs, while small, is not merely theoretical, according to Paul W. Brown, a retired National Institutes of Health senior investigator.“Any time you take a tissue or an extract process from a tissue from one species and put it into a another species or even another animal, you run the risk of unwanted pathogens that you didn’t know were there; that’s been responsible for repeated problems over the course of time,” Dr. Brown said. “If you can do something without taking tissue or a product from another being, you’re ahead of the game.”Even before the heparin recall, efforts were under way to find synthetic alternatives to that drug. Millions of vials of heparin are used each year in this country to prevent the formation of blood clots during major surgery and kidney dialysis. So far, no ideal synthetic version has been found.Arixtra, a synthetic drug that is marketed by GlaxoSmithKline and copies the most active portion of heparin, has been successfully used for some types of surgery. But besides being about 10 times as expensive as heparin — the company said Arixtra sells for about $42 for a low dose and twice that for a higher dose — it has at least one major medical drawback. Unlike heparin, Arixtra has no specific antidote to enable doctors to reverse its anti-clotting properties if a patient develops bleeding problems. Robert J. Linhardt, a heparin expert at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., who has been working to develop another synthetic alternative, said the use of pigs for heparin was of less concern to him than the issue of where the heparin pigs came from. The recent recall in the United States involved heparin material from Chinese pigs that Scientific Protein Laboratories supplied to Baxter International, a leading heparin marketer.“There are 700 million pigs slaughtered each year, and 400 million are slaughtered in China,” Dr. Linhardt said. “It makes us dependent. Basically 70 percent of the supply of heparin is coming from China. There’s very little regulatory control in China. So the reason why synthetic heparins are appealing is that they could be made in places where there is stronger regulatory control.”In some cases, companies are managing risks of animal-derived products by using animals from specially controlled herds.A herd of superpigs is being bred by scientists at the Mayo Clinic. The N.I.H. is helping finance the Mayo effort, which involves 200 genetically altered pigs housed in a disease-free environment. The hope is that those pigs and their offspring may provide a variety of useful parts, including entire pig hearts for human transplant, as an alternative to human hearts that are in short supply.Survanta, the most widely used lung surfactant for premature infants in the United States, which is made by Abbott, comes from cows in New Zealand, an island thought to be safe from mad cow disease.Until the heparin recall, it was pancreatic enzymes, which are used for other types of pancreatic disorders in addition to cystic fibrosis, that had drawn the most vocal complaints about an animal-derived drug. There have been reports of wide variations in the enzyme concentrations in the pills, which are sold by several companies.Dr. Hendeles, the Florida professor, said it was not clear how much of the disparity was attributable to variations in pig pancreases and how much to an industry technique called overfill, in which extra ingredients are added so capsules do not lose potency before their expiration dates.Jim Massman, a bank employee in Boston whose 7-year-old son, Patrick, has cystic fibrosis, said that the heparin recall had made him want to know more about pancreatic enzymes.“It certainly made me want to ask questions I otherwise might not have,” Mr. Massman said in a telephone interview. “Where are they manufactured? Where are the ingredients coming from?”Scientific Protein Laboratories, a leading supplier of pig-derived ingredients to manufacturers — including pancreatic enzymes — submitted a letter to the F.D.A. in 2004 saying that the enzymes carried a pig virus that is not dangerous to humans and that eliminating all viruses from the pills could result in damage to the enzymes. In 2006 the F.D.A. said that the viruses must nonetheless be eliminated or rendered inactive.The F.D.A. said March 19 that an investigation of the heparin found the presence of a separate ingredient, over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate, that was added to the heparin somewhere in China. The agency is investigating how that occurred, who is responsible and whether the additive caused the medical problems.In a statement last week, Scientific Protein Laboratories said that it was cooperating with the F.D.A. and Baxter in its investigation of the heparin problems, and that the contamination occurred before the heparin reached its Chinese manufacturing plant.Scientific Protein Laboratories also supplies an estimated 65 percent of pancreatic enzymes used in this country, according to a letter from the company on file with the F.D.A. A spokesman for Scientific Protein Laboratories, Wayne Pines, said the company got its pig pancreas material only from pigs raised in the United States.The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation remains concerned about deviations in pancreatic enzyme pills and the possibility that unidentified viruses or other contaminants could threaten supplies of the drug, according to Dr. Preston W. Campbell, the organization’s medical director.That is why the organization is helping finance the development of an alternative synthetic product made by Altus Pharmaceuticals.Altus has entered the final stages of clinical studies on the drug and is planning to submit its new drug application with the F.D.A. next year.Instead of five large pills with each meal and snack, people with cystic fibrosis would have to take only one small capsule.“You don’t ever know what’s going to happen to pigs,” said Dr. Campbell of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. “We wanted redundancy in the system and a backup. If there was a recall of these products for six months, a number of people would die.”'"
"'08-04-01,'1','While it is legal in Switzerland to shoot feral cats as well as domestic ones that stray more than 200 yards from their homes, it is not clear how many cats are hunted every year here and across the border in France, where residents have also complained about disappearing felines. One government official put the number at a couple of dozen. Luc Barthassat, a legislator with the Christian Democratic People’s Party, said about 2,000, but members of S O S Chats, an advocacy group, say tens of thousands are killed.Estimates of the value of each pelt vary wildly. Mr. Barthassat said he had been told by tanners that they pay only about $5. But animal rights advocates say that hunters make much more than that, noting that some blankets made from 10 pelts sell at retail for more than $1,700.But the numbers almost seemed beside the fact this fall, after a series of TV reports created a public furor. Three TV news crews from Switzerland and France conducted hidden-camera investigations that caught tanners who had officially denied trading in cat fur actively doing so and, in at least one case, explaining that cat meat was also available.Soon S O S Chats had collected more than 123,000 signatures urging the government to ban the practice. Brigitte Bardot and Michael Schumacher, the popular Formula One driver, signed the petition, as did leaders of animal-rights groups around the world.“This is probably the most popular subject we are dealing with this year,” said Mr. Barthassat, who has introduced a bill that would ban the import, export and domestic commercial trade in cat fur. “By this summer, it will be resolved. It is very personal for many people because cats are more than animals to us.”Regardless of how common it is, news media reports over the past year across Europe portraying Switzerland as a cat-slaying haven have helped S O S Chats press its case. “The politicians must be careful what they say, but that they are helping us is a good thing,” said Tomi Tomek, the director of S O S Chats, who has lived since 1981 at a 260-cat shelter nestled in the rugged western Swiss mountains near Neuchâtel. “All of this publicity has driven the trade underground, and that is good, too.”The matter would most likely have reached the Swiss Parliament in some form this year regardless of the activism and publicity because the European Union has required member states to prohibit the import and export of cat fur by the end of 2008 anyway. Switzerland is not a member of the Union but does have treaties that require it to adhere to many of its rules on trade matters. Mr. Barthassat’s effort to end the domestic trade, however, is a step beyond the European Union’s demands.Ms. Tomek said her organization had spent a decade trying to bring attention to the use of cat fur and the theft of domestic cats. She said one of the biggest problems her group faced was to convince people that there really was a trade in cat fur.“For a long time, nobody believed us because we had no proof,” she said. “We would call up the tanners and tell them who we were and ask them, and they would never admit they did this. Then we started just pretending we wanted to order some cat fur, and they sold to us. Now we are not seen as liars anymore.”Armed with a thicket of receipts showing purchases by S O S Chats of cat fur garments as recently as last August, Ms. Tomek approached journalists from across Europe, persuading several to look into the matter.Until she saw the news reports, Mrs. Nydegger herself dismissed Mrs. Tomek and others as radicals. But the loss of her third cat, Merlin, was particularly shocking because he was so loyal and well behaved, often taking walks with her and her dogs without a leash. That Merlin would have wandered off, she said, is “just completely impossible.”No less than Christophe Darbellay, the president of Mr. Barthassat’s own party, has said he is alarmed by the growing international outrage over the trade in a Western European nation otherwise known for its high regard for animal welfare. The Swiss are a pet-loving people, more than 60 percent of whom have a dog or cat, he said. Companion animals are often seen sitting with owners in restaurants and on public transportation.“Switzerland is becoming the place where the most cats are being killed for the import and commerce to sell the cat fur,” Mr. Darbellay said. “We don’t like to be seen this way.”'"
"'08-04-01,'1','LONDON — After six months of sensational testimony, the inquest into the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, began its final phase on Monday, with the coroner’s using his summation to dismiss any conspiracy theories involving the royal family or secret service in her death and to rebuke their relentless, deep-pocketed accuser, Mohamed al-Fayed, the owner of Harrods department store.The coroner, Lord Justice Scott Baker, said there was nothing to support allegations that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh and husband of Queen Elizabeth II, “ordered Diana’s execution,” nor that Britain’s secret intelligence service, MI6, or any other government agency played any part in the 1997 car crash that killed her and her lover, Mr. Fayed’s son Dodi.“There is no evidence that the Duke of Edinburgh ordered Diana’s execution, and there is no evidence that the secret intelligence service or any other government agency organized it,” he said. The five possible verdicts he outlined available to the 11-member jury included unlawful killing through “the gross negligence” of the driver, Henri Paul, and “grossly negligent driving” by the paparazzi pursuing the couple. But, he added, “It is not open to you to find that Diana and Dodi were unlawfully killed in a staged accident.”With British taxpayers’ costs for the inquest having passed $6 million, on top of at least twice that spent on inquiries of the crash by the British and French authorities, the coroner’s summing-up appeared to bring the case full circle, back to facts that were known within weeks, or days, of the crash: that Diana and Dodi al-Fayed died when their Mercedes-Benz, driven at high speed by Mr. Paul, who was drunk and trying to outpace the paparazzi, crashed head-on into a concrete pillar in a tunnel under the Pont de l’Alma in Paris in the early hours of Aug. 31, 1997.Starting last October, more than 10 years after the crash, more than 250 witnesses have marched week after week before the inquest and into the headlines of Britain’s newspapers and television newscasts. The testimony examined aspects of Diana’s private life and her increasingly acrimonious and even fearful relationship with Prince Philip, the father of her ex-husband Prince Charles. Rarely, if ever, have the sensibilities of the British public — and their prurient interest in the royal family’s private lives — been more provoked, or so richly sated by events in court.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','People with a large pot belly in midlife are at increased risk for dementia in their later years, according to a new study, and the bigger the belly the higher the risk.“People should be concerned not only about weight, but about where they carry it,” said Rachel A. Whitmer, the study’s lead author and a research scientist at the research division of Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif. “And midlife is not too early to start thinking about it.”It is well known that fat around the waist, even in people who are not overweight, is a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, but this is the first finding of an association with dementia.The study, which appeared online last week in Neurology, measured the sagittal abdominal diameter, or S.A.D. (in laymen’s terms, how far the pot belly sticks out), of 6,583 men and women in their 40s from 1964 to 1973, then looked at their records an average of 36 years later, when they found 1,049 dementia cases.Compared with those in the lowest one-fifth in S.A.D., those in the highest one-fifth were almost three times as likely to have dementia. Even among people of normal weight, those with an S.A.D. above 9.8 inches — which corresponds roughly to a 40-inch waist — were almost twice as likely to be demented as those with the smallest bellies. The association held after controlling for high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and other variables.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','The flood of referrals, however, is making it hard for Social Security to respond to people who are truly disabled, said Kenneth D. Nibali, the former top administrator of the Social Security disability program.“Anybody who is forced to come into this system, and who doesn’t need to be there, is affecting someone else,” said Mr. Nibali, who retired in 2002 and is serving as an expert witness for the plaintiffs. “They’re holding up cases for the people who have been waiting for months and years, who in many cases are much worse off.”Already, the disability program is in much worse shape financially than the old-age portion of Social Security. It is projected to run out of money in 2026, 16 years ahead of the old-age trust fund.The disability caseload is also expected to grow as the work force ages, since recovery time increases with age. The number of people waiting for hearings on their claims by an administrative law judge has more than doubled since 2000, and the average wait has grown to 512 days in that time, from 258 days.The Social Security Administration is not an active participant in the lawsuits and declined to comment on them. A spokesman, Mark Lassiter, said Social Security does not keep track of how many of its roughly 2.5 million annual applicants for disability are referred by insurance companies. But he cited academic research showing that 18 percent acknowledged privately that they were unqualified, because they could still work. “It is probable that many of these claimants were required to apply,” Mr. Lassiter said.Jessica Ortiz, a 27-year-old gas station attendant in San Diego, said that was what happened to her. Her disability insurer, the Unum Group, called more than 10 times after she was hurt in a car crash, insisting that she apply for Social Security and asking repeatedly where her application stood. Unum was paying her only $50 a month under her policy, she said, which seemed a small amount to merit so much attention.She did not need or want money from Social Security, and did not think she was entitled to it. Her doctors had told her she would recover, and Social Security is limited to people whose disabilities are total and permanent. But she applied because Unum insisted, she said.Ten months after her accident, Ms. Ortiz returned to work. Social Security turned her down, as she had expected. People who can work are by definition unqualified for disability pay from the government. But when she told the Unum representative what had happened, he told her she could still appeal.“If I were the government, I’d be pretty upset,” she said. “No wonder the pot could run out of money.”When the circumstances of Ms. Ortiz’s case were described, a spokesman for Unum said he could not comment without reviewing her case file. The spokesman, Jim Sabourin, said the company believed that it always had valid reasons for telling people to apply for Social Security.Forcing people who are injured to apply for Social Security before paying their claims appears to bolster insurers’ profits in several ways. If claimants refuse to apply, the insurers can simply stop paying their benefits, said Dawn Barrett, an employee of the Cigna Corporation, who grew frustrated sending people to Social Security and who is now a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits. More typically, she said, people apply for Social Security when an insurer tells them to. That allows the insurer to reduce its claim reserves, money that is kept in conservative investments for benefit payments. And in the insurance industry, smaller reserves mean bigger profits.“It’s all about the numbers,” Ms. Barrett said.Finally, disability insurers tell many of their claimants to appeal Social Security’s rejections again and again, until some are finally accepted. Then the insurers can take those people off their rolls, shifting the cost to the government.Whistle-blowers have filed lawsuits against the Unum Group, America’s largest disability insurer, and Cigna, another large one, though there is no dispute that the Social Security requirement is an industrywide practice. Unum, with revenue of $10.5 billion, paid disability claims of $4 billion last year.Both companies said their claims practices were fair, legal and consumer-friendly.“Our goal is to ensure that each member receives all of the benefits to which he or she is entitled,” said Jill Roman, a spokeswoman for Cigna.The lawsuits do not fault the idea of coordinating benefits with Social Security and workers’ compensation. Instead, they contend that insurers are recklessly dumping people on Social Security’s doorstep, without properly screening them to make sure they have a chance of qualifying.The typical long-term disability policy says workers can collect when they are unable to do their own jobs for some period, usually more than five months. Social Security, by contrast, will pay only those people who are so badly disabled they cannot do any job at all. The disability must be one that will last more than 12 months or that will lead to death within that time.Mr. Sabourin, the spokesman for Unum, denies the suits’ accusations and says that his company does screen people. He said Unum considered it in the best interests of its claimants to try for Social Security, because the federal program offers advantages over private insurance. Even though the federal requirements are tough, he said, Social Security has certain exceptions and trial programs that Unum’s claimants might qualify for.Unum is also concerned that the lawsuits might lead to changes in federal rules that require Social Security to vet all applications thoroughly. Any changes might drive up the cost of disability insurance premiums, Mr. Sabourin added. Unum plans to file a motion for a summary judgment in its lawsuit, which is in Federal District Court in Boston. The case is to be heard this fall.Both whistle-blower lawsuits cite the federal False Claims Act, a law that allows affected government programs to recover triple damages. The lawsuits were brought by people contending that the insurers were knowingly committing fraud.Mr. Nibali, the retired Social Security administrator, says the disability program has “an open-door policy” and is required to seriously consider all applications, even those that might seem improbable. While deciding whether a 65-year-old should get retirement benefits is relatively quick and easy; deciding whether someone should get disability benefits is not. The Social Security Administration compiles detailed medical records, sends applicants to doctors for examinations and tests, reviews their work histories and sometimes interviews their friends and relatives.Rejections can be appealed again and again.“A person can come in and file a disability claim with us as many times as they want to,” Mr. Nibali said.Linda Simmond, a 41-year-old mother in Atlanta, has been at it for four years. She worked as the supervisor of 10 Little Caesars pizza shops in Detroit but had to stop when she was found to have carpal tunnel syndrome, a wrist injury, from rolling out pizza dough. Surgery did not help.Little Caesar Enterprises was insured through Unum, which started paying Ms. Simmond disability benefits of about $1,780 a month, but told her she had to apply for Social Security. She did so, and was rejected. Ms. Simmond thought that was correct.“I’m not totally disabled,” she said. “I’ve seen people with one hand, no legs, working, so I know I can do something.”Unum told her to appeal. She refused. Unum stopped sending her checks. After several months with no income, Ms. Simmond relented and filed the appeal. Unum then resumed her payments — but before long, Social Security rejected her again, and the whole cycle began anew.Unum is now paying Ms. Simmond her benefits, but warning her that if she does not apply for Social Security again, it will stop her checks a third time, she said. “I need my benefits,” she said. “I have two children. I have a lot of debts. I’m going to have to do it, but I don’t believe in it.”When Ms. Simmond’s situation was described to him, Mr. Sabourin said he could not comment on it without reviewing her case file.Mr. Nibali has calculated that it costs $1,180, on average, to process a single Social Security disability application to the first decision, usually a rejection. If the applicant persists through the first three levels — the initial review, a reconsideration and a hearing by an administrative law judge — the case will cost the system an average of $4,759, he found. It is possible to appeal even higher, adding further to the cost. Lawyers from the firm Phillips & Cohen, in Washington, who are representing the plaintiffs, have been working with statistical samples. Their numbers suggest that the industry has been sending tens of thousands of dubious claims to Social Security, costing the system hundreds of millions of dollars over the last decade.Mr. Nibali said he believed that Cigna, Unum and other disability insurers had enough data on their claimants to weed out many meritless applications before sending so many people to Social Security. That would help the program’s finances, he said. “We’re not here to give money away.”'"
"'08-04-01,'1','The Mets have become baseball’s Sisyphus. For two consecutive seasons, the Mets have pushed a gigantic baseball up a steep mountain, only to have it come back down and crush their World Series dreams.Two seasons ago, the Mets waltzed into the postseason and advanced to the National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mets were heavily favored but lost the series in seven games. The lingering image of that Game 7 — for Mets fans — was Carlos Beltrán, with runners on base, looking at strike three to end the series.Last season, the Mets began the agonizing 162-game journey all over again. Then in a September finale that they will never forget, the Mets lost to these Marlins, 8-1, at Shea Stadium. That loss, coupled with a Philadelphia victory, eliminated the Mets from the postseason.The Mets had held a seven-game lead with 17 to play. Their fall was one of the greatest collapses in baseball history.So the Mets begin a new campaign in Florida. While all the other teams talk about beginning the season shoulder to shoulder at the starting line, the Mets begin their journey at the bottom of an imposing mountain.The significant difference this season is the presence of Santana. Give the Mets credit: the trade to bring him to New York was a masterly stroke. Minaya made a tremendous tactical move. The Mets had to do something to remove the bitter taste of last season’s collapse. Trading for the best pitcher in baseball gave fans a much-needed jolt of hope.The strategy appears to have worked. The Mets expect home attendance in this final season at Shea Stadium to break last year’s record 3.85 million.Beltrán was so inspired that he said the Mets were the team to beat in their division.“Without Santana” he said, “we felt as a team that we had a chance to win in our division. With him now, I have no doubt that we’re going to win in our division.”There certainly is a lot to look forward to. The excitement of moving into a new stadium, the joy of having the best pitcher in baseball. The anticipation of Santana leading the charge up — and finally over — the hill outweighs the demoralization of last fall’s collapse.Shortly after he signed, Santana told the news media that the Mets “will have everything it takes to go all the way to make it happen.” He called New York “the capital of the world,” and talked about looking forward to the challenge of playing there.But the thought that must be in the back of every Mets fan’s mind is the harrowing possibility that — even with Santana’s arrival — the Mets’ time has come and gone. The endings have become worse: Beltrán looking at a called third strike, then last season’s collapse.Will 2008 be the continuation of a downward spiral or will this be the glorious season when Sisyphus finally breaks free and bowls us all over?These are long-range questions on a day traditionally reserved for declarations of joy and optimism.Not with the Mets.'"
"'08-04-01,'1','NEW DELHI — Tibetan exile groups staged another spirited anti-Chinese demonstration here Monday, but the most radical among them have quietly called off a controversial march into Tibet, apparently heeding requests from their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama.Several hundred protesters marked the arrival of the Olympic torch in Beijing by dressing in black and staging a bloody tableau of Chinese atrocities on Tibetans. They carried a box with a petition calling on Beijing to show restraint and allow an international fact-finding mission into Tibet. They said the petition had been signed by 1.5 million people around the world.Later in the day, they were allowed to go to the gates of the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi, where a security guard received a copy of the petition. Earlier this month, several protesters were arrested after scaling the walls of the embassy and causing considerable embarrassment to the Indian authorities.Meanwhile, in Nepal, where police have forcefully cracked down on Tibetan protests, hundreds of demonstrators split into small groups on Monday and tried to storm a Chinese consular office from different directions in the capital, Katmandu, Reuters reported. Police beat them with sticks and detained more than 280 people, Reuters said.India continues to be in the eye of the Tibet storm. It shelters about 100,000 Tibetan refugees and allows the Dalai Lama to in effect run an administration from Dharamsala. New Delhi does not formally recognize his government-in-exile but describes him as a guest in India.'"

"'08-04-02,'0','Wall Street turned lower Wednesday as investors worried that a jump in oil prices could be another signal that consumers are under stress in an economy that is already showing signs of a recession.The major indexes, which spent most of the session in a tight trading range, tumbled after oil prices shot higher in response to the Energy Department’s report of an unexpected jump in gasoline demand. Crude oil rose $3.85 to settle at $104.83 a barrel in New York trading.In late afternoon trading, the Dow Jones industrials fell almost 100 points, before finishing 45.44 points lower, to 12,608.92 after changing direction several times. Broader market indexes also fell. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index were down less than one percent.Surging demand for oil is likely to send prices at the pump higher, a troublesome trend given that retail gas prices are expected to rise further as the summer approaches and put more financial pressure on consumers.“The oil uptick took away some of the optimism that we’ve seen recently,” said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. “Higher gasoline price would mean less in the pocket for Americans, and there’s also continued worries about a recession.”'"
"'08-04-02,'0','BEIJING (AP) — Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. urged Chinese leaders on Wednesday to press ahead with changes to their financial market but acknowledged the tight credit markets might make them hesitant.Mr. Paulson met with the Chinese president, Hu Jintao, and Beijing’s new point man on trade ties with Washington, Wang Qishan. Mr. Paulson said he assured them that Washington was trying to resolve its credit crisis but cautioned it was no finished and there would be ”more bumps in the road.”“There is no doubt that what is happening in the U.S. markets clearly has to give the Chinese pause,” he said. “They may be too polite to say that directly. But it clearly has to be giving them pause.”Mr. Paulson, who was in Beijing as part of a dialogue on trade and other contentious issues, said the two sides discussed financial reform, though he declined to say what Chinese officials said.He said once again that Beijing must open its financial markets wider to competition if it wanted to continue to develop.“They have headed down the path to a market economy, and capital markets are a very powerful force for good,” Mr. Paulson said. “Until they have efficient, competitive capital markets, their people will not receive adequate returns on their savings.”'"
"'08-04-02,'0','By the end of his comments, it was also clear that he and the Fed were not entirely pleased with the “blueprint” for regulatory changes issued on Monday by the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.That proposal called for an overhaul and consolidation of the financial regulatory system. The Fed chief, in an almost classic case of damning with faint praise, said Mr. Paulson’s blueprint was “a very interesting and useful first step” for Congress to consider.Mr. Bernanke, testifying before the Joint Economic Committee on Capitol Hill, said the economic situation had weakened since the Fed last reported at the end of January but that it could revive later in 2008 because of the $150 billion spending and tax cut package enacted this year.“It now appears likely that real gross domestic product, or G.D.P., will not grow much, if at all, over the first half of 2008 and could even contract slightly,” he said. “We expect economic activity to strengthen in the second half of the year, in part as the result of stimulative monetary and fiscal policies.”On Wall Street and in other markets, Mr. Bernanke’s comments led to a modest decline in share prices, most likely because his assessment reflected a growing consensus that the United States would experience a recession this year.Mr. Bernanke, making his first public comments about Bear Stearns, spent a considerable amount of time defending the Fed’s actions in arranging for Bear Stearns to be acquired by JPMorgan Chase at a fire-sale price, and with the help of a $30 billion loan from the Fed.Providing new details about the deal, which was arranged behind closed doors during the weekend of March 15, Mr. Bernanke said he and his colleagues at the Fed did not know until March 13 that Bear Stearns faced bankruptcy and that they quickly realized a failure to act would create a global crisis.“With financial conditions fragile, the sudden failure of Bear Stearns likely would have led to a chaotic unwinding of positions in those markets and could have severely shaken confidence,” he said. “The company’s failure could also have cast doubt on the financial positions of some of Bear Stearns’s thousands of counterparties and perhaps companies with similar businesses.”He said the $30 billion in collateral — in housing securities that have not been identified or evaluated publicly — would eventually be sold and that the Fed, and by extension the taxpayer, would not lose money. Indeed he suggested that the deal might make money for the taxpayer.'"

"'08-04-02,'0','HONG KONG (Reuters) — Asian stocks jumped and bonds fell on Wednesday after a Lehman Brothers securities offering met strong demand, raising hopes that the worst of the credit crisis might be over.A $19 billion write-down by the Swiss bank UBS reinforced the view that the banks were aggressively scrubbing their books clean of soured investments tied to the United States housing market.The change of mood bolstered the dollar, which in turned pushed oil back down toward $100 a barrel. The currency held on to its gains in early Asian trade.“The market has become somewhat confident that banks can overcome this crisis,” said Kosuke Hanao, head of currency sales at HSBC. “The dollar’s rebound may continue for a month.”The euro was little changed from its level in late New York trade at $1.5600, in sight of Tuesday’s one-week low around $1.5560 and well below a record high of $1.5905 hit last month.The dollar was quoted at 101.80 yen , little changed here, too, after jumping around 2 yen on Tuesday.Bank shares led stock markets higher, lifting Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 3.3 percent in early trading and shares in the rest of Asia 1.5 percent.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','Pentagon officials said Mr. Gates had yet to approve the recommendation.Mr. Gates, a former director of central intelligence, has promised to improve coordination of the Pentagon’s intelligence collection with other spy agencies and help rebuild some of the relationships bruised under Mr. Rumsfeld’s tenure. Mr. Rumsfeld and some of his aides had expressed deep suspicion toward the Central Intelligence Agency in particular, and some people accused Mr. Rumsfeld of trying to build an intelligence empire of his own.Shortly after taking over the Pentagon last year, Mr. Gates ordered a broad review of its intelligence operations and of the Defense Department’s relationships with other spy agencies.It is unclear whether Mr. Clapper is also recommending tighter restrictions on Pentagon counterterrorism and counterespionage operations in the United States.Some civil liberties groups said they worried that the change might be cosmetic and that the Pentagon might be closing the office to farm out its operations to other agencies that receive less scrutiny.Lt. Col. Patrick Ryder, a Pentagon spokesman, said the recommendation to close the office had nothing to do with its troubled history. The move is aimed, Colonel Ryder said, at “creating efficiencies and streamlining” Pentagon efforts to thwart operations by foreign intelligence services and terror networks.Representative Silvestre Reyes, Democrat of Texas and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, called the decision long overdue.Mr. Reyes said the office “was a Rumsfeld-era relic that triggered major concern about domestic intelligence gathering by the Pentagon against Americans.”The work of coordinating the Pentagon’s various counterintelligence activities would remain important, Mr. Reyes said, but “vigorous oversight” would be needed under the new structure.Some current and former Pentagon officials expressed concern that putting the mission of countering foreign intelligence services under the Defense Intelligence Agency could signal a decline in its priority. But Colonel Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman, said the recommendation to close the counterintelligence office was intended to strengthen counterintelligence operations.Pentagon officials said that the database that housed information about the war protesters was built to track terrorist threats against domestic military bases and that reports about war protesters were put into it by mistake. Mr. Clapper ordered an end to the database, called Talon, last year.The disclosure that the Pentagon was collecting information about citizens in the United States prompted memories of its activities decades ago, when the military used electronic surveillance to monitor civilians protesting the Vietnam War. The Pentagon is traditionally barred from conducting domestic intelligence operations.The counterintelligence office was also brought into the scandal surrounding Representative Randy Cunningham, a California Republican, who resigned from Congress in 2005 after pleading guilty to taking bribes from military contractors. Some of the contracts that Mr. Cunningham channeled to Mitchell J. Wade, a longtime friend, were for programs of the counterintelligence office.Newly declassified documents released on Tuesday shed more light on another activity coordinated by the Pentagon’s counterintelligence office, issuing letters to banks and credit agencies to obtain financial records in terrorism and espionage investigations.The Pentagon has issued hundreds of so-called national security letters, which are noncompulsory, as a tool to examine the income of employees suspected of collaborating with a foreign spy service or international terrorist network.The documents, released as part of a Freedom of Information lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, include an internal review begun in 2007 that examined the Pentagon’s use of the letters. The review found poor coordination and a lack of standardized training inside the Defense Department about using the letters, but uncovered no instances where the department broke any laws.The Pentagon is authorized to issue the letters, sometimes in coordination with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to obtain financial records of civilian and military Defense Department employees and their families.Colonel Ryder said that since the Sept. 11 attacks there had been six cases where the letters were used to obtain records about the family members of Defense Department employees.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','“What enables the innovation is the ability to bring over all the existing PC applications,” said Anand Chandrasekher, general manager of the company’s Ultra Mobility Group.The weak link in the Intel strategy is that voice communication remains a significant factor for consumers choosing to buy hand-held devices.Intel backed out of the cellphone market two years ago when it sold its Xscale microprocessor business to the Marvell Technology Group. Intel then set out on an ambitious redesign project for ultralow-power versions of its PC-oriented X86 chips. The current system requires two chips, one for the processor and one for peripherals. It will take the company another technology generation to place everything on a single chip.That leads some analysts to believe that the company’s real breakthrough will not come until 2009 or 2010, when a new processor, now code-named Moorestown, arrives.“We’re pretty bullish on it with some qualifications,” said Van L. Baker, a research vice president at the Gartner Group, a market research firm. “We don’t believe they get there in a significant way until the next generation of technology.”Meanwhile, Intel’s strategy is moving the company toward a direct confrontation with Qualcomm, the San Diego-based chip maker that is also trying to deliver the wireless Internet on hand-held devices. The company, which refers to its strategy as “pocketable computing,” is offering a competing chip that offers lower power consumption and which is aimed for devices that blend voice and Internet data.“We need to deliver an Internet experience that is like the desktop,” said Sanjay Jha, Qualcomm’s chief operating officer. “People are used to the Internet, and you can’t shortchange them.”The new Intel mobile Internet strategy takes advantage of the company’s Atom microprocessor, which was announced in early March. The Atom will have performance roughly equivalent to laptop computers introduced four years ago, but will use little more than a half-a-watt to two-and-a-half watts of battery power. That is significantly lower than the 35 watts of power consumed by the company’s state-of-the-art microprocessors in today’s laptops.The new MIDs, which are scheduled to begin showing up in consumer electronics outlets in June, are the clearest evidence to date of the effort that Intel has made since its chief executive, Paul Otellini, set the company on a low-power strategy in 2005. In interviews, Intel executives said that the company was slightly ahead of the commitment Mr. Otellini made to bring out a line of lower-power processors before the end of the decade.Complicating life for Intel is the fact that the chip maker is locked out of the low-power cellphone and smartphone marketplace, which today is entirely based on microprocessor chips made by designs licensed from the British design firm ARM Ltd. to companies like Qualcomm.More than 10 billion ARM chips have been sold by more than 200 licensees, and ARM now says that more than eight million chips a day are being used in cellphones, smartphones and a wide range of hand-held consumer products.Until recently, early efforts by the PC industry to create so-called palmtop PCs, such as the Microsoft-inspired Ultra-Mobile PCs, have failed to find a broad consumer audience. Indeed, the entire P.D.A., or personal digital assistant, market is all but dead as many of its functions were overtaken by the smartphone.However, the category showed renewed signs of life last year when Asus, a Taiwanese equipment maker, made a name for itself by introducing the Eee PC, a two-pound Linux-based laptop that sells for $400.Now many of the mainstream PC makers are rushing to introduce similar laptops that fall well below the traditional PC laptop price, but allow Web surfing and many basic computing tasks. There is also renewed interest among consumer electronics makers in devices that are neither laptops or cellphones.Introducing products at the Intel event in Shanghai will be Asus, BenQ, Clarion, Fujitsu, Gigabyte, Lenovo, LG-E, NEC, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp, Toshiba, WiBrain and Usi. Intel has also distanced itself from its traditionally close relationship with Microsoft and Windows by striking up a new partnership with Ubuntu and Red Flag, two distributors of Linux software for consumer markets.“Think of it as, ‘honey I shrunk the PC,’ ” said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a consumer electronics market research and consulting firm. “Intel is betting that this will be a win in China, which already has the world’s largest mobile phone market and therefore influences the rest of the world market.”'"
"'08-04-02,'0','In a sweeping use of its authority, the Department of Homeland Security said Tuesday that it would bypass environmental reviews to speed construction of fencing along the Mexican border.Michael Chertoff, the homeland security secretary, issued two waivers covering 470 miles of the border from California to Texas well as a separate 22-mile stretch in Hidalgo County, Tex., where the department plans to build fencing up to 18 feet high into a flood-control levee in a wildlife refuge.“Criminal activity at the border does not stop for endless debate or protracted litigation,” Mr. Chertoff said in a statement.The announcement angered environmental groups, which have raised concerns through lawsuits and public hearings about the damage that fencing could cause to wildlife. Property owners, particularly along the Rio Grande, have also objected to what they considered federal intrusion on their land and access to the river.Previously, Mr. Chertoff had used his waiver authority three times to overcome environmental hurdles along limited segments of the border in San Diego and Arizona. But as the department strives to meet a deadline of year’s end for nearly 700 miles of fencing, he has now greatly expanded the use of his waiver authority, which was granted by Congress.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','RIDGEWOOD, N.J. — Tuesday turned out to be opening day for José Canseco, too. Arriving 18 minutes late and wearing wraparound sunglasses and a day or two’s worth of stubble, Canseco signed copies for the first time of his second book, “Vindicated: Big Names, Big Liars and the Battle to Save Baseball.”When Canseco was introduced to about 35 people in the basement of Bookends, a shop on the main street of this quiet Bergen County town, he was warmly applauded. The response to the second book, he said, has been different from the first.“I think the title could have been, ‘I Told You So,’ but that’s already been taken,” he said after he had signed about 100 copies.In his first book, “Juiced,” which was released in 2005, Canseco said that up to 85 percent of the players in Major League Baseball had used anabolic steroids, including him and Yankees first baseman Jason Giambi, among others.“He was pretty much the guy who opened up the can of worms,” said Matt Whitfield of Chatham.“Juiced” became a best seller and made Canseco a hero to some fans for revealing steroid use among players. Some of those fans waited up to six hours Tuesday to have him sign the new book.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','Thornburg Mortgage shares rose nearly 20 percent Tuesday after the company, which provides large residential mortgages, said it successfully raised $1.35 billion in a last-ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy.In a statement late Monday, Thornburg said it sold subordinated secured notes with an initial 18 percent interest rate, warrants to buy common stock at 1 cent a share and a stake in some mortgage assets.The company said it had received $1.15 billion of the proceeds and expected to receive the remaining $200 million after a tender offer for preferred stock.“It should keep them out of bankruptcy,” said Jason Arnold, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in San Francisco. “They gave away everything and the kitchen sink to get the deal done. Thornburg will have a lot of constraints on how it uses capital, and now has reputational challenges to overcome.”Thornburg, based in Santa Fe, specializes in “jumbo” mortgages above $417,000, which have typically gone to buyers of more expensive homes who have good credit.The company had long boasted of the credit quality of its $35.2 billion portfolio of adjustable-rate mortgages, but it proved vulnerable to tightening credit markets as investors stopped buying those home loans.Until recently, jumbo mortgages were also too large to be acquired by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The terms of the offering were more costly to shareholders than Thornburg had estimated when it announced plans on March 25 to sell the notes, a Credit Suisse analyst, Moshe Orenbuch, wrote.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','For years Mr. Eckel went along. “But in the current political climate,” he said, “I just can’t take the risk of planting two million tomato plants and watching them rot in the field.”This is the crux of a tense, if largely unspoken, conflict between politics and reality in a state with 40,000 commercial farms. On many of those farms, crops requiring hand-picking are either not being put in this year, or are being planted by farmers who cannot be sure they will have the workers to harvest them, farm experts say.Yet, in more than a half dozen state legislative races, getting tough on illegal immigration has become the premier issue in this state, as it has in many others.In the 10th Congressional District, where Mr. Eckel’s 700-acre farm is located, the incumbent Democrat, Representative Christopher Carney, has made the enforcement of strong penalties for illegal immigrants and their employers a signature issue in a tough re-election campaign; Mr. Carney is one of two dozen incumbent Democrats singled out for defeat by the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee.“Over the last couple of growing seasons, farmers have been feeling a tremendous amount of stress over the way this issue has been playing out,” said Gary Swann, governmental relations director for the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau. “And if people think all we have to do is raise wages and hire local workers, they are simply mistaken.”Local workers will not do the job, Mr. Swann said.It is a claim hard to verify, farm experts say, because harvesting “specialty crops,” as the federal government refers to anything that is picked by hand — in other words, not wheat, corn or other crops harvested by giant machines — has been the domain of migrant workers since the turn of the last century.A temporary federal guest worker program, which briefly made hiring migrant farm workers easier, was not renewed by Congress last year in the rancorous debate over border security.In Pennsylvania, as in many other states, lawmakers have instead busily penned a cascade of bills penalizing those who employ illegal immigrants and making it easier for the police to check their status and turn them over to federal agents for deportation.His labor contractor, Ray Vega, told him recently that he could only raise about 75 of the 120 men who have been harvesting his tomatoes. Some had been coming for decades, living in the simple cinder block dormitories at the edge of the Eckel property during the two-month season.Since last year, however, some have been deported. Others have become too afraid to travel, Mr. Vega told Mr. Eckel.“Guys are scared,” Mr. Vega said by telephone from his home outside Albany, Ga. “They could end up in jail.”Neither the two Democratic presidential candidates nor the presumptive Republican presidential nominee have spotlighted the pressure brought on farmers around the country by the newly energized political consensus against illegal immigration.After newspapers and television stations in the Scranton area publicized Mr. Eckel’s decision to forgo planting tomatoes, he received a phone call from Senator Barack Obama’s agriculture adviser, Marshall Matz, who arranged a meeting for later this month.But firestorms of protest have greeted nearly every proposal to regularize and temporarily legalize the supply of workers, like the immigrants who harvested Mr. Eckel’s crops. He said he did not expect anything to change until there was a broad new consensus about immigrant labor, which might never happen.“I’m going to wait until February to decide whether I’ve planted my last tomato crop,” he said. By then, there will be a new president and a new Congress. But the tractors and seeding equipment in his warehouse will not wait forever. Their resale value is good for another year at most.“This is all about economics,” added Mr. Eckel, who served as president of the state farm bureau for more than a decade until the mid-1990s, and whose office walls are decorated with photos of himself shaking hands with Ronald Reagan and the two presidents Bush. “I’m not trying to make some political statement.”If one were to want to, though, three weeks before a state presidential primary would be good timing.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','Microsoft has won an international standards designation for its open-document format, according to voting results obtained Tuesday, apparently ending a divisive yearlong battle with software rivals before a global standards-setting organization.Microsoft’s Office Open XML, a format for interchangeable Web documents, was approved by 24 of 32 countries in a core group in a ballot by the International Organization for Standardization. Approval by the standards-setting body, a nongovernmental network of 157 countries based in Geneva, is considered almost certain to influence software spending by governments and large companies.The tally reversed a loss by Microsoft in first-round voting before an 87-nation panel in September, a process that involved blunt lobbying by both sides toward members of national standards committees — typically made up of technicians, engineers and bureaucrats.In the final round of voting, which ended Saturday, three-quarters of the core group members — including Britain, Japan, Germany and Switzerland — supported Microsoft’s standard, according to the results document. Of the 87 votes, 10 opposed the standard: Brazil, Canada, China, Cuba, Ecuador, India, Iran, New Zealand, South Africa and Venezuela.Under organization rules, at least 66 percent of core group members must accept a standard for it to be approved, and no more than 25 percent of all voting nations can be opposed.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','A spokesman for the Energy Department responded to the report by pointing to a statement last month in which the department said it would complete an analysis of what to do with the partly processed material “during the coming year.” In that statement, Energy Secretary Samuel W. Bodman said, “We will manage this commodity in a prudent manner that recognizes a variety of factors including our national security interest, departmental missions, realities of the global marketplace and impacts on domestic industry.”The department promised in that statement not to sell too much of the material at once, since doing so would lower uranium prices and hurt producers. Nuclear power utilities, however, would benefit from a price decline.The report noted that the price of uranium hexafluoride, the chemical form in which the material is stored, was $200 a kilogram, about $91 a pound, in February. It was as high as $360 a kilogram in the middle of last year, having risen from $21 a kilogram in November 2000.The current value of the department’s stockpile is about $7.6 billion, the auditors said.But, they said, it could end up being worth as much as $20 billion, or next to nothing. Experts say the current high prices are likely to stimulate the opening of new mines and new processing plants, increasing supplies and tending to drive prices back down. And the report said it would take years to process the current stockpile for sale.On the other hand, a resurgence in nuclear power, if it comes, would tend to push prices higher in the long run, and the stockpile could be sold at a fixed price or tied to market conditions over the years.At Evolution Markets, a brokerage firm in White Plains, Joe Kelly, who heads the nuclear fuel division, said that for the Energy Department, “it’s certainly a fine line to walk.” Start-up companies, Mr. Kelly said, are trying to raise money to begin mining uranium deposits that were previously ignored as unprofitable.“If those pounds in the ground become less valuable,” he said, “the incentive becomes less.”That, in turn, could have an effect on the steadiness of utilities’ supply. Jack Edlow, a uranium consultant in Washington, said utilities would like lower prices but would also seek security of supply, which would result from prices at which mining companies could turn a profit.The department’s stockpile, Mr. Edlow said, could be sold “in a way that supports everybody’s requirements, I believe, but it’s a bit of a balancing act.”The auditors said utilities were interested in buying the material, which could also be sent to the sole American company now processing uranium.That company is USEC, formerly the United States Enrichment Corporation, which was part of the Energy Department before being privatized a decade ago. When USEC was spun off, the department kept the partly processed material because it was considered too much of a burden for the new company.Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Energy and Commerce Committee, and who requested the auditors’ report, said in a statement that the Energy Department “needs a concrete strategy to take advantage of the current market conditions so that taxpayers can benefit from the sale of this asset.”Congress would probably have to change the law to allow the material to be sold without further processing, Mr. Dingell said, but that could be worked out on a bipartisan basis.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','“It’s very hard to argue for higher food prices because you are ceding popular high ground to McDonald’s when you do that,” said Mr. Pollan, a contributor to The New York Times Magazine and author of “In Defense of Food: An Eater’s Manifesto” (Penguin Press). “But higher food prices level the playing field for sustainable food that doesn’t rely on fossil fuels.”The food-should-cost-more cadre wants to change an agricultural system that spends billions of dollars in government subsidies to grow commodities like grain, sugar, corn and animal protein as cheaply as possible.The current system, they argue, is almost completely reliant on petroleum for fertilizers and global transportation. It has led to consolidations of farms, environmentally unsound monoculture and, at the end of the line, a surplus of inexpensive food with questionable nutritional value. Organic products are not subsidized, which is one reason those products are more expensive.As a result, the theory goes, small farmers can’t make a living, obesity and diabetes are worsening, workers are being exploited and soil and waterways are being damaged. In other words, the true cost of a hamburger or a box of macaroni and cheese may be a lot more than the price.“We’re talking about health, we’re talking about the planet, we’re talking about the people who are supporting the land,” said Alice Waters, the restaurateur, who has more than once been accused of promoting a diet that is either unaffordable or unrealistic for a working person.Urging others to eat better (and thus more expensive) food is not elitist, she said. It is simply a matter of quality versus quantity and encouraging healthier, more satisfying choices. “Make a sacrifice on the cellphone or the third pair of Nike shoes,” she said.Anna Lappé, founder of the Small Planet Institute, which studies food and public policy, said that equating cheap food with bad food is an oversimplification, because food pricing is a complex process. Investors skew the volatile commodities market. And less money is spent on the actual food than it is on marketing, packaging, transportation and multimillion dollar compensation for the biggest food companies’ executives.“But it is really hard for people to understand speculations on commodities markets and even how food companies externalize costs when they are going to the store to buy a gallon of milk,” she said. Besides, an intellectual debate on food costs might not be exactly what a cash-strapped grocery shopper needs right now. In fact, arguing for more expensive food seems, at the least, indelicate.“Someone on the margin who says ‘I’m struggling’ would say rising food costs are in no way a positive,” said Ephraim Leibtag of the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service. Even if the food budget isn’t an issue, there are plenty of people who view low-cost food as a national triumph.“If you think that mass production and vast distribution predicated on cheap energy is a good system, then the dollar hamburger is a good thing,"" Mr. Leibtag said.Still, there are likely to be some tangible advantages to current prices. For one thing, the relative bargains are likely to be found in the produce aisle and the farmers’ market stalls. The Consumer Price Index for fresh fruits and vegetables is slightly lower than a year ago. That is good news for many shoppers, including the poor who use food stamps and are experts in stretching a food dollar, said Laura Brainin-Rodriguez, a public health educator who helps the poorest people in the San Francisco Bay Area eat better.“People here will take two buses to get to Chinatown to get cheaper produce,” she said.Policies meant to support local farms and urban agriculture programs will likely be strengthened, too. Shorter supply chains become increasingly attractive as fuel costs rise, said Thomas Forster, a former organic farmer and veteran of four farm bills who is working with the United Nations on food issues.To that end, both state and federal governments have begun to encourage institutional buyers like school districts to consider geography and not just price when seeking bids on food contracts.“It could also lead to a move toward more local slaughterhouses and stronger regional meat systems,” he said.In the category of meat and dairy, rising commodity prices could very likely help the small but growing number of farmers who raise animals the old-fashioned way, on grassy pastures. With little or no need for expensive grain, these farmers can sell their milk and meat for more attractive prices.That is welcome news to Ned MacArthur, founder of an organic, pasture-based dairy in Pennsylvania that sells milk, butter and other food under the Natural by Nature label. Unlike dairy farmers who feed their animals grain, people on the 52 farms in his consortium are looking forward to the coming months, he said.“The grass is starting to grow now so within the next couple weeks the cows are really going to take off,” he said.Although prices for organic groceries are rising at least as fast as their conventional counterparts, organic shoppers may soon find that they have more low-priced options. Tighter grocery budgets could drive the expansion of less-expensive “private label” organic brands, as supermarkets and big box stores try to attract new consumers and keep established organic shoppers from walking away.“Organics are still considered food for the elite, but private labels make organics more the norm in the market place,” said Gary Hirshberg, president of Stonyfield Farm and a board member of four other organic food and beverage companies.Of course, all of this is theoretical. If the American shopper decides cheap food is the most important thing, the intellectual musings of the food elite might be trampled in the stampede to the value menu.Marcia Mogelonsky, a senior research analyst at Mintel who has analyzed food trends for 17 years, said it was too soon to tell.“The main thing is that you need a little evidence before you say everyone is clipping coupons and eating dirt,” she said. “All we know for sure at this point is that people are going to the supermarket and noticing butter is $4 a pound and not $2.”'"
"'08-04-02,'0','""These days my family quarrels a lot,"" says Zhang Liying, 55, a retired hotel waitress who with her husband invested all their savings in the stock market. “My husband asked me to sell; I wanted to hold for a while. Now my husband condemns me as so stupid that we lost our family’s savings.”Si Dansu, 68, and a retired engineer, is even more distraught, but she blames the government.“I devoted my whole life to the country. I went to the countryside after graduation, and worked as an engineer in a Shanghai factory until retirement. I invested almost all my savings and retirement fund in the market 10 years ago. But now I’m totally penniless. All my stocks went down.”Other parts of Asia are as bad, or worse. In India, stock prices have plunged 31 percent in Mumbai; they are off 31 percent in Japan and a whopping 53 percent in Vietnam, another booming economy. Angry investors have burned a securities regulator in effigy in Mumbai, and some are in tears in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.“Some of them have cried,” says Nguyen Quang Tri, 74, a retired cement company manager who was visiting a Ho Chi Minh City brokerage house this week. “I have my own equity, but most of the people here borrowed money from the bank.”The market mayhem began after concerns grew late last year about inflation at home and an American financial crisis. Now, even though China’s economy is growing at its fastest pace in over a decade, stock prices have fallen back to earth, crushing small investors on the way down.Few experts say the stock plunge is a major threat to growth in the real economy here. But there are worries that a prolonged downturn could reverberate through China’s financial markets — especially since a large number of corporations had aggressively shifted money, sometimes secretly, to play the market.By some estimates, 15 to 20 percent of the profits reported last year by publicly listed companies in Shanghai that are not involved in banking or finance (which usually invest in stocks) came from stock trading gains.Companies with primary businesses like selling electricity, or even sports jackets, were moonlighting by trading stocks, hoping to bolster their earnings.“Companies had a lot of excess cash,” said Jing Ulrich, a market analyst at JPMorgan in Hong Kong. “And a lot of that cash did leak into the stock market.”But the big companies were following the small investor. JPMorgan estimates that 150 million people in China were invested in the Chinese stock market as of the end of last year. That may still be a small slice of China’s 1.3 billion people, but it is a huge new constituency, and it has led to the birth of both a new source of potential popular discontent and a new lifestyle: the diehard investor.Chen Donghao is one convert. A 22-year-old recent college graduate, he is now a fixture at a Shanghai brokerage house.In April 2006, when he was still a student majoring in art design, his family gave him about $70,000 to invest in the stock market.It was an ideal time to get in.“When I started the stock market was around 1,700,” he says, noting that today, despite the drop, the Shanghai composite index is still up at about 3,400. “I made a lot of money. So since the beginning of this year I decided to open a restaurant. I’d like to open a chain of famous restaurants in Shanghai.”Shopkeepers, real estate brokers, even maids and watermelon hawkers are said to have become day traders.A new version of the national anthem made its way around the country last year, beginning, “Arise! Ye who haven’t opened an account! Pour your gold and silver into the hot market!”The anthem went on: “The Chinese nation faces its craziest time. The passionate roar of our peoples will be heard!”People responded. Here in Shanghai, brokerage houses with giant electronic screens started to draw huge crowds, including many retirees who were content to spend the entire day transfixed by the sight of rising prices.In some brokerage houses, entire floors are divided into small and midsize rooms that investors camp out in, from opening to closing bell, with their lunch bags, knitting gear, playing cards and newspapers to help them feel at home.Only now, many investors cannot bear to look at their screens.“I’m getting out of the game,” said Yuan Yuan, 23, a researcher at a fund company in Shenzhen who also invests on his own. “The game is over. Big institutions pulled out first, only leaving the small investors.”In China, the government fears that angry investors can be a social problem. And so while the state-run media report on the ups and downs of the market, and even warn investors of the risks and pitfalls of investing, the press does not usually report on investors’ anger.“Actually there are a lot of complaints, but the Chinese media can’t report this,” says Mr. Guan, the former real estate company owner.Now, in the brokerage house corridors — corridors of pain — one can hear complaints about all the market flaws: the government doesn’t regulate the stock market and it participates in it by allowing mostly big state-owned companies to go public.There are also complaints about insider trading, stock manipulation, and big investors with government connections, pumping and dumping stocks on small investors.But in China, experts say, the small investor also tends to be a speculator, a gambler, and that may be why the market is so volatile, and so unforgiving.“You know Warren Buffett?” says Chen Weihua, a 69-year-old retired engineer who once worked in Egypt. “He’s a master. He has a theory to hold stocks for a long time. But this theory doesn’t work in China. Look at Ping An.”Ping An is a state-owned insurance company that went public last year, with shares that soared to $144 a share in Shanghai, then sank. Today, it is trading at about $50 a share, despite strong profit growth.This was not the way it was supposed to end. Many investors had been betting that Beijing would not allow the stock market to crash before the Olympic Games come to Beijing in August.After the Games, the powerful rumor went, everyone would sell, leading to a steep market plunge.And if anything serious happened before the Olympics, the government would certainly do something to prop up the market.They are still waiting.“It’s a deformed market, an unhealthy market,” Mr. Guan says. “We’ve always had long bear markets and short bull markets.”“Look,” he said, “it took two years to go from 1,000 to 6,000 but two months to go from 6,000 to 3,500.”'"
"'08-04-02,'0','MEGAMERGERS and high-flying buyouts are nowhere to be found these days. But even in these risk-averse times, the commercial real estate industry is pressing on with enormous development projects around the world, many financed partly by big financial institutions and rich foreign investors.In some cases, these developers are taking on substantial debt loads amid the credit crisis, striving to build new financial hubs even as Wall Street struggles.Rising from South Korea’s western coast, near Seoul, New Songdo City has become one of Asia’s most ambitious planned development projects. By the time it is completed in 2015, the 1,500-acre site will encompass one of the largest business districts in Asia, with wireless technology woven into the fabric of the city.A joint venture of the American company Gale International and Posco Engineering and Construction in South Korea, Songdo also promises to be among the most expensive exercises in private master planning in history, costing an estimated $30 billion, with the Korean government spending $10 billion in additional infrastructure improvements.The project’s backers have pulled in outside investment, including $350 million from Morgan Stanley Real Estate and $2.7 billion from the Shinhan Bank in South Korea.By the time it opens late next year, MGM Mirage’s $8 billion city-within-a-city is expected to be among the biggest privately financed development projects in the United States. Among the 76-acre site’s attractions will be a hotel-casino, five nongaming boutique hotels and residences and a retail district that the developers say will rival SoHo in New York.'"
"'08-04-02,'0','“We’re looking for new markets and new areas to add to our bottom line,” said Yvonne Ike, senior country officer for sub-Saharan Africa at JPMorgan Chase. “There are deals to be done where valuations can be quite rich and yields are much higher” than in Europe or elsewhere, she said.Companies and governments are eager to find money for projects that range from bridge building to telecommunications tower installations. Investors looking for higher returns are racing to provide this cash, and deal-makers are reaping the rewards. “Too many people think of emerging markets in a general basket,” but they have very definite stages of development, said Norman Villamin, head of research and strategy group investments for Citi Global Wealth Management, Asia Pacific. Citi is advising investors to concentrate on markets that are “one step below the recent maturation seen in markets like China and Korea,” he said.These markets face a “two steps forward, one step back” approach to financial liberalization, Mr. Villamin said. “The banking systems don’t function that efficiently yet,” he said, so foreign money flowing in tends to be quick, sometimes inflating prices and causing an overdone regulatory reaction.Investors in emerging-emerging markets are willing to take that risk. “If you do an overall move away from risk, you do an overall move away from profits as well,” Ms. Ike said.Tutu Agyare is so certain that the time is right to invest in Africa that he left the bank he worked at for 20 years to do so. Mr. Agyare, who until November was the global head of European emerging markets at UBS in London, left to start Nubuke Investments, a two-fund shop that will invest only in Africa. The London firm will have several hundred million dollars under management and a dozen analysts when it opens in the next few weeks, he said.Mr. Agyare, 45, was born in London, grew up in Ghana, and has spent nearly all his career in London, where he started trading derivatives for the Chicago firm O’Connor Securities in 1986. He was the first black trader on the floor of the London Stock Exchange.“Africa is not just commodity led,” he said. “We’re seeing a lot more balanced growth, consumer spending and investment in infrastructure.”Africa amassed $60.1 billion in announced mergers and acquisitions in 2007, according to Thomson Financial, up nearly 47 percent from the year before. Foreign direct investment in African countries reached $35.6 billion in 2007, according to the United Nations Council on Trade and Development, twice the amount in 2004.Even the most stable African markets, however, have been rocked by turmoil. The Nairobi Stock Exchange in Kenya was one of the best-performing markets in 2006, but shares plummeted because of ethnic violence that led to at least 1,000 deaths after the presidential election last December. “There are significant risks,” Mr. Agyare said, that require a “deep knowledge and understanding of the history and people involved.”Big projects loom on the horizon. South Africa needs to add 17,000 megawatts of electricity and Algeria needs to spend $50 billion in the next five years to create new housing, Mr. Agyare said.Mr. Agyare said he expected his financial analysts to spend half their time in Africa. He plans to spend a third of his time there. To do well in Africa, “You need to have an affinity for the country, and affinity for emerging markets and curiosity,” which prompt you to look below the surface, he said. “You can’t just take the annual report and use it as a given.”When Gita Wirjawan, senior country officer for JPMorgan Chase in Indonesia, flew to the cold plains of Wisconsin from Jakarta for school when he was 17 years old, his intention was to become a famous jazz pianist. When he transferred to the University of Texas at Austin and warmer climes, he was already an accomplished musician.But, he said, his parents thought better of all that. “I was a music nut,” he said. “But they didn’t like me majoring in music, so I walked down to the registrar’s office and asked what the most popular major was. They said accounting.” Two decades later, at age 42, Mr. Wirjawan is one of the most highly respected deal-makers in Jakarta. He is on the verge of successfully negotiating the merger of Bank Niaga and Bank Lippo, an essential first step in Indonesia’s plan to consolidate its consumer banking industry.Last December, he transacted a 16 percent sale of Indonesia’s third-largest mobile phone company, Excelcomindo, to Emirates Telecommunications for nearly $438 million, a major investment in Indonesia from the Middle East.“I am happy here because the complexities are very interesting and that keeps me stimulated,” Mr. Wirjawan said. “I mean, for example, many people ask me about what the tariff structure will look like in the next five years. In other countries you can have a ballpark view of what it will be. Try answering that question here. I often just say, I don’t know.”Mr. Wirjawan worked at Citibank and a securities firm before going back to school at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, where he became friends with Felipe Calderón, now the president of Mexico.It was at Harvard that he began to see what he calls his endgame materialize. “I see myself in public service,” he said, adding that he didn’t intend to run for office but to help good governance.“I take a very long view of Indonesia; it’s the only way I can justify staying here. Despite the mediocrity within the leadership here in the past, our economy is still growing 6 or more percent. So you are looking at a huge economy 20 years down the line. That should make Indonesia pretty relevant.” PETER GELLINGLast spring, Adel Kambar, a British banker, left a job at Merrill Lynch in London to work with a Russian investment bank’s office in Almaty here. At the best of times, this would hardly be an obvious career move. As it happens, Mr. Kambar’s jump from London to Central Asia also coincided with an unraveling in the international lending that had sustained Kazakhstan’s banking sector. So by the time he stepped off the plane to become a banker in Kazakhstan, the financial sector there was drying up as surely as the cracked-mud surface of the shrinking Aral Sea.Still, Mr. Kambar said he had no regrets. He called the move emblematic of a shift under way in the financial world. Financial services, he said, are moving from London and New York to emerging markets. Bankers are moving, too.“I’m a long-term believer in emerging markets,” Mr. Kambar said. “This is a generational thing.”Meanwhile, Kazakhstan’s cushion of oil wealth caught the banking sector’s collapse last fall. Now, paradoxically, Mr. Kambar’s job might look more secure than those of his colleagues in New York, though steely nerves are still part of the job description.Like many emerging-market bankers, his own background is global. His father is from Kuwait and his mother from Russia. He left Merrill Lynch for Renaissance Capital, which is based in Moscow. He is its chief executive for Central Asia, working in Almaty.The country holds two-thirds of the crude reserves in the Caspian Sea region and is a magnet for Western oil giants like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, as well as competitors that include Gazprom, the Russian state gas company, and the China National Petroleum Corporation.Mr. Kambar said that living here was essential for building client relations. Kazakhstan’s society is built around allegiance to clans or tribes where personal and family ties play a huge role.“There’s always something unusual about it,” Mr. Kambar said of his new beat. “It’s more than the generic G-7 banking.” ANDREW E. KRAMERBassam Yammine, a managing director and co-chief executive of the Middle East at Credit Suisse, recently took a colleague from the bank’s London office to see a client in Saudi Arabia. He noticed his guest’s discomfort when, 40 minutes into the meeting, Mr. Yammine, a 40-year-old Lebanese banker, and the client were still chatting about politics and the weather. His colleague shot him a panicked look when everyone got up to leave, still not having mentioned business deals. Halfway out the door, Mr. Yammine turned around, quickly discussed the deal and he and his colleague left the meeting with a check.“In this part of the world, that’s how you do business,” said Mr. Yammine, who spends his time in Riyadh or Dubai and traveling the region. “Relationships are an important factor in clients’ decisions.” Mr. Yammine is proud of his relationships, including one with Saudi Telecom and some family offices, which he started to build in the mid-1990s, when he helped set up Lebanon Invest, Lebanon’s first investment bank.Much has changed since then, he said, recalling how he had managed the first private placement in the region for the Lebanese bank Byblos and helped raise debt and equity to finance the refurbishment of the old InterContinental Hotel in Beirut. Of course, rising oil prices created wealth and helped the economy boom, but the 9/11 attacks were also a major turning point for the region’s development, said Mr. Yammine, who has an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago.“Before 2001, the Arab world was fragmented, and investments either stayed within one country or moved to the United States or the U.K.,” he said. “Sept. 11 made the Arab world think more about investing in their own region.”Mr. Yammine, who likes to return to Lebanon for skiing and hiking trips with his wife and two daughters, perceives opportunities in linking Credit Suisse’s investment bank, private bank and asset management closer together and in advising sovereign wealth funds on how to make their dealings more transparent. This way, they can try to avoid a backlash from the United States two or three years from now, when their money may not be needed that desperately anymore. JULIA WERDIGIERMost days, Patrice Etlin runs the São Paulo office of Advent International, a private equity firm. But he relaxes by heliskiing, jumping onto untouched pistes. On two occasions, he watched his guide and his brother get swallowed up by avalanches. Both times he emerged unscathed and got help. “I escaped,” he said, before adding with a laugh, “I am in a risky business.”There could be a message to investors in those close calls. Mr. Etlin might take a chance. But he is a survivor.He opened Advent’s Brazil office in 1996, arriving in a boom that was inevitably followed by bust, with the Russian crisis, the Asian crisis, a Brazilian devaluation, economic collapse in Argentina, the bursting of the Internet bubble and Sept. 11 taking their toll.Mr. Etlin, who is half-Brazilian, half-French and a former electronics engineer, made it through what he called “the nuclear winter” and is now reaping the benefits. His first two funds, in 1996 and 2001, raised $235 million and $265 million, respectively. Last year, his third brought in $1.35 billion.Latin America’s private equity firms are enjoying plenty of interest from emerging-market investors. Firms raised a record $4.4 billion in 2007, according to the Latin American Venture Capital Association. Initial public offerings on the Brazilian stock exchange took in a record $32 billion last year.The newfound clout of Brazilian companies, particularly metals, mining and agricultural firms, means they are now buying overseas competitors. Domestically, where Advent is most active, business is also booming. Advent specializes in taking over family-run firms, so that Mr. Etlin’s efforts are spent forging relationships and building trust.That methodical approach seems to suit a man who says he considered becoming a professional chess player. But it doesn’t mean he is ready to forsake the adrenaline rushes of deal-making. “There will be volatility,” he said. “But I know how to navigate the risk. In the long term, the appetite for Brazil will remain.” ANDREW DOWNIE'"
"'08-04-02,'0','FOR restructuring experts, recess is over.Many had found themselves sidelined during the recent buyout boom: cheap and plentiful debt led to some of the lowest default rates in recent memory. But that easy financing has evaporated, roiling the credit markets and shaking up companies as big as Bear Stearns.The percentage of issuers of speculative-grade debt rose to 21.7 percent in February, the highest level since November 2002, according to Moody’s Investors Service. And default rates are expected to rise as well.“It’s meant lots of work and little sleep,” said Barry W. Ridings, a co-head of the restructuring advisory group at Lazard. “Tell my wife I’ll see her at Christmas.”Here are edited excerpts from conversations with four restructuring experts.“We’ve gotten more inquiries across a broader spectrum of companies. My guess is that we’ll see a rise in the second half of this year. And with a lot of companies that have been taken private by leveraged buyouts, we don’t know whether they’re twisting and turning. The majority of them don’t have publicly available information.”“What we may see are more sales of troubled companies, either in bankruptcy or outside of bankruptcy, with the enterprise value hopefully preserved by a quick sale. When you have unruly, conflicting ambitions and agendas, it’s about the only way to avoid keeping a company stuck in bankruptcy for a while.”“In all of these financial deals, we’re not seeing distressed investors, just the original holders. I think that is because the results of these deals are either investors’ getting 100 cents on the dollar or zero. It’s a very black and white situation.”'"
"'08-04-02,'0','That is, if you spend your days selling orthodontic supplies and your nights engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The event’s promoters had taken to calling Patterson the Suit, a nickname that made for a handy gimmick on the undercard, a blue- and white-collar showdown, the Janitor versus the Suit.But in truth Patterson is not such an oddity. Generations of boxers labored as night watchmen or warehouse hands or bookmakers’ enforcers. Mixed martial arts leagues have found some competitors in more rarefied quarters.“M.M.A. guys are usually collegiate wrestlers, so they have better day jobs,” said Mike Smith, a boxing trainer to Patterson and other mixed martial arts fighters at Gleason’s Gym in Brooklyn.And all but the name-brand fighters of the most popular league in the United States, Ultimate Fighting Championship, will most likely depend on those day jobs for some time. International Fight League, one of several upstarts, posted a $9.6 million loss in its most recent annual report.For Patterson, who tries to fight four or five times a year, the title shot promised an $8,000 appearance fee and another $8,000 if he wins. He has no illusions about quitting his day job.In a way, the corporate life made him fight. Transferred to the Midwest, friendless and spending evenings watching TV at a bar, Patterson said he took up jiu-jitsu to reclaim his athleticism.“I realized there was a lot more to life than just busting my butt at work,” he said during an interview over baked chicken at a Lebanese restaurant here.As Patterson intensified his training under the Brazilian champion Renzo Gracie, he was recruited into an International Fight League team called the New York Pitbulls, since rechristened Renzo Gracie Jiu-Jitsu New York City. Since December 2006, Patterson has won four of his five fights, beating opponents with moves described as choke, submission and guillotine.As a recent morning workout began at the gym, Rooney led the fighters through a series of knee bends, jumping jacks and crabwalks. They lifted weights. After an hour or so, Patterson changed back into his dress clothes.Patterson drove home, put on a pinstriped pea coat and set out on his route, selling orthodontic treatments for a company that tolerates his moonlighting but does not want any association with pro fighting publicized.After a few stops in New Jersey, Patterson visited a dental spa on Staten Island. New Age music played on a sound system in the waiting room. Soon the spa’s director, Albert Finkelshteyn, came out and greeted him. “Hey, it’s the Pitbull!” Finkelshteyn said.Patterson followed him into an office decorated with diplomas and brochures. They talked through a computer problem, the planning of a promotional event and the ordering of more before-and-after teeth photographs.Patterson soon made his way to Gleason’s Gym, where he has been developing boxing skills to complement his wrestling and jiu-jitsu prowess. He changed clothes again, this time into boxing shorts.In the sparring ring, a challenge was in store. The former World Boxing Council cruiserweight champion Wayne Braithwaite was taking on all comers. When the fight started Patterson held his gloves low and spread his legs in a wrestler’s stance. Braithwaite backed around the ring, letting Patterson swing and sometimes miss.When the bell sounded, the trainers in Patterson’s corner prescribed a more conservative approach. In the subsequent rounds, Patterson and Braithwaite locked up several times. From Patterson’s perspective, this was good practice. In the mixed martial arts ring, he could always end a lockup simply by picking up his opponent and throwing him.

"'08-04-02,'0','The median price for studios rose by 22 percent, to $490,000 from $401,000; and the median price for one-bedroom apartments grew by 12 percent, to $750,000 from $669,000, according to the Corcoran Group, a real estate brokerage firm.The firms disagree, however, on the extent of the slowdown in sales in the first quarter. According to Prudential Douglas Elliman, the number of sales fell by 34 percent in the first quarter, to 2,282 apartments from 3,474 last year. Data analyzed by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property showed a 1 percent drop in sales. Corcoran also said it saw a slight drop.No one disputes the fact, however, that inventory is rising, and after a wave of bad news in the financial world, a crucial underpinning of New York’s economy, fewer buyers are signing contracts. “We’re starting to see a hesitancy in the marketplace,” said Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead. “What I look at very carefully is the signed contracts, the deals that are coming to us right now. I’m starting to see a slowdown.”So far, wealthy Wall Street executives and foreign buyers have stayed in the market, paying record prices in a range of buildings. The high average price of Manhattan apartments reflects the popularity of luxury condos. The average price of a co-op rose to $1.3 million in the first quarter of this year from $996,000 last year, and the average price of a condo rose to $1.9 million from $1.3 million during the same period, according to Halstead. Corcoran and Prudential Douglas Elliman reported similar figures.The value of a co-op with four or more bedrooms rose an average of 86 percent this past quarter, to $12.9 million from $6.9 million the year before, according to Halstead.The rising prices are not just concentrated among Thurston Howell III types who want to live near Central Park. Apartments in less expensive areas like Inwood, Harlem and Hudson Heights also saw price increases, according to Halstead’s data. The average price of a studio rose by 2 percent, one- and two- bedroom apartments by 9 percent and three-bedroom apartments by 57 percent, according to Halstead.Gregory J. Heym, an economist who prepared the reports for Halstead and Brown Harris Stevens, said that in Harlem, prices rose in new condo projects like the one at 111 Central Park North. In Inwood and Hudson Heights, the prices of co-ops increased.“In Inwood and Hudson Heights, that just shows you it’s a decent resale market,” he said.Contrary to the trend in Manhattan, in Brooklyn, overall prices have started to drop. Median and average sale prices dropped by 2 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to data tracked by the Corcoran Group. Median prices in Brooklyn dipped to $549,000 from $560,000, according to the data. Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, said this pattern was typical of any slowdown. “When buyers become more cautious, the first markets to feel it are those that have been considered to be emerging neighborhoods,” Ms. Liebman said.All five boroughs are also facing an escalating number of foreclosures. The number jumped by 65.7 percent, to 918 foreclosures in the first quarter of this year, compared with 554 during the same time last year, according to PropertyShark.com, a real estate data company based in Brooklyn.The numbers make up a small percentage of New York City’s three million households, according to PropertyShark.com. The foreclosures are concentrated in Queens neighborhoods like Jamaica and Howard Beach, and Staten Island’s Mid-Island and North Island.Brokers are not as optimistic, however, about the next few quarters in Manhattan. Sales in the first quarter were strong in part because nearly a third of the apartments that closed were for condos that buyers signed contracts for at least a year ago, according to data tracked by Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead.Now buyers have more choices, with an inventory of 6,194 apartments compared with 5,923 at this time last year, according to Prudential Douglas Elliman. The brokerage firms reported that the number of buyers who went to contract in the first quarter was far lower compared with buyers last year.Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said that in the first quarter, the number of contracts signed in Manhattan fell by 21 percent even though the average price rose by 3 percent.Ms. Liebman said she had fielded calls from several Bear Stearns executives wanting to sell their apartments in the wake of the buyout of their firm. She said that a couple of Bear Stearns executives put their homes on the market.“Wall Street’s pain is definitely real,” she said. “We will see less transactions, but stable prices.”But while the brokerage firms say prices may eventually decline, they do not expect Manhattan’s real estate market to suffer as much as the rest of the nation’s.“I don’t think you’re going to see the next quarter being the end of the world,” said Dottie Herman, the president of Prudential Douglas Elliman. “You’re going to see a market that’s a lot more conservative, and things are going to be on the market longer.”'"

"'08-04-03,'1','So what's the lesson here? Simple enough: those vocal pre-release blogger-bashers are terrible predictors of a product's success or failure.All of this brings us to the MacBook Air. When it came to public pre-opinion, I knew I had another iPhone on my hands. Here it was, another Apple product with a stunning and sexy design, gorgeous software — and several missing standard features. (In the Air's case, those features included a removable battery, an Ethernet jack, a FireWire jack and a built-in DVD drive.)So confident was I that the spec-peepers would dump on this machine, I actually tried to pre-empt them in my review. I tried to explain that looks, size, shape, fit and finish actually matter, actually affect the pleasure you get from a machine. ""But for anyone who shares Apple's admiration for elegance,"" I wrote, ""the tradeoff is worth it. This laptop's cool aluminum skin and smooth edges make it ridiculously satisfying to hold, carry, open and close. You can't take your eyes or your hands off it.""Needless to say, my tactic didn't work. The feature counters blew right past my attempts to describe the differentness of this machine and dumped on it. ""This will be the biggest flop since the Cube! No removable battery? Nobody will touch this thing!"" Etc.I have no idea what the Air's sales are like, so I can't yet say that the blogger-bashers were wrong again. I do know, however, that the Air has precisely the same effect on people (who actually *see it*) as the iPhone did: they're awestruck. They want to hold it, to touch it. ""It's a chick magnet,"" said one guy on a plane. Well, yeah, except that actually, both genders usually want a gander.What is it about this thing? Newsweek tech columnist Steven Levy wrote about how his Air disappeared when (he believes) it was hidden in some newspapers that his wife threw down the compactor chute. TV host Charlie Rose showed up on the air with a massive black eye, having tripped on a pothole while carrying his Air and, as he fell, opting to save it instead of his face.I had a weird experience, too. After having used Apple's loaner review unit for a couple of weeks, I reached over to pick up my existing Mac laptop, the five-pound MacBook. After the Air, it felt like a piece of Soviet Army field equipment. When I tried to pick it up one-handed, I thought I'd break my wrist.So that's it: I bought an Air for myself.When I was getting it loaded with my programs and files, I deeply mourned the lack of high-speed file-transfer options like FireWire. A couple of times, I was seriously grateful for the optional Ethernet USB dongle — in hotels with wired Internet but no wireless, for example. And I'll repeat my advice from the original review: this machine doesn't make a great primary computer, thanks to its smallish hard drive.Otherwise, though, I've lived and flown with this machine for a month, presented nine talks on it, and have not missed its missing features one iota. It's plenty fast and capacious as a second machine.Meanwhile, when your laptop has the thickness and feel of a legal pad and starts up with the speed of a PalmPilot, it ceases to be a traditional laptop. It becomes something you whip open and shut for quick lookups, something you check while you're standing in line or at the airline counter, something you can use in places where hauling open a regular laptop (and waiting for it) would just be too much hassle.It's the same lesson I learned when I reviewed the Flip ""camcorder"" a couple weeks ago: if you change the shape and concept of something enough, it ceases to be that thing. It becomes a new thing, or a descendant of that earlier thing. But it's no longer the original thing, and you can't judge it on the same yardstick.P.S. —If you're up at 9 a.m. EST this Sunday, April 6, tune into ""CBS News Sunday Morning."" I'll be reporting on the new technology behind the FAA's $20 billion, 17-year overhaul of this nation's 50-year-old air-traffic system.

But like other airlines, it has struggled amid an economic slowdown and has been unable to offset soaring fuel prices.Fuel is one of the industry’s top costs and has pushed some carriers into merger talks.Major airlines, to offset record fuel prices, have slashed amenities that were once free and added fees for second bags, traveling with pets and booking tickets by phone.United Airlines said new luggage fees it had imposed on travelers will generate more than $100 million a year.ATA came out of bankruptcy with several other carriers two years ago, and it became the second to declare bankruptcy in the last two weeks, both with operations in Hawaii.

"'08-04-03,'1','“One of the things we never thought we would be experiencing again is a desperate need for more miners,” said Kathryn Tacke, a regional economist with the Idaho Department of Labor. “But anyone who wants to find a job mining in the Silver Valley probably can.”For years, some kinds of mining have survived near increasingly affluent Western towns like Steamboat Springs, Colo. A few other old camps, including Leadville, Colo., are also now moving toward reviving mining operations. But for others, like Crested Butte and Breckenridge, also in Colorado, the natural surroundings remain what they became long ago: amenities for newcomers, not resources for industry.“Now prices have recovered to where it’s finally economical” to mine again, said Laura Skaer, executive director of the Northwest Mining Association, but in many cases “the community has changed.”The Silver Valley has not changed nearly as much as pricey resorts like Crested Butte, however. The town of Wallace remains a tiny triangle of 890 people and dozens of historic red-brick buildings, all wedged between steep evergreen slopes and Interstate 90. About 10 miles west, the historic uptown section of Kellogg has plenty of vacant storefronts, and chain-link fences surround the two stalled condominium projects.Local officials say the revival of mining, however counterintuitive the idea may seem to the second-home aesthetic, is critical if the area is to remain affordable to a population whose families have lived here for generations. (Already there are concerns about the long-term rise in housing prices.)The average pay for mining jobs in Shoshone County in 2006 was about $57,000, more than double the average of all other jobs, Ms. Tacke said. And while the current total of 700 mining jobs is a small fraction of the 4,000 that the county had in the early 1980s, still it is 200 more than at this time last year.Many people here say they just want another chance to do what they do best. “I don’t really care about growth,” said Mayor Ronald Garitone, 68. “The price of silver is what determines our economic development.”Dick Vester, an optometrist here for three decades, said his office had been bustling with newly flush miners finally able to update their prescriptions. Some splurge on sunglasses.“Real estate is good, tourism is good,” Mr. Vester said. “But there’s nothing like good old industry. That’s what puts money on the table.”For now, at least, the new mining boom does not appear to be creating a culture conflict between miners and those nurturing a new Silver Valley.Mark W. Stromberg, an official of the federal Superfund project to clean up old mining contamination in the valley, said he was unaware of any organized opposition to the mining expansion. A huge toxic smelter has been largely leveled and removed as part of the cleanup, and the new mining involves expansion underground only and must meet a variety of environmental requirements.Neal Scholey, sales director at the new Silver Mountain Resort, in Kellogg, said the revival in mining had been largely invisible. “Where are they?” Mr. Scholey said. “The environmental impact is basically nothing.”The resort, with 277 condominiums built and hundreds more houses and a golf course planned, is an island of precise roof lines and fresh paint a few hundred yards from some of the last, dilapidated remains of old mining operations. The slogan behind the front desk of the sales center says: “Yesterday, Silver. Tomorrow, Gold” — the latter a reference to sunsets, not the metal.With mining making a comeback, sales representatives strive to balance messages, assuring newcomers that the vacant storefronts in Kellogg will soon turn over with new shops, that the area has a bright future as a resort and that the mining here is now clean and safe.Jacques Lemieux, a real estate agent with Century 21, works in a small office across the street from the resort and next door to new town houses whose prices, he said, have been lowered to $395,000 from $585,000.“We maybe got a little ahead of ourselves,” Mr. Lemieux said of the resort boom. “But it’s going to happen.”Then he nodded east toward Wallace and smiled.“Wallace is the damnedest town,” he said. “Wallace never gave up the mining dream.”'"
"'08-04-03,'1','Andrés W. López, a statehood supporter and a member of Mr. Obama’s campaign committee in Puerto Rico, said he was concerned that the governor’s support for Mr. Obama had created a pro-commonwealth impression that could create a backlash among Democratic voters.“A strong public endorsement from a well-known statehood figure would remedy what I feel is a misperception,” Mr. López said.The campaign received that backing on Monday from Pedro Pierluisi, the pro-statehood New Progressive Party candidate for nonvoting representative in Congress.Mr. Acevedo delivered his endorsement after receiving a letter in which Mr. Obama expressed openness to a constitutional convention or a plebiscite to determine status and support for all “valid options to resolve the question of Puerto Rico’s status, including commonwealth, statehood and independence.”Some statehood proponents have objected to a constitutional convention and to the listing of commonwealth as a viable permanent status.Mr. Obama met Mr. Pierluisi a few weeks ago and wrote him a letter suggesting openness to the idea of statehood.“I understand and respect the aspiration of the U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico who, like you, believe that statehood is the best status option for Puerto Rico, as I understand and respect the aspirations of those who favor other status options for Puerto Rico,” the letter said.It did not use the word “commonwealth.”Though most of the nearly four million Puerto Ricans are United States citizens, the territory does not have any electoral votes. The 63 delegates at play are on par with those available in the preceding contests in Oregon and Kentucky.Mrs. Clinton is the favorite in the race, given her longstanding relationship with the island as first lady and, more recently, as a senator from New York, the state with the largest Puerto Rican population. Her campaign focuses on specific policies for Puerto Rico like helping manufacturing and support for equal reimbursements to hospitals from Medicare and expanding Medicaid.Mr. Obama’s campaign focuses on broader themes of hope and change.Many of Mrs. Clinton’s high-profile endorsements arrived before the Feb. 5 nominating contests, and Mr. Acevedo’s announcement appears to have spurred others to support Mr. Obama.Mr. Obama, of Illinois, has the support of all Democrats running at the top of tickets in November for both major political parties in Puerto Rico.“There might be something to the fact that it is based on timing and current events rather than substance,” said Kenneth McClintock, the pro-statehood president of the Puerto Rican Senate who announced his support for Mrs. Clinton in December. “Would I have to choose now, I would choose exactly the same way for exactly the same substantive reasons.”Although Mr. Acevedo’s action appears to have opened the gates for others to back Mr. Obama, his indictment also was an embarrassment to the Obama campaign. The governor, a superdelegate, had been courted by both campaigns, even though it was common knowledge that he was under investigation.The two campaigns have courted pro-statehood and pro-commonwealth supporters, and Mr. Obama’s supporters are trying hard to integrate backers from both parties at an organizational level.Marie Helene Morrow, who helped organize Mr. Obama’s fund-raiser on the island and who said she had not become involved with local politics, recounted the meeting on March 27.“Our committee showed up, all colors, all stripes and discussed one thing,” Ms. Morrow said. “Obama, as it should be.”'"
"'08-04-03,'1','“I cannot think of one positive thing that developed as a result of these two companies,” said Richard X. Bove, a financial services analyst at Punk Ziegel. “The miracle of Citigroup is that it still is in the position it is in, given the massive mismanagement.”Vikram S. Pandit, the new chief executive of Citigroup, is struggling to steer the titanic company through the most turbulent period in its decadelong history. Just over 100 days into the job, he must reckon with the legacy of Mr. Weill, who retired as Citigroup’s chairman in 2006, and his own immediate predecessor as chief executive, Charles O. Prince III.Mr. Pandit, like Mr. Prince before him, is shying away from Mr. Weill’s strategy of providing one-stop shopping for financial services. Instead, he is focusing on businesses and markets that generate higher investment returns.To help, Mr. Pandit has brought in several outsiders, as well as old confidants from his time at Morgan Stanley, to strengthen Citigroup’s management. His decision to go outside is a crushing blow to Citigroup executives, who have long prided themselves on grooming the best and brightest in the industry. Recent hires include new heads of investment banking, alternative investments and consumer banking, as well as a new risk chief.This week, Mr. Pandit announced the bank’s 10th major management shake-up since 2002 and its latest reorganization, moves that underscore Citigroup’s failure to integrate and invest in its operations over the last decade. Executives caution that the road ahead will be rough. For example, it may take at least five years before the company’s technology systems catch up to those of its main rivals.Don Callahan, the chief administrative officer of Citigroup, said the company’s original model has evolved over time. “Vikram Pandit is now taking the bold steps essential to ensure proper execution across all businesses and geographies, for the benefit of our clients, employees and shareholders,” he said in a statement.Mr. Pandit must move quickly. Citigroup is being battered by the troubles in the credit markets. So far, the company has taken more than $20 billion in write-offs, and in recent months has raised billions of dollars from foreign investors. Wall Street analysts expect Citigroup to disclose billions of dollars of new losses when it reports earnings this month.Whatever happens at Citigroup, the aftershocks of the 1998 Citicorp-Travelers merger are still reverberating through the financial system. The deal paved the way for the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, the law that separated investment banks, which underwrite securities, and commercial banks, which accept deposits and make loans.The end of Glass-Steagall ushered in an era of consolidation and integration within the financial services industry, with mixed results. Mergers between Wall Street and Main Street banks helped American institutions compete with foreign rivals. But the deals also fostered some of the financial innovations that many say contributed to the subprime mortgage crisis. The Bush administration’s plan to remodel the system regulating the financial industry has rekindled the debate over the government’s role in the markets.In a brief interview last month after JPMorgan’s bid to buy Bear Stearns, the troubled investment bank, Mr. Weill said Citigroup, as a diversified company, could weather the storm better than old-fashioned Wall Street banks. Citigroup’s ability to raise capital “says a heck of a lot about the diversified model,” he said.But even Mr. Weill seemed to back away from his once-vaunted notion of the financial supermarket.Citigroup has “got to determine what are the core assets and what are the assets that are going to get the returns they want,” Mr. Weill said. “They have got to get their costs in line, and they have got to get their management together.”Whatever the case, Mr. Weill’s appetite for profits, rather than an orthodox belief in the diversified banking model, always drove his deal-making. The “financial supermarket” was part of the Wall Street sales pitch. Over the years, Mr. Weill built his empire by making big acquisitions and then wringing out costs. He pressed his business heads to maximize profits every quarter to finance his next deal.But Mr. Weill, reluctant to sacrifice those earnings, failed to connect Citi’s sprawling operations. Instead, Citigroup stuck businesses together but ran them independently.“It was like they were painting the house without making sure the plumbing was strong as it needed to be,” said one longtime Citi follower who was not authorized to speak by his company. “After a while, that catches up.”Under Mr. Weill, each part of Citigroup was run like a separate fief, leaving the company without a single, cohesive culture. Even now, some Citigroup bankers recount the glory days of Citicorp, while old hands on its bond trading desk answer their phones “Salomon Brothers!”Mr. Weill also struggled to retain his best managers. He and John S. Reed, the head of Citicorp, clashed from the start. Many of Mr. Weill’s lieutenants eventually left. Among them was James Dimon, Mr. Weill’s operational whiz and one-time heir apparent, who now runs JPMorgan.Mr. Weill finally chose Mr. Prince, his chief lawyer, to run the company and extricate Citigroup from several regulatory messes. In the late 1990s and early part of this decade, Citigroup bankers were at the center of some of the biggest corporate scandals of the time, including the collapse of Enron and WorldCom and the investigations into Wall Street research tainted by conflict of interest.But with little operating experience, Mr. Prince was ill equipped for the top job. He cut jobs and sold several businesses, but he was eventually forced out last fall after Citigroup ran up steep losses on complex mortgage investments.The question now is whether Mr. Pandit can make a leaner Citigroup work. He recently announced plans to give more authority to four regional heads to try to speed decision-making, and to centralize areas like legal affairs, technology and risk management.Guy Moszkowski, a longtime financial services analyst, said the idea behind Citigroup — that one company could do it all — was sound.“I do actually think the premise is one that makes sense,” Mr. Moszkowski said. “The problem Citi has had is in executing it. It has been deeply flawed and much more difficult than they imagined.”'"

"'08-04-03,'1','“One year ago today, the court rejected E.P.A.’s claim that it lacks authority under existing law to regulate greenhouse gases,” James Milkey, the chief of the environmental protection division at the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office, said Wednesday in a conference call with reporters. “It has the duty to regulate, not just the authority.”After the court’s ruling, the E.P.A. administrator, Stephen L. Johnson, said repeatedly that his agency would take the first step toward controlling emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide before the end of 2007.But in December, after President Bush signed a new law toughening vehicle mileage standards, Mr. Johnson abandoned this timetable. In a separate action, the agency refused to grant California and other states the waiver necessary to let them control tailpipe emissions on their own.Last week, Mr. Johnson informed Congress that the environmental agency planned to ask for broad public comment on implications of regulating all emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, not only those from vehicles. Cars and trucks are responsible for about 30 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in the United States.“Rather than rushing to judgment on a single issue, this approach allows us to examine all the potential effects of a decision with the benefit of the public insight,” Mr. Johnson wrote.But, the coalition argues, that could take years. “E.P.A. has squandered almost a decade and now wants to go back, not to Square 1 but rather to Square 0,” Mr. Milkey, who argued the plaintiffs’ case before the Supreme Court, said Wednesday.An agency spokesman, Jonathan Shradar, said in an e-mail message on Wednesday that officials would “review this new petition” while continuing to gather public comment. Mr. Shradar called this “a reasonable path forward.”The coalition’s petition argues that the agency’s initial analysis of the dangers of the gas emissions to human health was submitted to the White House Office of Management and Budget in early December, where it remains.Releasing the analysis “will not halt any E.P.A. plans” to solicit public comment, said David Bookbinder, the lawyer representing the Sierra Club and four other environmental groups, and the appellate court should force the agency to do so.In related actions Wednesday, Senators Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, and Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, introduced a bill that would require the E.P.A. to publish its findings on the public health threat from heat-trapping gases within 60 days and to reconsider its denial of a waiver to allow California to regulate tailpipe emissions.And a bipartisan majority of the House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming, whose chairman is Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, voted to subpoena the agency’s documents related to its regulation of tailpipe emissions of heat-trapping gases.'"
"'08-04-03,'1','But the arrangement would also position Live Nation to participate in a range of new deals with Jay-Z, one of music’s most entrepreneurial stars, whose past ventures have included the Rocawear clothing line, which he sold last year for $204 million, and the chain of 40/40 nightclubs.Jay-Z, 38, whose real name is Shawn Carter, owes one more studio album to Def Jam, where he was president for three years before stepping down in December after he and the label’s corporate parent, Universal Music Group, could not agree on a more lucrative contract.His first undertaking with Live Nation is his current 28-date tour with Mary J. Blige, his biggest live outing in more than three years. After that, Live Nation envisions integrating the marketing of all Jay-Z’s entertainment endeavors, including recordings, tours and endorsements.“I’ve turned into the Rolling Stones of hip-hop,” Jay-Z said in a recent telephone interview.The deal answers a question that had been circling through the rap world for months: Where would Jay-Z take his next corporate role? As part of the arrangement, Live Nation would finance the start-up of a venture that would be an umbrella for his outside projects, which are expected to include his own label, music publishing, and talent consulting and managing. Live Nation is expected to contribute $5 million a year in overhead for five years, with another $25 million available to finance Jay-Z’s acquisitions or investments, according to people in the music industry briefed on the agreement. The venture, to be called Roc Nation, will split profits with Live Nation.The overall package for Jay-Z also includes an upfront payment of $25 million, a general advance of $25 million that includes fees for his current tour, and advance payment of $10 million an album for a minimum of three albums during the deal’s 10-year term, these people said. A series of other payments adding up to about $20 million is included in exchange for certain publishing, licensing and other rights. Jay-Z said Live Nation’s consolidated approach was in sync with the emerging potential “to reach the consumer in so many different ways right now.” He added: “Everyone’s trying to figure it out. I want to be on the front lines in that fight.”The popularity of music downloads has revolutionized how music is consumed, and widespread piracy has contributed to an industry meltdown in which traditional album sales — composed mostly of the two-decades-old CD format — have slumped by more than a third since 2000. (The best seller in 2007, Josh Groban’s “Noël,” sold 3.7 million copies, compared with 9.9 million for the top album in 2000, according to Nielsen SoundScan.)That has further pressured record-label executives to rewrite the economics of their business and step beyond the sale of albums in an attempt to wring revenue out of everything from ring tones to artist fan clubs.Jay-Z said that his future as an artist could involve elevating the role of live performances, long a mixed bag even for popular rap acts.“In a way I want to operate like an indie band,” he said. “Play the music on tour instead of relying on radio. Hopefully we’ll get some hits out of there and radio will pick it up, but we won’t make it with that in mind.”Though sales for Jay-Z’s tour with Ms. Blige have been strong since it began on March 22, with almost all the early dates resulting in sold-out arenas, it is unclear when Live Nation could carry out other aspects of the deal. (Jay-Z said that he hoped to deliver his final album for Def Jam later this year.)Critics of Live Nation, which lost nearly $12 million last year, predict that it would be difficult to turn a profit on the arrangement, given the continuing decline in record sales and the mixed track record of artist-run ventures. Shares in the company have suffered since October when Live Nation negotiated a reported $120 million deal with Madonna.Michael Cohl, Live Nation’s chairman, said he was not worried. Though he declined to discuss terms of the Jay-Z arrangement, he said it did not require an increase in record sales to be profitable. “He could be doing more tours and doing great,” Mr. Cohl said. “There could be endorsements and sponsorships.” He added, “The whole is what’s important.”He cited Jay-Z’s forays into a host of other businesses as a model for Live Nation. “What he’s done has kind of mirrored what we want to do and where we think we’re going.”Some executives at major record labels have privately portrayed Live Nation’s artist deals as overly expensive retirement packages for stars past their prime.Others disagree. “I’d much rather be in the business of marketing a superstar who cost me a lot of money than taking the 1-in-10, demonstrably failing crapshoot” of signing unknown talents, said Jeffrey Light, a Los Angeles entertainment attorney, referring to the traditional record company model.But the dimensions of the competition could change if Live Nation begins vying for the same emerging artists that the labels hope to sign. Live Nation is negotiating with a Georgia rock act, the Zac Brown Band, after apparently wooing it away from an offer by Atlantic Records, according to music executives briefed on the talks.Jay-Z, for his part, suggested that the string of stars to exit the major-label system would also signal to younger acts how to plot their careers. He said that rising artists will be thinking: “ ‘Something must be happening. Madonna did it, she’s not slow. Jay-Z, he’s not slow either.’ ”'"
"'08-04-03,'1','Because opinions issued by the Office of Legal Counsel are “binding on the Defense Department,” Mr. Silliman said, Mr. Yoo’s opinion effectively sidelined military lawyers who strongly opposed harsh interrogation methods.In an e-mail message, Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, rejected the idea that his memorandum helped create a culture for mistreatment.“The ‘culture of abuse’ theory has no reliable evidence to support it,” Mr. Yoo wrote. He noted that several military investigations had found that what he called “the appalling abuses” at Abu Ghraib were not authorized by any military policy.“While each case of abuse is regrettable,” Mr. Yoo wrote, “it is not possible for a large organization charged with protecting the national security, under extraordinary pressure, to perform its mission error-free.”Top Pentagon officials including Donald H. Rumsfeld, the former defense secretary, have said they never condoned mistreatment of prisoners. But the role played by senior military and civilian officials at the Pentagon has never been fully explained, and it is not clear how the legal memorandum, which was addressed to William Haynes, then the top Pentagon lawyer, influenced interrogations.Several Democratic lawmakers asserted on Wednesday that the memorandum led directly to the abuses of detainees at Abu Ghraib, although the document specifies that it applies only to “unlawful combatants,” a label that would not apply to the largely Iraqi population captured during the Iraq war.The memorandum did apply to all unlawful combatants detained outside the United States, at a time when the Pentagon was struggling with the rules for interrogations of detainees at Guantánamo Bay and in other places, like Afghanistan.William C. Banks, a specialist on national security law at Syracuse University, said that the memorandum shed critical light on the Bush administration but that it was “far fetched” to think it might be used to overturn convictions of soldiers for abuse at Abu Ghraib or elsewhere.The document was made public on Tuesday after it was declassified in response to a request by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act.Both the August 2002 and March 2003 memorandums were formally withdrawn by the Justice Department in 2004, after Mr. Yoo’s successors at the Office of Legal Counsel concluded that they went too far.Jonathan Hafetz, a lawyer representing Ali al-Marri, a Qatar citizen arrested in the United States after the Sept. 11 attacks, said he believed that the March 2003 opinion explained why his client was removed from the criminal justice system and placed in a military jail in Charleston, S.C., in June 2003.“I think they moved him to the military system to be able to use the harsh techniques blessed in the Yoo memo,” said Mr. Hafetz, of the Brennan Center for Justice.Mr. Marri said he was subjected to cold, shackled in uncomfortable positions, deprived of sleep and otherwise mistreated.Congressional Democrats used the 2003 memorandum on Wednesday to renew their criticism of the administration for policies that Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said threatened “our country’s status as a beacon of human rights.”Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, said the memorandum showed that the administration “adopted arguments that could be used by other nations to try to justify the torture of American troops.”Both senators called for the release of other Justice Department opinions on interrogation. At least two major ones written in May 2005 by Steven G. Bradbury, the acting head of the Office of Legal Counsel, to justify harsh methods remain secret.David B. Rivkin, a former White House and Justice Department lawyer in the Reagan and first Bush administrations, said that the wording of the 2003 opinion might be “overly broad,” but that legal advisers like Mr. Yoo set out only what might be done legally, not what should be done.“In a post-Sept. 11 environment, the lawyers tried to give decision makers broad legal flexibility,” Mr. Rivkin said. “I don’t want to substitute my judgment for John Yoo’s as I sit in a comfortable office on a spring day in 2008.”'"
"'08-04-03,'1','MIAMI — On a humid night two years ago at Dolphin Stadium, Pedro Martínez slipped inside the clubhouse and landed on his hip, aggravating an old injury that would eventually cause him to miss three weeks. On a humid night two days ago at Dolphin Stadium, Martínez felt a twinge in his left hamstring, sustaining a new injury that will cause him to miss about six weeks.The results of the magnetic resonance imaging test Martínez had Wednesday afternoon in New York revealed what the team called a mild strain. The Mets expect him to resume pitching in four to six weeks, but given Martínez’s history of injuries and their overall conservative approach with him, it is entirely possible that he will not rejoin the team until the end of May. He was placed on the disabled list before Wednesday’s game against the Florida Marlins and replaced on the roster by the right-hander Nelson Figueroa.“We were all counting on Pedro this year to get started with us, but that’s the way it goes,” Manager Willie Randolph said. “You feel bad for him. It’s unfortunate because he’s worked real hard to get back to this point going back to last season.”Randolph had held out the slim hope that Martínez’s discomfort was a cramp, nothing severe. But he could sense Tuesday night, when Martínez grabbed his hamstring after throwing his 57th pitch of the game, that he would be without Martínez for a while. By now, the Mets are almost accustomed to adjusting to life without Martínez. This is his fourth stay on the disabled list in four seasons with the team, although this one was perhaps the least expected.The Mets permitted Martínez to work on his own schedule throughout spring training, and he spent his mornings and afternoons doing grueling workouts with his personal trainer, Chris Correnti. Martínez raved about his health, saying it was the best he felt in a decade. Club officials expected him to form, with Johan Santana, one of the best one-two pitching combinations in the National League.'"
"'08-04-03,'1','Wall Street turned lower Wednesday as investors worried about how a sharp jump in oil prices would affect consumers in an economy that is already showing signs of a recession.The major indexes spent most of the session in a tight trading range, but dropped after oil prices shot higher in response to the Energy Department’s report of an unexpected jump in gasoline demand. That could lead to higher prices at the pump, a troublesome trend given that retail gas prices are expected to rise further as summer nears.Crude oil rose $3.85 to settle at $104.83 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.“The oil uptick took away some of the optimism that we’ve seen recently,” said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist for Stifel Nicolaus. “Higher gasoline price would mean less in the pocket for Americans, and there’s also continued worries about a recession.”The credit crisis and weak economy have sent stocks tumbling over the last six months. But the shares shot up nearly 400 points on Tuesday on growing sentiment that the worst of the credit problems might be behind Wall Street.Some of the pullback late Wednesday was also attributed to profit-taking after that big advance.The Dow Jones industrials fell 48.53 points, or 0.38 percent, to 12,605.83, after changing direction several times.'"
"'08-04-03,'1','The Sony XEL-1 is a big idea in a small, expensive package. The first television available in the United States to use organic light-emitting diodes, it provides strong contrast, pure blacks and good detail in a screen that is thinner than the cord that powers it.The O.L.E.D. screen is a promising TV technology. It uses no backlight, so it requires little power to run; Sony estimates it is 40 percent more efficient for each panel-inch than a conventional L.E.D. screen.Because O.L.E.D.’s have a speedy response time, sports and fast-moving images have few of the problems known as artifacts, making for better picture quality.O.L.E.D.’s are inexpensive to make, at least in theory. The XEL-1, which measures 11 inches diagonally in the 16:9 widescreen format, is priced at $2,500, and will be available in limited quantities through Sony Style stores and some retailers. Sony unveiled a 27-inch version at a trade show in January. As production ramps up, expect O.L.E.D.’s to become larger and cheaper. ROY FURCHGOTT'"
"'08-04-03,'1','Now, those seeking entry must run a bureaucratic gantlet that can include having to establish their artistic credentials, hire a lawyer, pay visa fees and visit a United States embassy or consulate.All of that requires money and time, said Jonathan Ginsburg, an immigration lawyer in Fairfax, Va., with the firm of Fettmann, Tolchin & Majors. An entertainer from London who has an arrest record, for example, would need a report from Scotland Yard, which can cause more delays.Once the application is made, the Homeland Security Department is supposed to act within two weeks, but recently it almost never has; in the worst cases, getting an answer takes as long as six months, arts organizations said. So-called premium processing is available to expedite an application, at a cost of $1,000 for each petitioner.The House bill, approved on Tuesday, extends the processing time to 30 days from two weeks. If the deadline is not met, the department is required to provide free expedited processing. The bill, which applies only to visa applications made by nonprofit arts groups, still needs the Senate’s approval.Heather Noonan, the vice president for advocacy for the League of American Orchestras, called the bill an important step.“We’re very pleased to see Congress support opportunities for international cultural exchange this way and particularly happy to see such broad bipartisan support for the measure,” Ms. Noonan said.Sandra Gibson, the president and chief executive of the Association of Performing Arts Presenters, said: “We’ve been watching this issue for 10 years. The premium-processing fee meant the nonprofit community would not be served.”A task force on visas was formed in 2001, she said, when premium processing began. But the Sept. 11 attacks slowed everything down. “There were delays in interviews, inability to get interviews,” Ms. Gibson said. On applications, problems like inverted birth dates and misspelled last names made problems snowball. Around the world, the embassies and consulates that were part of the process were staffed at different levels. “In China and India it can take 100 days to get an interview,” she said.With the value of the dollar waning, more and more artists have decided to stay home, Ms. Gibson said, echoing other officials. And fewer of the presenters, she said, are willing to go through the contortions of bringing in foreign artists.Cyril M. Ferenchak, a spokesman for the Bureau of Consular Affairs at the State Department, said in an e-mail message that the government had worked hard to make the visa application easier and more efficient.“Over 570 new consular positions have been created to handle a growing visa demand and the added security measure in our visa adjudication process,” Mr. Ferenchak wrote, adding that embassy Web sites provide information on things like required documents to demystify the visa process.Matthew Covey, executive director of Tamizdat, a nonprofit group that helps artists get visas, said the House bill was a step in the right direction. Emerging artists without much money or the organizational skills to get together a visa application are the ones especially hurt by the visa labyrinth.“An awful lot of musicians don’t make a lot of money,” he said. “They are looking to break even, to promote their work. Most musicians need to expedite their visas because many clubs book six to eight weeks in advance.”And American audiences may never know what they are missing.'"
"'08-04-03,'1','“What kind of a business,” Ms. Pearce went on, “would rationalize the creation of an entire product line four times a year and then produce it on spec?”The most obvious result of this pressure is that Mr. Nilsson is not so singular after all. It is increasingly common for designers to be suddenly fired or replaced, as has happened at Anne Klein, Emanuel Ungaro, Chloé, Paco Rabanne and, yet again, at Bill Blass, all in the last 24 months. Anne Klein closed a collection designed by Isabel Toledo after two seasons. At Ungaro, Peter Dundas left after three seasons, to be replaced by Esteban Cortazar. Chloé dropped Paulo Melim Andersson after three collections. Paco Rabanne stopped producing the collections Patrick Robinson had designed for three seasons. And Michael Vollbracht, Mr. Nilsson’s successor at Blass, quit abruptly and was replaced by Peter Som.On Tuesday, Ferré announced its next designers as well, naming Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi of the label 6267 to replace Mr. Nilsson.THE frequency of turnovers suggests that cracks are beginning to appear in the model of brand reinvention that dominated fashion for more than a decade. The transformations at Yves Saint Laurent, Lanvin and Burberry, for example, benefited from clever managements and, just as important, enough time for the public to embrace the reborn brands — neither of which are in ample supply today.“It really is a case of these big business people who do not understand why creativity is valuable in the first place,” said Ruben Toledo, the illustrator.His wife, Ms. Toledo, was, until November, attempting to restore a prestige image to the Anne Klein label, designing an expensive version that was sold at Barneys New York.After just two seasons, Jones Apparel Group, which owns Anne Klein, decided to return its focus to mainstream sportswear and ended its contract with Ms. Toledo. Despite enthusiastic reviews, there wasn’t time for her to change the public impression of Anne Klein and also make a profit.Mr. Toledo decried the decreasing odds that creativity can flourish within a corporate environment. “Big business people think: ‘Oh, do we have to go with a creative person? Can’t we just fill the job with a merchandiser?’ ” he said. “You don’t put a scientist into the kitchen of a chef.”Corporate executives have argued that it is difficult to find a designer who has both creative and managerial skills, and also an ability to understand market directions. They see a shrinking talent pool of potential Tom Fords. “You need somebody who understands the customer base,” said Michael Groveman, the chief executive of Bill Blass. “In today’s world, it’s not enough to have a critically acclaimed talent. You need a commercial talent as well.”Ms. Toledo suggested that the problem did not lie with the designers’ skill sets.“Designers can design till the cows come home,” she said, “but if you don’t have good business people, good design does not reach its full potential.”The circumstances may be different enough to discourage generalizing about the fate of fashion, but they do illustrate a deeper regard for commerce than for creativity. Such an impression is also left by the Liz Claiborne company’s recent decision to downgrade Dana Buchman from an upscale department store label to one sold at Kohl’s; or the persistent sense in John Galliano’s ready-to-wear collections for Dior that the designer is checking off a list: four coats, six suits, three day dresses, 19 handbags, et cetera.At Anne Klein, Peter Boneparth, the executive who had championed Ms. Toledo, resigned from Jones after a disagreement with its board, leaving the expensive strategy of building a designer brand without an effective proponent. Jones cut its losses. At Ungaro, Mr. Dundas, whose sexpot sequins were championed by the severely styled editors of several French magazines but less appreciated by a more sober American audience, left in July after the company changed the stylist for his shows.Meanwhile, the announcement three weeks ago that Mr. Andersson (formerly of Marni) had been dropped at Chloé and replaced by Hannah MacGibbon, an assistant, did not surprise anyone who ever wondered if a square peg would fit a round hole.“The problem is that the talent pool is too young for some of these big positions,” said Kim Vernon, a luxury brand consultant. “They never learned how to be creative and design into a business.”What concerns Ms. Vernon is that there are fewer seasoned designers than available positions. Ungaro, a company with $250 million in sales and numerous licenses to support, raised eyebrows when it replaced Mr. Dundas with Mr. Cortazar, a 23-year-old design prodigy. As Mounir Moufarrige, the chief executive of Ungaro, told Women’s Wear Daily at the time, “The brand has aged, and it needs buzz — and fast.”Mr. Cortazar is no dummy. He recognizes the potential peril in his decision to move to Paris only eight months after moving to New York. But the opportunity was too good to miss. “This is on my shoulders,” he said. “But there has been such a revolving door at Ungaro that I think the owners feel this is a time to nurture someone and make it work. All that jumping around was hurting the company.”At Ferré, the circumstances are more complicated. The company may have moved too quickly in naming a successor less than three months after Mr. Ferré died last summer. Mr. Ferré was revered in Milan, most dearly by the employees who remained loyal to his company and did not entirely welcome Mr. Nilsson. In fact, several of them were crying when the new designer was introduced.According to three employees at Ferré, who did not want their names to be used because they are forbidden to talk about the circumstances that led to Mr. Nilsson’s dismissal, it quickly became clear that the changes Mr. Nilsson wanted to make were not in line with their ideal of the architectural drama of Ferré. He had asked for creative control over certain aspects of the house, including its men’s wear and myriad licenses, for children’s clothes and fur coats, they said, and so they iced him out.Although his departure from Ferré was indeed noteworthy for its haste, it lacked the Shakespearean undertones of his experience at Blass, where a colleague had been designing an alternative collection simultaneously to his, then secretly showed it to retailers before Mr. Nilsson was dismissed.“Maybe these companies are feeling they need to radically change to survive,” said Kim Hastreiter, an editor of Paper magazine. “It’s a defensive position instead of an offensive position. They are not willing to give it the long haul.”'"
"'08-04-03,'1','After such a burst, you’re offered three options: delete all 60 shots, keep all 60, or review them and pluck out the individual frames worth keeping. The whole batch begins to play like a flip-book movie; you control playback with a back-panel control dial. As you watch, you press the shutter button once to identify each frame you want to keep; the rest will be discarded.You can parcel out the 60-shot maximum in different ways: 30 shots a second for two seconds, 20 for three seconds, 15 for four seconds, and so on. You can even adjust the firing rate in midshot by turning the lens barrel. (The camera’s menus let you choose what you want the lens ring to govern: zoom, focus or burst rate.)So who would ever need to take so many pictures in one second? Sports fans, of course; imagine having the luxury of plucking out a photo of exactly the bat angle, soccer-leg swing or basketball jump height you want.But there are many other times when you might like to isolate just the right split second: when your subjects are wildlife (including children), explosions, splashes, bouquet tosses, celebrity glimpses, broadening smiles and so on.The F1’s second trick is that business about photographing a moment after the fact. In pre-record mode, you half-press the shutter button when you’re awaiting an event that’s unpredictable: a breaching whale, a geyser’s eruption or a 5-year-old batter connecting with the ball. The camera silently, repeatedly records 60 shots a second, immediately discarding the old to make room for the new.When you finally press the shutter button fully, the camera simply preserves the most recent shots, thus effectively photographing an event that, technically speaking, you missed.Then there’s the motion detector. In this mode, you put the camera down on something steady, press the shutter button and back away. It sits there, waiting for hours if necessary, until it detects movement in the scene — at which point it auto-fires 60 burst shots. That could come in handy when you’re trying to photograph a hummingbird approaching a flower, a bird arriving at its nest or an unauthorized household member raiding the cookie jar.As a final time trick, the F1 can display, on its 2.8-inch screen, a slow-motion version of what the camera is “seeing.” Your preview falls further and further behind real time — but you now have the luxury of patience as you decide precisely when to snap the shot.The F1’s movie mode is one of the most powerful ever. It has stereo microphones, and even a jack for an external mike. It has separate triggers for stills and videos, so you can snap stills right in the middle of filming a movie. It can zoom in midmovie, a rarity in still cameras. And it can film in either standard or high definition; there’s even a mini-HDMI jack for connecting the camera straight to an HDTV set.Most stunning of all, this camera can film at outrageously high frame rates: 300, 600, or even 1,200 frames a second. The result is incredibly smooth, extremely slow motion, like something in an Imax nature movie. No still camera has ever offered anything like this feature.The downside, alas, is that at faster rates, you get smaller movies. At 1,200 frames a second, you’re dealing with a Triscuit-sized video in the center of your TV screen, surrounded by oceans of black margin.Still, when you’re trying to pinpoint problems with your golf swing, your tennis serve or your industrial equipment, slowing time down to this extent is like a keyhole into a previously invisible world. You might not care about the size of the keyhole.Unfortunately, this highly unusual, almost experimental piece of equipment includes nearly as many downsides as breakthroughs.First, even though it’s nearly as big and bulky as a digital S.L.R. like a Canon Rebel or Nikon D80, the F1 is, at its heart, an amateur camera. It contains a tiny light sensor (about half an inch diagonal, versus 1.1 inches in a beginner S.L.R.). As a result, its light sensitivity is poor. Except in bright sunlight or studio lighting, those burst-mode shots are often disappointingly dim or disappointingly blurry.Casio was obviously aware of this weakness, and so it engineered one of the brightest and fastest flashes ever on a consumer camera: it can fire an amazing 7 times a second for up to 3 seconds. That superflash generally solves the light-sensitivity problem, but of course you might not want the characteristic harshness of flash photos.There’s even a second “flash” right above the first — actually a very bright video-light L.E.D., which can maintain steady illumination on nearby subjects when the main flash’s 7 frames a second still isn’t fast enough. Clever.But there are other problems. The eyepiece viewfinder is electronic (a tiny, relatively coarse video screen), not optical (pristine, see-through glass). Start-up is slow.The 12X zoom is nice to have, but it’s slow to react. And during video capture, when you turn the lens ring to zoom, it jerks spastically through the zoom range, effectively ruining your shot. The camera has great difficulty changing focus during filming, too.The F1 is also complicated. It has two different mode dials and two different “shutter” buttons (one for stills, one for video). All those high-speed features, and all the attendant settings, had to go somewhere.There are long lists of limits, too. You can’t use the lens ring to zoom during high-definition filming. The flash won’t operate in pre-record mode. Face detection doesn’t work during video capture. There’s no sound in high-speed videos. You can’t change focus, zoom or exposure during high-speed filming. And so on.Now, it does seem ungrateful to criticize such an astonishing camera; it’s like complaining that your 7-year-old violin virtuoso is lousy at sports.But make no mistake: no camera has ever offered anything like the F1’s high-speed stills, high-speed videos or high-speed flash for anywhere near its price. Everybody who sees this camera in action winds up slack-jawed with disbelief.Casio deserves congratulations for innovating in so many big, bold, industry-defying ways. Instead of pushing misleading metrics like megapixels, the company went its own defiant way and came up with a camera with an extremely clearly defined identity.Maybe it’s not the time machine of sci-fi movies. But in the world of consumer electronics, it’s an eye-opening first step.'"
"'08-04-03,'1','An independent environmental expert told a court in Ecuador that the oil company Chevron should pay $7 billion to $16 billion in compensation for environmental damage in the country.In a report to the court, the expert, Richard Cabrera, who is a geologist, said the low end of the range represented the cost to remediate soils and pay for health care costs, a water system and infrastructure improvements.The high end of the range was based on an “unjust enrichment” penalty.The lawsuit, which peasants and Indians in Ecuador brought in the early 1990s, contends that Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001, polluted the jungle and damaged their health by dumping 18 billion gallons of contaminated water from 1972 to 1992.Chevron’s general counsel, Charles James, disputed the findings of the report, saying the case had become a political issue in Ecuador.“This is no longer a private lawsuit; it is a working partnership between the government and plaintiffs,” he said. “This is more extortion that a real lawsuit. We will protest this report.”He did not rule out reaching an out-of-court settlement with the plaintiffs, but said the company would not be “blackmailed.”'"
"'08-04-03,'1','Thomas wants to stay, according to Walsh, who hired Thomas to coach the Indiana Pacers in 2000. The two remain friendly, so a partnership is possible, if potentially awkward. Although , the Garden chairman, has been fiercely loyal to Thomas, Walsh said that he alone would decide whether to retain Thomas, or anyone else in the basketball operations division, for that matter.Walsh, who signed a four-year contract, said repeatedly that he would make no decisions until he had a chance to meet with Thomas. They have spoken briefly by telephone since Walsh accepted the job. But Walsh seemed undaunted by the fans’ intense disdain for Thomas and by Thomas’s spotty record here. The Knicks have not had a winning season since Thomas became president, in December 2003, and are 53-104 in his two seasons as the coach. Their payroll is the highest in the league.“He is a great basketball mind, and I’m not going to judge anything from afar,” Walsh said. “I’ve told him that we’re going to sit down and talk in the coming days, and then we’ll go from there. I think he’s got the skills to help this franchise.”It is conceivable that Thomas, who has a good reputation for evaluating collegiate talent, could remain in the front office in a reduced role. Walsh would not say whether Thomas might return as coach, although it seems highly unlikely. Thomas has already lost stature in the locker room because of a number of questionable decisions this season. And it would surely be awkward for Thomas to face the news media every day while Walsh methodically dismantles his roster.Walsh was short on specifics, but he set out some goals. He said he wanted the Knicks to become competitive in the short term, and to get under the salary cap in the next two to three years.Walsh seemed to be eyeing the summer of 2010, when , Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh can become free agents. But creating cap space will require the Knicks to essentially stop spending for the next two years. It could also limit Walsh’s ability to make trades.The Knicks have not been under the salary cap in more than a decade. Having the chance to sign a major free agent “would be a monstrous thing for this franchise,” Walsh said. “You can turn something over overnight in a lot of ways if you can manage the cap the right way now.”That means the Knicks may be hesitant to trade ’s expiring contract (worth $22 million next season), because they would probably have to take back longer contracts in return.The Knicks (20-55) will also have a high draft pick, which Walsh also called “very important.” Based on talent alone, Walsh said he had thought the Knicks would compete for a playoff spot this season. He seemed intrigued by Eddy Curry and genuinely appreciative of Jamal Crawford, whom he called “a nice, solid player.” He said Marbury could be “a key player and said there were things he liked about Jared Jeffries, Renaldo Balkman and Nate Robinson.“It isn’t so much the players themselves, it’s the mix of players,” he said. “There’s some things missing here, or at least it appears to be.”Walsh also zeroed in on perhaps Thomas’s greatest miscalculation of the past year — the acquisition of Zach Randolph. Curry and Randolph never meshed in the frontcourt, ultimately hurting both players and the team as a whole.“They’re both very good players, and can that work?” Walsh said. “That’s all it is, is can it work?”It was a rhetorical question, which was consistent with Walsh’s approach to his first day at the Garden. He refrained from swift judgments or sweeping statements or anything too specific. Walsh said he wanted to meet with everyone — players, coaches, front-office personnel and other staff members — before making any major decisions.He did not say whether he might hire a general manager, but noted that he had already fielded several calls from interested parties. Glen Grunwald has served as general manager for the last two seasons under Thomas. Brendan Suhr, who is among Thomas’s closest confidants, is the team’s director of player personnel. Both could be replaced.If Walsh indeed decides to hire a new coach, there will be plenty of candidates. The most accomplished free-agent coaches are Rick Carlisle (who worked for Walsh in ), the former coach Scott Skiles and the former Knicks coach .Walsh spent more than two decades running the Pacers, building them into a perennial Eastern Conference power and rebuilding them several times along the way. They made the finals in 2000. The Knicks have not had someone of Walsh’s caliber running the franchise since left in 2001, and Dolan assumed more control over day-to-day operations.After seven straight losing seasons, Dolan is finally ready to cede authority.Walsh will report directly to Dolan, but will have “complete control over all basketball operations,” Dolan said. That includes a re-examination of the team’s unusually restrictive policies on dealing with the news media.Walsh said he would not have taken the job without autonomy.In introducing Walsh, Dolan praised “his character, his judgment and of course his exceptional basketball expertise.” He said that hiring Walsh would be the first step in repaying fans for their loyalty.“His mandate is clear: do whatever is necessary to turn this team around,” Dolan said, reading from a prepared statement. “Our fans have been patient and loyal and deserve to have hope.”Dolan, who spoke publicly for the first time in a year, left without taking questions. The spotlight belonged solely to Walsh for the rest of the day.Although hiring Walsh is arguably the best move the Knicks have made in many years (Commissioner even released a statement praising the hire), the proceedings were understated. Three years ago, the Knicks marked the hiring of Coach , another New York native, with rock and a video tribute, while the Garden marquee blinked “Welcome Home Larry” on Seventh Avenue.There was no such fanfare Wednesday. Dolan and Walsh walked into the Garden’s Theater lobby just after 1 p.m. The only soundtrack was camera shutters snapping as they took the dais.

"'08-04-03,'1','Glenn Okun, clinical professor of management and entrepreneurship at Stern School of Business at New York University, says that owners should view their business as if they were a prospective outside investor. He outlines six steps to a thorough analysis of a venture:¶Assess the attractive, or opportune, elements of the venture.¶Identify the risks of the business.¶Select the most attractive opportunities to pursue.¶Decide which risks must be dealt with, given the likelihood of their threat and the extent of their impact.¶Determine the resources that will be required to exploit the opportunities and manage the risks.¶Estimate the value that will be created through the expenditure of resources. Plans that result in incremental shareholder value should be considered.Entrepreneurs must remember, he said, that resources have costs that must be borne by the firm. Financial costs include interest and the dilution of ownership. Financing terms may also constrain the entrepreneur’s flexibility in managing the firm.'"
"'08-04-03,'1','I have an acute sense of self-preservation, yet the assertion from the two police officers in Dege that I was in danger — particularly from the Tibetans, from whom I was purportedly being protected — struck me as preposterous.I thanked the police for their concern, and persuaded them to let me stay an extra day, after which I would absolutely have to leave. And, I was told, I had to change hotels. “This one isn’t safe enough,” the policewoman declared, which seemed to me to be a questionable assertion. Though not certified to house foreign guests, my hotel was no less secure than the one that she “recommended,” which was just 100 yards away, had no sink or shower in the entire place, and provided a 10-foot-long tiled trench for a common toilet.As our conversation progressed, it became clear that the police officers’ version of reality was being molded to fit government orders. Attempting to reason with people employed to sustain that reality was like trying to find out who’s on first.I finally turned to the translator and asked if she thought all of this was crazy. She wouldn’t say anything, even though the officers spoke no English, but she laughed in the affirmative.Despite the apparent urgency of getting me out of Dege, I stayed for three days, since the road out was closed because of heavy convoy traffic. I spent many hours among the local people and pilgrims who came to circumambulate the monastery, and was met with unanimous, unmistakable warmth. They were, conclusively, no threat.I harbored some anxiety about overstaying my welcome. But the police, who were everywhere, paid me no attention. Many soldiers were overtly friendly, waving and saying “Hello” in English. I shouldn’t have been there, but no one cared that I was.While this was a relief, it was also confusing. I didn’t know if the rules really mattered, what the consequences might be for violating them and how much of that depended on the whimsy of any given person in uniform. Looming behind everything was the shadow cast by China, its human rights record, and its intolerance of lawbreakers. As a result, I succumbed to a few baseless paranoid fantasies, even slashing slits in my backpack straps to stash my photo memory cards, which were my greatest concern.Over those three days, the scene in Dege, which never felt tense, relaxed even more. Soldiers began marching without helmets, shields or clubs; they looked like a group of students out for some exercise, their faces expressing that their mission was a bore.When I was able to return to Ganzi, the checkpoint at the edge of town conveyed an altogether more serious situation. Soldiers with machine guns eagerly surrounded the minivan I was in and flung open its doors on both sides. One of them addressed me in hurried, gruff tones; I calmly replied in English, “I don’t speak Chinese.” He stared at me, speechless, then turned his attention to the Tibetans in the vehicle. I wasn’t even asked to show my passport.Walking openly around town, I wasn’t questioned once by the police positioned at every intersection. Bizarrely, my presence seemed of no concern to anyone. The mood on the streets was as vibrant as when I’d first been there, and local people confirmed that life had returned essentially to normal. I was tempted to stay. Though deep in forbidden territory, I thought I might get away with it. There were still many mountain villages near Ganzi that I wanted to explore.Hungry to squeeze every last drop out of the trip, I envisioned myself playing out a traveler’s version of “The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.” Recalling the movie’s end, however, and noting that those who wanted me out had badges, I decided I had experienced plenty, and left. But regrets linger.I’m yearning to return — once it’s safe again.'"
"'08-04-03,'1','The advertisements on Wednesday capped a day in which Mr. McCain gave speeches at old haunts, from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md., to the Florida base here where he learned to fly, and revealed that he had begun drawing up a list of roughly a score of potential running mates.Mr. McCain joked on his campaign bus in Annapolis that his list had “every name imaginable” on it and stood at about 20 people but that there were probably a hundred people who thought they were on it.As nervous aides looked on and occasionally interjected to say that no decisions had been made, Mr. McCain said he had spoken with several people about heading the search for a running mate.He broached the subject in a radio interview on Wednesday with Don Imus.“We just started this process of getting together a list of names and having them looked at, and I don’t know how long it takes,” he said. “But if I had a personal preference, I’d like to do it before the convention to avoid some of the mistakes that I’ve seen made in the past, as you get into a time crunch and maybe sometimes don’t make the announcement right.”Choosing a conservative running mate might help Mr. McCain energize the Republican base, and a moderate might help him win the support of independent voters in swing states.Officials who have been mentioned include Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and several governors, like Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, Charlie Crist of Florida, Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah and Mark Sanford of South Carolina.Former governors have also been mentioned, including Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, whose support of abortion rights could cause trouble among conservatives already wary of Mr. McCain, and former primary opponents, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.Mr. McCain began the day in Annapolis, speaking in a chill wind at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium about his transformation from a rebellious youth to a presidential aspirant.“In truth, my four years at the Naval Academy were not notable for exemplary virtue or academic achievement but, rather, for the impressive catalog of demerits I managed to accumulate,” said Mr. McCain, who graduated fifth from the bottom of his class. “By my reckoning, at the end of my second class year, I had marched enough extra duty to take me to Baltimore and back 17 times, which, if not a record, certainly ranks somewhere very near the top.”In the contentious Democratic primary, meanwhile, Mr. Obama picked up two endorsements on Wednesday, one from a former congressman, Lee Hamilton of Indiana, which holds its primary in five weeks, and the other from a superdelegate, Gov. Dave Freudenthal of Wyoming. And he also suggested that in an Obama administration, he would find a role for former Vice President Al Gore, who is considered the ultimate prize among superdelegates.With the rivalry between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton splitting the party, Howard Dean, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, met with Florida party officials in an effort to resolve the seating of the state’s delegates at the national convention. Florida’s delegates have been barred because the state primary was held before party rules allowed.Mr. Dean said he hoped to seat the delegates but wanted the Obama and Clinton campaigns to agree on a resolution of the issue.'"

"'08-04-04,'0','If “Nim’s Island” were anything but a children’s movie, the casting genius who suggested Jodie Foster as a potential love interest for Gerard Butler would be looking for a new occupation. But miscasting isn’t the only problem with this sweet but ho-hum adaptation of Wendy Orr’s novel, a comedy-adventure that never quite finds its tone.The island in question lies deep in the South Pacific (beautifully played by the Gold Coast of Australia) and is home to Nim (Abigail Breslin) and her father, Jack (Mr. Butler). Motherless and near-fatherless (Jack spends his days studying plankton), Nim amuses herself with a stable of performing pets and the literary adventures of an Indiana Jones-style hero named Alex Rover. When Jack is trapped by a storm at sea, and Nim sends an e-mail message to Rover for help, she’s unaware that the recipient is his agoraphobic creator, Alexandra (Ms. Foster).Playing yet another tightly wound woman, Ms. Foster makes a slapstick meal of rushing to Nim’s aid. Yet this is a story about hiding from the world — whether on a remote island or inside your head — and the film’s sensitive notes are too often jarred by its attempts to score cheap comic points from sea lion flatulence and obese Australian tourists. The message that lifelong connections can be forged through books is a lovely one; too bad it’s obscured by flying lizards.Directed by Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett; written by Mr. Levin, Ms. Flackett, Paula Mazur and Joseph Kwong, based on the novel by Wendy Orr; director of photography, Stuart Dryburgh; edited by Stuart Levy; production designer, Barry Robison; produced by Ms. Mazur; released by Fox Walden.

"'08-04-04,'0','Payrolls for January and February were revised lower by a total of 67,000 and the unemployment rate shot up to 5.1 percent, the highest since September 2005. The economy has given up jobs the first three months of this year, and the latest report adds fuel to the belief of many economists that the U.S. is already in recession.“The economic data is negative, but I think what the market’s telling us is we’ve priced in a lot of the bad news already,” said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Jefferies & Company. “You could make the argument that we’ve thrown a lot of difficult news at this market and it’s reacted very well.”The market’s next big test is likely to come with the release of first-quarter earnings reports in the coming weeks. Investors will be particularly keen to know what companies’ outlooks are for the rest of this year — if they are disappointing, Wall Street could see a return of the punishing volatility of the last few months.Treasury prices jumped after the jobs report, as investors often seek the safety of government-backed bonds amid uncertainty about the economy. The yield on the benchmark 10-year note, which moves opposite its price, fell to 3.48 percent from 3.59 percent late Thursday.The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices rose.Crude oil prices rose $2.40 to settle at $106.23 a barrel in New York trading. Retail gas prices, meanwhile, surged to a new record above $3.30 a gallon, and appear ready to rise further as supplies tighten ahead of the summer driving season.Investors’ assessment of the economy comes after a strong week for Wall Street. Monday brought the welcome end to a downbeat first quarter. While the nearly 10 percent decline the S.& P. 500 during the first three months of the year was not upbeat news, stocks had managed to pull off their lows by quarter’s end.On Tuesday, the Dow surged nearly 400 points as investors snapped up shares of financial companies, which have fallen sharply in recent months on concerns about bad debt on balance sheets. The quiet sessions since, including Friday’s modest moves in the face of bad economic news, appeared to buoy some hopes that the market is carving a bottom after five months of declines in the S&P.Friday’s moderate moves followed a modest rise Thursday in response to remarks by the Federal Reserve chairman Ben S. Bernanke that the Fed expects to recover most, if not all, the $29 billion worth of loans it made to keep struggling Bear Stearns from collapse. Mr. Bernanke’s comments to the Senate Banking Committee, in which he defended the central bank’s decision to aid JPMorgan Chase’s takeover of Bear Stearns, were calming to investors hoping that demand is returning to the tight credit markets.Other central bankers and business leaders appearing before the committee indicated they were able to avert a financial catastrophe with Bear Stearns sinking quickly toward bankruptcy.Remarks by Mr. Bernanke earlier in the week left the door open to another interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve.Michael Strauss, chief economist at Commonfund, said that the jobs “number still supports the notion that there’s likely going to be more monetary policy easing by the Fed.”Figures like employment numbers also lag, Mr. Hogan said. “The unemployment rate will go higher before the recession is over,” he said. “I think the market is trying to tell us we understand that, we’ve seen this before.”“I think there are market participants who are looking through the valley and saying they’re seeing the other side,” he added.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','Still, Mr. Ospel, in an interview in Zurich, insisted such a shift would be a mistake. “We have reassessed the strategy over and over again and came to the conclusion that the integrated model makes sense,” he said.The chief executive of UBS, Marcel Rohner, has also repeatedly rejected calls to split off the investment bank, saying that the bank works well as an integrated firm and that it would lose cost savings and revenue of it were to separate the businesses.A spokeswoman, Sarah Small, said Friday that UBS would review Mr. Arnold’s letter and respond “in due course and in an appropriate form.”The letter by Mr. Arnold, who served as UBS’s finance chief and then president of the group executive board before resigning in 2001 after a power struggle, comes days after the Swiss bank revealed a $19 billion write-down and announced plans to raise $15 billion in new capital.Other observers agree that there is a logic to hiving off the investment banking arm. An analyst at JPMorgan Chase, Kian Abouhossein, estimates UBS is trading at a 25 percent discount because the value of its wealth management unit is diluted by the troubled investment banking division. He suggested the spin-off of 30 percent of the wealth management division to current shareholders.A Swiss shareholder group, Actares, also favors a separation because it would increase transparency and reassure wealth management clients who have grown nervous about losses at the bank. Net investments in the private-banking unit were “slightly positive” in the first quarter, but clients in Switzerland have started to withdraw funds.In a sign that UBS is already looking for new ways to cope with some of its troubled debt securities, the bank said that it would “ring-fence” its more problematic positions. The announcement helped fuel a surge in financial shares as investors bet UBS and similarly troubled banks would move swiftly to clean their problems.“I can’t believe that Kurer is not already looking into the option of a separation in one form or another,” Roby Tschopp, managing director of Actares, said, referring to Peter Kurer, the UBS general counsel who was named this week to succeed Mr. Ospel.Mr. Arnold has asked the board to rethink Mr. Kurer’s appointment, saying he was part of the team that allowed UBS to become overexposed to the subprime mortgage sector.Dieter Buchholz, a fund manager at AIG Private Bank in Zurich, said Mr. Arnold’s proposals might help but it was too early to discuss them.“The damage is still working itself through the system,” said Mr. Buchholz. “When the dust has settled down, that’s when you can discuss these issues.”'"
"'08-04-04,'0','Cities and towns along the Mississippi River braced for rising water levels and possible flooding on Friday as recent rains in the nation’s lower midsection ran off saturated ground toward its eventual destination in the Gulf of Mexico.The river is expected to crest at 48 feet in Vicksburg next Tuesday, according to the Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center. On Friday, the river was at 46.6 feet, 3.6 feet above flood stage.Some residents of Vicksburg’s northern areas have already evacuated as rising water has made some roads impassible and others were expected to leave as the river approaches its peak.Meanwhile, the Army Corps of Engineers warned that minor flooding was possible in Southern Illinois as lakes drain into already swollen rivers in the region. Corps officials said they would monitor and adjust outflows from the lakes to minimize the flooding.Meanwhile thunderstorms, some of them likely to be severe, were expected to develop in Texas and Arkansas and move eastward. In addition to the threat of tornadoes, similar to the one that flattened parts of northern Little Rock, Ark., Thursday night, the storms were expected to bring renewed downpours throughout the deep South to the Tennessee Valley.High winds also toppled trees and knocked out power in northern Louisiana and ArkansasParts of southern Missouri and the Ohio Valley were expecting downpours on Friday which might also aggravate existing flood problems.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','“We are extremely disappointed that our plan investors have taken the position that they are not obligated to fund their planned investment commitments to Delphi and instead have chosen to walk away from the company and its stakeholders,” Delphi’s restructuring chief, John Sheehan, said in a statement. “We are prepared to pursue actions that are in the best interests of Delphi and its stakeholders.”A G.M. spokeswoman Renee Rashid-Merem said it was disappointed Appaloosa had withdrawn.“There has been a tremendous amount of effort and progress made to establish the foundation that would enable Delphi to emerge from Chapter 11,” she said in a statement. “G.M. will continue to work with the involved parties to facilitate Delphi’s efforts to emerge from bankruptcy.”“I would not be surprised to see additional forms of financial support from G.M.,” an anlyst at Fitch Ratings, Mark Oline said. “It’s been never-ending since the initial filing.”An anlyst at Standard & Poor’s, Marc Eiger, told investors that the sooner Delphi emerges from bankruptcy, the better off G.M. will be. He noted that G.M. recently increased the amount of loan money it offered to Delphi, and it “may need to provide more cash to help Delphi emerge.”As for an equity deal, Appaloosa said it was still negotiating to invest in Delphi despite its refusal to do so under the terms of the existing agreement.Appaloosa’s announcement came as Delphi faced a Friday deadline to raise $6.1 billion in loans to help it out of bankruptcy. Delphi followed Appaloosa’s statement with its own, saying it had raised the needed loan money and was ready to do the deal but that Appaloosa had backed down.“We are extremely disappointed that our plan investors have taken the position that they are not obligated to fund their planned investment commitments to Delphi and instead have chosen to walk away from the company and its stakeholders,” Delphi’s restructuring chief, John Sheehan, said in a statement. “We are prepared to pursue actions that are in the best interests of Delphi and its stakeholders.”Delphi, which has been in bankruptcy since October 2005, offered no specifics on what those actions may be.Appaloosa said Delphi has breached an agreement it had with the investor group but said it was still talking to Delphi and could potentially do a deal “in a capacity different than currently envisioned by the agreement.”The letter from Appaloosa’s David Tepper, a well-known investor in distressed companies, said he had been “actively engaging in discussion to resolve our outstanding issues in a mutually acceptable manner.”Mr. Tepper also asserted Friday that he is entitled to an $82.5 million fee, because Delphi breached their agreement by seeking an alternative transaction. It referred in its filing to Delphi’s effort to take more loans from G.M., a move that threatened the power of the investor group.Under the restructuring plan approved by the court and creditors, G.M. can offer up to $750 million in loans. A judge recently ruled that a G.M. affiliate — but not G.M. itself — could offer two other loans, one of $2 billion and a second loan worth as much as $825 million.Five of six investors in the Appaloosa group had objected to G.M.’s increased participation in the loans package over concerns about G.M. expanding its influence over Delphi. They had argued the loans would “adversely affect the company and the investors by materially increasing and concentrating G.M.’s ongoing influence and control.”The other investors in the Appaloosa-led group are Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund I Ltd., Merrill Lynch , Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., UBS Securities , Pardus Capital Management and Goldman Sachs Group.Goldman Sachs was the one investor in the group that had not objected to more loans from G.M.G.M. is also in negotiations to increase its contribution to Delphi’s pension plans from the $1.5 billion obligation it has now.G.M. shares fell 88 cents, or 4 percent, to $20.71 in afternoon trading Friday.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','The diversified manufacturer Honeywell International said on Friday that it would buy Norcross Safety Products, a maker of personal protective equipment, for about $1.2 billion to expand its safety business.Norcross, which is majority-owned by Odyssey Investment Partners, makes respirators, helmets, protective gloves and shoes and other protective gear for firefighters and industrial workers. The company had 2007 revenue of about $609 million.“This acquisition provides Honeywell with a complete platform in a fragmented, global segment which is expected to yield substantial growth opportunities,” Roger Fradin, chief executive of Honeywell’s automation and control solutions group, said in a statement.Norcross, based in Oak Brook, Ill., will become part of Mr. Fradin’s unit, Honeywell’s largest and fastest-growing operation.The division, whose products range from home thermostats to systems that manage large industrial facilities, last year generated 36.1 percent of Honeywell’s $34.6 billion in revenue.The deal is subject to regulatory review, Honeywell, said. It is based in Morris Township, N.J..'"
"'08-04-04,'0','Cabrera led off the eighth with a single against Brian Wolfe, who then gave way to the left-hander Scott Downs. The next two hitters bunted, with Downs bobbling Johnny Damon’s bunt for an error and setting up another sacrifice, by Derek Jeter.That brought up Abreu, who typically exhorts teammates by belting out, “Atta boy.” This time, Abreu earned praise of his own, punching an inside sinker from Downs into center to drive Cabrera home.Rivera allowed a leadoff single to Vernon Wells in the ninth, and groundouts moved Wells to third. But Rivera froze Aaron Hill with an inside fastball at the knees to end the game.Hill stood at the plate, banging the barrel of his bat in the dirt, as the plate umpire Bill Miller walked away. The Blue Jays got three quality starts in this series, but the Yankees took two of the games.“You know it’s going to be a battle when you face these guys,” Yankees Manager Joe Girardi said. “They hold runners on, they do a lot of the little things, they don’t walk people. So you have to beat them with quality at-bats. Our guys kept at them, kept at them, and we finally scratched a few runs across.”Hughes, who was nearly traded with Cabrera for Johan Santana last December, did not allow a base runner for three innings. He mixed his pitches effectively, getting in good counts and then trying curveballs and changeups to keep the Blue Jays guessing.“If I’m ahead with my fastball, I’m usually not going to give up many runs,” Hughes said.A looping double down the left-field line by David Eckstein hurt Hughes in the fourth, and after Alex Rios drove in the run, Hughes faced two dangerous power hitters. He went at Wells with a changeup and a curveball on 3-2, getting a foul and a swinging third strike, and then ran a full count on Frank Thomas.Hughes’s fastball buzzed low and in on Thomas, who hustled out of the box and took a few steps toward first base. But Miller ruled that it clipped the inside corner for strike three.Only eight players have drawn more walks than Thomas, who took the first of his 1,628 when Hughes was 4. It would be natural for Thomas to get borderline calls, and he was livid at Miller, storming back to yell at him and earning a quick ejection.“That’s one of the worst calls I’ve seen in a while,” Thomas told Toronto reporters, adding later, “I don’t run to first base unless it’s a ball. It was a bad miss.”Hughes took one more spin through the order, ending by jamming Thomas’s replacement, Shannon Stewart, on a weak groundout to end the sixth. Toronto scored once more in that stretch, though, on an infield single by Eckstein that made the score 2-0.The Yankees, who had failed to capitalize on leadoff singles in the third, the fourth and the fifth, finally broke through against Dustin McGowan in the sixth.Damon led off the sixth by swinging at a high fastball — “Maybe ball four,” he said — and driving it to right center for a double. McGowan followed by hitting Jeter with a curveball and walking Abreu, and Damon scored on a wild pitch.A sacrifice fly by Jason Giambi tied the game. Abreu was caught at third trying to tag up on the play, but he came through when he got his next chance.The left-hander Kei Igawa has struggled in the majors, but he continues to thrive forClass AAA Scranton-Wilkes Barre. On Thursday, Igawa threw six perfect innings in a 4-1 victory over Lehigh Valley before reliever Scott Patterson allowed a leadoff single in the seventh.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','The better half, the old man, the breadwinner, the spouse.Roget’s Thesaurus may be of some help, but when it comes to defining who may inherit part of a reported $350 million from the Johnson & Johnson fortune, the one built on Band-Aids and Mylanta, the New Jersey Supreme Court is far better.At least Marty Richards thinks so.The court decided on Thursday that Mr. Richards, the third husband of a Johnson & Johnson heiress, remained a spouse even though the heiress died in 1990.New Jersey’s highest court ruled 5 to 2 that Mr. Richards was eligible for part of an enormous trust fund, just like the 30 or so other family members, including great-grandchildren. The decision cannot be appealed.Roderick Ryan, the son of the heiress, Mary Lea Johnson Richards, along with the great-grandchildren of John Seward Johnson Sr., the son of one of the company’s founders, have argued in court for years over the meaning of “spouse,” to the exclusion of Mr. Richards. Mr. Ryan is Mr. Richards’s stepson.The estate’s trustees are free to determine how much or how little money Mr. Richards may receive, the court said, but they cannot exclude him on the grounds that he is not a spouse.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','“I know that I’m not going to get a majority of the African-American vote,” Mr. McCain said last week in a radio interview on “The Tavis Smiley Show.” “But I’m going to campaign all over this country. I’m going to go to South Philadelphia, I’m going to go to the Black Belt in Alabama, I’m going to go all over America, and I’m going to communicate, I’m going to talk with, I’m going to share the frustrations, the hopes and the dreams that the African-American community has.”The Democrats are pointing to Mr. McCain’s vote against the King holiday — and his votes against civil rights legislation in 1990 and in support of stripping funds from a commission to encourage observance of the holiday — to question his commitment to civil rights.“Instead of using his biography tour to reinvent himself for the general election, John McCain should explain why he thinks voters should trust him to protect the rights and dignity of every American after getting it wrong during his quarter-century in Congress,” said Damien LaVera, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee.The year Mr. McCain voted against establishing the federal holiday for Dr. King, the bill passed the House by 338 to 90, with most Republicans supporting it. It then passed the Republican-controlled Senate and was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan, who had initially opposed the measure. Asked this week why he had voted against it, Mr. McCain said, “I just had not had a lot of experience with the issue, that’s all.”While running for president in 2000, Mr. McCain said in an interview on “This Week With Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts” on ABC that he had voted against the King holiday because he “thought that it was not necessary to have another federal holiday, that it cost too much money, that other presidents were not recognized.”In 2000, he brought up the bitter battle over establishing a state holiday in Arizona, which he at first had opposed, while arguing that the people of South Carolina should decide whether to fly the Confederate flag over the Capitol.“I believe it’s an issue that the people of South Carolina can settle,” he said on “Meet the Press” on NBC, “just as we in Arizona settled the very divisive issue over the recognition of Dr. Martin Luther King as a holiday. When I was fighting for that, I resented it a great deal when people from Washington and pundits and politicians and others came to my state to tell us how we should work out a very difficult problem.”Mr. McCain later wrote that his failure to keep a consistent position on the flag — he had initially called it “a symbol of racism and slavery” — was an act of cowardice, and that he had believed the flag should be lowered from the Capitol.Although Mr. McCain now plans to begin reaching out to African-American voters, he and the other leading Republican presidential candidates skipped a televised debate last year that centered on issues of importance to black and Hispanic voters, citing scheduling conflicts.Mr. McCain recalled this week how he had learned of Dr. King’s assassination while he was a prisoner of war in Vietnam, through a propaganda radio program broadcast into his cell, where he was kept in solitary confinement. “If there was bad news — like a hurricane, or Martin Luther King’s assassination or Bobby Kennedy’s or any of the others — then they would broadcast it right away,” he said. “If it was an event like the Moon landing, well, that was not worthy of our notice.”When he was asked about Senator Barack Obama’s proposal to honor César Chávez, the activist for farm workers’ rights, with a national holiday, he said he would consider it. “My initial leanings are, why not?” Mr. McCain said.'"

Hundreds of people watched the event; Cypriots also lined up (left) to cross once the checkpoint was opened. Although Turkish Cypriots have opened five other checkpoints in recent years, the Ledra Street crossing was considered especially symbolic because it sat in the heart of the island’s divided capital, Nicosia. Both sides agreed last month to restart talks on uniting the island, the first serious effort in two years to erase the 1974 division.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','He asked the federal court to make the case a class action on behalf of all baristas in New York State.In a statement, Starbucks said it was unfortunate that copycat lawsuits had been filed in the weeks after the California ruling and that it intended to appeal. “Our tip policy allows hourly partners (baristas and shift supervisors) to receive their fair share of customer tips,” the company said. “Shift supervisors are not managers and have no managerial authority.” The company said that shift supervisors often do the same work as baristas.The $105 million award in California stung and embarrassed Starbucks at a time when store sales had dropped for the first time. It is even closing some shops.In a voice mail message to employees last week, posted on the company Web site, Howard Schultz, the company’s chairman, called the California ruling “extremely unfair and beyond reason.” Mr. Schultz told employees, “I want to personally let you know that we would never condone any type of behavior that would lead anyone to conclude that we would take money from our people.”In New York, Starbucks has been hit by other problems. A year ago, the National Labor Relations Board charged Starbucks with breaking federal labor laws 30 times, including the illegal firing of two workers who supported a unionization effort.Daniel Gross, a leader of the unionization drive, said that after the California ruling was handed down, baristas in New York began debating whether shift supervisors should share in the tips.“It’s a very divisive issue,” he said. “A lot of baristas feel that shift supervisors are part of our team, that they’re absolutely on the floor with us, making drinks. Others don’t feel that sense of camaraderie with them.”Liberté Locke, a barista at a Starbucks in Union Square, admitted feeling torn about sharing tips with the shift supervisors.“On one hand, Starbucks sees them as management,” she said. “They handle the cash. They handle the keys. They lock the doors. They run the stores when managers are away. They have power to discipline baristas through performance reviews. But on the other hand, they are paid significantly less than the other managers, and they often work alongside us.“So part of me feels that they should be able to receive part of the tips,” she continued. “But under the language of the law, I feel they shouldn’t receive tips.”Ms. Locke said she earned $10.03 an hour after three years on the job, while a shift supervisor at her shop made $10.25 an hour, also after three years.Several baristas said they typically received $1.20 an hour to $1.80 an hour in tips.Mr. Kirschenbaum, the lawyer, said, “The fact that shift supervisors are underpaid doesn’t mean that baristas should bear the brunt of that.”'"
"'08-04-04,'0','Stocks managed a modest gain on Thursday, as Wall Street moved cautiously before Friday’s jobs report, hopeful that the global financial system is on the mend.Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, calmed investors when he told Congress that the Fed expected to recover most, if not all, of the $29 billion worth of loans it had made to keep Bear Stearns from collapse.John A. Thain, the chief executive of Merrill Lynch, also gave solace to the market, telling The Nikkei, a Japanese financial newspaper, that it had adequate cash and would not need to raise more.Early Thursday, stocks dipped after the Labor Department reported a spike in jobless claims to the highest level since September 2005, but the decline was mild and short-lived.“I think that the desire to sell is coming off,” said Thomas J. Lee, equities analyst at JPMorgan. The fact that the market has not been shaken by recent disappointing economic data “tells me that the recession is largely discounted.”'"
"'08-04-04,'0','INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — ATA Airlines shut operations and stranded thousands of travelers Thursday when an unexpected loss of charter flights and soaring fuel costs forced the carrier into bankruptcy.Once the nation’s 10th-largest air carrier, ATA entered bankruptcy for the second time in just over three years. The company had more than 2,200 employees, and “virtually all” were told that their jobs were gone, a company spokesman, Michael Freitag, said.Many passengers learned of the airline’s collapse at ticket counters, where advisories were posted in the handful of cities ATA still served. The airline said it flew about 10,000 passengers a day.“It ruins my vacation,” said Beatrice Martinez, who was trying to reach Guadalajara, Mexico, from Midway International Airport in Chicago. “I’m in shock.”ATA, based in Indianapolis, was the second carrier to seek bankruptcy protection in two weeks. Aloha Airlines filed for Chapter 11 protection last month, a little more than two years after emerging from bankruptcy.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, praised the Senate bill on Thursday but said the House would work to improve it.“The value of what the Senate did is they came together in a bipartisan way and gave a signal that Congress is prepared to act,” Ms. Pelosi said. “I think there are improvements that certainly need to be made.”A more aggressive legislative rescue effort for homeowners is expected to pick up steam next week in the House. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee, will hold hearings on a plan to provide up to $300 billion in federally guaranteed loans to help refinance the mortgages of as many as 1.5 million homeowners at risk of default.That proposal would require lenders and loan service companies to agree to cut the principal balances of troubled loans and take a loss, with the hope of avoiding further losses in a foreclosure. Senator Christopher J. Dodd had hoped to include a version of that proposal in the Senate package but said it was too complicated and would require separate legislation.Instead, the more modest Senate bill includes a new standard property tax deduction of up to $1,000 for couples and $500 for individuals that will benefit 28.3 million tax filers who do not itemize their deductions.The bill includes $10 billion in tax-exempt bonds for local housing agencies to refinance subprime loans and provide mortgages for first-time home buyers, $4 billion in grants for local governments to buy foreclosed properties and $100 million to expand counseling for homeowners at risk of defaulting on their loans.It would also give a $7,000 tax credit to buyers of foreclosed homes and a tax break for home builders and other businesses, allowing them to claim current losses against taxes paid in previous years. Officials said the proposals would cost taxpayers $15 billion to $20 billion.In the Senate, where a lawmaker’s bad mood can bring proceedings to a standstill, Mr. Durbin’s move to table his amendment drew high praise.“That is unheard-of in the Senate,” the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, declared. “He did that in an effort to move this along. He knew where the votes were, and I want the record to be read with the fact that this is a fine legislator, a good human being.”'"
"'08-04-04,'0','LONDON — British prosecutors laid out charges on Thursday at the trial of eight men accused of planning suicide attacks on trans-Atlantic airliners “in the name of Islam,” using explosives made of household liquids mixed into a deadly cocktail, as the planes flew from London to the United States and Canada.Peter Wright, the lead prosecutor, said the men had identified seven United Airlines, American Airlines and Air Canada flights leaving within 2 hours and 35 minutes for what were to have been coordinated attacks. The bombs were to have been made of hydrogen peroxide and other organic chemicals and smuggled onto the planes disguised as soft drinks.“These flights were particularly vulnerable to a coordinated attack upon them while in flight,” Mr. Wright told Woolwich Crown Court. “When the midflight explosions began, the authorities would be unable to prevent the other flights from meeting a similar fate as they would already be in midflight and carrying their deadly cargo.”The defendants might have contemplated attacking more flights, he said.His was the first detailed official account of the events in August 2006 that sounded widespread alarms as the British police descended on 21 suspects, and terrorism threat levels were raised. Senior British officials said then that the men had not been ready to strike immediately.But Mr. Wright said that they had been “almost ready to put their plot into practice.”“The disaster they contemplated was not long off,” he said in court on the first day of the trial, after the jury was sworn in Wednesday.The defendants in the trial, expected to last eight months, were identified by the police as Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 27, also known as Ahmed Ali Khan; Assad Sarwar, 27; Tanvir Hussain, 27; Mohammed Gulzar, 26; Ibrahim Savant, 27; Arafat Waheed Khan, 26; Waheed Zaman, 23; and Umar Islam, 29, also known as Brian Young. Mr. Sarwar was said to have lived in High Wycombe, west of London.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','“Antony and Cleopatra” is a big play to squeeze onto a small stage. The same could be said for most of Shakespeare, in theory, but the mythic title characters of this one may require even more theatrical space than most of their brothers and sisters in the tragic canon. And the play is as much a sweeping historical drama as it is the story of a passionate union brought to ruin. Antony and Cleopatra do not just make history as they make love — they embody it, in all its grandeur, its confusion and its folly.The Theater for a New Audience’s production of the play, which opened on Thursday, must scale down the story to fit a relatively small space (the Duke on 42nd Street, which has just 200 seats), with some uncomfortable results. I have probably seen many characters in Shakespeare plays resurrect themselves to make a necessary exit, but it seemed to trespass on the dignity of the great Antony’s death to watch him rise to his feet and quietly slink off, while his great rival, Octavius Caesar, held forth in the next scene.Exacerbating the problem, the performance takes place against a long wall of royal-blue sea and gold-tinted sky, designed by Alexander Dodge, that is certainly eye-catching and accommodating, allowing for brisk entrances and exits as doors in the glossy paneling slide smoothly open. But as the defining image of the production, this seascape is oddly pacific for a story of martial conflict and scorching sex in the ancient world.Actually, the ancient world has been banished. The production has been updated to “around 1884, when the term ‘the scramble for Africa’ was coined,” according to the program. (This play concludes the company’s season devoted to the connections between America, Africa and Europe.) The Romans are recast as the colonizing British, more or less, which saps a little more of the story’s legendary resonance. The Roman soldiers and officers look rather softened by the khaki uniforms, pith helmets and pretty sky-blue sashes across their chests.On the other hand, it is amusing and somehow appropriate to conceive of Octavius Caesar (the efficient Jeffrey Carlson, with unfortunate orange-blond hair) as an officious youngster, presumably just out of Oxford, taking over Daddy’s business with an air of petulant entitlement.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','NATO’s final statement invited Russia to cooperate with the United States and Europe on developing defenses jointly.Konstantin Kosachev, chairman of the international affairs committee of the Russian Parliament, said that missile defense would be high on the agenda for the meeting between Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin in Sochi, a Russian resort, scheduled after the NATO conference, which Mr. Putin is to attend Friday.Mr. Kosachev said Russia doubted Washington’s motives. “We still do not have a proper explanation of this project,” he said. “It is not about the number of interceptors. It’s about undermining mutual confidence and trust.”The main contributor to more troops in Afghanistan was France. President Nicolas Sarkozy said Paris would send another battalion — some 700 troops — to eastern Afghanistan, freeing up more American soldiers to deploy in support of Canadian forces in the south, where the fighting against the Taliban is heaviest.Mr. Sarkozy, in a joint press conference with the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, repeated that France intended to reintegrate fully into NATO once a separate European defense pillar became a reality. “Let Europe’s defense pole advance, and we will continue to advance toward NATO,” he said. “I repeat, these are two things that go together, not one or the other, so let’s wait for the summit” in 2009, he said.He praised Mr. Bush for comments “on the need for European defenses that would complement the alliance, which was, in my opinion, a historic turning point in U.S. policy,” Mr. Sarkozy said. “It was a gesture we have been waiting for, that has been noticed. It’s a gesture that shows understanding for what is happening in Europe.”A senior American official said Mr. Bush praised Mr. Sarkozy, too, saying his trip to the United States last fall had an impact “like the latest incarnation of Elvis.”Mr. Bush traveled to Ukraine on the eve of the summit meeting here and strongly endorsed its eventual membership. But the alliance decided not to offer Ukraine and Georgia entry into its Membership Action Plan, or MAP, a set of requirements and reforms necessary to achieving full alliance membership.It was a remarkable rejection of American policy in an alliance normally dominated by Washington, and it sent a confusing signal to Russia, one that some countries considered close to appeasement of Moscow.American officials focused on NATO’s agreement that the alliance’s foreign ministers would reconsider Ukraine and Georgia when they met again in December, before President Bush left office, though few Europeans expected a different result. The Europeans suggested that invitations to the MAP might come in a year, at the next summit meeting, to be jointly held by Germany and France, or in 2010.Mr. Hadley, the national security adviser, said that most of the former Communist states that had joined NATO after the collapse of the Soviet Union had supported the American position. He and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice emphasized NATO’s final statement declaring that Georgia and Ukraine would become members someday, as would any other aspiring democracy in Europe.German and British officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, criticized the Bush administration for not coming to grips soon enough with the Ukraine and Georgia problem. They suggested that Mr. Bush’s failure to try to work through the issue with Russia in advance created doubts among crucial allies like Germany and France, who also felt that Georgia’s leadership was unstable and that Ukraine, with a divided population and a new government, was not yet ready to enter the MAP.Boris I. Tarasyuk, a former Ukrainian foreign minister and close ally of President Viktor A. Yushchenko on NATO membership, said in an interview: “Moscow will be very satisfied with the outcome. But I’d like to say to them that this is not the end of the story. Sooner or later it will happen.”Georgia’s foreign minister, David Bakradze, said a “no” for Georgia would validate “those people in the Kremlin who think that by a policy of blackmail, by arrogance and aggression” they can influence NATO’s decisions.NATO did extend full invitations to join the alliance to two significant countries of the Western Balkans, Croatia and Albania. But in an embarrassment for NATO, which runs by consensus, Greece insisted on vetoing the membership invitation of tiny Macedonia. Athens insists that the country must have a name different from Greece’s northern province to avoid any sense of territorial claim and “instability,” objections that NATO officials regard as ludicrous.“This is a huge disappointment,” said the Macedonian government’s negotiator, Nikola Dimitrov. “It goes against the values that stand behind NATO. It’s very much against stability in the Balkans.”Mr. Bush, addressing his NATO colleagues, praised changes that Macedonia had put in place and said that the “name issue needs to be resolved quickly, so that Macedonia can be welcomed into NATO as soon as possible.”He did not mention Greece. Nor did Mr. Bush mention Ukraine and Georgia.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','Mr. Hu’s wife, Zeng Jinyan, herself a well-known blogger and rights advocate, was distraught in a telephone interview on Thursday.“I feel hopeless and helpless,” said Ms. Zeng, who is under house arrest with the couple’s infant daughter in their suburban Beijing apartment, though she was allowed to visit her husband on Thursday.Asked why Mr. Hu was arrested and convicted, she said: “The fundamental reason is to silence him. He had been speaking up and all he said was plain truth. It makes them unhappy. But they can do this to him because they’re unhappy?”Earlier this year, Ms. Rice raised Mr. Hu’s case during a meeting with China’s foreign minister, Yang Jiechi. The European Union presidency has also criticized the subversion charge and called for Mr. Hu’s release.Li Fangping, Mr. Hu’s lawyer, said the court showed leniency by sentencing him to less than the maximum five-year term. The sentence also forbids Mr. Hu to make any public political statements for one year after his release from prison, Mr. Li said.“Three and a half years is still unacceptable to us,” Mr. Li told a throng of reporters outside the courthouse. “There is a major disagreement between prosecutors and the defense over punishing someone for making peaceful speech. We still believe the charge does not stand.”Prosecutors in China rarely discuss cases after a verdict. But Xinhua, the country’s official news agency, reported that Mr. Hu had confessed to the charges. “Hu spread malicious rumors and committed libel in an attempt to subvert the state’s political power and socialist system,” the court verdict stated, according to Xinhua.In his human rights work, Mr. Hu has volunteered to help AIDS patients and plant trees to fight the encroachment of desert.He has maintained regular contacts with dissidents and other advocates on issues that include environmental protection and legal reform. He has also served as a one-man clearinghouse for information about peasant protests and dissidents.He was detained on Dec. 27 last year and later charged with “incitement to subvert state power,” an accusation based on six essays and interviews in which he criticized the Communist Party. He wrote a long, blistering essay detailing how the police had tortured two people who had protested the illegal seizure of their homes in Beijing. In that essay, he also criticized the party’s human rights record.Mr. Hu posted the essay on his personal blog at a delicate time: in advance of last fall’s 17th Party Congress, a major political meeting in which the new party leadership was announced.Last year, Mr. Hu was also a co-writer of an article that contended that the Communist Party had failed to fulfill its Olympic promises to improve human rights before the Beijing Games, though that article apparently was not included as evidence.Mr. Li said that Mr. Hu continued to maintain his innocence, though he had acknowledged outside the courtroom that some of his comments were “excessive” in the context of existing law.China’s subversion laws, like those for state secrets, are deliberately vague and grant prosecutors considerable leeway in determining subversive speech, although freedom of speech is included in the Constitution.Mr. Hu has 10 days to decide whether to appeal the verdict. His health is also an issue; he has hepatitis B and also takes medication for a deteriorating liver condition. Mr. Li said Mr. Hu had the option of applying for medical parole if he chose not to appeal.Meanwhile, Ms. Zeng, Mr. Hu’s wife, was anguished. “I’m very disappointed and very pained,” she said. “Yesterday, I thought he could be back home today.”'"
"'08-04-04,'0','BEIJING — Tibet will be reopened to tourists on May 1, a decision announced Thursday even as authorities showed no sign of lifting restrictions preventing foreign journalists from freely visiting Tibet and other Tibetan regions in western China to report on episodes of ethnic unrest.Meanwhile, Communist Party officials in Tibet plan trials this month for people arrested in the violence. Wang Xiangming, a deputy Communist Party secretary in Lhasa, the capital, said more than 1,200 people would be prosecuted, according to accounts in the Chinese and Hong Kong news media.Tibet has been closed to domestic and foreign tourists since March 16, two days after violent riots erupted in Lhasa.Zhanor, deputy director of Tibet’s tourism bureau, said organized tours and independent travelers could return to Tibet beginning in May, according to China Daily, the official English-language newspaper.Authorities in Lhasa attributed the tourism closing to safety concerns and property damage from the violence.On Thursday afternoon, Xiao Youcai, an official from Aba County, a Tibetan region in Sichuan Province, said the area had largely returned to normal after a March 16 protest. State media have reported the police in Aba fired on Tibetan protesters after they tried to storm a police station. Overseas Tibetan advocacy groups have asserted that up to 20 Tibetans were killed.'"
"'08-04-04,'0','“How do we guard against a future Bear Stearns,” asked Senator Charles E. Schumer. “Was someone asleep at the switch? It is a long road until our system of regulation catches up with our financial system.”When it comes to plying the corridor of money, legislation and power that links Wall Street to Washington, few senators are as adept as Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York.So it was appropriate that the two senators, who are among the top members of Congress receiving donations from Wall Street, were at the forefront of Thursday’s hearing, posing questions to panelists that included Mr. Bernanke, Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve, Christopher Cox, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Robert K. Steel, the Treasury under secretary for domestic finance.While Mr. Schumer has raised more money from Wall Street, Mr. Dodd has deeper ties to Bear Stearns. Since 1989, Mr. Dodd has received $350,000 in contributions from Bear Stearns, one of the highest of his total donors, and putting him among the top Congressional recipients of political contributions from the firm.During his brief run for the presidency, his most prominent supporter on Wall Street was Warren Spector, a former co-president at Bear Stearns.And in 2001, he wrote a letter to President Clinton in support of a pardon for Edward Downe Jr., a former Bear Stearns director who pleaded guilty in 1994 to insider trading.So it should not have been a surprise that Mr. Dodd addressed what has become a source of speculation on the part of the once-brash Bear Stearns executives still furious at the loss of their fortunes. Did Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, mandate a rock-bottom price for Bear?“What did you know and when did you know it,” Mr. Dodd asked, his voice loud as he pressed Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner for an answer.Mr. Steel and Mr. Geithner were artful and vague in their responses, but Mr. Steel did concede that “a lower price was appropriate” given the deployment of federal funds.“I happen to believe that this was the right decision,” Mr. Dodd said, addressing the government’s role. “The alternative could have been devastating. But were there alternatives?”He asked, for example, whether an earlier opening of the discount window would have given Bear the funds it needed to survive, a claim that has been made constantly by angry Bear executives over the last few weeks.Mr. Geithner was blunt in his response.“I would not have been comfortable lending to Bear at that time,” he said. “We only lend to sound institutions. Lending freely to Bear would not have been a prudent act.”For Mr. Schwartz, who had come to Washington on Wednesday for briefings with Mr. Bennett, the hearings could not have pleasant.Asked how things were going, his response was brief. “They are going,” he said, his voice strained.He was direct in laying the blame for Bear’s collapse on rumors and investors selling Bear’s stock short. “The rumors and speculation became a self-fulfilling prophecy,” he said.Mr. Schwartz’s comments were tinged with a regret that Bear did not survive. He mentioned, for the first time, that over the weekend when the deal was negotiated, Bear had a preliminary commitment from an equity investor for a higher price. But given the time constraints there was no time to strike a deal. So Bear turned to JPMorgan, which held all the cards. “We had no leverage over price,” Mr. Schwartz said.Mr. Dodd was sympathetic and expressed his concern for Bear Stearns employees who had seen their savings disappear. He mentioned that he and Mr. Schwartz had spoken before the crisis about the possibility of opening the discount window to investment banks and how that might have saved the firm.Contradicting comments made by Mr. Geithner, Mr. Schwartz said that the firm would have survived if it, along with other banks, could have had access to the Federal Reserve’s discount window. “It is my strong belief that if the window had been open to all banks we would not be in the situation we are in now,” he said.Mr. Dodd then addressed the stark increase in trading volume in the days before the deal.“It looked like it was more than fear,” Mr. Schwartz said. “It looked like people wanted to induce a panic. There are laws against manipulating the market.”Earlier, Mr. Dodd had harsh words for Mr. Cox and the S.E.C. on that subject. “This must have triggered bells and whistles,” he said. “Was there a reaction?”Mr. Cox, who has been criticized by various senators, had a muted response and told the committee to expect enforcement action soon.In the end, Mr. Schwartz kept his emotions in check and accepted broad responsibility. “The buck stops here,” he said. “And we and our shareholders paid the price.”'"

"'08-04-05,'0','Since 2003 NATO has led the international force in Afghanistan, which now totals 47,000, and NATO members have contributed soldiers and civilians to the American operation in Iraq, as well. Mr. Bush, however, suggested a broader, far more ambitious objective for the alliance.“NATO is no longer a static alliance focused on defending Europe from a Soviet tank invasion,” he said in Bucharest. “It is now an expeditionary alliance that is sending its forces across the world to help secure a future of freedom and peace for millions.” Mr. Bush visited Croatia on the eve of a trip to Russia, where NATO’s expansion has been greeted with suspicion and hostility, despite Mr. Bush’s repeated assurances that the Russians need not fear an alliance of democratic nations on its western borders.President Vladimir V. Putin, after meeting with NATO members in Bucharest on Friday, bluntly declared that an expansion that included Ukraine and Georgia, both former Soviet republics with deep historical links to Russia, would constitute a threat. NATO rebuffed pleas by Mr. Bush and some other NATO allies to extend a preliminary “membership action plan” to both countries, a significant step toward full membership. The refusal to do so has been seen by many as a result of Russia’s warnings.Bush administration officials said they hoped that the as the president meets with Mr. Putin this weekend, they would be able to reach agreement on a document that would outline areas where the countries could cooperate, mostly on security issues like nuclear weapons treaties. The alliance’s refusal of Ukraine and Georgia may have eased some of the tensions that threatened to sour the weekend meeting.The administration’s plans to locate parts of a missile defense system in Poland and the Czech Republic — another Bush priority endorsed by NATO on Thursday — remained the main obstacle to an agreement, two officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Mr. Bush’s stop in Croatia, less than a day in all, echoed one he made to Romania in 2002 after that country was invited to join NATO, though the public response was more subdued. He met with Croatia’s president and prime minister, as well as those of Albania and Macedonia. NATO did not invite Macedonia because of a Greek veto over the use of Macedonia’s name, which Greece says implies territorial ambitions on its region of the same name.Mr. Bush praised all three as deserving democracies that emerged from the Soviet bloc and survived strife and civil war, but even on a celebratory day, the lingering tensions of the Balkans were palpable.When President Bush called on NATO to open its doors not only to Macedonia but also to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro, the crowd gathered in the St. Mark’s Square cheered. When he said the same about Serbia, which Croatia fought from 1991 to 1995, the crowd remained silent as the translator finished his remarks.The response was also subdued when he evoked Croatia’s part in his expansive view of NATO’s global duty. Croatia opposed the war in Iraq, though it now has 50 military police officers deployed as part of NATO’s mission in Afghanistan.“It’s only a matter of time before freedom takes root across that troubled region,” he said, referring to Iraq and the Middle East. “And when it does, millions will remember the people of your nation stood with them in their hour of need.”'"

"'08-04-05,'0','Mr. Rudolph said his membership had grown to more than 45,000 — up nearly 40 percent from a few years ago — including diggers from previously gold-crazed states like Arizona, Colorado and California. In Alaska, tales of bigger nuggets — one to three ounces, sometimes larger — are drawing newcomers to the Yukon River and its tributaries in search of overnight riches.Mining shops say they cannot keep equipment on the shelves. “We had a lady in here on crutches, not a young lady either, saying, ‘I want to buy this $3,200 metal detector and a $1,000 power sluice,’ ” said Steve Herschbach, an owner of Alaska Mining and Diving, a supply shop in Anchorage. “We tried to talk her down a bit, but she was dead set.”Not all the action is in the water. Some prospectors have taken to scouring ore dumps— discarded piles of rock left by old-time miners — with high-tech metal detectors hoping to divine what previous generations missed. In Arizona, clubs head for dry creeks, sifting through the dirt where gold might have washed down in past floods.Perhaps nowhere is the rush more spirited than in California, home of the Sierra’s famed Mother Lode, where the discovery of gold in 1848 caused a national migration. Like their forebears, many of today’s prospectors have little more than a pan, a shovel and a dream.Unlike the original forty-niners, though, some of today’s caravans involve minivans, wetsuits and cellphones. And while many current prospectors say they hold out hopes of big scores, their clubs also act as social networks, where members exchange stories of the joys of sluicing and the unexplainable, often unattainable, thrill of shouting “Eureka!” at the sight of a nugget.“There’s nothing like finding gold,” said Pat Putnam, 57, who found a nickel-size chunk of ore a few years back. “It’s just an unbelievable feeling. Because you know you’re the first person to ever lay eyes on that.”Long the province of crusty hobbyists and bored retirees, prospecting has also recently drawn some younger converts, partly from their exposure to two prospecting shows on the Outdoor Channel.Not everyone, of course, is just in it for the fresh air. Rob Goreham, a miner and equipment salesman from Columbia, Calif., in the heart of the Mother Lode, says hundreds of full-time prospectors in California make a living at the often bone-chilling profession. How much of a living?“No one’s going to tell you that,” said Mr. Goreham, like the veteran gold man he is. “We do O.K., how about that?”The work is often backbreaking — and mind-numbing — but many call it a type of therapy.Mr. Zuspan, the American River prospector who is otherwise a truck driver, said he had joined the Delta Gold Diggers, in Stockton, Calif., in part to get over a divorce and his six-day workweek.Frank Hansen said he used the club’s outings to get over memories of working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. “I could go out to a mountain and do this, and as soon as I saw a little bit of that color in the pan, I could ignore the job, and that stress would dissolve,” Mr. Hansen said.Others fear a different type of stress. Past gold rushes caused hills to be denuded and rivers polluted, and the new rush has led to fears of a repeat. In 2007, the California Department of Fish and Game issued nearly 3,000 permits for dredging, even as it began to look into whether dredging was causing “adverse environmental effects” or harm to fish. A coalition of sport and tribal fishermen asked Monday for a two-year moratorium on dredging till the environmental impact could be determined.The one gold-digging law that hasn’t changed over the years is this: If you want to make money during a gold rush, don’t mine the hills. Mine the miners.The New 49ers Prospecting Club, in Happy Camp, Calif., charges members $2,500 each for lifetime access to claims on several rivers and tributaries in northernmost California. Dave McCracken, the club’s owner, says he expects gold-prospecting to bring about $5 million this summer into Siskiyou County, an economically depressed region.Jerry Keene, 73, the chief executive of Keene Engineering, a leading manufacturer of mining equipment, said, “Anything connected with gold, we’re just about out of.”Last month the company posted an apology on its Web site, saying a backload of orders had simply overwhelmed the staff.Mr. Keene likened the current rush to the last time gold prices spiked this high, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the spot price for an ounce hit $850. The current price is $913, after topping $1,000 last month.All of which can make some new prospectors a little wild-eyed. “Gold fever is a real thing, you know,” said Gary Hawley of the Gold Prospectors of the Rockies, a 140-member club in Denver. “They’ll go out with a pan and get some speck, and some people will get crazed by it. They’ll go from pan to sluice box to dredge. Before you know it, you can end up with $7,000, $8,000 worth of equipment and still no gold.”Wes Reese, 35, a stay-at-home dad who was panning recently with the Delta Diggers on the American, had no illusions of riches, but a big smile on his face.“You get to go out and play in the dirt and play in the water,” he said. “What else could you want?”'"
"'08-04-05,'0','With both Hamas and Hezbollah gaining strength on Israel’s borders and developing rockets with longer ranges, Sderot, its advocates say, is a bitter sample of what more prosperous and distant parts of Israel may face if the threat here is ignored. And to a growing number across the political spectrum, it has inspired a collective rescue operation.“In Tel Aviv, you have great cafes, nice clothes and you live an illusion as if everything is all right,” reflected Ilanit Swissa, a theater director and one of about a dozen liberal intellectuals setting up camp in Sderot who moved here a few months ago to work with high school actors. “But it is not true. Here I feel like I am contributing something. We are at war and you feel it here.”Surrounded by orange groves and wheat fields, guarded above by a military blimp that sets off an alert with each rocket launched from Gaza, Sderot has been a tough place to live. There have been days when more than 50 rockets have landed in or near the town, bringing panic, destruction and occasionally death to a town of 20,000 that is heavily populated with Israeli minority groups — Moroccans, refugees from Central Asia and Ethiopians. Panic is widespread. Businesses have closed. Three thousand residents have left.Residents have grown accustomed to — though hardly comfortable with — the constant sound of a townwide alert known as “Code Red,” produced when the blimp detects an incoming rocket. Once the alarm has gone off, there is 20 seconds to get to a shelter before the rocket hits. Given such a short warning, kindergartners are kept inside all day rather than risk their failing to move quickly.Hundreds of rockets are on grim display in the courtyard of the police station. The town itself, while typical of many its size in Israel, is now pockmarked with rocket holes and shelters and has developed a fierce black humor about its predicament, with sculptures made of rockets in a number of places.A sense of pride in Sderot’s gritty refusal to yield and an interest in finding ways to protect and enhance the town have spread rapidly. World WIZO, a Zionist women’s group, found that Sderot campaigns elicit visceral support from donors.“We printed T-shirts saying ‘Sderot Needs You.’ In one day, we raised $1 million,” said Helena Glaser, the group’s president, as she toured Sderot.The other day, David W. Lentz of Livingston, N.J. was pounding the pavement here with fellow Israel advocates, looking for ways their community could help.That same afternoon, a busload of Jewish fund-raisers were inspecting new care centers they had sponsored, passing some of the dozens of bomb shelters, some of them donated by evangelical Christians; a rabbi was going over plans for a $5 million seminary, financed mostly from abroad.For people who live and work here, all the attention, especially from wealthy outsiders, can seem overwhelming. Several said they were unable to get anything done.“It has gotten out of hand,” said Dror Marsha, the director of the local volunteer center. “It has become a trend — a good trend — but I can’t handle it. We have 1,000 volunteers a month now.” Two years ago, he said, the number was 200.Among the projects donated by evangelical groups are some of the nearly 80 small shelters and bus stops that double as shelters as well as a set of “resilience centers” to coordinate social services. Run by the Israel Trauma Coalition, a project of the UJA-Federation of New York, the resilience centers send social workers on house calls, provide training for single parents and offer workshops for the elderly and new immigrants.Apart from the donations and support from the outside, another big change in Sderot in the past year has been economic, and the surprising reason for that is the Israeli evacuation of Gaza. Until 2005, there was an industrial park just inside Gaza of companies jointly owned by Israelis and Palestinians. With the withdrawal, the companies relocated to Sderot and employed locals, bringing the city’s unemployment rate from a crushing 20 percent in the late 1990s to a near national low of 3.5 percent, according to Shalom Halevy, a municipal spokesman.Still, 30 percent of Sderot’s population show symptoms of stress, five times as many as in similar populations in Israel, according to studies carried out by Marc Gelkopf of Haifa University. Many families sleep in one room together for fear of missing an alarm.As much as Sderot is a symbol, it is also a kind of Rorschach test — a screen onto which various political factions project their hopes and fears. For the right, it is evidence that only force will stop the rockets; for the left it is evidence that force is not the answer and that the rockets cannot be stopped without a new approach.One attempt at a new approach involves a group in Sderot that has started holding discussions with Palestinians in Gaza via speakerphone. The group, Another Voice, is urging a cease-fire. There is also a new blog, a discussion between a resident of Sderot and one of Gaza, both anonymous.But for Rabbi David Fendel, who has run a 500-student yeshiva here for years, the rockets are proof that withdrawing Israeli settlers and soldiers from Gaza was foolish. He has raised millions of dollars to build a new yeshiva. The point of his project is to make a statement to those who wish Israel ill.“The Palestinians are trying to turn this into a ghost town,” he said as he stepped through the construction site of his school. “We’re not going to let them. We’re going to make it a dynamic center of Zionism, Torah and building.”The building here is a bit unusual — the new yeshiva study hall will have 1,500 tons of concrete in its ceiling as protection against the crude homemade rockets known as Qassams and other rockets that assault the city on a nearly daily basis from Gaza.Rabbi Fendel recognizes that there is plenty of work ahead. He is marrying off his eldest of seven children in the coming weeks. But even though his son and future daughter-in-law will live here at the yeshiva, the wedding will not be here because so many guests are afraid to come.Avi Farhan, who was a settler in the Sinai before it was returned to Egypt and then in Gaza before the Israelis withdrew, said he agreed with Rabbi Fendel that the withdrawal was a mistake. Standing on a bluff near his new apartment, he can see what remains of his former Gaza settlement, now a staging ground for rocket fire.“From my old house, they can now shell my new house,” he said ruefully.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','For the moment, no one has stepped forward to contradict her account, and there is no evidence that anything about the system was illegal or that any money was misspent. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has expressed confidence in her, calling her “the most honest person I know.”But Ms. Quinn’s defense hinges largely on her assertion that when she learned about the practice she immediately ordered it to cease, only to learn that her staff disobeyed her and carried it on for several more months.“There were meetings, there were oral conversations,” Ms. Quinn, a Manhattan Democrat, said Thursday. “There were many people in the numerous meetings with myself and the finance staff during the budget process, with many people in the room who can confirm that.”On Friday, however, when Ms. Quinn’s office was asked to produce some of the “many people” who could confirm it, only her chief of staff stepped forward, saying he had remembered her noting in one meeting that they would no longer use the reserve system.And numerous former and current City Council officials said Ms. Quinn had during her tenure taken an unusually active role in overseeing the budget, leaving them wondering how she could not have known or, if she had truly objected to the practice, authoritatively ended it.“It’s an off-line extra budget slush fund within the city’s budget, and it’s used at the discretion of the speaker,” said Dick Dadey, executive director of the Citizens Union, who joined Ms. Quinn to overhaul the lobbying rules and is now calling for all future Council appropriations to be monitored by an outside agency. “Given the speaker’s drive to create more transparency about the Council’s own budget and member items, it would have been appropriate to go public with this bad practice even if it did shine a bad light on the Council.”Indeed, the revelations have been particularly troubling for Ms. Quinn, consultants said, in part because she has made open government a mantra of her tenure as speaker.“She’s no Eliot Spitzer,” said Kellyanne Conway, a Republican political consultant, “but we have a very recent example in the governor’s precipitous fall from grace that the more you crusade as someone having a transparent budget, open to the public, governing according to ethics, then the higher those accountability standards will be.”Councilman Tony Avella, who has pushed for more disclosure in Council spending practices and is also planning a run for mayor, asked Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo in a letter sent Friday to investigate the practice.Ms. Quinn declined to comment on the matter Friday. Whether she will be able to survive and pursue higher office, analysts said, will depend on the results of the current investigations into Council finances by the United States attorney’s office and the City Department of Investigation. But already, she has suffered some damage.“It’s a lose-lose situation,” said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor at the Baruch College School of Public Affairs who once worked for the Council. “Either she knew what was going on and condoned it or she thought she had taken care of it but didn’t. If I’m running against her, I’m saying, she can’t keep track of her office, how can she keep track of a $60 billion budget?”Ms. Quinn, who worked for five years as chief of staff to Thomas K. Duane, a former councilman, before winning a Council seat in 1999, said she had been vaguely aware that money was put aside in some sort of reserve accounts before becoming speaker in January 2006. But she maintained that it was not until the spring of 2007, well into her second budget cycle as speaker, that she learned that money was being parked in reserve accounts known as holding codes.She said she made it clear in a series of budget meetings and conversations with her staff that the practice was to stop. But last fall, she said, she learned that not only was the practice continuing but that the money was being parked in accounts named for fictitious groups.On Friday, Ms. Quinn’s staff was pressed to produce people who were in the meetings and who could corroborate the speaker’s account. By late afternoon, however, only Charles Meara, the chief of staff, came forward, saying in a statement that he had “attended several meetings with Council Speaker Quinn, members of the City Council Finance Division and other senior staff regarding the city budget.”“At one of those meetings,” the statement continued, “I clearly recall Speaker Quinn stating that we will no longer use holding codes to keep reserve funds.”James McShane, Ms. Quinn’s communications director, said late Friday they could not provide other people to confirm the speaker’s account at this time.It would be inappropriate “to comment further on who attended the meetings,” he said, given the ongoing investigation.A person close to the speaker who said they were not authorized to speak about the matter, said Thursday that Ms. Quinn forced out two of her top finance staffers, Michael Keogh and Staci Emanuel, after the discovery of the problems.Attempts to reach Ms. Emanuel were unsuccessful, and Mr. Keogh, now with Bolton-St. Johns, a lobbying and consulting firm, has not responded to several requests for comment.But Norman Adler, president of Bolton-St. Johns, sharply denied accounts that Mr. Keogh was pushed out. He had been pressing Mr. Keogh to join his firm for a year and half, he said, but was told that he was committed to stay with Ms. Quinn through the end of the budget cycle, and then had some unrelated issues that prevented him from moving over sooner. Mr. Keogh submitted his resignation letter on Jan. 3 — about six months after the budget for the 2008 fiscal year was completed.“I aggressively recruited this guy,” Mr. Adler said. “He’s one of the most talented people in government.”Ms. Quinn has also stressed in her defense that the use of fictitious groups to hold money in reserve dates back to her predecessors, Peter F. Vallone Sr. and Gifford Miller, a claim that records and former staff members under those speakers confirmed.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — The standoff between Microsoft and Yahoo appears to be growing more tense.A meeting of senior executives from the companies this week to discuss Microsoft’s hostile takeover bid was icy from the start and ended with no progress, people briefed on it said.Microsoft and Yahoo both declined to comment.Microsoft remains steadfast in its refusal to raise its bid and is growing increasingly frustrated with Yahoo’s refusal to enter into negotiations, according to a person with direct knowledge of Microsoft’s thinking.“Microsoft has tried again and again to engage in substantive negotiations, but the board has simply refused,” the person said. “Since the offer was made, the market has deteriorated, and there are numerous indications that Yahoo’s business has declined.”The person noted that technology companies’ shares, including Google’s, were down significantly since Jan. 31, when Microsoft first made its offer for Yahoo, and that Yahoo’s market share in Web searching appeared to have slipped. Meanwhile, a presentation by Yahoo’s management to large shareholders last month appears to have failed to convince investors that Microsoft’s bid undervalues Yahoo, the person said.“All indications are that the market will continue to deteriorate,” the person said. “Microsoft will continue to evaluate its offer in that context.” The person said, however, that Microsoft was not considering lowering its offer or withdrawing it altogether.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','His critics plan to introduce amendments to weaken his authority, accusing him of selling out workers by negotiating back-room deals that sacrificed some gains for current union members, like health coverage for retirees.Mr. Stern is trying to frame his argument by saying that labor has two stark choices: “Just Us” unionism or “Justice for All” unionism.“Just Us ignores the fundamental mission of the union movement — to build a more just and humane society for all working people, not just a small exclusive club,” Mr. Stern said. “At a time when seven out of eight workers have no union, 11 out of 12 in the private sector, to be a voice just for the few who do is to abdicate our founding mission.”Anticipating that the next president will be a Democrat who will make it easier for unions to organize nonunion workers, Mr. Stern said, “I’m throwing down the gauntlet at this moment of opportunity because we have to push each other and say to the whole labor movement, ‘We all need to think about how do we get bigger to help the tens of millions of workers without unions.’ ”Last week, the service employees filed a report with the Labor Department saying it had 1.65 million members and represented another 207,000 workers who paid the equivalent of union dues.Mr. Stern’s leading critic, Sal Rosselli, president of the union’s giant health care local in California, accused Mr. Stern of making deals that were far too friendly to businesses.“He’s pushing for the corporatization of the S.E.I.U.,” Mr. Rosselli said. “He’s hijacking worker power to centralize it in D.C. What he’s saying is rhetoric; it’s not real.”Mr. Stern and other leaders of the service employees union have often pushed to have a nationwide bargaining team handle negotiations with large companies, a move that officials with the union’s locals sometimes say shortchanges local members. That nationwide bargaining team often puts more emphasis on striking deals that pave the way to organize more nonunion workers than rank-and-file members do.“Andy is consumed with the idea of growth,” said Jerome Brown, the retired president of the union’s health care local in Connecticut. “He’s decided that the traditional way to organize and represent workers doesn’t allow fast enough growth. He is experimenting with agreements with employers that allow workers to organize more easily. That’s a great idea, but the question is, What do you give up to get those agreements?”Mr. Stern said one message he would take to his union’s convention — and to all of organized labor — was that the bargaining power of union members would be undermined unless they did more to organize workers.He pointed to the nation’s truck drivers, saying that their after-inflation wages slipped when the percentage of drivers in unions slid from 60 percent in 1975 to less than 25 percent three decades later.“It simply is not possible for current members to pull up the ladder, barricade themselves in a fortress and continue to enjoy relatively high pay and benefits,” Mr. Stern said, while the majority of workers are nonunion and earn less.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','Senator John McCain said Friday that he would meet with officials next week to discuss receiving Secret Service protection, even though he has resisted it in the past.“I think that it’s important as we get more and more visibility, that we recognize the inevitable,” Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, told Chris Wallace in an interview that will be broadcast on “Fox News Sunday.” “And so we will be talking with them early to arrange for, very soon, some Secret Service protection.”He said he had resisted accepting such protection earlier because “it inhibits my ability to have close contact with people.”Mr. McCain, of Arizona, said in November that he would reject Secret Service protection if he won the Republican nomination and possibly even the White House. While he does use private security guards, he called the elaborate security procedures of the Secret Service an “inconvenience” and a “waste of taxpayers’ money.”Testifying before a House subcommittee on Thursday, Mark Sullivan, director of the Secret Service, said that Mr. McCain had not requested Secret Service protection and that he was not required have it. His Democratic rivals have long received such protection: Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York had it from her years as first lady, and Senator Barack Obama has had it since May 3, 2007.Mr. Sullivan said that even without protection for Mr. McCain, the 2008 presidential campaign was on track to be the most expensive in Secret Service history.With the help of a panel that includes Congressional leaders and based on a set of qualifications, the secretary of homeland security determines whether to grant a candidate’s request for protection.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','JACKSON, Miss. (AP) — Ray Smith Poole, a former Giants All-Pro end and a three-sport star at the University of Mississippi, died Wednesday. He was 86.The cause was cancer, university officials said.Poole played baseball and basketball at Ole Miss, where his football career was interrupted by three years of service with the Marines in World War II. After his pro career, he returned to Ole Miss as a football coach, working for the longtime coach Johnny Vaught.Poole’s brothers, Buster and Barney, were also star athletes at Ole Miss. The brothers and their descendants have accounted for 50 athletic letters, and a campus roadway is named for them.Ray Poole grew up in Gloster in southwestern Mississippi and earned 11 letters in his career at Ole Miss. He was a guard and center for the basketball team, leading the Rebels in scoring in 1943, and he was 5-2 as a pitcher in 1946.It was on the football field where he made his biggest impression.After his military service, he was captain of the football team in 1946. He was an all-Southeastern Conference selection and turned pro after being taken by the Giants in the 13th round of the 1944 N.F.L. draft. He played for the Giants from 1947-52 and the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League in 1953-54.He was an All-Pro in both leagues. He caught 83 passes for 1,164 yards in 71 N.F.L. games and finished with 223 career points, including 9 touchdowns, 27 field goals and 86 extra points.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','A gypsy-cab driver’s claim that two New York City police officers violated his constitutional rights by reporting him to immigration authorities was rejected on Friday by a federal jury in Manhattan.The cabdriver, Waheed Saleh of Yonkers, contended during a four-day trial in Federal District Court that a police officer in the Bronx had been harassing him by giving him tickets.When he filed a complaint against the officer with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, Mr. Saleh said, the officer and his supervisor retaliated by telling immigration authorities that he had overstayed his visa. The authorities then began deportation proceedings.Mr. Saleh argued that the officers, Sgt. Kishon Hickman, and his supervisor, Capt. Kevin Nicholson, had violated his First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances, and asked for unspecified damages. The jurors deliberated for about two hours before rejecting that claim. They found in favor of the city, which argued that far from harassing Mr. Saleh, the police were simply enforcing the law by giving him tickets for offenses like double-parking, disorderly conduct and driving an unlicensed taxi. “This case is about Mr. Saleh, a man who consistently violated the law — state, city and federal — and who was angry and frustrated at the police officers who enforced the law,” said Jennifer Amy Rossan, an assistant corporation counsel for New York City, in her closing argument earlier on Friday.Mr. Saleh’s lawyer, Tushar Sheth of the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund, said on Friday that despite the verdict he believed that the case had focused attention on what he said was a routine Police Department practice of reporting the names of noncitizens who have been arrested to immigration authorities.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','BAGHDAD — Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki sought to defuse recent tensions among Iraq’s Shiites on Friday by suspending raids by government forces on militias, less than 24 hours after he threatened further raids.In softening his tone, Mr. Maliki said in a statement that he was suspending raids “in order to give a chance to those who have repented and want to lay down their weapons.”On Thursday, Mr. Maliki said Basra was only the first stage of continuing operations to crack down on illegal militias and criminal gangs.At gatherings for Friday Prayer across the country, preachers loyal to the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr urged their followers to follow his instructions to march in Baghdad next week to protest the American presence in Iraq. He called for a march on Wednesday, the fifth anniversary of the day American forces captured the Iraqi capital.Addressing thousands of worshipers in Mr. Sadr’s eastern Baghdad stronghold, Sadr City, Sattar al-Battat, a Sadrist preacher, told the crowd, “We want the occupier to leave our land; we should walk in crowds, and we must fill in the ground in order to show our refusal to everyone who tries to destroy our holy land.”Sadr City was one of the places where fighting broke out between the Mahdi Army, a militia loyal to Mr. Sadr, and American forces last month, in the wake of battles between the militia and Iraqi forces in Basra.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','Never far behind is the question of their survival as freestanding institutions.The nation has 165 seminaries, but 39 percent of seminary students attend just 20 of them. The 20 large institutions, all but two evangelical Christian, raise substantial money, have big endowments or receive moderate to high denominational support — or do all three.In addition, nonsectarian theological and divinity schools that exist within a university also tend to be in good shape.But a majority of Protestant seminaries are smaller independents, and many, including Andover Newton, lack adequate endowments. The mainline churches that parented the older seminaries have sharply cut financial support.A result, said Daniel O. Aleshire, executive director of the National Association of Theological Schools, is that around 30 seminaries are in financial stress. In the future, Mr. Aleshire said, “There may be just two kinds of seminaries, those with substantial endowments or effective annual giving and the nonexistent.”While Andover Newton is not on the brink, Mr. Carter said, it and other seminaries needed to think about sharing costs and pooling resources. The Bangor Theological Seminary in Maine has begun to outsource information technology work here.“All of us,” Mr. Carter said, “have to find news ways to relate to and collaborate with each other as institutions or face the prospect that some will go out of business.”Driven by economics and a desire for innovation, Andover Newton shares its campus with Hebrew College, a rabbinic school. The arrangement saves on fixed costs, Mr. Carter said, and the interfaith discussions it has created has attracted new types of students, grants and donations. Other seminaries are similarly combining resources, Mr. Aleshire said.Mr. Carter’s question about the mission of theological education is sharpened here by the bicentennial. The nation’s first full-time graduate theological school, the Andover Theological Seminary was started by orthodox Calvinists who fled Harvard after it embraced Unitarianism. The school opened in 1808 at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass.Until then, ministerial training had been undergraduate, capped by parlor study under a pastor. Andover started three years’ graduate study of four subjects under a residential faculty: the Bible, church history, doctrinal theology and the practical arts of ministry.That model became the gold standard, although Andover Newton has long since changed it. Andover Seminary, a bastion of Christian evangelical and missionary zeal, moved here in 1931 to an early Baptist seminary campus, merging in 1965.Today, Andover Newton maintains ties to the United Church of Christ and the American Baptist churches and has 380 students from 35 denominations. One-fourth are Unitarian Universalists.Tuitions covers 40 percent of the $7 million annual budget. The rest is from fund-raising, the endowment and other sources, with a trickle coming from the denominations, Mr. Carter said.“We can’t turn out pastors for a church that no longer exists,” said Mr. Carter, an American Baptist minister. “Pastors have to be grounded in their own faith yet also have the ‘border crossing’ skills to be leaders in today’s religious landscape. Our survival depends on this more than anything.”He pointed out that when new ministers took their pulpits, “perhaps half the people they see in the pews didn’t grow up in that faith tradition.”Mr. Carter’s call to reinvent seminaries is hardly new.Theological education is adapting to declining denominational loyalty, changing ministries and a greater diversity of students, monitors of the field say.David Kelsey, a professor of theology at the Yale Divinity School, said, “I think Mr. Carter is right about the inadequacy of what seminarians learn to the real ground-level cultural, social, economic diversity, even pluralism of belief, in the congregations they serve.”Mr. Carter said seminaries might learn from business, adding: “Too many of us have long lists of problems, then put our best resources to work solving them. But if we would apply those same resources to our assets, our strengths, we would become stronger and in the long run be more able to solve our problems.”'"
"'08-04-05,'0','Stocks were little changed on Friday as fears about more bank losses and the biggest monthly decline in the job market in five years overshadowed earlier optimism that the credit crisis might be easing.The Nasdaq, however, edged higher, capping its best week since August 2006, helped by a 3.5 percent rise in Google as investors saw value in its shares after a 32 percent sell-off since the beginning of the year.Fears about further weakness among banks and brokerage firms lingered. Bank of America sharply cut its earnings view on Merrill Lynch, while JPMorgan Chase cut its annual earnings estimate for Bank of America, largely on expectations of more write-downs.Government data damped investor enthusiasm, showing a third month of nonfarm job losses and the highest unemployment rate in two and a half years. That provided further evidence that a housing downturn and credit crisis may have pushed the economy into recession.“Investors are processing the fact that the economic data is confirming what everybody believes, which is that we’re in a recession,” said Frederic Dickson, senior vice president and market strategist for D. A. Davidson & Company in Lake Oswego, Ore. “There’s real anxiety about the earnings picture.”'"

"'08-04-05,'0','LOS ANGELES — For all of the reality programming on television today, few shows actually encourage viewers — particularly children — to get up and do something real.That is part of the inspiration for “Dance on Sunset,” a new dance and variety show on Nickelodeon that is in many ways a throwback to “American Bandstand,” “Soul Train” and other participatory programs.“What was fun for all of us watching those shows,” said Marjorie Cohn, an executive vice president for development and original programming at Nickelodeon, “was the act of learning how to dance, and picking out a particular person in the show and following her and saying ‘I can do that too.’ ”That is exactly what viewers of “Dance on Sunset,” which had its premiere last Saturday and is now being shown on Sundays at 8:30 p.m. Eastern and Pacific times, are encouraged to do. In addition to dance contests involving the studio audience, the show’s choreographer, Tony Testa, teaches simple sequences in a segment called “Fresh Squeezed Dance.”If viewers master those steps, they can go to the show’s Web site — danceonsunset.com — for more advanced moves. Fans can also upload their own videos to the site, a feature that has helped to speed the audience growth for the recently introduced Nickelodeon hit “iCarly.”Mr. Testa, who is all of 21, started dancing professionally after he managed to get a home video of his choreography to Janet Jackson, for whom he soon went to work. He has also danced with Beyoncé Knowles in the film “Dreamgirls” and with Britney Spears at the MTV Video Music Awards.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','I wasn’t in a rush to find out, but now that question is looming in a new way. My husband — who has been working part time since January — is now contemplating going back to work full time.His stint as stay-at-home dad was always meant to be temporary, so I have been amazed by my own confused reaction.When we first discussed the idea, I was so thrilled, I was practically ready to pack his lunch and drive him to the commuter train. We’d have two incomes! Like normal people!Granted, we live in a rural county where there is no commuter train and the median salary is about $9,000 less than the national median of $48,000. We would hardly be rich.But having lived on my income this long (knock on wood), we could afford to save nearly all of his, as a cushion for the present and a big boost for our retirement.Mind you, the job was purely theoretical and there I was dividing up the paychecks. Isn’t it remarkable how money can steal center stage and make you forget what’s in the wings?A day or so later, I was knocked sideways by second thoughts. It was true that I had never worn the mantle of breadwinner with much grace or confidence. Angst and hand-wringing had been my specialty. If my husband went back to work full time, it would alleviate a lot of financial anxiety.But at what price?We would have to find full-time day care for our son. That not only would mean an extra $1,000 a month — but I wouldn’t see the little guy at lunch or when he visited my home office to see mama “tippin” on her computer. If my husband was gone all day we would probably need a second car. And how would we divide the buying of groceries, doing the laundry, cleaning the bathroom, running to the hardware store and a thousand other chores?THERE were many times in the last year and a half when I knew how lucky we were. Despite the financial strain, now it seemed crazy to give up the balance we had managed to find — simply to have more money.Of course, when I brought all this up to my husband, he pointed out that we could defer his job decision for another year, maybe, but that it was inevitable that his career hiatus would have to come to an end.In all my musings about the difference between the lives of male and female breadwinners, this is one I hadn’t considered. There are many women who are willing to run their homes, open-ended. I have not been able to find any research on this topic, but I suspect most men view the position as a stopover.Even if we were millionaires, my husband would want to resume his life. We are most assuredly not, so a large part of his salary will have go toward paying for the various ways our lives will have to be rebalanced when he does start working. I’d like to say I know that this shift will be worth it in the end.'"
"'08-04-05,'0','Many microlending advocates, including Mr. Yunus, say that success is threatened by Mr. Danel and Mr. Labarthe’s market-oriented model, with its emphasis on investor returns.“Microfinance started in the 1970s with a focus on using this breakthrough to help end poverty,” said Sam Daley-Harris, director of the Microcredit Summit Campaign, a nonprofit endeavor that promotes microfinance for families earning less than $1 a day. “Now it is in great danger of being how well the investors and the microfinance institutions are doing and not about ending poverty.” He said the situation posed the danger of “mission drift.”Mr. Danel and Mr. Labarthe say microfinance will help more poor people by tapping the boundless pool of investor capital rather than the limited pool of donor money.“It’s marvelous to have one creditor but it’s marvelous to have one million creditors,” Mr. Labarthe said, “and that’s where we really start to change the face of opportunity.”Compartamos (“let’s share” in Spanish) expects to reach one million borrowers this year. Its profits are healthy, some $80 million last year, and its portfolio has grown to almost $400 million. Since it went public nearly a year ago, return on equity has been more than 40 percent.Both sides agree that there is a need for capital, too great to be met by the donor groups that initially financed microlending. Deutsche Bank estimates the global demand for microfinance loans at about $250 billion, 10 times the amount that has been lent.But Compartamos’s decision to go public last April became a flashpoint in what had been a genteel debate over how microfinance could tap into the financial markets’ vast resources. The initial public offering gets special mention at every microfinance conference, and has been condemned by Mr. Yunus, the Nobel laureate.Alex Counts, president of the Washington-based Grameen Foundation, said Compartamos’s poor clients “were generating the profits but they were excluded from them.”Lynne Patterson, a founder of Pro Mujer, a nonprofit microfinance group with branches in several Latin American countries, agrees. “We use the profit to reinvest in the service of the clients,” she said, referring to loan repayment profits.Since lack of access to credit is just one of the problems the poor face, Pro Mujer also offers services like breast cancer screenings, advice on dealing with domestic violence and financial education.Still, in three decades microfinance has evolved — from small nongovernmental organizations lending $50 to women to buy sewing machines or fruit to sell at market to, in some cases, formal banks that cover costs and grow through profits, like any business.On Wall Street, investment banks package microfinance loans to sell to institutional investors, many of them “socially responsible” and looking for steady returns rather than trading profits. A few equity funds have even taken stakes in microfinance institutions.Critics say that Compartamos manages its business to benefit its investors, not its borrowers. The bank began as a nongovernmental organization in 1990, started by a Catholic social action group called Gente Nueva, whose inspiration was a visit by Mother Teresa to Mexico.After Compartamos became a for-profit company in 2000, costs fell as efficiencies increased, but the bank kept interest rates high. On average, customers pay an annual interest rate of almost 90 percent, which includes 15 percent in government tax. In much of the world, microfinance interest rates range from 25 to 45 percent. But in Mexico, high costs, inefficiency and limited competition keep interest rates much higher. Compartamos’s rates are only a few percentage points higher than Pro Mujer’s, for example.Like microfinance businesses around the world, Compartamos makes loans without collateral. Its borrowers, who are nearly all women, are organized in groups, which guarantee the loans. Stop paying and your friends must pay for you: the system keeps default rates down.Historically, microlenders point out, such borrowers are excellent risks. For instance, Compartamos’s nonperforming loans were just 1.36 percent of its portfolio at the end of last year.Servicing those loans takes labor and that pushes up rates on such small amounts. A Compartamos collection agent visits each group every week, riding public buses out to villages.Compartamos is more efficient than other Mexican microfinance institutions and its own borrowing costs are lower, thanks to its strong credit rating. Critics charge that it has not passed those savings on to its customers.The numbers seem to bear that out. A study last year by the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, known as CGAP, a microfinance industry group based at the World Bank, estimated that 23.6 percent of Compartamos’s interest income went to profits. Its return on average equity is more than triple the 15 percent average for Mexican commercial banks.Profit is not a dirty word in the microfinance world. The question is how much is appropriate. CGAP estimates the average return on assets for self-sufficient organizations to be 5.5 percent. The figure for Compartamos was 19.6 percent in the fourth quarter.Mr. Danel said Compartamos’s interest rates have fallen 30 percentage points over the last five years. “They go down based on efficiencies, and we pass this benefit on to the customer,” he said.Compartamos grew to 840,000 customers last year, from 60,000 in 2000.Last April, Compartamos’ owners sold 30 percent of their stock on the Mexican stock market in an initial public offering. The public offering brought in $458 million. Private Mexican investors, including the bank’s top executives, pocketed $150 million from the sale. More than half of the public offering proceeds went back to development institutions that had invested in Compartamos when it moved from being a nonprofit to a commercial venture in 2000.One of them was Acción International, a Boston-based nongovernmental organization that helps build microcredit institutions and provides them with technical assistance. Acción invested $1 million in Compartamos in 2000. It sold half its 18 percent stake at the time of the public offering for $135 million.“This is one strategy to address poverty that doesn’t remain small and beautiful,” said María Otero, president of Acción.Charles Waterfield, a microfinance consultant who has been among the most vocal critics of Compartamos’s model, disagrees. “Not only are they making obscene profits off poor people, they are in danger of tarnishing the rest of the industry,” he said. “Compartamos is the first but they won’t be the last.”There has not been a rush to market yet. In part, the subprime mortgage debacle and the ensuing selloff on global markets has made this a poor time for initial public offerings. Compartamos has not escaped the turmoil; its stock price is up nearly 17 percent since the offering, but down 32 percent from its high last July.Those who argue for more such public offerings say that Compartamos set the right example.“Boy, you got a lot of people’s attention with that I.P.O.,” said Bob Pattillo, who runs Gray Ghost, a fund that invests in microfinance. “This has got Wall Street’s eye, London’s eye, Geneva’s eye — to have one out there to say that if all the dots got connected this can be quite profitable.”Mr. Danel and Mr. Labarthe argue that successful microlenders in a middle-income country like Mexico should use the capital markets, instead of crowding out donations.As part of their defense, they argue that Compartamos’s success has prompted a number of institutions, including traditional banks and retailers, to start offering financial products to the poor. “We don’t only see ourselves as a specialist in microfinance but also as the builder of an industry,” Mr. Danel said.Compartamos estimates that its target market is 14 million households, more than half of the country’s population, most of them with little or no access to banking services.At the recent weekly meeting of a group of Compartamos borrowers in the village of Valle de Vázquez, the interest rate was not a great concern. Indeed, several women said they had left another microfinance institution because it charged more.The group was well established, 35 strong and well into its third year of borrowing. The meeting, which took place in the living room of one borrower’s home, was the start of a new four-month borrowing cycle.A Compartamos manager, Claudia Ayala, began with a pep talk, pointing to a house plant set on a chair beside her. “This plant grows and this group can grow,” she said to the women, who were listless in the afternoon heat. “How? By inviting more compañeras,” or friends. “By fertilizing it with responsibility,” she said.Though the village depends largely on remittances sent by relatives in the United States, the Compartamos loans have helped some women become self-sufficient.Silvina Martínez started a little restaurant in her house a year ago to sell her homemade snacks to students at a nearby high school. It has grown steadily since then. With this cycle, she was going to borrow about $1,100 to paint the restaurant and expand her menu. “It’s my own business,” she said. “You are a slave to it, but at least it’s mine.”Other women were successful entrepreneurs to start with, but the Compartamos credit gives them a push, allowing them to hire an employee or help ease their cash flow.Alejandra Abúndez, 57, keeps pigs and cattle, and produces 330 pounds of cheese a day, which she sells in the local market. She and her daughter, Micaela Rivera, were borrowing $3,550 from Compartamos to buy animal feed and to stock the tiny store in her front entryway.“Everything I have, I invest,” said Ms. Abúndez, who was left a widow with five children at 35. “No gadding about for me.”'"
"'08-04-06,'0','The McCain and Obama campaigns sparred over the weekend after Ed Schultz, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host deeply critical of the Bush administration, called Mr. McCain a “warmonger” at an Obama event in North Dakota. Amid Republican protests, an Obama spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, issued a statement that distanced the senator from the “warmonger” characterization without abandoning the critical tone.Mr. McCain has been an unapologetic defender of the so-called surge strategy of President Bush in Iraq. But his campaign says that Mr. McCain’s comment months ago that an American presence there even for 100 years would “be fine with me as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or killed” has been irresponsibly twisted. Mr. Obama, who favors a gradual withdrawal of most American combat troops, had at first suggested that Mr. McCain was talking approvingly of a 100-year war.Mr. Obama and other Democrats have since backed away from that assertion, but now argue that even a prolonged American presence in Iraq is ill-advised. “We do not belong as an occupying power in that part of the world,” Senator Jim Webb, Democrat of Virginia, said Sunday on ABC.A key McCain supporter, Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, defended the Arizona senator’s Iraq position. “John wants a winning outcome in Iraq,” he said on ABC. Mr. Graham accompanied Mr. McCain on his latest Iraq visit, which ended shortly before the Iraqi government’s recent operation in Basra.Mr. McCain acknowledged on Fox that the Iraqi operation in Basra surprised him, but said the Bush administration itself had little notice.“Now, obviously, the results were mixed; obviously, there were problems,” he said. But Mr. McCain said Iraqi government forces had performed surprisingly well over all.“There were many, many thousands who are fighting there,” he said. “Compare that with two years ago when the army was basically unable to function in any way effectively.”Mr. Dean, appearing on ABC, defended the Democratic candidates’ right to stay in the race “as long as they think they can win,” but urged superdelegates to make their preferences known soon.More than 400 of the nearly 800 superdelegates mostly elected party and government officials have already done so. “If the other 340 would say who they’re going to be for, then we’d be all set,” Mr. Dean said.He wants the party to pick a candidate by July 1; Mrs. Clinton has vowed to fight on to the convention, if necessary.A prominent Clinton supporter, Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania, was asked on the NBC News program “Meet the Press” whether the Clinton camp would “deny” Mr. Obama the nomination if he was leading in delegates and the popular vote after the last primaries, on June 3.Mr. Rendell said the superdelegates would look to see who was running better in the polls against Mr. McCain, especially in the big states. If Mrs. Clinton is running stronger in late June, he said, “then I think the superdelegates have to look long and hard at making her the nominee.”If she wins Pennsylvania, which votes April 22, she’ll have “an insurmountable lead among states with electoral votes,” he said.But Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, an Obama supporter, said on NBC that electoral votes were completely irrelevant in a primary. He said that an attempt to deny Mr. Obama the nomination was “a real concern” but he did not think it likely that the superdelegates would go against the decision of the delegates.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','Mr. Obama did not refer to Mr. Schultz’s remarks in a speech he delivered Saturday morning to an overflow crowd, estimated at 8,000, at the University of Montana basketball arena in Missoula. But a spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, issued a statement that distanced him from them while reiterating Democratic criticisms of Mr. McCain’s stand on the war in the Iraq.“John McCain is not a warmonger and should not be described as such,” Ms. Psaki said. “He’s a supporter of a war that Senator Obama believes should have never been authorized and never been waged.”This is not the first time an overenthusiastic radio host has created a controversy in remarks meant to support a candidate. At a McCain rally in Cincinnati in February, the conservative talk show host Bill Cunningham repeatedly used Mr. Obama’s middle name, Hussein; made disparaging references to him; and urged the national press, which he said was soft on Mr. Obama, to “peel the bark off” him.As his position as the Democratic front-runner solidifies, Mr. Obama has increased his attacks on Mr. McCain’s views and policies. But he frequently tempers those criticisms, as he did on Friday in Indiana and North Dakota and on Saturday in Montana by calling Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, “a genuine war hero who deserves our respect” and making clear that the differences between the two men are political, not personal.The Republican primary was “nothing more than a contest to see who was best qualified to run for George Bush’s third term,” Mr. Obama said in a speech to the North Dakota Democrats on Friday evening. “John McCain won that contest, and now he’s offering four more years of the very same policies that failed us for the last eight.”“We can’t afford to give John McCain the chance to carry on George Bush’s can’t-do, won’t-do, won’t-even-try style of politics,” he said. “We are a better country than that.”As Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain were jousting, the campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, Mr. Obama’s rival for the Democratic nomination, was dealing with fallout from reports that Mark Penn, a public relations executive who is also Mrs. Clinton’s pollster and chief strategist, had agreed to represent the government of Colombia in its effort to win Congressional approval of a free trade agreement with the United States.Mr. Penn met with the Colombian ambassador in Washington on Monday to discuss strategy to overcome resistance among many unions and Democrats in Congress to such a treaty.Mrs. Clinton has opposed the accord, as has Mr. Obama.On Saturday, after Mr. Penn issued a statement saying he had made “an error in judgment” by meeting with Colombian officials, the government there fired him and his firm, Burson-Marsteller. It said his action was “unacceptable” because it showed a “lack of respect to Colombians.”Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton, were scheduled to cross paths Saturday night in Butte, at a Montana Democratic Party dinner. Montana will send 24 delegates to the Democratic convention and is one of the last states to hold a primary with the vote, open to voters of all paries, scheduled for June 3.The flap over Mr. Schultz’s remarks came on a day when Mr. McCain, of Arizona, himself was emphasizing tolerance and comity among Americans, including those who are political rivals. But even as he spoke in front of a giant American flag in Prescott, a handful of protesters yelled “Out of Iraq.”“We deserve more than tolerance from one another, we deserve each other’s respect, whether we think each other right or wrong in our views,” Mr. McCain said. He added: “Let us remember, we are not enemies. We are compatriots defending ourselves from a real enemy. We have nothing to fear from each other.”As an example of tolerance, Mr. McCain cited Barry Goldwater and Morris K. Udall, who were the deans of Arizona politics when he began his public life in the state over a quarter of a century ago.Mr. Udall was a liberal Democrat and Mr. Goldwater the father of modern Republican conservatism, but the two men managed to retain a friendly relationship and, as Mr. McCain noted, were both generous in teaching him about Arizona and politics.“Their example showed us how to be better Americans, better people,” he said. “I intend to wage this campaign and govern this country in a way that they would be proud of me as I have always been proud of them.”'"
"'08-04-06,'0','Microsoft warned the board of Yahoo on Saturday that if a merger agreement was not completed in the next three weeks, Microsoft would make its offer directly to Yahoo shareholders, probably at a lower price.The warning was made by Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, in a letter sent by e-mail. It expressed dismay at Yahoo’s refusal to enter into formal negotiations over Microsoft’s Jan. 31 takeover bid and warned that without an agreement by the deadline, Microsoft would seek to oust Yahoo’s board.“If we have not concluded an agreement within the next three weeks, we will be compelled to take our case directly to your shareholders, including the initiation of a proxy contest to elect an alternative slate of directors for the Yahoo board,” Mr. Ballmer wrote. “If we are forced to take an offer directly to your shareholders, that action will have an undesirable impact on the value of your company from our perspective, which will be reflected in the terms of our proposal.”Microsoft’s offer, in cash and stock, was initially valued at $44.6 billion, or $31 a share. After a decline in Microsoft’s shares, it is now worth about $42 billion.Yahoo’s board formally rejected Microsoft’s offer, saying it “substantially undervalues” Yahoo. Microsoft described the offer, at a 62 percent premium over Yahoo’s closing price on Jan. 31, as generous and has been steadfast in its refusal to raise it.Mr. Ballmer also noted that in the two months since the company made its offer, the overall stock market has deteriorated and Yahoo’s business has appeared to weaken.'"

"'08-04-06,'0','While Jimmy McCain’s service is a story all his own — he enlisted at age 17 — it illuminates the beliefs about duty, honor and sacrifice with which family friends say he was raised. Military ideals have defined Mr. McCain as a person and a politician, and he is placing them at the core of his presidential candidacy. Last week, he campaigned at his former stations of duty, explaining how the lessons he learned there would guide his decisions as commander in chief.“If I had ignored some of the less important conventions of the Academy,” as a demerit-prone midshipman, Mr. McCain said Wednesday at the United States Naval Academy, “I was careful not to defame its more compelling traditions: the veneration of courage and resilience; the honor code that simply assumed your fidelity to its principles; the homage paid to Americans who had sacrificed greatly for our country; the expectation that you, too, would prove worthy of your country’s trust.”With both potential Democratic nominees in favor of withdrawal from Iraq, debate about the war — whether it is winnable, what would happen if the United States withdrew, how much loss the country can endure — is likely to be a dominant issue in the general election. Mr. McCain’s potential opponents are already implying that he is too willing to risk American lives, too committed to stretching an already unpopular war far into the future.Out of the Public EyeMr. McCain has largely maintained a code of silence about his son, now a lance corporal, making only fleeting references to him in public both to protect him from becoming a prize target and avoid exploiting his service for political gain, according to friends. At the few campaign events where Lance Corporal McCain appeared last year, he was not introduced.The McCains declined to be interviewed for this article, which the campaign requested not be published. “The McCain campaign objects strongly to this intrusion into the privacy of Senator McCain’s son,” Steve Schmidt, a campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “The children of presidential candidates in this election cycle should be afforded the same respect for their privacy that the children of President Bush and President and Senator Clinton have been afforded.” (To protect Lance Corporal McCain in case he is again deployed to a war zone, The New York Times is not publishing recent photographs of him and has withheld some details of his service).Born in 1988, the third of John and Cindy McCain’s children, Jimmy inherited his father’s features and slight build, outrageous humor and family tradition of military service that stretches back to the Revolutionary War. His grandfather and great-grandfather were the first parent and son to achieve four-star admiral status in Naval history.Then there was his father’s ever-growing legend. A hell-raising Navy pilot, John McCain relied on a defiant streak to survive nearly six brutal years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam. As Jimmy grew up, his father, first a congressman and then a senator, was always dashing off to speak at military events — a dedication here, a graduation there. Mr. McCain’s reputation was burnished with his memoir, “Faith of My Fathers,” and its adaptation into a television movie.Two of Jimmy’s three older brothers went into the military. Doug McCain, 48, was a Navy pilot. Jack McCain, 21, is to graduate from the Naval Academy next year, raising the chances that his father, if elected, could become the first president since Dwight D. Eisenhower with a son at war.The McCain children were not force-fed tales of their father’s bravery, said Orson Swindle, who was imprisoned in Vietnam with Mr. McCain. But “if you’re a man in the public eye, it’s hard for them not to know about it,” Mr. Swindle said in an interview.By the time Jimmy was in high school, he was scouting war memorabilia on eBay and playing video games like “Battlefield 1942,” classmates said. He chose sports that simulated combat, like fencing and paintball, and his prized possession was a World War II Army hat.At Culver Academy, a military-style boarding school in Indiana, he and his friend Nick Moore would fire up “Apocalypse Now” or “Platoon” on a laptop — critiques of war, but never mind — turn the sound down and talk about serving. “The testosterone was flying,” Mr. Moore said in an interview. “He’d say, ‘I’m just going to go in there guns blazing!’ ”Jimmy wanted to attend the Naval Academy, he told Mr. Moore, and then learn to fly. But how he would get there was uncertain. In interviews, classmates and teachers described him as the kind of kid who contributed impressive thoughts to classroom discussions but did not always turn in assignments, who was always collecting demerits for minor offenses like smoking — descriptions that echo those of his father at the same age. He left Culver after his sophomore year, making it the second school he passed through in two years.Sometime in the next year, Jimmy enlisted in the Marine Corps. He only called his parents to tell them afterward, according to Lance Cpl. Casey Gardiner, a friend from boot camp. Iraq was tilting toward civil war, with blasts of improvised explosive devices at their highest levels yet. Jimmy McCain was 17, so young that Cindy McCain had to sign consent forms for his medical tests before he could report for duty, according to Gunnery Sgt. Edward Carter, a recruiter in Phoenix who handed her the papers.By enlisting in the Marines, Jimmy seemed to be giving up his birthright. The Navy is, by reputation, the most aristocratic of the armed forces, the McCains among its most storied families. Now he would hold the lowest rank in a branch known for its grittiness. “The first time I heard he was going to be in the company, I couldn’t believe it,” said First Lt. Sam Bowlby, one of Lance Corporal McCain’s officers in Iraq.“He didn’t want to be in the shadow of his father,” Lance Corporal Gardiner said.But the new marine was fulfilling his father’s legacy in at least one way. John McCain had become a hero not for the missions he had flown or the men he had led, but for the privileges he had refused and the hardships he had endured. The North Vietnamese wanted to free Mr. McCain ahead of other captives because he was the son of a Navy admiral and Pacific commander. Mr. McCain refused. Now his son was carving a humble new path that the father, academy-bound since birth, never had.Jimmy began boot camp on Sept. 11, 2006. He took extra abuse for his last name, said Lance Cpl. Gregory Aalto, a member of his training platoon. Recruits are not even allowed their own eyeglasses, so Jimmy had to wear the standard-issue Marine ones, so unappealing they are known as “birth-control goggles.”As he completed his training and prepared for deployment, other marines caught only occasional glimpses of his family’s celebrity and wealth, such as when he handed out extra tickets for a Floyd Mayweather Jr.-Oscar De La Hoya boxing match he was attending with his father in Las Vegas. If anyone asked about his family, he had a sarcastic joke at the ready. When a cluster of marines asked how they could help his father’s campaign, Lance Corporal McCain pretended to call him and then passed on a message: they could carry out the contracts the senator had taken out on his rivals’ lives.“Jimmy was just completely joking,” said Lance Cpl. Johnathan Pebley. “You can kind of tell he doesn’t want to talk about it.”In July, days from deployment, Lance Corporal McCain, newly engaged to be married, joined his father’s struggling campaign in New Hampshire. He visited the Flanagans and sat unrecognized at campaign events.At the last stop, a veteran asked for a round of applause for the candidate’s brave Marine son. He did not seem to know that Jimmy McCain was sitting just a few seats away. Almost no one did.Mr. McCain did not speak publicly about whatever anxiety he may have felt about his son’s deployment, but Mr. Swindle described the experience as difficult. “Anybody who tells you it’s not tough is not being straightforward with you,” he said.Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, whose son served two tours in Iraq, said he and Mr. McCain privately traded their concerns. “We talked about how it affects the young men over there,” Mr. Bond said. “He’s basically a father, very anxious about what his son’s going to be doing.”Representative Duncan Hunter, Republican of California, a former presidential contender whose son was serving in Afghanistan, said he and Mr. McCain would update each other at debates. “He knows what his father and grandfather went through as his sons went off to war,” Mr. Hunter said. “So he’s got a model to follow.”Indeed, John McCain’s own parents were dressing for a dinner party in London when they learned he had been shot down. They went anyway, never telling other guests. Later, Admiral McCain ordered air strikes on Hanoi, where he knew his son was imprisoned.Just before Jimmy’s departure, Mrs. McCain decided she had to see him one final time, according to Lieutenant Bowlby. With a few well-placed phone calls, she won permission to visit the Air Force base from which his unit would depart. When Lance Corporal McCain found out, he protested. No special favors, he said. Mrs. McCain stayed away.“God forbid someone gave him something the rest of the marines weren’t entitled to,” Lieutenant Bowlby said.Lance Corporal McCain and his fellow riflemen had trained for the worst in the spring of 2007, using paintball guns rigged as M-16s to apprehend costume-clad “insurgents” in fake Iraqi villages.In the real Iraq, they saw little combat. “We were expecting to get shot at all the time,” said Lance Cpl. Justin Murdock, 20. “But 95 percent of the time, nothing was going on.”The marines were stationed in Anbar Province, where some of the war’s bloodiest battles had been fought. But the fighting had moved on to other areas, and Lance Corporal McCain’s company mostly did security work, which meant keeping an unceasing eye on the locals, poor Sunnis who grew rice and other crops on small plots.Lance Corporal McCain’s unit performed “soft knocks” — visits to Iraqi homes intended as reassurance as well as surveillance, said Lance Cpl. Jason Case. His platoon hunted for weapons caches and I.E.D.’s, but also distributed school supplies and candy. Relying on interpreters and the bits of Arabic they all seemed to pick up, the 19- and 20-year-old grunts taught Iraqi police officers how to hold and clean weapons, search vehicles and conduct patrols.The hardest part, said several marines, was enduring tedium while remaining braced for mayhem. There were physical deprivations, too — searing heat, heavy gear, long hours and minimal sleep.Fifteen marines with whom Lance Corporal McCain trained or served were interviewed for this article, and all praised his performance. He “was just always a hardworking kid,” Lieutenant Bowlby said. “He never bitched about anything,” he said, and always seemed to be laughing. “The humility of him, that’s what blew me away,” he continued.For much of his tour, Jimmy McCain was cut off from political news. The rented Iraqi home where his platoon bunked did not have Internet service, and the 30-odd men shared one satellite phone with a shaky signal. Some news arrived via word-of-mouth, like the senator’s New Hampshire victory (Mr. McCain recounted the story at a recent Manhattan fund-raiser). Lance Corporal McCain did see his father once. On Thanksgiving, Mr. McCain visited Camp Habbaniya with Senate colleagues, and the two shared the holiday meal in the chow hall, according to several people present. Mr. McCain asked other marines if they saw security improving and seemed heartened when they told him they did.Lance Corporal McCain and his unit returned home in February. For his father, who believed that United States strategy in Iraq was working, his son’s tour corresponded well. The company had not lost any men, though three from the battalion had died. It had arrived in a stable area and things had only improved from there. “In my seven months there, you would see drastic changes in Iraq,” Lance Cpl. Greg Jumes said.Lieutenant Bowlby echoed his comments, as did every marine interviewed. “There were some hairy moments, but compared to the past couple of years, it’s 180 degrees,” he said, comparing his first tour in Iraq with his second.Two days after Lance Corporal McCain arrived back in the United States, his father shared his account of the war with Republican congressmen. In a private meeting on Capitol Hill, Mr. McCain mentioned the decline in I.E.D.’s that his son witnessed, the soccer balls he gave to Iraqi children. Mr. McCain’s audience responded with a standing ovation, according to a report published by CNN and confirmed by several aides who were present.In recent weeks, the news from Iraq has been less encouraging. The cease-fire between the leading Shiite militia and American and Iraqi security forces, which overlapped with Lance Corporal McCain’s tour, has frayed. Bombings and sectarian killings have increased. Days after the fifth anniversary of the war’s start, the death toll of American troops crossed the 4,000 mark.As Mr. McCain enters the general election, some say that his son’s service will underscore the sincerity of his stance on the war. “He has, to use a gambler’s term, skin in the game,” said Bob Kerrey, the former Democratic senator and longtime friend of Mr. McCain. “It’s among the most important things that people want to know about John McCain in trying to decide whether or not to trust him.”Last month, Mrs. McCain made a similar argument at a campaign event in Houston. “I want him to represent my son at 3 o’clock in the morning,” she said of her husband, referring to an advertisement for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York that boasts of her national security credentials. She wore a blue-star pin, the mark of an American with a family member at war.Her son is back at Camp Pendleton, where he is using the Jeep he just bought to ferry other marines to the beach. Lately he has been teased about a McCain presidency, according to Lance Cpl. Matt Drake, another company member. “Will we have to go patrolling with Secret Service?” they ask.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','In his speech at the Naval Academy, he described his transformation thus: “In a later crisis, I would suffer a genuine attack on my dignity, an attack, unlike the affronts I had exaggerated as a boy, that left me desperate and uncertain. It was then I would recall, awakened by the example of men who shared my circumstances, the lesson that the academy in its venerable and enduring way had labored to impress upon me. It changed my life forever. I had found my cause: citizenship in the greatest nation on earth.”But this week Mr. McCain did not dwell in any detail on the harsher aspects of his time as a prisoner of war — how he broke his arms and knee when his plane was shot from the sky over Vietnam, or how he was bayoneted by an angry crowd after he fell to earth. He only alluded to his solitary confinement. And while former prison mates — including Col. Bud Day, a Medal of Honor winner, and Orson Swindle — made appearances, they did not go into the detail they have in the past.Instead, Mr. McCain stuck to broad themes about growing up and learning conceptions of honor. Throughout the week he toggled between harsh appraisals of his youth — he continually called himself vain, truculent, petty and immature, among other things — and a kind of winking reminiscence of just how much fun it all was.“I wanted to live the life of a daring, brash, fun-loving flier, indifferent to the hazards of his profession, calm and stoic when the adrenaline flowed, fatalistic about life-and-death situations, and determined to live every nondangerous moment of his life to the fullest,” he said in Pensacola. “I thought that image, which I doubt I ever quite perfected, would prove irresistible to everybody I knew, and especially so to girls whose attention I sought.“You know, there are compensations to growing older, my friends, but the late discovery that you were probably not quite the charming, irresistible young man you once believed you were, but rather callow, conceited and often stupid, is not among them.”On his campaign plane, Mr. McCain, 71, said he would caution young people against behaving as he did. “I enjoyed a lot of it,” he said, “but I didn’t, I think, take advantage of a lot of the opportunities that I had by neglecting my studies at the Naval Academy and some of the other things that I did.”Mr. McCain planned the tour to reintroduce himself to voters as the Democrats continue to squabble, and to try to paint a picture of his life and character and how that might influence him as a president. The confessional bent gave it an idiosyncratic feel. The various recollections were in keeping with his mischievous streak, which sometimes seems to relish pushing boundaries. And it offered Mr. McCain a way to talk in a broader context about his war experience — which he has in many ways made a central part of his candidacy, though he sometimes seems conflicted about doing so.Redemption stories play well in politics — from Prince Hal renouncing Falstaff to become Henry V to George W. Bush, talking as a candidate about finding God, quitting drinking and maturing.Of course, apologies, contrition and redemption have long been central to Mr. McCain’s political identity.After, as a senator, Mr. McCain became one of the Keating Five — he intervened with federal regulators on behalf of Charles H. Keating Jr., a contributor with whom he had vacationed and whose savings and loan collapsed, requiring a multibillion-dollar bailout from taxpayers — he worked to rebuild his reputation by making ethics reform and campaign finance laws a priority. (The Democrats recalled the scandal this week in a release headed “McCain Missed a Stop on the Bio Tour — Keating Five.”)And Mr. McCain took time out from his biographical tour of sin and redemption to stop here in Memphis on Friday to mark the 40th anniversary of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and to note that he had made a mistake by voting in 1983 against establishing a national holiday for Dr. King. “I was wrong,” he said, addressing the matter head-on in a speech he gave in a driving rain outside the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. King was shot, to a number of boos from the assembled crowd.And throughout the week, Mr. McCain acknowledged that some people say they still see hints of his more rebellious youth. “Some of my critics allege that age hasn’t entirely cost me my earlier conceits,” he said at Annapolis. “All I can say to them is, they should have known me then.”'"
"'08-04-06,'0','“No one has said that everything would be finalized and everyone would be satisfied with all the preparations, because we haven’t even started to work on the technical aspects of the system,” Ms. Perino said, referring to the talks on missile defense, which officials have acknowledged is the most contentious issue.Mr. Bush’s trip to Eastern Europe focused on NATO expansion, which threatened to overshadow his last meeting with Mr. Putin, as that subject has at many previous meetings.Mr. Putin, who also attended the meeting with NATO members in Bucharest on Friday, bluntly declared that a further expansion to include two former Soviet republics, Ukraine and Georgia, would constitute a threat.Mr. Bush pressed NATO to offer the two countries a “membership action plan,” an important step toward membership, but Germany, France and other allies vetoed the proposal, settling instead on a statement welcoming their aspirations to join and declaring that they would ultimately become NATO members. The alliance’s rejection of Mr. Bush’s request was widely viewed as a result of Russia’s warnings.Before arriving in Russia, the president continued to champion NATO’s expansion across all of Europe. Addressing new NATO allies in a medieval town square in Zagreb, Croatia, earlier Saturday, President Bush compared the liberation of Eastern European nations from Communism to the American-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.“The people of this region know what the gift of liberty means,” Mr. Bush said, openly relishing NATO’s decision on Thursday to add Croatia and Albania as new members of the 26-nation alliance.“You know the death and destruction that can be caused by the followers of radical ideologies,” he said to several thousand people who had received tickets to attend. “You know that, in a long run, the only way to defeat a hateful ideology is to promote the hopeful alternative of human freedom. And that is what our nations are doing today in the Middle East.”Mr. Bush’s remarks underscored the extent to which he has sought to recast NATO’s mission from a bulwark against an invasion of Europe to an expeditionary force able to extend its reach far beyond its borders.At the NATO meeting in Bucharest, Romania, he called the war on Islamic extremism — a focus of his administration since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 — “the top priority of this alliance,” a view that is not universal among some European allies.Since 2003 NATO has led the international force in Afghanistan, which totals 47,000, and NATO members have contributed soldiers and civilians to the American operation in Iraq, as well. Mr. Bush, however, suggested a broader, more ambitious role for the alliance. “NATO is no longer a static alliance focused on defending Europe from a Soviet tank invasion,” he said in Bucharest. “It is now an expeditionary alliance that is sending its forces across the world to help secure a future of freedom and peace for millions.”During his stop in Croatia, which lasted less than a day, Mr. Bush met with Croatia’s president and prime minister, as well as those of Albania and Macedonia. NATO did not invite Macedonia because of a Greek veto over the country’s name, which Greece says implies territorial ambitions on its region of the same name.Mr. Bush praised all three as deserving democracies that emerged from the Soviet bloc and survived strife and civil war. But even on a celebratory day, the lingering tensions of the Balkans were palpable.When President Bush called for NATO to open its doors not only to Macedonia but also to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Montenegro, the crowd in St. Mark’s Square in Zagreb cheered. When he said the same about Serbia, which Croatia fought from 1991 to 1995, the crowd remained silent as the interpreter finished his remarks.The response was also subdued when he evoked their part in his expansive view of NATO’s global duty. Croatia opposed the war in Iraq, though it now has 50 military police officers deployed as part of NATO’s mission in Afghanistan.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','Officials recently announced that the new government would include 40 ministries, a Kenyan record, and many people fear that the money for salaries, cars and staff for the bloated cabinet will eat into what the displaced people need.Donors have pledged millions of dollars to build homes and resettle people, but most of that is in limbo. And now it is the rainy season.Nearly every day, the skies crack open and the water gushes down. Tents collapse, latrines overflow, firewood gets soggy, food goes uncooked and diseases like malaria and the flu flourish. Many of the displaced people are farmers, and the same rains they would have prayed for, had they not been violently driven off their land, are now a curse.Three women in a camp recently died from exposure to the cold and 5-month-old twins from pneumonia.“The rains are my biggest fear,” said Naomi Shaban, Kenya’s minister of special programs, who oversees the displaced persons camps. “These people are living in tents, and these are not just showers, they are heavy rains. There is a lot of contamination, with children playing in the water. We anticipate health problems.”Many displaced people in this nation of 37 million are worried about how long they can survive and feel abandoned by their government. Ms. Wanjiru, who voted for Mwai Kibaki, Kenya’s president, said she did not support him — or any other politician — anymore.“All we get are words,” she said.She spends her days washing the few clothes she has and sitting in a cracked plastic chair watching the cars go by. A mother of six with a seventh on the way, she said she did not even have the bus fare to go into town or check out the mall.Ms. Shaban defended the president, saying he was very concerned about the plight of the displaced people and that helping them is a post-election priority. She said the government had already spent $11 million on food and medicine since January, though the distribution of supplies was sometimes delayed, because some of the people hanging around the displaced persons camps were “impostors” and it took time to verify who the real victims were.The Kenyan government is asking donor nations, including the United States, to provide nearly $500 million to resettle people and rebuild the tens of thousands of burned down homes, businesses, public utilities and schools.After the disputed election, supporters of the government and of the leading opposition party raged against each other. More than 1,000 people were killed, many quite brutally, and much of the fighting was along ethnic lines.Ms. Shaban, like many other government officials, insisted that most of the displaced people would eventually go home.“As the healing process goes on, more and more want to go back,” she said.But many people are scared. Hundreds of thousands have already resettled in areas where their ethnic group dominates, because that is seen as the only way to guarantee safety. Just a few days ago, in late March, leaflets were circulated in several Rift Valley towns telling Kikuyus, Mr. Kibaki’s ethnic group, that if they returned, they would be killed.“People are still bitter,” said Florence Muia, a Catholic nun who works with displaced people. “They have seen this violence before, and this time they are saying never again.”Many of the displaced children, traumatized into near silence, simply have nothing to return to.Naomi and Joseph Nganga were abandoned by their father after a mob burned down their house in the Rift Valley and their mother died from a stomach sickness in a displaced persons camp. They are sister and brother, 9 and 10 years old, and live in the children’s home with about 80 others, including: Clinton, who speaks in whispers; a 3-year-old whom workers call Baby Joshua because they do not have any more information about him; and a cheerful 16-year-old named Millicent who has a baby of her own.The boys wear V-neck sweaters and the girls plaid dresses. They play in bare concrete rooms and drink plastic mugs of tea for a snack.When asked if he wanted to stay in the children’s home in Nairobi or go back to his village, Joseph’s voice dropped to a mumble.“I just want to go to school,” he said.His sister nodded next to him and then looked down at her cracked leather shoes.'"

But the weak dollar has hurt the company, it could not meet Christmas demand, and sales are expected to be down 4 percent for the year ended March 31, to $1.1 billion.Last November, the company said it would cut half of its roughly 1,000 jobs near Waterford. KAREN FREEMANNOW THAT’S A REFUND Lawrence J. Ellison, the billionaire chief of Oracle, just added $3 million to his wealth, thanks to the San Mateo County Assessor’s Office in California.The office recently ordered the return of $3 million in taxes that Mr. Ellison had paid on his 23-acre estate in Woodside, Calif.In 2004, the county assessed the property at $163 million, but Mr. Ellison’s holding company, Octopus Holdings, later had it appraised at $64 million.In agreeing to the lower valuation, the assessor’s office said that the estate, with its 16th-century Japanese architecture, suffered from “functional obsolescence” that would limit its appeal to buyers.LAURIE FLYNNREDOING THE MATH VeriFone, a maker of payment technology like PIN cards and checkout counter credit card machines, said last week that it “did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting,” according to a company statement on Wednesday.The lapse, revealed in an internal audit, included the overstatement of $37 million in operating income for the first three quarters of 2007 and double-counting of some inventory. It also resulted in the resignation of Barry Zwarenstein, its chief financial officer, who will leave his post after a restatement of earnings is completed.The Securities and Exchange Commission has “indicated an interest in interviewing several current and former VeriFone officers and employers,” the statement said. A company spokesman did not return calls seeking comment.STACEY STOWEIT REALLY ADDS UP Reuben Mark, who retired as chief executive of Colgate-Palmolive in July after 23 years, is standing for re-election as the company’s chairman one more time on May 8. But he will not have to worry that any decision he makes could jeopardize his substantial nest egg.Mr. Mark, 69, has already cashed out his pension, collecting $36 million plus an annuity that will pay him more than $160,000 a year. He also had a gain of $149 million from exercising options on Colgate’s stock and an additional $32 million from the vesting of previous stock awards.Along with more than $3 million in cash pay, that means Mr. Mark can spend some of his golden years deciding what to do with at least $220 million, before taxes.  PATRICK McGEEHANRESISTANT TO SPIN Many C.E.O.’s are known for putting a positive spin on negative news, but that is becoming harder to do.The C.E.O. Confidence Index, measured by Chief Executive magazine since 2002, plunged to a record low last month. Not mincing words, 52 percent of top chiefs surveyed called current business conditions downright “bad.” No word on whether the magazine plans to add choices like “truly abysmal” or “utterly hopeless” to the survey, just in case “bad” ends up becoming business as usual.PHYLLIS KORKKI'"
"'08-04-06,'0','TO measure the amounts that executives were paid last year, Sunday Business asked Equilar Inc., an executive compensation research firm, to compile and analyze the compensation data included in the corporate filings of 200 large public companies that had revenues of more than $6.5 billion, and that had filed their proxies by March 28 this year.The presentation is simplified this year, because all of the companies now file proxies under the new Securities and Exchange Commission disclosure rules. Last year, only companies whose fiscal years ended on or after Dec. 15, 2006, had to comply. So the analysis had to be divided into two tables, one covering companies that filed their data under the new rules, the other for ones that were still following the old system. This year, the analysis is presented in a single table, which spans Pages 10 and 11.The total compensation figures represent the sum of base salary, discretionary and performance-based cash bonuses, option awards, stock awards and other compensation like benefits and perquisites. The annual salaries cited for chief executives who served only part of the year was derived either from information disclosed by the company about the new chief’s contract, or by prorating their salaries based on the time they actually served in the position. Other elements of their compensation, though, were not prorated.Option and stock award figures include the value of all service-based and performance-based awards on the day they were granted. If the company reported those values, its numbers were used. If it did not, Equilar used the assumptions that the company provided to generate the numerical value.Percentage changes for total compensation are provided only for those companies that had the same chief executive at fiscal year-end in both 2006 and 2007.The calculation for change in total pay varies from company to company. For companies filing two consecutive years of compensation information under the S.E.C.’s new disclosure rules, total pay values are calculated for 2006 and 2007 using the method outlined above. But comparisons were more difficult for companies that filed under the new rules for the first time this year. For them, Equilar applied a separate formula to make the data comparable, even though disclosure formats had changed.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','On the other hand, the sheer volume of extra premium-class seats flying across the Atlantic does seem likely to have a long-term effect on the front of the plane; walk-up New York-London business-class tickets can cost as much as $8,000 round trip. “You will definitely see more downward pressure on those fares,” said Andre Hesselink, Vayama’s chief executive.Already badly overcrowded, Heathrow Airport in London has seen the greatest impact from the open-skies agreement, with an additional 100 trans-Atlantic flights a week already added.Until last Sunday, only two domestic carriers, American and United, had access to Heathrow. Now they all do. Delta Air Lines marked opening day with new flights between New York, Los Angeles and Atlanta and Heathrow in a partnership with Air France. Continental, Northwest and US Airways also scheduled new Heathrow flights.The open-skies agreement also allows European carriers to fly between any point in Europe and the United States, rather than just between their home countries and the United States.Meanwhile, talks are starting on the second phase, scheduled for 2010. European carriers are already grumbling that the first phase disproportionately benefited the Americans, and that the United States has not yet said that it will accept the chief provision of Phase 2 — allowing foreign airlines to fully own airlines in the United States.Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Atlantic Airways, said recently that the Europeans would “rip up” the first stage of the open-skies agreement if the ownership issue wasn’t resolved. Virgin has a 25 percent interest in, but has said it would like to control, the United States carrier Virgin America.It’s no secret that several big foreign carriers would like to own airlines in the United States. In fact, some European airlines already have ventures with carriers in the United States that resemble mini-mergers in certain markets.Delta shares revenue with Air France on its three new routes to Heathrow and plans to expand the relationship. Glen Hauenstein, a Delta executive vice president, calls it “a new era in our ability to extract value from each other’s networks” and to “coordinate passenger flows, schedules and pricing.”Lufthansa of Germany acquired a 19 percent investment stake in JetBlue last December, and is considering expanding the relationship. One byproduct of the investment, said Wolfgang Mayrhuber, Lufthansa’s chief executive, is that Lufthansa and JetBlue can more easily tap into each other’s networks from their bases at Kennedy International Airport.So while Phase 1 of the open-skies agreement means more competition, Phase 2 — assuming that the United States drops the foreign ownership ban — could portend just the opposite.Consider that Air France’s parent, Air France-KLM, has a partnership with Delta and with Northwest (a partnership it inherited when Air France bought the Dutch carrier KLM in 2004).Delta, expanding its big European network, says it wants to negotiate a merger with Northwest, which has a big Asian network. If Air France-KLM were to buy a merged Delta-Northwest under the next open-skies phase, that consolidation alone would be impressive.“The structure of the airline industry could end up eventually looking like the trans-national oil business — and we know how that worked out,” said Joe Brancatelli, publisher of Joesentme.com, the business travel Web site.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','If John McCain’s past implies superior wisdom in military matters, then why did he vote for the insane war on Iraq?He has demonstrated that he doesn’t even know who and where our so-called enemies are, or who supports them. He has claimed that conditions in Iraq are vastly improved, when that’s clearly not the case.Is his biography even relevant? Do we, and the world, deserve another president who chooses aggression over diplomacy; who still doesn’t know the difference between Shiites and Sunnis; and who has admitted, after 26 years in the Senate, that he knows little about economics?Isn’t it possible that John McCain’s distinguished military service actually works against him when one considers his presidential résumé?Military training teaches the soldier to follow orders and complete the mission. There is no room to question the orders themselves once an objective is set. The focus is to get the job done.We see this in Mr. McCain, who vows to stay in Iraq until victory is ours. According to him, to pull out is to accept defeat. Unfortunately, victory in Iraq will never be found where he is looking for it — on the battlefield.We need a president who can get us out of this Iraq mistake, and, more important, repair the damage done by this war to our worldwide prestige, our economy and to our military.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','That advice could have saved some of the billions that evaporated so swiftly in the last few months. According to Brad Durham, managing director of EPFR Global, a fund research firm, investors pumped $50 billion into emerging-market stock funds last year.Almost all of it — about $45 billion — came in the last quarter, Mr. Durham said. That means the net inflow into those funds in three months was about double what they had previously received in a good year, he said.Much of that money was chasing the higher returns available in those markets, but a lot of it was fleeing the troubles in the United States, including the declining purchasing power of the dollar, Mr. Durham said.But as stock prices slid worldwide, the money flowed right out again. In the first quarter this year, emerging-market funds had net outflows of about $20 billion, he said.This year, most of the action in emerging-market funds has been in those with the most exposure to commodity-rich countries like Russia and Brazil and to the regions of the Middle East and Africa, he said.Russia funds had net inflows of more than $1 billion in the first quarter. They had underperformed for years, Mr. Durham said, because of fears about what Vladimir V. Putin, the president who tangled with the country’s oligarchs, might do next. But the election last month of Dmitry A. Medvedev to succeed Mr. Putin has quelled some of those concerns, Mr. Durham said.“Now that the political situation in Russia has been clarified,” he said, “I think Russia is a pretty attractive market.”When Justin Leverenz, who manages the $12 billion Oppenheimer Developing Markets fund, returned from Moscow recently, he was not raving about the investment opportunities there. Instead, Mr. Leverenz was more excited about the bargains he said he saw in technology companies whose fortunes are tied to the American economy.He said he thought investors had turned too sour on some established franchises that depend on the West for much of their business. Two of his favorites are Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Infosys Technologies, a technology services company based in India. Taiwan Semiconductor’s profits have been growing more than 15 percent a year, but its stock now sells for about 12 times its per-share earnings “based on the view that semiconductors are cyclical and the U.S. economy is going down the toilet,” Mr. Leverenz said. “It’s seriously mispriced.”Infosys, a prime beneficiary of the trend toward offshoring of technology services, is an “enormous” business that will be offering more software-based services to clients in the United States and Europe, he said. Its stock is cheaper now than during the dot-com boom of the late 1990’s, he said, because of the perception that there will be an “apocalyptic retreat” in spending on information technology.Mr. Leverenz said he had also been buying shares of some of the biggest companies in Mexico, including Grupo Televisa, the broadcaster, and Banorte, a bank.BUT despite being a Mandarin speaker who lived in and around China for 10 years, Mr. Leverenz said, he had relatively little money invested there.“In my mind, China is the most durable emerging market in terms of breadth,” he said. But in recent years, he said, most stock prices there had become “just totally nonsensical.”“The prices for much of the emerging world were wildly out of whack,” Mr. Leverenz said. “That’s why this year we’re seeing a big pullback. The math didn’t work. The underlying expectations were too high, and we’re getting a natural correction.”The good news for investors who still have an appetite for emerging markets, he said, is that the cleanup after the storm is probably more than halfway complete.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','After Xanadu’s long and troubled gestation, its actual construction has proved jarring to turnpike drivers who wonder why a container ship with a 1973 color scheme seems to have docked beside the Exit 18W tolls. The Snow Dome, with the indoor ski slope, is taking shape . The giant Ferris wheel with the Pepsi logo will soon follow. But it’s spring again, so what about baseball?“Now we see it going up, and everyone is asking, ‘Where’s the ballpark?’ ” said Dennis McNerney, the Bergen County executive. “And the Yankees opened up and people are screaming about the prices there, so a minor-league stadium is becoming more and more attractive.”When developers were pitching their plans back in 2002 to the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, the landlord in the Meadowlands, one of them — the original developer behind Xanadu — brought along some players dressed in Cliff Hawks uniforms.“Not only did it include minor-league baseball, but it was specific to the Bergen Cliff Hawks,” Joseph Forgione, a sports authority commissioner, said about the original Xanadu proposal. He vows that “over my dead body” will the land set aside for the ballpark ever be used for anything else.But proposals are neither blueprints nor budgets, and as the Xanadu project floundered, and passed from the original developer to another, nobody could agree on who would pay the $20 million or so it would cost to build the ballpark. Would the state kick in? What was Xanadu’s share? How much should come from Mr. Kalafer?Mr. Kalafer thought he had what he called an “agreement in principle” with the developers, and in 2006, with no ballpark on the horizon, he sued them. “This has been an intentional deception,” he said. Baseball, his lawsuit argued, was just bait, a way to convince the authority that Xanadu was not just a mall. “The residents of New Jersey bought something different than what they were sold.”A Superior Court judge in Bergen County dismissed the suit in January. Mr. Kalafer, Judge Jonathan N. Harris wrote, is “an entrepreneur who thought that he could introduce minor-league baseball to Bergen County based upon a handshake”; the defendants are “real estate developers who imagined that they could build and operate a world-class retail and entertainment lifestyle center in Bergen County on a constrained budget”; and what happened when they met left “both sides’ dreams in disarray.” Mr. Kalafer is appealing the decision.Xanadu is scheduled to open in November, but no work has started at the ballpark site. “We always wanted baseball, we still want baseball, we’re going to have baseball,” said Lloyd Kaplan, a spokesman for Xanadu. But the question of who will pay for the ballpark remains unresolved. “We look forward to selecting an operator by the end of the year capable of operating a first-class franchise and moving forward with the development of the stadium.”The Cliff Hawks, Mr. Kaplan said, remain a possibility, but Mr. Kalafer has not had any meetings with Xanadu. “I get so angry when they say, ‘Well, we’re talking to teams,’” said Mr. Forgione. “What do you mean you’re talking to teams? You already have an anchor tenant in Kalafer. He has one of the most successful teams in New Jersey. What else are you looking for?”Mr. Kalafer has also produced nine movies — mostly documentaries, three of which were nominated for Academy Awards — and he plans another one about Xanadu: “It’s New Jersey,” is the working title, and the synopsis describes it as “a case study in public and political manipulation.” He brought a cameraman into the depositions for his lawsuits, and also to a recent tour of Xanadu by state officials and reporters. Homer, the Cliff Hawks’ mascot, might make a guest appearance.“It’s being dry-cleaned,” he said about the costume, as he made the rounds of a ballpark that does exist as more than a drawing, and that averaged 5,200 fans a game last season. A new scoreboard was coming to the Patriots’ home (“the same as in Yankee Stadium,” he said) and the last of the gray winter shadows would soon be power washed away.“It will be perfect by opening day,” he said, meaning here, at least.'"

"'08-04-06,'0','WITH gas prices soaring and the debate intensifying over ways to reduce automobile congestion on the streets of Manhattan, Metro-North Railroad’s announcement that it will add 67 trains a week in and out of Grand Central Terminal is welcome news, commuter advocates say.“Finally, the word seems to be spreading that the train is a better way to get into the city, rather than paying all that money for tolls and gas and parking,” said James F. Blair, a member of the Metro-North Railroad Commuter Council, created by the State Legislature in the early 1980s to represent riders.The new schedule, which goes into effect on April 6, is aimed at several groups of riders, including those who commute to and from Manhattan; those who visit the city for social and cultural reasons, and second-home owners who keep their cars out of town and return home by train to the city on Sunday evening.Ridership is growing most rapidly at Metro-North’s northernmost stations, among them Poughkeepsie, Wassaic and New Haven, said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North. “Especially in Poughkeepsie,” she said, “it’s been increasing like gangbusters.”In the past decade, as the cost of buying a home closer to Manhattan has risen markedly, new housing developments have sprouted throughout Putnam and Dutchess Counties, attracting commuters willing to take on longer commutes.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','The officer on patrol duty found a chain, secured the dog to a signpost and provided a bowl of water; then protocol took over. The Town of Huntington Animal Shelter and Adoption Center was notified, and John Dowling, a retired dog groomer who used to show collies and Bichons and now beautifies incarcerated strays, drove the foundling to the pound in the canine paddy wagon. He, too, seemed sure her owners would be in touch. “She’s a nice, big, friendly dog,” he said.But the owners weren’t in touch on Easter night, nor did they call Monday morning (only her finder did), nor did they reach out anytime over the ensuing week.“Even I’m starting to give up hope,” Mr. Dowling said one afternoon when her finder, who developed a guilty crush on this pooch, paid her daily visit to the pound armed with affection, the dog’s first preference, and large Milk-Bones, her second.Mr. Dowling, a bit of a soft touch, could not be tapped as a potential adopter. He has four dogs at home, the town limit: “A big, smelly bloodhound and a Doberman puppy, both difficult to place, so I adopted them, and then I inherited a papillon and a Chihuahua from a friend who died. A full house.”On March 31, Inmate No. 102, unofficially renamed Pearl by her finder, officially became the unclaimed property of the town and, pending the completion of temperament testing, available for adoption. Her finder’s name and number are at the top of the list of Pearl’s potential adopters, just in case — perish the thought — no other dog lover claims her.The Huntington Animal Shelter is not a no-kill shelter: last year it took in 530 dogs and euthanized 71, roughly half of them old or sick animals surrendered by their owners, the other half unwanted. Enough said.The shelter, which has concrete runs for 60 dogs but no indoor kennels, is currently occupied by 24 dogs, about 15 of which are ready for adoption (www.petfinder.org, ZIP code 11731). Charlie, a homely brown pit bull with an earnest attitude, is not the oldest dog in the place; that’s probably Angel the Chihuahua, who, unlike Charlie, has a Beware of Dog sign on her cage. But he claims seniority: he’s been waiting for a home since last June, slightly longer than Angel.“I hold onto my dogs,” said John Thompson, the shelter’s supervisor, who has two dogs, three cats and a rabbit (he found it in the road near his home in Patchogue). “I’m not going to put down a dog I believe is a good dog. Sometimes I’ll ask myself, ‘Am I doing the right thing by keeping this dog so long?’, but I truly believe there is somebody out there who will adopt that dog eventually.”That’s how he wound up with Dakota, a coon hound, and Rebel, a beagle; both were surrendered (the phrase “dumped at the shelter” is dismissed by shelter employees as politically/compassionately incorrect) by frustrated owners who deemed them overly aggressive. So was tiny Angel, who sleeps on a pink throw rug. She’s a biter who has developed a tolerance for Mr. Thompson and Mr. Dowling but terrorizes the rest of the staff.“I say there’s someone for every dog,” Mr. Thompson said, “but I’m starting to think I’m going to have to take Angel home.”Inmate No. 102 and her fellow travelers deserve the same.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','High-end properties can leave the city’s tax assessor pondering enigmatic questions. While it’s obvious why a three-bedroom home is more valuable than a two-bedroom property, how much value does a ninth bathroom really add? Is there a point beyond which a home becomes so big — say, 30,000 square feet — that extra rooms begin to add negligible value? As owners update their high-end properties, Booth is sometimes left trying to figure out how much an owner’s over-the-top improvement — outfitting a dining room with wainscoting imported at impossible expense from a French monastery — will add to the home’s market value, since tomorrow’s buyers may rip it out. “There are no two apples in this market, so it’s not apple-to-apple,” Booth says. “It’s how close your apple is to my pear.”Over the past decade, the process of assessing a home’s value has become heavily computerized. Booth demonstrates how the automated system works. On his computer screen he chooses a vacant quarter-acre lot that’s owned by the city. It’s currently assessed at $603,200, owing to its pond view. He clicks open a window and begins adding an imaginary home. It’s a custom-built clapboard-and-brick structure with four bedrooms, three baths and a mansard roof. He checks off various options — hardwood floors, central air-conditioning, oil heat. When he’s finished, he clicks a button, and the software tells him this property is now valued at $824,800, meaning the house has added $221,600 to the existing land value.This computer-generated number is just the starting point, however. If after visiting the home, Booth feels $825,000 is too high or too low, he may recalculate some of the subjective variables — like whether the construction quality is “very good” or “excellent” — to bring the number more in line with his instinct of what the home is really worth.Local real estate agents joke with Booth about using a dartboard to put values on these homes, but in truth, they sympathize. Paul Leys, a broker and owner at Gustave White, the Sotheby’s affiliate in Newport, says that when he and his colleagues estimate the value of a high-end home in pursuit of a listing, they typically give the owner a range. “This isn’t an exact science, so we’re hesitant to put one number on it,” Leys says. Booth, of course, has no such flexibility; his assessments must be precise. Chris West, Leys’s partner at Gustave White, says, “Allan’s got a harder job, no question.”Booth’s job is made all the more challenging because the higher a property’s tax bill, the more incentive a homeowner has to file an appeal — and if buyers are wealthy enough to afford a multimillion-dollar home, they also have enough money to hire an attorney. At any given time, Booth’s office is usually involved in several dozen disputes over assessments, a few of which will result in full-blown trials. These cases create headaches, but they’re also one of the reasons he likes his job.“Someone gave me a plaque one time,” Booth says. “It said: ‘Arguing with the tax assessor is like wrestling a pig in the mud. After a while, you realize the pig enjoys it.’ ”On a recent afternoon, Booth parked outside a new shingle-style residence on Wellington Avenue, just across from the harbor. Its roofline contains a turret, three brick chimneys and a series of handsome gables and shed dormers. To the right, up a broad set of steps, is a wide patio, one of three outdoor spaces from which the homeowners can look out at the waterfront. At 5,652 square feet, the home has plenty of room for guests, but the property also contains a three-bedroom Cape Cod-style guesthouse with an additional 2,468 square feet.The owners bought the land for $2.3 million in 2005 and began building their home. Soon after its completion, in the spring of 2007, they received a letter from Booth, who had valued the property, called Harbor Watch, at $4.6 million. This meant the owners would have an annual property tax bill of $38,568.The owners questioned the assessment. The basic facts on the home’s computerized assessment record — the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, that it’s heated by gas-fired hot water and contains central air-conditioning — are all correct. But their lawyer, Turner C. Scott, argued that Booth had made a crucial error. He classified Harbor Watch as an “estate” instead of merely a “custom home.” It’s a distinction that may have inflated the property value by half a million dollars. According to the General Laws of the State of Rhode Island, an estate is defined as “a large, luxurious residence with ample acreage” — a pretty broad definition. “I think its acreage sufficient to support a second dwelling,” Booth said of Harbor Watch. “I think it’s an estate-like dwelling.”Then he considers the homeowner’s argument. This lot, which measures 2.74 acres, isn’t exactly Gatsby-esque, particularly by Newport standards. And unlike the Gilded Age mansions that line the Cliff Walk a mile away, this property lies down the street from a commercial district and just across from a busy dock. “He’s got traffic and noise,” Booth admits. Still, when he considers the $2.3 million price for the land, plus the construction costs for this high-end house, he thinks $4.6 million is a fair measure of what it might fetch on the open market.Booth pulled up the Harbor Watch computer file. He changed it from an “estate” to a “custom home,” and the computerized assessment dropped by more than $600,000 — which would save the owners more than $5,000 in annual taxes. “But here’s the hook,” Booth said, clicking around on his computer. Say he calls it a “custom home” but also changes the grade to “excellent” instead of “very good/excellent.” Click: the assessment jumps back up to $4.4 million. “That’s what I explained to Turner, that I felt it was a $4.5 million house,” Booth said. “If he’s really worried about the word ‘estate’ versus ‘custom,’ I could change it, but I wasn’t going to change the assessment.”After discussing it with Turner Scott, the owners of Harbor Watch decided to forgo a lawsuit. Scott said that he talked with the owners about the costs of litigation and about what they would ask for the house if they were selling it. Suddenly its $4.6 million assessment didn’t sound so ridiculous. “Allan has it listed as an estate, but that really doesn’t make much difference,” Scott says. “You think accountants can play with numbers, you should see appraisers play with numbers.”Booth doesn’t have to worry about appraisals when it comes to his own home, however. He’s a third-generation resident of Newport who raised three sons here. But for the past 20 years, he and his wife, Linda, have been renters.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','“You did moral hazard in 1998,” writes Steven Weisman, a Times colleague with an archival memory. “Everyone is using it now to describe the supposed ‘moral hazard’ of bailing out Bear Stearns. An oldie but goodie; maybe it’s time to return to it.”“We’re very aware of moral hazard,” Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. told George Stephanopoulos of ABC a few weeks ago, as the Federal Reserve Board stepped in to allay the risk in J. P. Morgan Chase’s takeover of the anxiety-attacked investment bank, “but our primary concern right now . . . is the stability of our financial system, the orderliness of our markets.” He saw the risk of growing panic to be greater than the risk of undermining the discipline of punishment. Here’s what that means:There are times when helping people in the short run may hurt them in the long run. Contrariwise, there are times when refusing to help people in the short run means they won’t have a long run at all. That’s the dilemma inherent in the phrase moral hazard. Does protection against risk tempt a person to do ever-riskier things? Does it endanger your moral sense — undermine a person’s character or weaken an institution’s self-discipline — to reduce the severe consequences of foolish action?Put punchily, does it weaken morality to lessen the lesson of loss?The phrase was born in the controversy in the mid-19th century about the wisdom of the ascending scale of life-insurance premiums, encouraging the healthy to drop out and the sickly to stay in. The American Cyclopedia in 1875 called that “a moral hazard too great to be incurred in the present state of society.” Economists seized the phrase in 1895: “Lack of moral character,” reported The Quarterly Journal of Economics, “gives rise to a class of risks known by insurance men as moral hazards.”There are still those who mutter that burglary insurance discourages people from locking their doors, but the idea of all kinds of insurance — purchased by individuals or given by government — seems to have caught on. The concern of conservatives that government “relief” undermined the work ethic led to bipartisan reforms that encouraged “workfare”; the worry of liberals was that large companies or leading banks would undergo moral hazard if they were protected by government as too big to fail. That phrase, used in a 1936 Times subheadline about a call by the former governor Al Smith (“He Says New York Is Too Big to Fail in Duty of Giving to Private Welfare Agencies”) surfaced again in a 1975 Business Week headline about a government loan guarantee to protect Lockheed Aircraft: “When Companies Get Too Big to Fail.” Later that year, The Economist noted “all the scary stuff about what the collapse of New York would do to the domestic and world financial system” and predicted the city’s rescue because “it is too big to fail.”The reader who wants a profound look at the phrase that launched a thousand Wall Street arguments about the effect on moral character of the forgiveness of failure can find it in the December 1996 Texas Law Review article “On the Genealogy of Moral Hazard,” by Tom Baker. To see how that phrase applies to the pros and cons of bailing out those banks, speculators and homeowners embroiled in the subprime mortgage mess — a surefire campaign issue — consult today’s front pages.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','Arnie and Jack, or, if you prefer, the King and the Bear, are Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus — like Tiger, and for that matter Britney and Paris, members of that exclusive American fraternity where last names are unnecessary. Arnie, it’s hard to believe, is 78 now, and Jack 68. They’re lions in winter, jowly, a little hobbled, and have retired even from the Masters, though Arnie is scheduled to hit a ceremonial first ball to open the tournament on Thursday. On the few occasions when they still compete in public — at the Del Webb Father/Son Challenge, for example, where Arnie actually plays with his grandson — they have evolved a sort of vaudeville routine in which each gently pokes fun at the other’s infirmities. It’s all an act, according to Ian O’Connor in “Arnie & Jack.” Each of them would give anything for one more chance to beat the other guy.Their rivalry really is golf’s greatest, and it was nurtured both by timing — they were the commanding figures in an era when, thanks largely to Arnie, golf became a sport that ordinary people followed — and by inspired casting. They couldn’t have been more different. Arnie was broad-shouldered, slim-hipped and irresistibly charming. “I’ve got sex written all over my face,” he once said. Jack, until he made himself over in the mid-’70s, shedding weight and letting his hair grow, was fat and puffy, with a dorky buzz cut. His frat brothers at Ohio State called him Blob-o. He spoke in an annoying, high-pitched voice and had a manner that was both shy and self-absorbed.They played differently too. The son of a Pennsylvania greenskeeper, who grew up without indoor plumbing, Arnie was largely self-taught. He had a fierce, slashing swing that almost lifted him out of his shoes and a follow-through that made him look as if he were wrestling with a downed power line. Jack’s father owned a small chain of drugstores near Columbus, Ohio, and belonged to a country club, where his son was expensively tutored. Except for a tendency to let the right elbow fly, his swing was almost classically perfect.Arnie hit a low draw, a snap hook sometimes; Jack, a high fade. Arnie played quickly, striding down the fairway with an L & M cigarette cupped in his hand, and he relied on hunches and his ability to recover from near disaster. Jack was methodical and agonizingly deliberate, dithering forever over his putts, and when they were paired together, his slowness drove Arnie crazy. Jack was better, of course; he drove the ball farther and had a more reliable short game, and by the mid-’60s he had convincingly dethroned the King. His record of 18 major championships far eclipses Arnie’s seven (four of them at the Masters). Tiger is bound to outstrip him any day now, but for the time being Jack is the greatest golfer ever.But Arnie is more loved, and always was. If anything, O’Connor understates the way that television, then just beginning its symbiotic relationship with professional sports, embraced Arnie and made him one of the most popular figures of his time. Arnie didn’t just have fans, he had Arnie’s Army, which at Oakmont in 1962, when Jack beat Arnie in a playoff for the U.S. Open championship, jeered Jack loudly and unmercifully. There is something almost biblical in their relationship: Jack is admired, but Arnie is cherished, and it is on him, unfairly, that we still bestow our favor.That Jack would be resentful at times is more than understandable, but one of the odd things about this rivalry, as O’Connor points out, is that the two men are also friends of a sort. Their wives were very close, and Arnie and Jack inevitably spent a good deal of time together. They’ve also mellowed over the years. In public they were always gracious about each other, but to judge from this account, Arnie seems to have been nastier in private. He delighted in calling the Golden Bear logo on Jack’s shirts a Golden Pig, and he used “Nicklaus” as a locker-room euphemism for going to the bathroom. To this day, O’Connor says, Jack is a little miffed that in their playing days Arnie never complimented him after a round. But that’s the way it is when you’re the King; you don’t bow down before others.'"
"'08-04-06,'0','Forty-three years after that propitious encounter, one of its beneficiaries woke up in his two-room apartment in suburban Japan on a brilliant autumn morning, at the dawn of a new millennium, to spend a day with the Dalai Lama. I'd been visiting him in his exile home for almost thirty years at that point, and had been following him on his global travels for almost as long. But still I was intrigued by the quiet revolution he was promulgating, challenging us to see politics, globalism, celebrity itself, in a larger and more spacious light, and I was interested to examine all the challenges and questions his experiments entailed.He had been taking to the road more and more often in recent years, partly, as always, to speak for the six million Tibetans more or less imprisoned in Chinese-occupied Tibet, but also, increasingly, to speak on behalf of what he now called ""global ethics,"" those basic principles of kindness and responsibility that anyone could implement in her life, whether or not she was committed to any religion. In my many years of traveling as a journalist, I couldn't remember any Tibetan — or exile — I had met who spent no time mourning the past he had lost but concentrated his energies on how he could construct a more useful and inclusive future across the globe.Japan in November is a blaze of radiance and impermanence. The sky this day, as on most such days, dawned a startling blue, the temperature in the seventies, even as the leaves all around the town of Nara began to turn ocher, lemon-yellow, the russet of a Tibetan monk's robes. The very heart of Nara, the first Buddhist capital of Japan, thirteen centuries before, is a deer park that brings to mind the park in which the Buddha delivered his first discourse, in India. Everything changes, falls away, dies, the leaves in the Japanese autumn say, and yet everything comes back again, and change itself is a kind of constancy. Life, as some Buddhists have it, is a ""joyful participation in a world of sorrows.""We got up early, my longtime companion Hiroko and myself, the morning light throwing pools of gold across our ceiling, and traveled by bus and train out to the musty Nara Hotel, a ninety-year-old hunting lodge of a place that sits at one corner of the deer park like a keepsake that has fallen out of some absentminded visitor's pocket. Just before nine a.m., we were ushered into a small conference room, where ten local academics and monks — all men, most of them in formal black — were seated around a table, trying to stifle their yawns, and sitting upright and a little stiffly in the Japanese way. We took up folding chairs against the wall, observers, and I thought of how the Dalai Lama himself had already been up for more than five hours, awakening, as he always does, at three-thirty a.m., to spend his first four hours of the day meditating on the roots of compassion and what he can do for his people, the ""Chinese brothers and sisters"" who are holding his people hostage, and the rest of us, while also preparing himself for his death.When he came into the room, accompanied by a group of aides and hosts, his stooped figure pressing forward — ""He looks like a middle linebacker,"" his old friend and admirer Abe Rosenthal, longtime managing editor of the New York Times, had once said to me — there was a sense of sharpened attention in our midst. He was looking around him as ever, picking out familiar faces, making eye contact with strangers, taking his new surroundings in (when I went to see him in Dharamsala, eighteen months later, many of the examples he would use would come from this brief trip to Japan). His hands were joined before him, in a gesture of respect, and his bearing, the opposite of remote, was aimed, I thought, to try to dissolve all borders and get formality out of the way. We're all in this together, his body might have been saying; let's see if we can use this session for some good.Taking his seat at one end of the table, he looked around the room with frank, unembarrassed curiosity, and at the translator chosen for this meeting — a local American hippie, by the looks of him, with a thick gray ponytail and a Gypsy vest. (The Dalai Lama can rarely catch sight of a beard or a male ponytail without wanting to tug at it.) As the Tibetan offered a few words of introduction, I noticed, as I had not quite seen before, that he was coming into the room, essentially, as a spokesman for ""potential,"" to use one of his favorite words. A team of scientists in Wisconsin, complemented by researchers at Princeton and Berkeley, he said, in his measured, deliberate way, passing in and out of English and Tibetan, had been conducting a series of experiments on monks and practiced meditators to measure the effect such training can have upon the mind. So far they had found that those who had meditated for years could lower their heartbeats by three or four beats a minute (even, in a few exceptional cases, more), could alter their brain scans, could even boost their entire immune systems. Conclusive results had yet to be firmed up, but the research suggested that just as so many of us these days had taken to training and strengthening our bodies, perhaps we could do the same with our minds?And if we could control our heartbeats, our theta waves, even the heat of our bodies, perhaps we could also do more to control our thought patterns, our anger, our perceptions? Certainly, the new neurological idea of ""brain plasticity"" suggested that we had much more potential for change than had previously been imagined. The mind was something we had the potential to transform. So, too, therefore, was the world that the mind created.Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, was, first and foremost, an empiricist, a scientist of self; what he learned he learned by conducting experiments on the closest specimen to hand, himself. First he walked out of his gilded palace at the age of twenty-nine, in order to see firsthand the realities his father had tried to screen from him, the abiding truths of old age and suffering and death. Then he traveled and traveled, consulting teachers, practicing austerities, and, finally, sitting down under a pipal tree and vowing not to get up again until he'd come to some understanding of the nature of suffering and, further, of how we could come to a liberation from suffering. Then he traveled for the rest of his life, extending and sharing the understandings he'd gained.He always took pains to tell people he was no more than an experimenter, doing nothing that the rest of us could not do; his aim was simply that of a doctor at a sickbed, eager to find an immediate solution to the problem at hand, without claiming his was the only or even the best solution. By speaking, as he often did, of a ""path,"" he was saying, in effect, that we could always go further, that everything was in a constant state of flux and that all he was doing was showing the way so that others could take it in new directions.The Fourteenth Dalai Lama had been pushing along the same road for several decades now, turning around corners to meet a world in which almost every culture could access every other, and a single image had the power to reach the entire planet; he had traveled out of the mud-and-stone village in which he was born to the center of a kingdom that had no roads linking it to the outside world even in the 1950s, and then right into the heart of the twenty-first-century whirlwind. But he always stressed that, like the ""scientist of mind"" who was his root teacher, he had no wish to claim final authority.""Our master gave us liberty to investigate even his own word,"" I would hear him say two years later in Zurich, of the Buddha, ""so I take this liberty fully!"" As a boy he early showed a fascination with all things scientific, fixing the old generator in the Potala Palace in Lhasa, using a telescope left to him by the Thirteenth Dalai Lama and seeing that — contrary to Tibetan teaching — the moon did not generate its own light; delighting (as the Thirteenth Dalai Lama did) in taking watches apart and then trying to put them together again. Even now he kept a plastic model of the brain with labeled, detachable parts on his desk at home and loved to meet scientists who could improve his understanding of the world and mind, in part by disproving his assumptions about them.Excerpted from The Open Road by Pico Iyer Copyright 2008 by Pico Iyer.

"'08-04-07,'0','Iraq's political order is also evolving in hopeful ways. Four out of the six laws cited as benchmarks by the U.S. have been passed by the Iraqi legislature. A law on amnesty and a law rolling back some of the harsher restrictions against former employees of the Iraqi government have made it possible for Iraqis to find genuine reconciliation. They should also encourage both Sunni and Shi'a to feel they have a stake in Iraq's future. The legislature has devolved greater power to local and provincial authorities, where much of the real work of rebuilding Iraqi society is taking place. Much more needs to be done, and Iraq's politicians need to know that we expect them to show the necessary leadership to rebuild their country. For only they can.The job of bringing security to Iraq is not finished. Iraqi forces recently battled in Basra against radical Shi'a militias, supported by Iran, a fight that showed both the progress made by the Iraqi security forces -- a year ago, they could not have carried out such operations on their own -- and the continuing need for coalition support. The situation in southern Iraq remains unsettled. There continues to be a significant flow of money and weaponry from Iran into Diyala Province, Baghdad, Basra and elsewhere in support of the Iranian-backed Special Groups, the Jaish al-Mahdi, and the Badr Organization. Sunni terrorists and insurgents continue to maintain bases in Mosul and elsewhere in Nineveh province.But there is no doubt about the basic reality in Iraq: we are no longer staring into the abyss of defeat, and we can now look ahead to the genuine prospect of success. Success in Iraq is the establishment of a generally peaceful, stable, prosperous, democratic state that poses no threat to its neighbors and contributes to the defeat of terrorists. It is the advance of religious tolerance over violent radicalism. It is a level of security that allows the Iraqi authorities to govern, the average person to live a normal life, and international entities to operate. It is a situation in which the rule of law, after decades of tyranny, takes hold. It is an Iraq where Iraqi forces have the responsibility for enforcing security in their country, and where American troops can return home, with the honor of having secured their country's interests at great personal cost, and helping another people achieve peace and self-determination.Today these goals are within reach. ""Never despair,"" Winston Churchill once said. And we did not despair. We were tested, and we rose to the challenge. Some political leaders close their eyes to the progress that the surge has made possible, and want only to argue about the past. We can have that debate. I profoundly disagree with those who say we would all be better off if we had left Saddam Hussein in power. Americans should be proud that they led the way in removing a vicious dictator and opening the door to freedom, stability, and prosperity in Iraq and across the Middle East.But the question for the next President is not about the past, but about the future and how to secure it. Our most vital security interests are at stake in Iraq. The stability of the entire Middle East, that volatile and critically important region, is at stake. The United States' credibility as a moral and political leader is at stake. How to safeguard those interests is what we should be debating.There are those who today argue for a hasty withdrawal from Iraq. Some would withdraw regardless of the consequences. Others say that we can withdraw now and then return if trouble starts again. What they are really proposing, if they mean what they say, is a policy of withdraw and re-invade. For if we withdraw hastily and irresponsibly, we will guarantee the trouble will come immediately. Our allies, Arab countries, the UN, and the Iraqis themselves will not step up to their responsibilities if we recklessly retreat. I can hardly imagine a more imprudent and dangerous course.Over the past year, the counterinsurgency strategy of General Petraeus has been based on the premise that establishing greater security in Iraq is indispensable to advancing political reconciliation and economic reconstruction; to making diplomatic progress in the region; and to preparing the Iraqi military to assume its responsibilities to defend the sovereignty of Iraq and the authority of its elected government. Should the United States withdraw from Iraq before that level of security is established those goals will be infinitely harder if not impossible to attain. Al Qaedain Iraq will proclaim victory and increase its efforts to provoke sectarian tensions in Iraq into a full scale civil war that could descend into genocide and destabilize the Middle East. Iraq would be a failed state that could become a haven for terrorists to train and plan their operations. Iran's influence in Iraq -- especially southern Iraq -- and throughout the region would increase substantially and encourage other countries to seek accommodation with Tehran at the expense of our interests. These likely consequences of America's failure in Iraq would, almost certainly, require us to return to Iraq or draw us into a wider and far costlier war.The American people deserve the truth from their leaders. They deserve a candid assessment of the progress we have managed to make in the last year in preventing the worst from happening in Iraq, of the very serious difficulties that remain, and of the grave consequences of a hasty, reckless, and irresponsible withdrawal. If we are honest about the opportunities and the risks, I believe they will have the patience to allow us the time necessary to obtain our objectives. That honesty is my responsibility, and it is also the responsibility of Senators Obama and Clinton, as well as Democratic and Republican leaders in Congress. Doing the right thing in the heat of a political campaign is not always the easiest thing. But when 4000 Americans have given their lives so that America does not suffer the worst consequences of our failure in Iraq, it is a necessary thing. In such a grave matter, we must put the nation's interests before our own ambitions.The fact is, we now have a great opportunity, not only to bring stability and freedom to Iraq, but to make Iraq a pillar of our future strategy for the entire region of the greater Middle East. If we seize the opportunity before us, we stand to gain a strong, stable, democratic ally against terrorism and a strong ally against an aggressive and radical Iran.Over the next 18 months, Iraq will conduct two landmark elections -- for provincial governments and for the national government. On my most recent trip to Iraq, I met dozens of shopkeepers, workers, city council officials and others, who want Iraqis from all backgrounds to elect local leaders charged with making decisions that reflect the needs and desires of the local populations -- not the preferences of Baghdad elites. If we sustain the current progress, those elections can be held in relative freedom and security for the first time since the fall of Saddam. We should welcome a larger United Nations role in supporting the elections under the capable leadership of its Special Envoy, Steffan de Mistura, who is already playing a key role in mediating disputes in areas like Kirkuk. Throughout this period, we must continue to help the Iraqis protect themselves against the terrorists and the insurgents. We must press ahead against the radical Shiite militias and the Iranian-backed Special Groups, and support the Iraqi government's efforts to defeat them. We must continue to support the Sunni volunteers of the Iraqi Awakening as they stand up to Al Qaedain Iraq, especially in the ongoing battle for Mosul. And we must continue to build the capacities of the Iraqi Security Forces so that they can play an increasingly strong and neutral role in suppressing sectarian violence.All this will require that we keep a sufficient level of American forces in Iraq until security conditions are such that our commanders on the ground recommend otherwise. It also means we must increase levels of reconstruction assistance, so that Iraq's political and economic development can proceed in the security that our forces and Iraqi Security Forces provide. Above all, it means we must once again reject, as we did in early 2007, the calls for a reckless and irresponsible withdrawal of our forces just at the moment when they are succeeding.Economic progress is essential if the security gains in Iraq are to be sustained. The once silent and deserted markets have come back to life in many areas, but high unemployment rates continue to fuel criminal and insurgent violence. To move young men away from the attractions of well-funded extremists, we need a vibrant, growing Iraqi economy. The Iraqi government can jump-start this process by using a portion of its budget surplus to employ Iraqis in infrastructure projects and in restoring basic services. The international community should augment Iraqi efforts by broadly enhancing the proven success of microfinance programs to spur entrepreneurship at local levels throughout the country and Iraq's Arab neighbors should invest in regional stability by using the fruits of their oil exports to directly invest in Iraq. As these efforts begin to take hold in Iraq, it will be -- as in all countries -- the private sector that creates the vast majority of jobs and propels the growth that will end reliance on outside aid.I do not want to keep our troops in Iraq a minute longer than necessary to secure our interests there. Our goal is an Iraq that can stand on its own as a democratic ally and a responsible force for peace in its neighborhood. Our goal is an Iraq that no longer needs American troops. And I believe we can achieve that goal, perhaps sooner than many imagine. But I do not believe that anyone should make promises as a candidate for President that they cannot keep if elected. To promise a withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, regardless of the calamitous consequences to the Iraqi people, our most vital interests, and the future of the Middle East, is the height of irresponsibility. It is a failure of leadership.I know the pain war causes. I understand the frustration caused by our mistakes in this war. And I regret sincerely the additional sacrifices imposed on the brave Americans who defend us. But I also know the toll a lost war takes on an army and on our country's security. By giving General Petraeus and the men and women he has the honor to command the time and support necessary to succeed in Iraq we have before us a hard road. But it is the right road. It is necessary and just. Those who disregard the unmistakable progress we have made in the last year and the terrible consequences that would ensue were we to abandon our responsibilities in Iraq have chosen another road. It may appear to be the easier course of action, but it is a much more reckless one, and it does them no credit even if it gives them an advantage in the next election.We all respect the sacrifices made by our soldiers. We all mourn the losses they have suffered in this war. But let us honor them by doing all we can to ensure their sacrifices were not made in vain. Let us show an appropriate humility by recognizing that so little is asked of us compared to the burdens we imposed on them, and let us show just a small, but significant measure of their courage, resolve and patriotism by putting our country's interests before every personal or political consideration.War is a terrible thing. You know that better than most; you who have borne the heartache and deprivations of war so that our country might be secure in its freedom. I hold my position on Iraq not because I am indifferent to the suffering caused by this war but because I detest war, and believe sincerely that should we fail in Iraq we will face an even sterner test in the very near future, an even harder war, with even greater sacrifice and heartbreaking loss than we have suffered over the last five years.It is every veteran's hope that should their children be called upon to answer a call to arms, the battle will be necessary and the field well chosen. But that is not their responsibility. It belongs to the government that called them. As it once was for you, their honor will be in their answer not their summons. Whatever we think about how and why we went to war in Iraq, we are all -- those who supported the decision that placed them in harm's way and those who opposed it -- humbled by and grateful for their example. We know how little has been asked of others compared to their service, and the terrible sacrifice made by those who have not returned to the country they loved so well. They now deserve the distinction of the best Americans, and we owe them a debt we can never fully repay. We can only offer the small tribute of our humility and our commitment to do all that we can do, in less trying and costly circumstances, to help keep this nation worthy of their sacrifice.The sacrifices made by veterans deserve to be memorialized in something more lasting than marble or bronze or in the fleeting effect of a politician's speeches. Your valor and devotion to duty have earned your country's abiding concern for your welfare. And when our government forgets to honor our debts to you, it is a stain upon America's honor. The Walter Reed scandal recalled, I hope, not just government but the public who elected it, to our responsibilities to the men and women who risked life and limb to meet their responsibilities to us. Such a disgrace is unworthy of the greatest nation on earth. As the greatest leaders in our history, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, instructed us, care for Americans who fought to defend us should rank among the highest of national priorities.Those who have borne the burden of war for our sake must be treated fairly and expeditiously as they seek compensation for disability or illness. We owe them compassion, knowledge and hands-on care in their transition to civilian life. We owe them training, rehabilitation and education. We owe their families, parents and caregivers our concern and support. They should never be deprived of quality medical care and mental health care coverage for illness or injury incurred as a result of their service to our country.As President, I will do everything in my power to ensure that those who serve today and those who have served in the past have access to the highest quality health, mental health and rehabilitative care in the world. The disgrace of Walter Reed must not be forgotten. Neither should we accept a situation in which veterans are denied access to care due to great travel distances, backlogs of appointments, and years of pending disability evaluation and claims. I believe that we should give veterans the option to use a simple plastic card to receive timely and accessible care at a convenient location through a provider of their choosing. I will not stand for requiring veterans to make an appointment to stand in line to make an appointment to stand in line for substandard care of the injuries you have suffered to keep our country safe. Whatever our commitments to veterans cost, we will keep them, as you have kept every commitment to us. The honor of a great nation is at stake.As we meet, in Iraq and Afghanistan, American soldiers, Marines, sailors and airmen are fighting bravely and tenaciously in battles that are as dangerous, difficult and consequential as the great battles of our armed forces' storied past. Many of them have had their tours extended longer than they were initially told. Others who had already served two or three tours returned to combat sooner than they had been led to expect. It is a sad and hard thing to ask so much more of Americans who have already given more than their fair share to the defense of our country. Few of them and their families would have greeted the news without feeling greatly disappointed, and without offering a few well deserved complaints in the direction of those of us who have imposed on them this additional hardship. Then they shouldered a rifle and risked everything -- everything -- to accomplish their mission, to protect another people's freedom and our own country from harm.It is a privilege beyond measure to live in a country served so well by such selfless patriots. God bless and protect them.'"

"'08-04-07,'0','A federal judge in Houston will hear arguments Wednesday on a motion to disqualify Roger Clemens’s lead lawyer, Rusty Hardin, from representing him in a defamation lawsuit against his former personal trainer Brian McNamee.Richard Emery, a lawyer for McNamee, filed a motion in March to have Hardin removed from the case because he had also represented Andy Pettitte.Emery, a New York civil liberties lawyer, and Hardin, a former prosecutor in Houston, have clashed in the news media throughout the dispute between Clemens and McNamee but have never argued against each other in court.“The judge sent us a memo on Friday indicating he wanted to hear both positions in respect to the disqualification of Hardin,” Emery said Sunday.A spokesman for Hardin declined to comment. When Emery filed the motion to have Hardin removed, he said in court papers that he would call Pettitte as a witness during the trial. His motion also said that Hardin had an ethical commitment to Pettitte because he once represented him and that Hardin could not then question Pettitte on another client’s behalf.In responding to the motion, Hardin said that he represented Pettitte for only four days. He also said he would have another lawyer question Pettitte if Pettitte were called as a witness.“Judges have a lot of room to accommodate these conflicts, including disqualification,” said Daniel C. Richman, a former federal prosecutor. “If Pettitte is a witness in another case, including a criminal matter, then that judge would have to decide whether Hardin could still represent Clemens.”'"
"'08-04-07,'0','KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Is Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice campaigning to be John McCain’s running mate? If so, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said on Sunday that he had not noticed.“I missed those signals,” Mr. McCain told reporters on his campaign plane en route to Kansas City.Nonetheless, Mr. McCain took a few moments to compliment Ms. Rice. “I think she’s a great American, I think there’s very little that I can say that isn’t anything but the utmost praise for a great American citizen, who served as a role model to so many millions of people in this country and around the world,” Mr. McCain said, adding that “her overall record is very, very meritorious.”Mr. McCain was responding to questions from reporters about comments made on the ABC program “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” by Dan Senor, a former military spokesman for coalition forces in Baghdad. Mr. Senor said Ms. Rice spoke last week before an unusual forum for a secretary of state: a meeting of economic conservatives led by Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.“Condi Rice has been actively, actually in recent weeks, campaigning for this,” Mr. Senor said.Ms. Rice has said she was not interested in being vice president.Mr. McCain, who has been critical of the Bush administration’s handling of Iraq, told reporters that Ms. Rice, who was national security adviser during the first year and a half of the conflict, bore some responsibility for the management of the war.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','For its part, Microsoft has insisted it sees no reason to raise its bid, because Yahoo, which has discussed alternative deals with other companies, has no competing offers.“Basically Microsoft infers that Yahoo has no alternative deals in the offing, therefore there is no need to raise its price,” said Michael Klausner, a Stanford Law School professor who specializes in corporate law and governance. “Microsoft still prefers a negotiated deal to a proxy fight.”Mr. Ballmer’s letter puts pressure on the board to act quickly or face the possibility that they will fail to get the best deal possible for Yahoo shareholders, Mr. Klausner said.But waging a battle over board seats while offering a lower price for Yahoo could prove to be a gamble for Microsoft. In recent weeks, many large Yahoo shareholders have indicated that they would favor a deal with Microsoft, at a slightly higher price. It is not clear that Yahoo shareholders would be happy with a deal at the current price, let alone at a price that is even lower.Still, some experts in mergers and acquisitions say that without an alternative, Yahoo shareholders are likely to vote in favor of a Microsoft offer, even if it is lower.“Although shareholders may not be happy with a move like that, in general they will support a premium bid,” said Morton A. Pierce, who heads the mergers and acquisitions practice at Dewey & LeBoeuf, a law firm in New York.Still, Mr. Pierce says that Microsoft may still raise its bid. “Generally in situations like these, people will bump their offer to avoid the monetary and social cost of going through a proxy contest,” he said.In his letter, Mr. Ballmer noted that in the last two months, the stock market had declined and Yahoo’s business appears to have deteriorated. He also said that Yahoo had adopted a plan to retain employees in the event of a merger that would make Microsoft’s acquisition even more costly.“By any fair measure, the large premium we offered in January is even more significant today,” Mr. Ballmer wrote. “We believe that the majority of your shareholders share this assessment, even after reviewing your public disclosures relating to your future prospects.”But Yahoo has disputed the notion that its business is deteriorating. In a presentation to investors in mid-March, executives reaffirmed their earlier financial projections for 2008 and put forward bullish growth forecasts for the next three years.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','To avoid future problems, Mr. Simitian has introduced a bill to ensure that trees planted before solar panels are installed have a right to grow in peace. If he succeeds, the state that legalized medical marijuana may soon do the same for shade.The solar-redwoods dispute is unusual largely because it is a solar-panel owner who is mounting the challenge. Typically, solar-panel owners have to play defense.For example, despite a 1980 Arizona law to protect homeowners who install photovoltaic panels, Henry Speak, a retiree in Avondale, Ariz., had to battle his homeowners’ association through a series of state courts to keep his rooftop solar system without adding expensive screening — screening that, like the redwoods, would have reduced the panels’ efficiency.On both sides of the Sunnyvale backyard fence, there is evidence of environmental virtue — one Prius (Ms. Bissett and Mr. Treanor), one electric car (the Vargases), one water-free xeriscaped front yard with recycled-plastic borders (Ms. Bissett and Mr. Treanor), 128 solar panels providing almost all the power for one home (the Vargases), and eight carbon-dioxide-sipping, bird-friendly redwood trees in various stages of growth (Ms. Bissett and Mr. Treanor).But putting the eco-accent of the feud aside, other elements of the story have universal resonance.Carolynn Bissett, 48, a contracts administrator for the City of Palo Alto, moved back into her childhood home with her new husband in the mid-1990s. The house once backed onto a cherry orchard, but they found the orchard gone, replaced by large two-story houses, one of which was 17 feet from their lot.Mark Vargas, 38, moved into that house in 1993 and began raising a family that now includes three children. He put a hot tub in the small backyard and planted a bit of corn that thrived in the southern sun.There was little communication between the neighbors — until Ms. Bissett introduced three redwood trees in 1996. In the next five years, she planted five more. As they grew, the ribbon of Mr. Vargas’s backyard got less sunlight; the corn was abandoned.In 2001, Mr. Vargas installed solar panels on his roof and on a trellis over his hot tub. He then informed his neighbors — brusquely, they say — about the solar shade law, saying they must cut down all of the redwoods. He says he asked them politely to remove the trees and offered to pay for removal and replacement.There were efforts to invoke local ordinances. Did Mr. Vargas get a permit for his solar system? Did the redwood roots interfere with a municipal storm drain easement? The backyard fence runs along the border between the cities of Sunnyvale and Santa Clara, doubling the number of agencies involved.Mr. Vargas got no satisfaction until, in 2005, the deputy district attorney, John Fioretta, began the first prosecution under the Solar Shade Act. It ended in December with the conviction of Ms. Bissett and Mr. Treanor by Judge Kurt Kumli of Santa Clara County Superior Court.The judge found that Trees Nos. 4, 5 and 6, which cast little shade when the solar panels were installed, were now collectively blocking more than 10 percent of the panels over the hot tub. Trees Nos. 1, 2 and 3 shaded the area when the panels were installed, so they were exempt, and Trees Nos. 7 and 8 did not violate the law, the judge ruled.Mr. Treanor and Ms. Bissett said that after spending $37,000 on legal fees, they had no money left for an appeal. Last month, to comply with the order — even though Judge Kumli said he found it hard to call the trees a “nuisance” — the couple called the pruners. The judge postponed a decision on whether the pruning of Tree No. 6 was sufficient until after Dec. 21, the winter solstice this year, when the sun is lowest in the sky and the trees cast maximum shade.Mr. Treanor and Ms. Bissett still do not quite believe what happened. “It was like I’d been hit in the chest,” Ms. Bissett said of her reaction upon opening the envelope that contained the criminal charge.Mr. Vargas said it all could have been avoided. “My entire goal was to find a more appropriate tree to place between our two properties,” he said. “To have a 60-foot barrier is unreasonable.”He said he was consulting his lawyer about filing a civil suit, possibly related to the storm-drain easement.“We hear him typing away at night,” Ms. Bissett said.Meanwhile, Senator Simitian’s bill is headed for a committee vote this month. It determines when trees can grow amid solar panels (if they are planted ahead of time) and when they cannot (if they are planted after a solar-panel is installed). The state, Mr. Simitian pointed out, has a law to encourage the construction of one million solar roofs. “I’m trying to avoid a million neighborhood arguments,” he said.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','“There’s very little margin of safety,” said Mike Simonton, senior director at Fitch Ratings. “The company needs to execute asset sales and cost cuts in order to make its debt service payments and offset the significant revenue declines.”Mr. Zell understands that. He had criticized the previous management for repeatedly cutting newspaper staffs, but under him, the Tribune Company has eliminated more than 400 jobs at The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, Newsday, The Baltimore Sun, The Orlando Sentinel, The Hartford Courant and other papers.“I have discussed with many of you our mutual concern about the cyclical eroding of content quality to meet budgets manufactured in the corporate office,” he wrote in a staff memo in February. “I promise you, in time, we will end that downward spiral.”Mr. Zell and the company declined to comment for this article, but they have scheduled a conference call with bankers and journalists on April 17 to discuss Tribune’s finances.Meanwhile, he has been making business moves and rallying the troops, supplying what analysts and Tribune executives say are healthy ideas and a needed sense of urgency. He has dashed around the country to Tribune newspapers and television stations, warning that a somnolent corporate culture had better get moving.At a company known for its cautious pace, he has made quick decisions and given more authority to managers who felt hamstrung by the top-down style of the old regime.But at times, his message has been overshadowed by confrontational or provocative statements. He told reporters in Washington, D.C., that there were far too many of them, and said to employees they should be free to look at explicit Web sites while at work. He has also told journalists that they must be part of the quest for revenue, an unsettling prospect for people in a line of work who have prided themselves on remaining apart from their employers’ business concerns.When Tribune agreed to an $8.2 billion takeover offer from Mr. Zell in April 2007, many analysts said the price was high and left little maneuvering room.“This thing looked shaky from the start,” said Ken Doctor, lead analyst with Outsell. “It looked worse by the time the deal closed in December, and it’s gotten worse since then.”But Mr. Zell was not taking on much of the risk. He put up $315 million, and the company borrowed the rest. Tribune’s stock is now held by an employee stock ownership plan. That makes the company tax-exempt, partially offsetting the interest payments, but as profits dwindle, so do the tax savings. Tribune reported $87 million in net income last year, down from $594 million in 2006. And the company cannot escape capital gains tax on asset sales until it has been tax-exempt for 10 years.Since Mr. Zell made his bid for Tribune, things have been worse for newspapers than many predicted, with advertising revenue down almost 8 percent in 2007 and 2008 off to a poor start.Tribune’s papers fared worse yet, losing 10.5 percent of ad revenue last year. Even so, the company’s operating margins were healthy by industry standards. What sets Tribune apart is its debt burden. Its debt service bill this year is almost $1 billion, not including a $650 million balloon payment from the takeover financing that is due in December, and one for $750 million due in mid-2009.Last year, the company had earnings (before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) of about $1.2 billion. But 2008 is expected to be more difficult, and the company’s bond covenants require it to have earnings around $1.1 billion or risk being declared in default — even if it has the cash to make its interest payments.Tribune’s credit rating has slipped several notches below investment grade, and its bonds are trading far below their face value, signaling that the market sees a high risk of default. The company’s long-term, unsecured debt can be bought for less than 50 cents on the dollar.Despite these problems, some of Mr. Zell’s strategic moves have been praised by some industry analysts. Tribune created a subsidiary to combine and streamline back-office operations of television stations, and sold Tribune’s Hollywood production studios and some related real estate for $125 million. It merged the online operations of a Miami television station, WSFL, and the Fort Lauderdale newspaper, The Sun-Sentinel.The company shifted a San Diego station, KSWB, from the CW network to affiliation with the more lucrative Fox network, and gave The Baltimore Sun the go-ahead to start a youth-oriented tabloid. Several stations have new general managers, and The Orlando Sentinel has an interim publisher.Tribune has replaced most of the company’s upper management, hiring some highly regarded television executives, and also some from the radio and music industries who have no experience in television or newspapers. One of the latter, Lee Abrams, the chief innovation officer, has already gained something of a reputation with long, rambling, excited e-mail messages to the staff, loaded with references to the history of rock ’n’ roll, that have left people scratching their heads.“If we can morph the Soul of Dylan ... with the innovation of Apple and the eccentric-all-the-way-to-the-bank of Bill Veeck, the WORLD will be a better place,” he wrote in one missive.Still, a Tribune executive who, like others interviewed, declined to speak on the record, said, “I think that people are energized, where before they felt nobody could make any decisions, but there is still a healthy amount of skepticism and they know it’s going to be very hard.”An equity analyst who follows the company said, “These mostly look like smart moves, but they might only help on the margins.”Things have not gone according to plan for Mr. Zell on several fronts.Last year, he said he did not want to part with any newspapers, but he recently began fielding offers for Newsday, based in Melville, N.Y.He set out to sell the Cubs and their home, Wrigley Field, and Tribune executives talked of reaching a deal in 2007. But the talks have been slowed by the complex arrangements Mr. Zell is seeking, and Tribune executives now say the team might not be sold until after the baseball season ends in October.He wants to sell the ballpark to a state agency, the team to a private buyer, and possibly the naming rights to the field to a third buyer. And he has insisted that a stadium deal has to be in place before he negotiates for the team.Tribune put out word last month that it might sell Newsday, and three newspaper publishers with properties nearby signaled that they want it — Mortimer B. Zuckerman, owner of The Daily News; Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, which publishes The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal; and the Observer Media Group, which publishes The New York Observer. The Dolan family, owners of Cablevision, Madison Square Garden, the Knicks and the Rangers, have also expressed interest.People advising potential buyers said the price for Newsday could exceed $500 million. But they also said that as with the Cubs, Mr. Zell has included an unusual twist that could delay a deal.To minimize Tribune’s capital gains tax bill, they said, Mr. Zell wants much of the payment to be noncash and possibly deferred, most likely involving a real estate transfer.Selling the Cubs and Wrigley makes sense because they could fetch a high price but do not generate proportionate income. Tribune executives have talked about reaping as much as $1 billion for the team, the ballpark and the naming rights.Analysts say Tribune might also sell another valuable asset that is not part of the core business, its stake in the Food Network.But Newsday seems like the kind of property a long-term owner would want to keep if he could. It is part of the core business — the newspaper business that Mr. Zell said he wanted to be a part of — and has the kind of cash flow the company will need for years as it pays off its bonds.As Mr. Simonton of Fitch put it, “There is absolutely a paradox there.”'"
"'08-04-07,'0','Skybus Airlines, a low-fare carrier that started operations less than a year ago, filed for bankruptcy after stopping service.The airline is the third to seek bankruptcy in the last two and a half weeks on rising fuel costs and a slowing economy, joining the Aloha Airgroup and ATA Airlines.

"'08-04-07,'0','Marilyn Monroe has been labeled many things. Some have been flattering and some derogatory, but none have been as potentially costly as what her own estate has called her: a New Yorker. Judge Margaret Morrow of Federal District Court in Los Angeles has ruled that because Marilyn Monroe LLC had argued to California tax authorities that the actress was a New York resident, Monroe could not have been a Californian when she died. As so Monroe becomes subject to legislation in New York, where her rights of publicity ended with her death in 1962, rather than in California, where her rights of publicity continue after death and can be bequeathed. The decision makes it possible to reproduce Monroe’s image without having to pay licensing fees worth millions of dollars to her estate. “Marilyn Monroe LLC lacks standing to assert any right of publicity in Marilyn Monroe,” said Surjit Soni, a lawyer representing families of photographers who own images of Monroe. “For nearly 25 years they have been unlawfully extracting license fees from content providers and legitimate businesses that have wanted to use her photograph or name in connection with profits.” According to a statement, Monroe’s estate plans to appeal the ruling. The suit was brought in March 2005 and, as a result, California clarified its legislation regarding dead celebrities’ publicity rights in October 2007.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','“Plastic Card Tricks” (editorial, March 29) suggests that pending federal credit card legislation provides a perfect antidote to America’s recent economic woes.But the bills, rather than delivering the “reasonable changes” that your editorial espouses, would effectively demolish risk-based management — an essential pricing tool card issuers use to base interest rates on a user’s likelihood to repay.Risk-based management makes common sense. Just as safe drivers pay lower premiums, people with good credit habits should enjoy the best rates.The legislation’s proponents claim to protect consumers, but these bills would have negative consequences for virtually every American with a credit card. If companies can’t precisely assess risk, interest rates will increase for everyone except the most negligent credit card users.Additionally, consumers will have less access to credit — at a time when some Americans, befallen by economic hardship, may need it most.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','As was widely reported last week, there seems to be no crisis of confidence in the high-end housing market of New York. In the first three months of this year, average apartment prices in Manhattan rose by 33.5 percent to $1.7 million — and much of that increase was carried by the boom in sales of apartments at the high end. In the same period, the number of apartments that closed for more than $10 million, for example, rose by 318 percent, according to calculations based on public records and provided by Brown Harris Stevens, a luxury residential real estate firm.Not that even those kinds of prices promise perfection. The front door of the Essex House duplex — 2,800 square feet going for close to $10 million — opened up on a stairway whose Champagne-colored carpet looked dingy. A telltale towel on a windowsill revealed a leak, and there was an excess of mirrors on part of the first-floor ceiling, with predictable results. Anyone in the market for a $10 million home would inevitably renovate anyway, but it was surprising — no, it was heartening — to see that even buyers with that kind of money have to endure a boring bit of patter from the broker about the repointing work being done to the exterior.“Where are the sellers from?” asked the prospective buyer, looking skeptically at a tall, husklike sculpture in the bedroom. California, the broker told him. “That explains it,” he said.The availability of new luxury housing like 15 Central Park West and the Plaza accounts for much of the high-end real estate boom — but how to explain that in those buildings, priced at $5,000 to $6,000 a square foot, bidding wars are still not uncommon, even as the economy wobbles, from many reports, on the edge of a precipice?“Scarcity,” said Nancy Candib, the broker showing the duplex.The subprime mortgage fiasco may be complicated, but the high-end real estate market is not: There are still more people who can afford to have it all than there are apartments that actually have it all — the views, the space, the prime location and the amenities.This is what makes New York sometimes feel unlivable: the notion that you can be asked to spend close to $10 million on an apartment with a leaky window, or $6 million on one with low ceilings and no views, and still have to pay $275,000 for storage, as was the case with one apartment viewed last week on the Upper East Side. You could even walk out of 15 Central Park West, as the wife of an electronics magnate did last week, feeling disappointed in the cramped kitchen of an apartment going for $15 million.But those absurdities are also part of New York’s shiny allure. This is a city so well populated by the super wealthy, even they are forced to compromise. New York promises the attainability, in all economies, of untold affluence; it’s everywhere, there for the making or taking. It advertises the possibility of wealth, as well as the consoling limitations of what it can buy, all in one real estate market.The former publisher left the Essex House apartment expressing enthusiasm mostly for the possibility of that elevator. The lack of a terrace, not his stock portfolio, might be what held him back.As for the wife of the electronics entrepreneur, she wasn’t in a hurry to decide.“I think the prices are going to start coming down in a few months,” she said, explaining why she’d wait before making an offer. If the high-end market does soften, it probably won’t be because of the buyers’ financial anxiety.“I think we’re heading for a period of really dark times,” she said.From her point of view, the market could only get better.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','“Teams are going to make runs,” Wiggins said. “What we’re best at is not letting it discourage us, pulling ourselves together and saying, Let’s stop that.”Stanford had been seeded second in the Spokane Region, behind Maryland, the 2006 national champion. Many believed the Cardinal deserved the No. 1 seed, and that perceived slight clearly fueled the team through the N.C.A.A. tournament.“Giving us a No. 2 seed was the best thing they could have done for us,” Pedersen, a freshman, said. “It gave us an extra push to show the East Coast what we’re all about.”UConn held only one lead, at 3-2. Maya Moore, the Huskies’ all-American freshman forward, seemed uninvolved early, then recovered to finish with 20 points and 9 rebounds. But it was insufficient. Guard Ketia Swanier fell into foul trouble, which restricted the Huskies’ ability to shadow Wiggins. And much of the night, the Huskies seemed rushed, uncertain. Moore and guard Renee Montgomery shot 4 of 20 on 3-point attempts.“Stanford executed their offense well, and we didn’t hit shots,” Swanier said.Sometimes, despite the complexities of the game, it really is that simple to explain.“Life’s thrown a lot of things at us this season,” UConn Coach Geno Auriemma said. “It took away two players. The fairy tale didn’t have a happy ending. That’s life.”Stanford won national titles under Coach Tara VanDerveer in 1990 and 1992, but it had not been in the Final Four since 1997. In the meantime, it suffered the most ignominious loss in the men’s or women’s N.C.A.A. tournament, losing as a No. 1 seed to 16th-seeded Harvard in 1998.“In some ways, when you have something taken away from you, maybe it makes you appreciate it more,” VanDerveer said.A rainstorm before Sunday’s game left water dripping onto the court near one of the 3-point lines. A bucket was hung from the ceiling of the St. Pete Times Forum to catch the leak. Something slightly larger would have been needed to collect all of UConn’s early errant shots.The Huskies missed 12 of their first 18 attempts from the field and never caught up. Moore seemed bothered early by the shorter but insistent Stanford guard J J Hones and was held in check by a rotating cadre of Cardinal players. Moore did not attempt a shot for the first six and a half minutes and did not make her first basket until 7:14 remained in the opening half. By then, the Huskies trailed by 27-22.Defensively, the Huskies were flustered by the constant motion, superb passing and open shooting of Stanford’s triangle offense. The Cardinal lost, 66-54, to Connecticut in November at a tournament in the Virgin Islands, but this Stanford team barely resembles that one with its revamped offense and the explosive play in the tournament of Wiggins.“We have gone from a caterpillar to a butterfly,” VanDerveer said of her team’s improvement.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','“There is a marketing problem here,” said Michael Glynn, an analyst with Credit Suisse who has also raised broader concerns about the future of Healthways and the disease management industry.The stock took an additional beating in February over concerns about the loss of one of its customers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, which decided to run its disease-management operations itself. The relationship is scheduled to end in December.Healthways insists that Medicare’s analysis so far does not reflect the company’s success in helping patients. The company has written a letter to Medicare in which it says it “calls into question both the content and conclusions” the agency had made public. And the company has enlisted members of Congress to help persuade the agency to continue the experiment beyond the scheduled end of the first phase in December.Healthways’ chief executive, Ben R. Leedle Jr., said he was unable to comment more specifically about the company’s results. But the company has told investors that it is now projecting a loss on the experiment, although Healthways continues to be profitable.Last year, the company earned $45 million, or $1.22 a share, on $616 million in revenue for the year ended Aug. 31. The company is telling analysts and investors to expect fiscal 2008 earnings a share to be in the neighborhood of $1.50 to $1.55.Healthways insists that among corporate customers it has amply demonstrated the value of its services, which involve having nurses at telephone call centers talk to patients about how best to control their diseases. Mr. Glynn, the analyst, predicts companies like Healthways will also face increased competition from others in managing the care of the chronically ill, including health insurers.Others are experimenting with different methods of disease management, some of which are more focused on using doctors to coordinate patients’ care.Healthways has tried to reassure investors and analysts that there continues to be increasing demand for its services, including outside the United States in countries like Germany and Brazil. And it points to some new customers that it has recently signed up, like Abbott Laboratories and Caterpillar.While there is no consensus about Healthways’ stock outlook among Wall Street analysts, Mr. Glynn says the shares may have been punished enough. He has a neutral rating on the stock, which closed at $35.62 on Friday.'"
"'08-04-07,'0','The statement added: “We consider your threat to commence an unsolicited offer and proxy contest to displace our independent board members to be counterproductive and inconsistent with your stated objective of a friendly transaction. We are confident that our stockholders understand that our independent board is best positioned to objectively and knowledgeably evaluate our company’s alternatives and to maximize value.”Senior executives from the companies have met on two occasions since Microsoft made its offer public on Feb. 1, but they have not entered formal negotiations. Yahoo rejected Microsoft’s offer, saying it “substantially undervalues” the company.“We are open to all alternatives that maximize stockholder value,” Yahoo said in its statement. “To be clear, this includes a transaction with Microsoft if it represents a price that fully recognizes the value of Yahoo on a standalone basis and to Microsoft, is superior to our other alternatives, and provides certainty of value and certainty of closing.”Yahoo said in its letter Monday that board has asked Microsoft for information on antitrust issues and other matters but complained that Microsoft has failed to respond.For its part, Microsoft has insisted it sees no reason to raise its bid, because Yahoo, which has discussed alternative deals with other companies, has no competing offers.“Basically Microsoft infers that Yahoo has no alternative deals in the offing, therefore there is no need to raise its price,” said Michael Klausner, a Stanford Law School professor who specializes in corporate law and governance. “Microsoft still prefers a negotiated deal to a proxy fight.”Mr. Ballmer’s letter puts pressure on the board to act quickly or face the possibility that they will fail to get the best deal possible for Yahoo shareholders, Mr. Klausner said.But waging a battle over board seats while offering a lower price for Yahoo could prove to be a gamble for Microsoft. In recent weeks, many large Yahoo shareholders have indicated that they would favor a deal with Microsoft, at a slightly higher price. It is not clear that Yahoo shareholders would be happy with a deal at the current price, let alone at a price that is even lower.Still, some experts in mergers and acquisitions say that without an alternative, Yahoo shareholders are likely to vote in favor of a Microsoft offer, even if it is lower.“Although shareholders may not be happy with a move like that, in general they will support a premium bid,” said Morton A. Pierce, who heads the mergers and acquisitions practice at Dewey & LeBoeuf, a law firm in New York.Still, Mr. Pierce says that Microsoft may still raise its bid. “Generally in situations like these, people will bump their offer to avoid the monetary and social cost of going through a proxy contest,” he said.In his letter, Mr. Ballmer noted that in the last two months, the stock market had declined and Yahoo’s business appears to have deteriorated. He also said that Yahoo had adopted a plan to retain employees in the event of a merger that would make Microsoft’s acquisition even more costly.“By any fair measure, the large premium we offered in January is even more significant today,” Mr. Ballmer wrote. “We believe that the majority of your shareholders share this assessment, even after reviewing your public disclosures relating to your future prospects.”But Yahoo has disputed the notion that its business is deteriorating. In a presentation to investors in mid-March, executives reaffirmed their earlier financial projections for 2008 and put forward bullish growth forecasts for the next three years.“This plan has received positive feedback from our stockholders, further strengthening the view that Yahoo is worth well more as a standalone company than the value offered in your proposal, and would be even more valuable to Microsoft,” Yahoo said in its statement.'"

"'08-04-08,'0','Much, much more needs to be done. And Iraq's leaders need to know that we expect them to show the necessary leadership to rebuild their country, for only they can. But today it is possible to talk with real hope and optimism about the future of Iraq and the outcome of our efforts there.But while the job of bringing security to Iraq is not finished, as the recent fighting in Basra and elsewhere vividly demonstrated, we're no longer staring into the abyss of defeat and we can now look ahead to the genuine prospect of success. Success, the establishment of a peaceful, stable, prosperous, democratic state that poses no threats to its neighbors and contributes to the defeat of terrorists, this success is within reach. And with success, Iraqi forces can take responsibility for enforcing security in their countries, and American troops can return home with the honor of having secured their country's interests at great personal costs and of helping another people achieve peace and self-determination.That's what I hope every American desires for our country in our mission in Iraq. Yet should the United States instead choose to withdraw from Iraq before adequate security is established, we will exchange for this victory a defeat that is terrible and long-lasting. Al Qaeda in Iraq would proclaim victory and increase its efforts to provoke sectarian tensions, pushing for a full-scale civil war that could descend into genocide and destabilize the Middle East. Iraq would become a failed state. It could become a haven for terrorists to train and plan their operations. Iranian influence would increase substantially in Iraq and encourage other countries to seek accommodation with Tehran at the expense of our interests.An American failure would almost certainly require us to return to Iraq or draw us into a wider and far, far costlier war. If, on the other hand, we and the Iraqis are able to build on the opportunity provided by recent successes, we have the chance to leave in Iraq a force for stability and freedom, not conflict and chaos. In doing so, we will --SENATOR LEVIN: (Sounds gavel.) We're going to ask you, please, to sit down. No more demonstrations, or if there is another one, we're going to have to ask our Capitol Police to remove any demonstrations.SENATOR MCCAIN: I have had this experience previously, Mr. Chairman. (Laughs.)If, on the other hand, we and the Iraqis are able to build on the opportunity provided by recent successes, we have the chance to leave in Iraq a force for stability and freedom, not conflict and chaos. In doing so, we will ensure that the terrible price we have paid in the war, a price that has made all of us sick at heart, has not been paid in vain. Our troops can leave behind a successful mission, and our nation can leave behind a country that contributes to the security of America and the world.To do this, we must continue to help the Iraqis protect themselves against the terrorists and the insurgents. We must press ahead against al Qaeda, the radical Shi'ite militias -- Shi'a militias, and the Iranian-backed special groups. We must continue to support the Sunni volunteers, the Iraqi Awakening, as they stand up to al Qaeda in Iraq.And we must continue to build the capacity of the Iraqi security forces, so they can play an ever stronger and more neutral role in suppressing violence. This means rejecting, as we did in 2007, the calls for a reckless and irresponsible withdrawal of our forces at the moment when they are succeeding.I do not want to keep our troops in Iraq a minute longer than necessary to secure our interest there. Our goal, my goal, is an Iraq that no longer needs American troops. And I believe we can achieve that goal, perhaps sooner than many imagine. But I also believe that the promise of withdrawal of our forces, regardless of the consequences, would constitute a failure of political and moral leadership.Achieving our goals in Iraq will require much more than a military effort. The Arab neighbors should increase their investment and engagement, including an overdue dispatch of ambassadors to Baghdad. We should encourage greater United Nations involvement, building on the work its representatives have done on the Kirkuk issue.The Iraqis must continue the reconciliation that has helped dampen violence over recent months. And they need to move a portion of their growing budget surpluses into job creation programs, move toward an end to their reliance on outside sources of aid and look for other ways to take on more of the financial burdens currently borne by American taxpayers. This is especially important as the government of Iraq continues to take in revenues it finds difficult to disburse through its own government channels.One way they might begin to do this is by contributing significantly to the Commanders Emergency Response Program, CERP, which pays for employment and reconstruction projects throughout the country. This is a start. Other programs of this type can and should be funded by the Iraqis themselves.By giving our men and women in uniform the time and support necessary to succeed in Iraq, we have before us a hard road. It is a privilege beyond measure to live in a country served so well by these individuals. The sacrifices made by these patriots and their families are incredibly great. Yet the alternative path is, in the end, the far costlier one.As we convene this hearing and as we continue to debate our future in Iraq, Americans continue to risk everything -- everything -- to accomplish their mission on our behalf. With the untold costs of their failure and the benefits offered by success, the Congress must not choose to lose in Iraq. We should choose instead to succeed.'"

"'08-04-08,'0','“Geoff Garin is the straightest shooter,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, one of many Democratic senators Mr. Garin has advised. “He doesn’t try to shift the numbers or slant the numbers to buttress his argument.”The numbers facing the campaign are foreboding. Mrs. Clinton, of New York, trails Mr. Obama, of Illinois, by more than 160 pledged delegates and has seen her lead in committed superdelegates shrink by about one per day since the Feb. 5 coast-to-coast series of contests. Mrs. Clinton’s campaign on Monday sought to reassure supporters, contributors and delegates that her candidacy would withstand — and be rejuvenated by — its second leadership shake-up in two months.With the ouster of Mr. Penn as chief strategist, Mr. Garin will share duties in coordinating Mrs. Clinton’s message with Howard Wolfson, the campaign’s communications director. Mr. Penn, a leading adviser to the Clintons since 1996, relinquished his role on Sunday after apologizing for holding talks with officials of the Colombian government about a trade treaty with the United States that Mrs. Clinton opposes.The refurbished Clinton team faces challenges on two fronts: trying to contain fallout from union members and other blue-collar workers who are essential to her success, and seeking to persuade key supporters and donors that Mr. Penn’s removal can bring fresh energy. Gerald W. McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, a union that has campaigned vigorously for Mrs. Clinton, said he called her Saturday and urged her to fire Mr. Penn.“Penn’s presence in the campaign has been a public distraction,” Mr. McEntee said in an interview. “It sends a mixed message on Nafta and the Colombia trade deal, and we’re glad to see him go.”Mrs. Clinton spent Monday in Washington out of public view, huddling with advisers about the Pennsylvania primary on April 22 and other contests. In an appearance on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” which was taped Friday, Mrs. Clinton vowed to continue fighting in “a lot of states that haven’t voted yet.”The campaign dispatched former President Bill Clinton to one such battleground, Puerto Rico, which selects delegates on June 1. Traveling with Mr. Clinton, Terry McAuliffe, the campaign’s chairman, hailed Mr. Garin’s elevation by saying “it’s always good to get some new ideas.”Mr. Garin, 54, joined the Clinton campaign several weeks ago to augment strategy. His elevation could herald a less negative tone as the candidate tries to catch Mr. Obama.Inside the Clinton team, Mr. Penn advocated increasingly sharp attacks on Mr. Obama as Mrs. Clinton’s best option. Long before he joined the campaign, Mr. Garin argued that her route to success lay more in presenting her strengths than in assailing her opponent.“The sweet spot a campaign needs to hit is the intersection between what makes the candidate special and what the voters feel they need,” he explained, praising Mrs. Clinton’s values, spunk and resilience.Recalling a recent meeting with Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Garin said: “I had the same reaction so many people have: I wish everyone could see her this way. If we could help make that happen, that would be great.”A native of Long Island, Mr. Garin put off law school after Harvard to work for Representative John Heinz of Pennsylvania, the sort of liberal Republican Mr. Garin says “doesn’t exist in the world any longer.”After a stint on Mr. Heinz’s staff when he went to the Senate, Mr. Garin joined the polling firm of Peter Hart, a fellow Democrat.Since then, Mr. Garin has worked with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, Congressional campaign committees, organized labor and feminist groups, and on several presidential campaigns, including that of Senator Bob Graham of Florida and Gen. Wesley K. Clark, retired.“He’s not someone who takes some ideology into a campaign,” said Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant who has worked alongside Mr. Garin.Ellen Malcolm, a Clinton backer who is the president of Emily’s List, a political action committee that supports women running as Democrats, called Mr. Garin “very smart, very strategic, very measured.”An ardent fan of the Washington Nationals, Mr. Garin cast his campaign role as that of “the seventh-inning guy, instead of the starter.” But his genial relationships throughout the party may offer some reassurance that the endgame of the nomination fight will not prove as damaging to Democratic hopes in the fall as some have feared.“I don’t want there to be a thermonuclear climax,” he said. “Senator Clinton is committed to having a united Democratic Party at the end of this process. Senator Obama is committed to having a united Democratic Party at the end of this process. And we will have a united Democratic Party at the end of this process.”'"
"'08-04-08,'0','Mrs. Clinton made the issue the focus of some advertisements and went on to win the primary on March 4 by a sizable margin.Now Mr. Obama’s labor backers are trying to turn the tables.“Trade is the No. 1 issue in Pennsylvania,” said James P. Hoffa, president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which has endorsed Mr. Obama.Mr. Hoffa said Mr. Penn hurt Mrs. Clinton’s campaign when he met Colombian officials in his position as chief executive of Burson-Marsteller, the global public relations firm.Colombia had hired Mr. Penn in an effort to reach a free trade agreement with the United States. Many labor leaders oppose the agreement because they say Bogotá has done too little to stop the assassinations of union officials.“If Hillary is going to have any credibility on the trade issue,” Mr. Hoffa said, “she can’t have strategists on her staff who are lobbying for trade agreements like the one with Colombia.”Mr. Hoffa said it was not enough for Mr. Penn to leave as chief strategist. He called on Mrs. Clinton to end his role as an adviser and pollster, as well.Mr. Hoffa said labor leaders were already uneasy about Mrs. Clinton on trade, saying he remembered when she had helped her husband push for passage of Nafta when he was president.Mrs. Clinton’s labor supporters say the Obama forces are misguided to question her toughness on trade. At a political conference of the state A.F.L.-C.I.O. last week in Philadelphia, she emphatically denounced the free trade agreement with Colombia that President Bush has endorsed.“Her opposition to the Colombian trade deal has been pretty clear and unequivocal,” said Kathleen Strand, Mrs. Clinton’s communications director in Pennsylvania.Gerald McEntee, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and Mrs. Clinton’s most outspoken union advocate, also defended her.“Hillary Clinton has taken the right positions with regard to trade,” Mr. McEntee said.He said he remembered her telling him in the early 1990s that she hoped Nafta would be defeated.“She said she didn’t think it could work, and she was against it,” Mr. McEntee said.Yet Mr. McEntee acknowledged phoning Mrs. Clinton on Saturday to urge her to fire Mr. Penn.“Penn’s presence in the campaign has been a public distraction,” Mr. McEntee said. “It sends a mixed message on Nafta and the Colombia trade deal.”Mrs. Clinton’s role in the Nafta passage came under renewed scrutiny last month when the National Archives released her appointments calendar. It showed that she had attended events where the Clinton administration had promoted Nafta.“There has always been doubt where she was on Nafta because of her husband,” said Bill George, president of the Pennsylvania A.F.L.-C.I.O.Mr. George said the Penn case would put Mrs. Clinton on the defensive over the next week. He predicted that she might be able to put it behind her before the April 22 primary.Some political experts said most Pennsylvanians were less concerned about trade than union leaders, who often represent workers in the industries hardest hit by trade deals.“Pennsylvania lost a lot of steel jobs in the ’80s, before Nafta,” said G. Terry Madonna, a professor of public policy at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. “Jobs are always important in our state. But trade is not as important as labor leaders say.”'"
"'08-04-08,'0','“Many participants thought some contraction in economic activity in the first half of 2008 now appeared likely,” the minutes said.The March 18 meeting took place less than 48 hours after the Fed engineered an unprecedented bailout of Bear Stearns, the investment bank that nearly collapsed amid speculation that it had run out of money.Fed officials made no mention of Bear Stearns during their meeting, the minutes showed, although they did discuss other efforts by the Fed to make it easier for banks to borrow from the government.They acknowledged, however, that the situation remained difficult for businesses and would-be homeowners to get loans and mortgages, and even raised the possibility of a so-called negative feedback loop, “in which a restriction in credit availability prompts a deterioration in the economic outlook that, in turn, spurs additional tightening in credit conditions.”Officials said that inflation had grown more quickly than anticipated, but they said prices for consumer products would probably recede toward the end of the year.Fed officials also confirmed a common lament among economists, that the central bank finds itself in an extremely difficult situation.“Members noted that appropriately calibrating the stance of policy was difficult,” the minutes said, as officials weighed the benefits of lowering interest rates against the possibility that inflation will get out of hand.Lower rates make it easier for banks, businesses and consumers to obtain money, which can in turn cause prices to rise.Two Fed governors — Richard W. Fisher of the Dallas Fed, and Charles I. Plosser of the Philadelphia branch — voted against the decision to cut three-quarters of a point, with Mr. Plosser arguing that the Fed “could not afford to wait until there was clear evidence that inflation expectations were no longer anchored, as by then it would be too late to prevent a further increase in inflation pressures.”The dissenters also argued that the Fed’s previous efforts to restore confidence among lenders — including its decision to provide cheap loans to investment banks in exchange for relatively risky collateral — were a more effective and time-sensitive approach to improving the economy. (The benefits of rate cuts can take up to six months to appear.)But a sense of imminent danger appeared to prevail.“Most members judged that a substantial easing in the stance of monetary policy was warranted at this meeting,” the minutes said. “Indeed, some believed that a prolonged and severe economic downturn could not be ruled out given the further restriction of credit availability and ongoing weakness in the housing market.”'"
"'08-04-08,'0','“With the uncertainties in the outlook for both economic activity and inflation elevated, members noted that appropriately calibrating the stance of (interest-rate) policy was difficult,” the minutes stated.On the one hand, the Fed has been urgently moving to prevent the trio of economic woes — housing, credit and financial — from plunging the country into a deep recession. On the other hand, with soaring energy prices and high food costs, policy makers realize that they cannot afford to let inflation get out of control, either.Even with the big interest rate reduction in March, most Fed members saw overall inflation moderating, the minutes said. However, inflation pressures had picked up even as economic growth had weakened, the minutes added, suggesting that uncertainty clouded the inflation outlook.Mr. Plosser and Mr. Fisher — the two who opposed the hefty three-quarter-point reduction in March were “concerned that inflation expectations could potentially become unhinged,” according to the minutes. If people, investors and businesses expect prices to rise sharply, they’ll act in ways that will make inflation worse. Once inflation takes hold, it is hard to break.”Since last September, the Fed has been cutting rates to shore up the economy. One of the risks of lowering rates is that it can sow the seeds of inflation down the road. To battle inflation, the Fed usually increases rates.Besides cutting rates, the Fed has taken a number of unconventional steps recently to ease a dangerous credit crisis.Under one new program, the Fed has been letting big investment firms borrow super-safe Treasury securities and put up more risky investments, including certain shunned mortgage-backed securities as collateral. The Fed said it would make as much as $200 billion worth of Treasuries available through weekly auctions.The program is intended to help financial institutions and the troubled mortgage market.The goal is to make investment houses more inclined to lend to one another. It is also aimed at providing relief to the distressed market for mortgage-linked securities. Questions about their value and dumping of these securities have driven up mortgage rates, aggravating the housing crisis.In the broadest use of its lending authority since the 1930s, the Fed last month agreed to temporarily let investment firms obtain emergency financing from the Fed, a privilege that previously had been granted only to commercial banks.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','In 2007, Philips sold $1.7 billion in television sales in North America, Mr. Zeven said. The licensing of the brand to Funai will create what Mr. Zeven said would be the third-largest television manufacturer in the United States.Analysts agreed with Mr. Zeven’s assessment. “This is probably a good move for Philips,” said Riddhi Patel, an analyst with iSuppli, the research firm. “They’re getting out of a business where margins are really getting squeezed.”Philips’ share of the L.C.D. business in the United States has been steadily declining. While the company was the top-selling brand in the fourth quarter of 2006, with 17 percent market share, according to iSuppli, the company dropped to sixth place one year later, with just a 6.6 percent share.As prices decline, profits have been increasingly difficult to achieve. According to iSuppli, the average selling price for a 42-inch L.C.D. television has fallen from $2,082 one year ago to $1,544 today, a 26 percent drop. Depending on the manufacturer, the profit margin for that size set is between 9 and 16 percent.Philips has been warning for years that it would take the necessary moves to improve its business. Earlier this year, Philips’ chief executive, Gerard Kleisterlee, was quoted as stating that the company would sell products only in those markets where margins were sufficiently high.In an interview at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, Mr. Zeven stated that Philips would “do less and less manufacturing” and concentrate instead on its patents.“Philips has a great, top-tier brand in Europe, but it has been difficult for them to realize that premium positioning in the U.S.,” said Ross Rubin, director of industry analysis at NPD Group.The company joins other competitors that have reduced their presence in the United States. In 2003 Thomson, the French company, sold its RCA television brand to TCL of China. Last month, Pioneer announced that it would no longer produce its own plasma panels, buying them from others instead.Globally, Philips has pulled back from consumer electronics manufacturing. Most recently, the company has significantly reduced its position in LG. Philips L.C.D., a display panel manufacturer. Originally a joint venture with South Korea’s L.G., Philips has now cut its stake to 13.2 percent and the company’s name has been changed to LG Display.Analysts said Philips gets hurt as top-tier brands like Sony introduce scores of new models to value-priced stores like Wal-Mart and dominate shelf space at other retailers.“There has been a fairly substantial move by high-end consumer electronics manufacturers to embrace Wal-Mart,” said David A. Schick, managing director of Stifel Nicolaus and Company, a Baltimore equity research firm. “Access to Sony’s Bravia line of televisions at Wal-Mart changes the dynamics of the business.”“There is a war for shelf space, and Philips is getting squeezed,” Mr. Rubin concurred.In addition, Philips’ designs have appeared stodgy to consumers in the United States. While other companies have been shrinking the size of frames around the screens in order to make TVs look bigger, Philips has used its lighting expertise to create Ambilight, a technology that casts complementary light on the wall but requires thicker, not thinner bezels.Philips’ other consumer products in the United States., including its line of DVD players, audio video equipment and accessories, health care, electric razor products and lighting, are not affected by this agreement.The company will leave its Atlanta headquarters and consolidate employees from its remaining consumer products in its offices in Stamford, Conn. Those working in the television business may be employed by Funai, Mr. Zeven said.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','Nine Islamic extremists convicted in the Casablanca bombings in 2003 that killed 45 people and wounded scores more tunneled their way out of prison, officials said. Abderrahim Mahtade, who represents a prisoners’ advocacy group, said the fugitives had escaped from the Kenitra prison, north of Rabat, after dawn prayers. He said one of the nine had been sentenced to death, six to life imprisonment and two to 20 years. All were from Casablanca. Mr. Mahtade said they had left a letter complaining of injustice and saying that they had been left with only the escape option. The Casablanca attack, in which a dozen suicide bombers struck a restaurant, a hotel and Jewish establishments, was Morocco’s worst terrorist attack. More than 1,400 men have been convicted on terrorism-related charges and sent to prison. Many of them, in various Moroccan prisons, went on a 24-hour hunger strike on Monday to protest conditions.'"

Witnesses said at least one person had been killed by hotel security guards during a protest in the southern city of Les Cayes, where four people died last week in food riots and clashes with United Nations peacekeepers. Thousands of people marched mostly peacefully past the National Palace in Port-au-Prince. “We’re hungry!” some called out. Haitians are particularly affected by food prices that are rising worldwide. Eighty percent of the population lives on less than $2 a day. The cost of staples like rice, beans, fruit and condensed milk has gone up 50 percent in the past year.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','In March, Senator Reed and Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, asked the Government Accountability Office to look into the penalties that the S.E.C. has been levying lately. Penalties, together with the return of ill-gotten gains, fell by half in the 2007 fiscal year, to $1.6 billion.Staff lawyers in the S.E.C. enforcement division say high turnover, tight budgets and a new, looser attitude toward corporate wrongdoing are sapping morale. The staffing and budget of the S.E.C. have lagged far behind the explosive growth of the markets the commission must police.The Bush administration has left the S.E.C., normally headed by its chairman and four other presidentially appointed commissioners, firmly in the hands of Republicans with the departure of one Democrat last fall and another in January. Nominations for both positions have been submitted.Turnover is high. The percentage of employees who leave annually rose to 8.6 percent in 2007, the highest level in five years, from 7.5 percent in 2005, when Mr. Cox arrived (turnover in the late 1990s was much higher, and generally surges in bull markets, said John Nester an S.E.C. spokesman). Staff levels are down and falling. The S.E.C. budgeted for 1,093 enforcement jobs in 2009, down from 1,232 full- time enforcement employees in 2005.“The slight decrease in personnel, despite record spending on enforcement, is directly attributable to the overall higher salaries paid to enforcement personnel consistent with the S.E.C.’s priority of attracting and retaining the highest caliber staff,” Mr. Nester said.But since Christopher Cox, a former Republican congressman from California, took over as chairman in 2005, spending on enforcement has fallen from $316.3 million to $298 million in 2007.“What Cox has done to this agency is to pull state patrolmen off the highways and shackle them in one way or another in a parking lot,” said Lynn E. Turner, who served as the S.E.C.’s chief accountant from 1998 to 2001.But to many on Wall Street, Mr. Cox has struck the right balance for the times.“First and foremost the S.E.C. is a law enforcement agency, and Chris Cox has continued that longstanding tradition,” said Ira D. Hammerman, senior managing director for the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the industry’s main trade group.Mr. Cox succeeded William H. Donaldson, another Republican, who moved aggressively to punish mutual funds engaged in market timing, regulate hedge funds and give shareholders a more powerful vote in corporate matters. Mr. Donaldson infuriated the business community, and his five-member commission was often divided.Mr. Cox, by contrast, has made consensus among his commissioners a priority.“He was more moderate in his approach on many issues at the start of his chairmanship,” said Joel Seligman, president of the University of Rochester and author of a book on the history of the S.E.C. “He worked very hard to build consensus to an extent that many people thought was appropriate and wise.”Mr. Cox has tried to clarify the commission’s policy toward penalties with guidelines released in January 2006. He has said the S.E.C. generally wants to avoid punishing one set of shareholders for corporate wrongdoing that benefited another group of shareholders.But enforcement staff have argued that other policies have hampered their ability to bring tough cases. Previously, for example, staff lawyers negotiated settlements and then brought them to the commissioners for approval. Now, under a pilot program, the commission requires a majority of the commissioners to approve a range for settlements. Some staff members complain that this makes them feel as if they must get permission to do their jobs.But the commission has argued this change gives its lawyers more leverage. When they negotiate, companies know any settlement cannot be voted down by the commission later.Whatever the case, total disgorgements and penalties, which are subject to business cycles and individual factors affecting cases, have fallen recently. The penalties portion — the punishment that a company faces, excluding any return of ill-gotten gains — fell from $977 million in 2006 to $505 million in 2007. But accompanying that decrease is a decline in disgorgement, suggesting that companies and officers are engaged in less wrongdoing than that the S.E.C. staff is bringing fewer cases. Return of ill-gotten gains fell to $1.1 billion in 2007 from $2.4 billion in 2006.Mr. Cox responded to Senator Dodd’s inquiry on April 1, pointing out that in the fiscal year ended 2007, the S.E.C. brought the largest number of corporate penalty cases in its history. Since 2006, the S.E.C. has settled some high-dollar cases, including a penalty for Fannie Mae that totaled $400 million. Yet the JPMorgan case, in which the S.E.C. said the bank failed to detect wrongdoing at a client for which it was a trustee, is not the only recent case in which the commissioners have reduced bills for companies. (JPMorgan, as is usual in S.E.C. settlements, neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.)On March 5, in a particularly high-profile case, the agency accused Fidelity Investments and 13 former and current employees of accepting more than $1.6 million in improper gifts, entertainment and travel paid by brokers doing business with the fund company.Among those charged was Peter Lynch, vice chairman and former portfolio manager for the Magellan Fund. He struck a deal with the S.E.C. to pay almost $30,000 in disgorgement, but the commission, excluding Mr. Cox who was recused, later reduced that to about $16,000, saying gifts should be valued at retail prices, as they are for federal employees.Arthur Levitt, who served as S.E.C. chairman under President Clinton, is critical that the agency is not as active as it should be. When the Treasury Department proposed a blueprint that would have stripped the S.E.C.’s powers, Mr. Cox did not condemn it.“Together with other actions taken and some not taken with respect to a number of issues important to investors, it is unlikely that this commission will be known as an activist one,” Mr. Levitt said.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','The novel was published in 1957, sold well, was bought by the Book of the Month Club, was favorably reviewed and a year later won the National Book Award.Even so, in 1959, Mr. Bessie was passed over for the position of editor in chief of Harper & Row in favor of Evan Thomas. He then teamed with Alfred A. Knopf Jr. — then working for his parents, Alfred and Blanche Knopf, at their publishing house — and Hiram Haydn, an editor at Bobbs-Merrill, in founding Atheneum. They lined up four backers, each willing to put up $250,000, and established offices in a four-story brownstone on East 38th Street in Manhattan. Cornelia Schaeffer, who would go on to marry Mr. Bessie, joined the house as an editor about a year later.Atheneum achieved quick success. Its first three lists produced three No. 1 best-sellers: “The Last of the Just” (1960), a novel about the Holocaust by André Schwarz-Bart; “The Making of the President, 1960” (1961), the first book in Theodore H. White’s series on presidential campaigns; and “The Rothschilds: A Family Portrait” (1962) by Frederic Morton.Other books also did well for the house. The first list included Jan de Hartog’s crime novel “The Inspector,” Wright Morris’s “Ceremony in Lone Tree” and William Goldman’s “Soldier in the Rain.” Later came Edward Albee’s play, “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (1962).But there were also misjudgments. Having published Mario Puzo’s second novel, “The Fortunate Pilgrim” (1965), Atheneum turned down the author’s next effort, “The Godfather,” because, Mr. Knopf said, Mr. Haydn thought it “junk.” (G. P. Putnam’s Sons published it in 1969.)Atheneum prospered until the 1970s, when straitened economic conditions began to make it harder for independent publishers to stay afloat, and the house began to look for a larger company to buy it. When Mr. Bessie received a bid from his former employer, now called Harper & Row, Mr. Knopf demurred, not wanting to work for someone else.Mr. Bessie then parted company with Atheneum and, in 1975, accepted a senior vice presidency at Harper, with an agreement that it would finance his and his wife’s own imprint — Cornelia and Michael Bessie Books — when he turned 65 in 1981. (Harper followed through on that promise.) In 1978, Atheneum merged with Charles Scribner’s Sons.Mr. Bessie remained on the Harper board until 1987, shortly after the News Corporation bought the company and changed it to HarperCollins. Mr. Bessie followed Bessie Books first to Pantheon and then to Counterpoint, in Washington.Mr. Bessie was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1916, the son of Abraham Bessie, a doctor, and Ella Bessie. He attended Harvard College, where he edited The Harvard Crimson and received his bachelor’s degree in 1936.That summer he became a reporter for The Newark Star Eagle and then joined the research department of RKO Radio Pictures, remaining there until 1938, the year he published his book “Jazz Journalism: The Story of Tabloid Newspapers” (Dutton).After working as a reporter and editor at Look magazine, he joined the Office of War Information in 1942 and was involved in psychological warfare in North Africa, Sicily, Italy and France. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1946.He entered the publishing business toward the end of World War II, joining Harper, at the invitation of his boss at the Paris embassy, Cass Canfield, who had recently become the company’s head.In 1945, Mr. Bessie married Constance Ernst, the head of the broadcasting division of the war information office in New York. They had two children, Nicholas and Katherine, both of whom survive Mr. Bessie. Mr. Bessie married Cornelia Schaeffer in 1968, having first met her when she was an editor at Harper.For all his success in shepherding major books into print, Mr. Bessie also let some get away. Two decisions he later regretted were his rejections of Frantz Fanon’s “Wretched of the Earth” and Vladimir Nabokov’s “Lolita.”“One reads under different circumstances,” he said in an interview with the online journal Archipelago in 1997. “I have now reread Lolita several times since then, and I cannot reconstruct the S. M. Bessie who sat there in a hotel in Paris and turned that book down! But I did.”'"
"'08-04-08,'0','PITTSBURGH (AP) — Chuck Tanner could not do it. Jim Leyland could not do it, either, and each went on to win the World Series.So it probably was too much to ask John Russell to break a streak that dates to the 1960s in which every new Pittsburgh Pirates manager loses his home opener — even after a comeback from a seven-run deficit.Aramis Ramírez’s sacrifice fly scored the go-ahead run during a two-run 12th inning in which the Cubs did not have a hit against the rookie Evan Meek (0-1), and Chicago rallied after wasting a huge lead Monday for a 10-8 victory in Pittsburgh.The former starter Jon Lieber (1-1) gave a depleted Cubs bullpen a lift with three scoreless innings before Carlos Mármol finished the 12th for his first save since June 27.Russell did something every new Pirates manager since Larry Shepard in 1968 has done by losing his home debut.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','Gov. Jon S. Corzine’s proposed budget would cut $193,000 in aid to Mine Hill this year. To ease its financial problems, the township is sharing some of its services with the neighboring town of Wharton.Mr. Corzine has urged that municipalities take such steps. “We’ve done all the things they said to do — we’ve received no assistance,” Mr. Sovelove said. “The reality we have to face is, we’re a small town, and we’re dramatically affected by factors outside.”To enter the farm preservation program, Mr. Paschal’s land would first have to be rezoned by the township. In general, the state only accepts farms for the program with the approval of local officials, which is usually granted.Susan Craft, executive director of the State Agriculture Development Committee, which administers the preservation program, said local towns were usually enthusiastic supporters because “most municipalities don’t want to see wall-to-wall development as they get built out.”The New Jersey farm conversion program is one of the oldest and most successful in the country, and has eased what Ms. Craft said were residents’ frustrations with “constant conversion of the land.”“People really do appreciate open places, some green space in their daily commute, and in their lives,” she said.Frank Pinto, for 14 years the head of the agriculture development board for Morris County, which includes Mine Hill, said Mr. Paschal’s case was “the first time we’ve had a township not support a farm.”But the dilemma posed by town officials — a choice between revenue and preservation — seemed to represent a false choice, he said. In the first place, Mr. Paschal could sell the land to the state or the county as open space, removing it completely from the town’s tax rolls. But if the farm entered the farm preservation program, Mr. Paschal would still pay taxes, though admittedly less than an office development might bring in.Mr. Pinto said that an office building would need more municipal service than Mr. Paschal’s farm.The debate over Mr. Paschal’s application occurs amid widespread concern about the future of farm preservation in New Jersey. In addition to the cuts in aid to cities and towns, Mr. Corzine is proposing to abolish the state’s Department of Agriculture, which administers the preservation program, and to disperse the agency’s duties among other departments.The farm preservation program, under the governor’s proposal, could be transferred to the state’s Department of Environmental Protection, an agency that Peter Furey, executive director of the New Jersey Farm Bureau, sees as more concerned with regulation than preservation. “We are going to be leery of entering farmland preservation without the secretary of agriculture being at the helm of the program,” Mr. Furey said.The budget pressures faced by towns threaten more than farmland. In the borough of Red Bank, in Monmouth County, the mayor and the local environmental commission are fighting over a piece of land on the Navesink River, according to Louis DiMento, commission chairman. Just as Mine Hill has done, the Red Bank mayor, Pasquale Menna, has raised the problem of Trenton’s dwindling support for towns in his argument for selling a lot on the river to developers. The commission would rather make it a dock for kayaking.A few miles down the road from Mr. Paschal’s farm, in the neighboring town of Randolph, sits Sun High Orchards, a 63-year-old preserved farm with apple and peach groves and pumpkin-picking for school groups. It serves as a kind of advertisement for the state’s preservation program: set against all the development on busy Canfield Avenue, the farm, with its roadside fruit stand, is a relief.But few people here believe that Mr. Paschal’s farm is ever likely to be such an oasis, preservation program or no.For starters, he would not open it to visitors: “There are insurance issues,” he said. And Mr. Sovelove, who describes himself as a friend of Mr. Paschal’s, said the farm would probably never elicit any nostalgia from Mine Hill residents.“He’s got a tree-cutting operation and a junkyard,” Mr. Sovelove said. “It’s not an orchard or a pumpkin farm.” Mr. Paschal said that if he is accepted, he would clean up the clutter around the farm.On the edge of his land, hidden in a steel cage, is a natural spring. Mr. Paschal, who has a crushing handshake, said the spring’s water had kept him healthy all these years. Residents line up daily to stock up on the water, and even Mr. Sovelove acknowledged that people would miss it if it was paved over to become a parking lot.“It’s always flowing. It’s always cold,” Mr. Sovelove said. “When you’re elected, you think about the impact on people’s lives. We’re trying to strike a balance.”'"
"'08-04-08,'0','The United States today finds itself with too much war for too few warriors. With the “surge” now giving way to a “pause,” the Iraq war has become an open-ended enterprise. American combat operations in Iraq could easily drag on for 10 more years, and a large-scale military presence might be required for decades, which may well break the Army while bankrupting the country. The pretense that there is a near-term solution to Iraq has become a pretext for ignoring the long-term disparity between military commitments and military capacity.1. General Petraeus, in the spring of 2003, on your first tour of duty in Iraq, you remarked to a reporter, “Tell me how this ends.” You are now on your third tour and the war is in its sixth year. Please tell us how this war ends.2. In addition, please provide an approximation of when it will end. With the war costing the United States $3 billion per week and 30 to 40 American lives per month, how many more years (or decades) will elapse before one of your successors is able to report that the mission in Iraq has been accomplished?3.

"'08-04-08,'0','Because of booming demand, new mines are opening in South America and Asia, where deposits are plentiful. There is also a growing business in recycling lead, mainly from used batteries (where 75 percent of lead ends up) but also scrap metal.Lead prices reached a record of $3,900 a ton late last summer mainly because of supply problems from mines in Australia, consumer demand in China for cars and motorbikes, and speculation by hedge fund managers on volatile commodities markets, said William Adams, a metals analyst at BaseMetals.com in London.The price has pulled back since, trading at about $2,750 a ton, he said, but it could climb again on continuing supply problems and steady Chinese demand.One of the oddest consequences of the historically high price is that idyllic corners of Britain — a nation that gave birth to the Industrial Revolution — are suddenly feeling the strain of Asia’s industrialization.“Churches have become pretty savvy at protecting property inside their buildings, such as the altar ware and money in boxes,” said Mr. Pitt of Ecclesiastical, “but now the most valuable thing these churches have is being taken away piece by piece, and that is tearing away the very fabric of these buildings.”Ecclesiastical is raising its premiums for churches after paying out claims last year totaling £9 million ($18 million), mostly for thefts of lead from roofs, he said. Before 2005, such claims were almost unheard-of.A crucial problem for Britain’s churches is that many go unused for long periods of time, largely because of a decline in churchgoing. Services here in Edmondthorpe, for example, are often held just six times a year.In some cases, clergy members and parishioners discover roof thefts only once rain pours into the building, damaging cherished items like carved wooden screens and ancient organs. The thefts can lead to thousands of pounds of structural damage, too.In Edmondthorpe, the damage will cost £10,000 ($20,000) to repair.“It’s ruthless how they do it,” said Nigel Peters, an inspector with the Leicestershire constabulary, describing lead thefts at Edmondthorpe and seven other local churches. “It’s such a skill to lay down the lead, and then it is literally just ripped away.”Mr. Peters said his force had carried out raids on two local scrap metal dealers but had found no evidence of wrongdoing. He said no arrests had been made in connection with thefts in his part of the county.Historical preservation rules require many churches to replace roofs with original building materials, including lead, despite its attractiveness to thieves and its cost. Many fear thieves will return after the repairs.“Whenever I get an early morning phone call these days, I think, ‘Oh no, they’ve taken the roof again,’ ” said John Deave, 80, a retired barrister and a churchwarden at St. Guthlac’s Church in Stathern, another Leicestershire village, where the church was vandalized in January.Mr. Deave suspected that thieves had climbed up the drainpipe, peeled a three-foot-wide strip from the roof, and threw their haul down into the churchyard, where they left a piece of metal and an indentation in the grass, before driving away.Insurance paid most of the £2,300 bill to fix the roof. But the church had to pay the £500 deductible with parishioners’ money and reserves from tiny “peppercorn rents” still collected on nearby lands.Mr. Deave has put special paint on the drainpipes to make them slippery to would-be climbers; has marked the roof with SmartWater, a kind of indelible ink that can be used to identify stolen property; and has pitched a thicket of signs around St. Guthlac’s warning thieves to stay away.He wanted to put a bright light on the roof as an additional security measure but neighbors opposed the move.Some churches in larger and more prosperous towns have upgraded their internal security, little changed since medieval times, to systems that are distinctly 21st century.After lead worth £7,500 was taken from the roof of St. Peter & St. Paul, in Rutland, a county neighboring Leicestershire, the church canon, Stephen Evans, installed a security system with outdoor cameras. Movement on the roof sets off warnings that are sent to up to six mobile phones.For churches with less money, the introduction of more rudimentary deterrents may be inevitable.“Nobody likes to think of barbed wire or that kind of thing on these buildings, but churches seriously have to look at that,” said Tom Bates, a former insurance manager in the village of Waltham-on-the-Wolds, where lead was removed from the church of St. Mary Magdalene late last year.“Ultimately insurance companies will say, ‘Enough is enough,’ ” he said.At St. Michael and All Angels in Edmondthorpe, Barbara Coulson, a lay minister, went ahead with a Good Friday service even after the theft. Thirty-six people attended as wintry gusts flapped the blue plastic covering the hole in the roof.Ms. Coulson expected the roof to be repaired soon and said new security measures would be put in place.Still, she said, churches like hers would remain vulnerable, in part because respect for faith traditions is often too weak to offset the temptation of cashing in on global markets.“We increasingly seem to live in a world where the question ‘Is nothing sacred?’ so easily springs to mind,” she said.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','The tendency to have a breech delivery is inherited, a new study reports, and it is apparently inherited equally through the father and the mother.Norwegian researchers examined records of all 2.2 million births in Norway from 1967 through 2004 and found that men and women who had themselves been delivered in breech position — that is, buttocks first — had more than twice the risk of delivering their own first babies in the same way. The study is in the March issue of BMJ.Men delivered by breech appear to carry genes predisposing to breech delivery that are then transferred to their offspring. And in addition to those genes, women may carry other genes for physical characteristics that can be expressed only in daughters — the shape and size of the pelvis, for example, or uterine malformations — that also increase the risk.“More knowledge is needed before we can be absolutely certain of the link,” said Tone Irene Nordtveit, the lead author of the study and a doctoral candidate at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen, Norway. “Still, health personnel should ask a pregnant woman how she and the baby’s father were born. Such information can contribute to good birth planning and sharpen vigilance” by the midwife and the doctor.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','A much-noted study last year raised more than a few eyebrows when it suggested that digital music players could set hearts aflutter — by interfering with pacemakers.The study, published in the journal Heart Rhythm, found that all it took to cause electrical interference in an implanted pacemaker was holding an iPod two inches from a patient’s chest. In some cases, the study found, an iPod caused interference when it was held within 18 inches of a patient.But many scientists were skeptical, and apparently for good reason. More recent studies that looked at music players have found they have little effect on pacemakers.The latest, carried out by scientists at Children’s Hospital Boston and Harvard Medical School, tested four types of music players on patients 6 to 60 with active pacemakers or implantable cardioverter defibrillators. The scientists found during hundreds of tests that the music players had no effect on the “intrinsic function” of pacemakers. The only slight effects occurred when the heart devices were being programmed, “but not in a way that compromised device function,” the authors said.As a result, they concluded, patients need be wary only while their doctors are reprogramming their devices.Another study, in January by a scientist at the Food and Drug Administration, echoed those findings. The scientist, Howard Bassen, tested four different types of iPods and found that they did not hinder pacemakers.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','“NBC gave a lowball offer,” he said, “thinking the Weinstein Company couldn’t do better.”Andrea Wong, the president of Lifetime Entertainment Services, said in a telephone interview, “I could not be more excited that ‘Project Runway’ is coming to Lifetime.” The show is scheduled to start on Lifetime in November, she said, though it will have to squeeze in one more cycle on Bravo before that.But Ms. Wong said, “It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the lawsuit because we are not a party to it.” She added, “We have a signed contract with the Weinstein Company to acquire the show.”Mr. Boies said the talks that went on past the date of the agreement with NBC Universal did not constitute negotiations. NBC Universal called them “a sham negotiation.”NBC Universal’s suit argues that the company had a clause in its original contract with Weinstein that would have prevented any future network that acquired the show from putting it on the air for a year, a so-called hold-back agreement. In exchange for dropping that condition, NBC Universal’s suit says, it won from the Weinstein Company the promise of the right of first refusal, which meant NBC Universal could have tried to match another network’s bid for the show.NBC Universal also contends that the Weinstein Company improperly bundled the renewal of “Project Runway” with a package of unsuccessful movies that company has produced and failed to sell elsewhere. (The titles include “I Could Never Be Your Woman,” “Death Defying Acts” and “The Girl in the Park.” )When NBC Universal declined to pay a high price for the deal, NBC Universal asserts, Weinstein made a deal with Lifetime, a network that needs a hit reality show — and one willing to buy the movies included in the deal. But NBC Universal argues that it has an exchange of e-mail messages that back its contention that the Weinstein Company had agreed to the right of first refusal on the deal.Mr. Boies said that the e-mail messages included in NBC Universal’s court filing were not complete and would not back up the claim that Mr. Weinstein or his representatives had agreed to the right of first refusal. He also said that the original contract for the show had never been signed and that a signed agreement last July reducing the hold-back period had not mentioned the right of first refusal.NBC Universal’s position is that the contract’s not being signed will have no significance because both sides had worked under its terms for five years — and that many Hollywood deals are never signed and still remain in effect.The financial terms of the Lifetime deal were not announced, but one executive involved in the negotiations estimated the cost to Lifetime at more than $150 million over five years.Even if NBC Universal had retained the rights to the show, it was surely going to move it off Bravo.In initial talks with the Weinstein Company, NBC Universal had promised to move the show to a larger network, either the USA cable network, or perhaps even to NBC.'"
"'08-04-08,'0','Mr. Hagee also declines to discuss the endorsement, and in interviews and during a conference call with reporters on Monday, he would not even say how it had come about. “For the present time for many reasons,” Mr. Hagee said in an interview late last month, “it is better that I don’t comment on the campaign in any way.”The controversy surrounding Mr. Hagee seemed to take the McCain campaign by surprise, said David C. Leege, an expert on Catholic voters and an emeritus professor of political science at Notre Dame.Mr. McCain began seeking Mr. Hagee’s endorsement more than a year ago, trying to bolster the campaign’s support among evangelical voters. Republican leaders are concerned that evangelicals will sit out the election in November, depriving Mr. McCain of votes that may be crucial to beating the Democratic nominee.Mr. Hagee has a large following and a vast reach on radio and television. But he has also been criticized by Catholics for comments about the church and, recently, by some Jews for his views on Israel.After Mr. Hagee endorsed Mr. McCain, the criticism was fierce and Mr. McCain soon distanced himself, issuing a series of statements until he announced he was “repudiating” those of Mr. Hagee’s views that might be considered anti-Catholic.A McCain adviser acknowledged on Monday that the campaign had failed to look into Mr. Hagee’s background adequately and said that as a result the campaign’s procedures for vetting endorsers had improved.Mr. McCain, who does not talk about religion publicly, has a rocky history with conservative Christians. Eight years ago, he called the Rev. Jerry Falwell and the Rev. Pat Robertson “agents of intolerance.”But as he prepared to run for president again, Mr. McCain was the graduation speaker at Mr. Falwell’s Liberty University in 2006, met with Mr. Hagee in Texas and spoke at his Night for Israel in Washington in 2007.As recently as last week, however, James C. Dobson of Focus on the Family criticized Mr. McCain in an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal for his unwillingness to support a federal amendment against same-sex marriage and to oppose federal financing for stem cell research.Mr. Hagee, 68, is not as well known as Dr. Dobson or Mr. Falwell, but he is powerful within the “strongly conservative political wing of the evangelical community,” said D. Michael Lindsay, an expert on evangelical political involvement and assistant director of the Center on Race, Religion and Urban Life at Rice University. The author of many books, Mr. Hagee also talks twice daily on 75 radio and 125 television stations, Mr. Lindsay said. Mr. Hagee also professes to have a personal e-mail list of two million supporters. “It is his constituents who are least likely to support McCain,” Mr. Lindsay said.Immediately after the endorsement, though, the Catholic League condemned him as being anti-Catholic. The group accused him of branding the Roman Catholic Church as anti-Semitic and of referring to it in his apocalyptic theology as “the great whore of Babylon,” the symbol of a false church.Mr. Hagee said that his views had been misrepresented and that he had never been anti-Catholic. He said that he had examined anti-Semitism across Christian denominations and that the reference to a false church applies to those Christians who do not believe in the Gospel.Mr. Hagee was also denounced last week by Rabbi Eric Yoffie, the president of the Union for Reform Judaism, the country’s largest branch of Judaism. Rabbi Yoffie called Mr. Hagee and his group, Christians United for Israel, “extremists.”Mr. Hagee, who is traveling in Israel with 1,000 evangelicals, defended himself in a conference call on Monday, saying that Rabbi Yoffie “relies on a few quotes from me and others pulled out of context. Rabbi Yoffie ignores our record because this record completely undermines his claim.”Mr. Hagee’s prominence is partly explained by his activism on behalf of Israel. His group has a mailing list of 80,000 “spiritual leaders,” Mr. Hagee said, and he has given about $30 million to Israeli causes in the last five years.The group’s view, which it has expressed to members of the Bush administration, is that Israel should not be pressured “into making territorial concessions that she does not want to make,” Mr. Hagee said Monday. He does not support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.While many Jewish leaders welcome Mr. Hagee’s support, Rabbi Yoffie, at a meeting in Cincinnati of the rabbinate of Reform Judaism, asked leaders to reject Christians United for Israel. “If implemented,” Rabbi Yoffie said, “these views would mean disaster for Israel, and would lead to diplomatic isolation, increased violence and the loss of Israel’s Jewish majority.”Most of the 55 million evangelical adults in the United States believe in the literal second coming of Christ, but Mr. Hagee is one of approximately nine million who are pre-millennial dispensationalists, said John Green of the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. By putting together passages from biblical books like Revelation, Daniel, Ezekiel and others, they amass “a puzzle to produce an amazingly detailed scenario of the end of history,” said Timothy Weber, author of “On the Road to Armageddon: How Evangelicals Became Israel’s Best Friend.”For the prophecies to be fulfilled, proponents believe, Jews must control Israel.Mr. Hagee has said he supports Israel because of biblical mandates to “bless” the Jews. “Our support of Israel has absolutely nothing to do with any kind of End Times scenario,” Mr. Hagee said. “All the Old Testament prophets prophesied that the state of Israel would be reborn.”Mr. Hagee, meanwhile, has been trying to patch up relations with Catholic leaders. He met recently in New York with Deal W.

"'08-04-08,'0','Yahoo’s statements were in response to a letter on Saturday from Steven A. Ballmer, the chief executive of Microsoft, threatening to begin a proxy fight to oust Yahoo’s directors if the two companies had not reached a negotiated deal in three weeks.Mr. Ballmer also warned that a proxy fight would probably be accompanied by a lower offer for Yahoo.Microsoft’s offer on Jan. 31 was initially valued at $44.6 billion, or $31 a share, but has fallen to just over $42 billion, or $29.36 a share, after a decline in the price of Microsoft’s shares.Shares of Yahoo fell 66 cents on Monday, to $27.70.With the threat of a proxy fight looming, the two companies are expected to increasingly court shareholders, whose views will prove decisive.In its letter, Yahoo said that shareholders owning “a significant portion of our outstanding shares” supported the company’s position.For his part, Mr. Ballmer said in his letter that Yahoo’s business appeared to have weakened in the last two months. As a result, he said, Microsoft’s bid offered Yahoo shareholders an even larger premium than when it was first made. Mr. Ballmer said he believed that a majority of Yahoo shareholders shared that view.Yahoo rejects the notion that its business has weakened and has recently reaffirmed its forecast for the first quarter, which calls for revenue to grow 8 percent to 17 percent from a year earlier. Wall Street analysts, on average, have pegged the company’s growth at about 12 percent.“The first quarter is absolutely crucial to the credibility of Yahoo’s management,” said Youssef H. Squali, an analyst with Jefferies & Company. “If they expect Microsoft to sweeten its offer, they need to come in at 12 percent or better. Coming in at the low end of the range won’t cut it.”Yahoo is expected to report first-quarter results on April 22, less than a week before the deadline imposed by Microsoft.In its letter, Yahoo also said that it had raised with Microsoft executives a number of antitrust concerns related to a merger of the two companies, and it complained that Microsoft had failed to respond to those concerns. “To date, you have still not provided any of the requested information,” the company said.'"

"'08-04-09,'0','A lonely newt, a strong-willed Scottish princess and modern-day elves are among the stars of 10 new animated movies from Walt Disney Studios and its boutique animation unit, Pixar.The media conglomerate on Tuesday unveiled its upcoming animation slate for movie theater owners and the media. The message of the splashy, three-hour presentation: Disney's acquisition of Pixar has resulted in rejuvenation of the company's entire animation business.The slate, while not entirely a surprise to Disney followers, is certainly ambitious. Over the next five years, Disney's offerings will include a quartet of straight-to-DVD animated features starring Tinker Bell and her friends; the company's first hand-drawn musical in nearly two decades, ""The Princess and the Frog""; a 3-D retelling of ""Rapunzel""; and much-anticipated additional installments to the ""Cars"" and ""Toy Story"" franchises.Among the original features Pixar is attempting are ""Newt,"" a summer 2011 film about a lizard cooling his heels in a community college science lab; ""The Bear and the Bow,"" a holiday 2011 fantasy about an impetuous Scottish princess; and ""King of the Elves,"" a 2012 offering focusing on elves and trolls who live in modern-day Mississippi.Disney also announced a roster of celebrities who will lend their voices to various characters. For instance, Ed Asner will create the cranky septuagenarian adventurer at the center of ""Up,"" a Pixar feature set for a May 2009 release. The voices of John Travolta and Miley Cyrus will star in ""Bolt,"" a November 2008 film about the adventures of a Hollywood show dog and his owner, Penny.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','That sent light, sweet crude for May delivery up $3.05 to $111.55 on the New York Mercantile Exchange after earlier rising as high as $112.21. That passes a trading record of $111.80 set last month.Analysts expect demand for gas and oil to fall further as prices rise. Theoretically, that should bring prices down. But so far this year, gas and oil prices have shown little inclination to fall in response to eroding demand. With gasoline supplies shrinking and the summer approaching — when demand, while weaker than last year, will be stronger than it is now — consumers may have to wait until the fall for price relief.Some analysts cautioned against reading too much into last week’s drop in crude supplies.“We note there was a sharp decline in crude oil imports,” said Eric Wittenauer, an analyst at Wachovia Securities in St. Louis, in a research note.Mr. Flynn of Alaron Trading believes crude imports fell because fog closed the Houston Shipping Channel, a vital oil import conduit, several times last week. “That leads me to suspect that there are more ships out there in the Gulf (of Mexico) that didn’t get counted,” he said.Before the energy agency issued its report, oil prices were already higher because of the dollar’s slide against the euro Wednesday. Many investors see commodities like oil as an effective hedge against a falling dollar and inflation. Also, a weaker American dollar makes oil cheaper to investors overseas.Analysts attribute much of oil’s rise this year to speculative buying tied to the falling dollar. With the Federal Reserve expected to cut rates several more times this year, which will likely further weaken the dollar, oil prices may continue rising despite tepid demand.The Energy Information Administration also said supplies of gasoline and distillates, which include diesel fuel and heating oil, fell more than expected last week. May gasoline futures rose 3.75 cents to $2.7879 a gallon on the Nymex — a price move that could also affect the price at the pump.May heating oil futures rose 12.18 cents to $3.232 a gallon after earlier rising to a trading record of $3.2445 a gallon.In other trading, May natural gas futures rose 36.8 cents to $10.065 for 1,000 cubic feet.In London, May Brent crude futures rose $2.54 to $108.88 a barrel on the ICE Futures exchange.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','The announcement puts yet another cloud over a program that, for a long time, appeared to be uncannily on track. The Dreamliner is also the fastest-selling plane in aviation history; carriers were attracted to its new largely composite design and innovative next-generation jet engines that will allow the wide-bodied plane to fly further on less fuel.But the company has been plagued by parts shortages — primarily fasteners, which help hold the plane together — as well as other bottlenecks in the delivery of parts, which caused the program to slip behind its ambitious schedule and raise questions about the credibility of Boeing’s forecasts.The first flight for the Dreamliner is now expected for the fourth quarter of this year, rather than later in the current quarter. And Boeing is still working with the Federal Aviation Administration to get the plane certified as airworthy, including issues with the Dreamliner’s lightning protection.As the program has faced these setbacks, so has Boeing’s stock, which has steadily fallen after hitting an all-time high of $107.80 in July 2007, just as a gleaming shell of the plane was rolled out at Boeing’s Everett plane to a cheering crowd of employees and customers. Shares closed yesterday at $75.02, as word of further delays began to leak out. But shares were up $3.43 Wednesday afternoon, to $78.45.Analysts seemed guarded about Boeing’s lastest forecast. Within minutes of the announcement, Michael Derchin, a senior analyst at the FTN Midwest Securities Corporation, wrote to investors and said “it appears that Boeing has finally produced a realistic timetable for its key 787 program,” but added that “execution of the new plan is critical and any slippages from here would be negatively received by investors.”When first announced, the Dreamliner program was such a hit with air carriers that it forced its rival Airbus back to the drawing board in July 2006 to redesign its competitive wide-bodied jet, the A350, to make it even wider — it was rereleased as the A350XWB for “extra wide body.”Yet Boeing’s misfortune may do little to help the A350 program since it remains at least four years behind the 787 in development and does not plan to be delivered to customers until sometime in 2013.To help resolve some of the problems with suppliers, especially those in Japan and Russia, Boeing executives have been traveling and say they have improved communications with many makers of critical components.“Our supply base is healthy,” Mr. Carson said in the conference call. “We’ve improved the assembly of our major sections. We’re focused and we are applying lessons learned. We are close to overcoming the delays and will will bring this breakthrough plane to our customers.”To resolve some of the supply chain issues, Boeing announced last month that it would buying the interest of a supplier — Vought Aircraft Industry — in an assembly plane in near Charleston, S.C., as it struggled to meet the program’s demands. In addition, Boeing said it has provided cash advance payments to another major supplier, Spirit Aerosystems Holdings, which was affected by the delays.Company executives, however, said that it did not expect the slippage in the timetable to change its 2008 earnings forecast, but declined to comment on its impact on Boeing’s 2009 earnings.'"

"'08-04-09,'0','Now, because of a growing global middle class as well as federal mandates to turn large amounts of corn into ethanol-based fuel, food prices are beginning to jump. Cropland is suddenly in heavy demand, a situation that is fraying old alliances, inspiring new ones and putting pressure on the Agriculture Department, which is being lobbied directly by all sides without managing to satisfy any of them.Born nearly 25 years ago in an era of abundance, the Conservation Reserve Program is having a rough transition to the age of scarcity. Its 35 million acres — about 8 percent of the cropland in the country — are the big prize in this brawl.Groups like Ducks Unlimited and Pheasants Forever want the government to raise rental rates to keep the same amount of land in the program or even increase it. While offering more money to farmers might be a difficult sell in a year of record farm profits, Jim Ringelman of Ducks Unlimited said, “There are overriding environmental issues here.”The bakers and their allies have a different set of overriding issues: high commodity prices. The rising cost of feed is hurting ranchers, the rising cost of corn is hurting ethanol producers and the rising cost of wheat is hurting bread makers.“We’re in a crisis here. Do we want to eat, or do we want to worry about the birds?” asked JR Paterakis, a Baltimore baker who said he was so distressed at a meeting last month with Edward T. Schafer, the agriculture secretary, that he stood up and started speaking “vehemently.”The Paterakis bakery, H&S, produces a million loaves of rye bread a week. The baker said he could not find the rye flour he needed at any price. That gives him two unwelcome options: close half of his operations starting in July, or experiment with a blended flour that will yield a different and possibly less-than-authentic rye bread.Such problems were never contemplated when the Conservation Reserve was conceived as part of the 1985 Farm Bill. Participants bid to put their land in the program during special sign-ups, with the government selecting the acres most at risk environmentally. Average annual payments are $51 an acre. Contracts run for at least a decade and are nearly impossible to break — not that anyone wanted to until recently.“Older farmers put their land in the program rather than renting to a younger farmer or selling,” said Dale Schuler, who grows wheat in Fort Benton, Mont. That made it difficult for farmers who wanted to expand as well as farm equipment dealers, supply co-ops and other services, which suffered declines in business.“It’s certainly been a polarizing issue,” Mr. Schuler said. “Half the people love it and half the people hate it.”While few urban dwellers ever heard of Conservation Reserve, it found support among two important constituents: hunters had more land to roam and more wildlife to seek out, with the Agriculture Department estimating that the duck population alone rose by two million; and environmentalists were pleased, too. No one disputes that there are real environmental benefits from the program, especially on land most prone to erosion.The program peaked late last summer, with more than 400,000 farmers receiving nearly $1.8 billion for idling 36.8 million acres. Put all that land together and it would be bigger than the state of New York.The group doing the most to undermine this amiable coexistence is the farmers themselves. Last fall, when five million acres in Conservation Reserve came up for renewal, only half of them were re-entered. While the program has gained some high-priority land in the last few months, in part from an initiative to restore bobwhite quail habitats, the net loss is still more than two million acres.That is just the beginning, warns Ducks Unlimited, a politically potent organization with more than half a million members in the United States. Ducks Unlimited is concerned about the three-quarters of a million acres of grassland that were removed from the program last year in the so-called duck factory in the Upper Midwest.“We foresee a dramatic reduction,” said Mr. Ringelman, a conservation director for the association.Ardell Magnusson, a farmer in Roseau, Minn., shows the changing mood. He said the program was “a godsend” when he put 300 of his 2,300 acres into it eight years ago. “I needed some guaranteed income or my banker was going to tell me to find another occupation,” Mr. Magnusson said. It is not exactly a bonanza: he gets about $12,000 a year.He calculates he can make more than that by farming sunflowers or wheat or soybeans. When his contract expires in two years, he plans to withdraw about half his land. It would not be a shock if the Agriculture Department cut him loose sooner. “Another nine months of wheat at today’s prices and there will be political pressure on this program like you wouldn’t believe,” Mr. Magnusson said.That pressure is exactly what the bakers and their allies are aiming for, saying the Conservation Reserve costs taxpayers and hurts consumers.“This program is taking money out of your pocket twice a day,” said Jay Truitt, vice president for government affairs for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association. “Do you think it’s right for you to pay so there’s more quail in Kansas?”The cattlemen and bakers argue that farmers should immediately be allowed to take as much as nine million acres out of the Conservation Reserve without paying a penalty, something they say would not harm the environment.“The pipeline for wheat is empty,” said Michael Kalupa, a bakery owner in Tampa, Fla., who is president of the Retail Bakers of America. Mr. Kalupa said the price he paid for flour had doubled since October. He cannot afford to absorb the cost and he cannot afford to pass it on. Sales have been falling 16 percent to 20 percent a month since October. He has laid off three employees.Among farmers, the notion of early releases from conservation contracts is prompting sharp disagreement and even anger. The American Soybean Association is in favor. “We need more food,” said John Hoffman, the association’s president.The National Association of Wheat Growers is against, saying it believes “in the sanctity of contracts.” It does not want more crops to be grown, because commodity prices might go down.That is something many of its members say they cannot afford, even with wheat at a robust $9 a bushel. Their own costs have increased, with diesel fuel and fertilizer up sharply. “It would decrease my profit margin, which is slim,” said Jeff Krehbiel of Hydro, Okla. “Let’s hurt the farmer in order to shut the bakers up, is that what we’re saying?”Mr. Krehbiel said his break-even last year was $4 a bushel. This summer it will be $6.20; the next crop, $7.75.In the struggle between those who would shrink the program and those who would bolster it, the Agriculture Department is leaning toward the latter. When Mr. Schafer spoke recently before wildlife and hunting groups in Phoenix, he opened the door to significantly raising rents on new land.Randy Schuring, a dairy farmer with 200 acres in the program, said there was no possible solution that would make everyone happy.“If the government lets the land out and then crop prices fall, that’s going to hurt a lot of farmers,” said Mr. Schuring, whose farm is in Andover, S.D. “If it doesn’t let the land out and prices keep going up, that will hurt a lot of consumers. If only we had a crystal ball.”'"
"'08-04-09,'0','WASHINGTON — The pilot of a cargo ship that struck the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in dense fog last November, causing a major oil spill, had apparently become confused about his location and later regretted having set off in such conditions, according to a transcript from the voice recorder at the ship’s helm.The transcript, released here Tuesday on the first of two days of hearings that the National Transportation Safety Board is holding on the accident, also shows that the pilot, John Cota, left port despite concerns expressed by at least one member of the ship’s Chinese crew.The ensuing crash caused the ship, the Cosco Busan, to spill more than 50,000 gallons of its fuel into San Francisco Bay. The spill, the worst in the bay in 20 years, killed about 2,000 seabirds.The transcript indicates that as the ship approached the bridge, Mr. Cota thought it was going to pass between the bridge’s towers.Then, after the crash, he told the ship’s master: “So sorry, captain. I misunderstood the chart.”'"

"'08-04-09,'0','The French regulator declined Tuesday to confirm the authenticity of the document, but a spokeswoman for EADS said it appeared to be genuine. The document is a summary of a 94-page report that was presented to the authority’s board on April 1 and has been sent to French prosecutors.In a statement, EADS said it was shocked by the disclosure of the confidential report, which it said had yet to be delivered to the company or to the managers accused of insider dealings. EADS said the leak, coming after the disclosure of a preliminary report on the case in October, was “contrary to legal procedures” and ignored the rights of the accused to a presumption of innocence.As previously reported, the individuals named include current top executives of Airbus and EADS — among them Thomas O. Enders, now the head of Airbus; his second-in-command, Fabrice Brégier; John Leahy, Airbus’s head of sales; and Ralph D. Crosby Jr., head of EADS North America.Noël Forgeard, a former co-chief executive of EADS who was ousted in July 2006 in the A380 delays, is listed as having gained the most from his share options, reaping more than 4.3 million euros.In its summary, the French regulator said that in June 2005 — shortly after the announcement of a record number of new aircraft orders at the Paris air show had given a sharp boost to EADS shares — “the main managers and controlling shareholders became aware” of a possible decline “in the medium and long term of the expected profitability of Airbus and the group.”At a board meeting on June 7, 2005, to discuss the group’s three-year budget plan, Airbus executives predicted that operating profit would probably be no higher than 1.7 billion euros in 2007, down from an internal forecast of 2.6 billion euros, the report said. Executives cited rising research and development costs for the A350, as well as penalty payments for an initial six-month delay in A380 deliveries announced at the Paris air show, the report said. Operating profit margins were expected to drop to about 6.5 percent from an earlier estimate of 9.9 percent.The regulator’s report called this evidence “crucial” because it demonstrated the disparity in the information available to EADS and Airbus management, and what was known to the public, at the time executives began exercising share options in November 2005.The other evidence cited relates to the delays in the development of the A380 and the A350.The French authority said that senior EADS and Airbus managers were aware “at the latest” by March 1, 2006, that “for the second consecutive year and for identical reasons,” deliveries of crucial components of the A380 to the final assembly line in Toulouse, France, had been disrupted.It added that by March 7, 2006, the EADS executive committee was informed that development costs for the A350 had increased by around 30 percent and that expectations of its market share against the rival Boeing 787 had declined.The report said this “has all the characteristics of privileged information.”EADS has consistently maintained that share trading by its executives was in line with company regulations and that it was done with the approval of its compliance department and the chief financial officer, Hans Peter Ring.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','“I was expecting something pretty thin, but now I find myself sneaking around my house with the DS in my pocket, thinking about puzzles,” Mr. Zeschuk said last week by telephone from Edmonton, Alberta, where BioWare is based. “I never conceived of having puzzles as the focus of a game, but they have done a great job of integrating the puzzles with the story and some pretty wacky characters. It’s this juxtaposition of really well thought-out puzzles, high-level artistry and the engaging story.”At its best, Professor Layton is a sublime expression of the game maker’s art. What makes games unique among media is that they force you to think for yourself. Fall asleep halfway through a movie, a TV show or a play, and the actors will get through whatever confronts them on their own. As the viewer, all you have to do is sit there and watch. Or don’t watch. Either way, the plot unfolds without you.In a game the protagonist is you, and if you don’t figure out whatever there is to discover, no one else will do it for you (unless you enlist a friend or look it up online). The very concept of the deus ex machina, the god or godlike solution that miraculously appears to save the day, a concept ingrained into millenniums of traditional media, is completely anathema to interactive storytelling. The whole point of a story’s being interactive, rather than a static narrative merely consumed by the audience, is that the player makes the choices that matter.With a traditional medium like books or opera, consumers are in no way responsible for anything that happens; the narrative exists wholly outside them. But make bad choices in a game, any game, and the game ends badly.That can feel both empowering and intimidating. The essence of game making is to create a framework in which players want to solve the challenges placed before them so that it feels like fun, rather than like a chore. Consider the seminal video game: Pac-Man. The goal is to eat all of the pellets in the maze before the ghosts get you. That could be really boring. But tune and design it properly, and you create a fixture of global culture.A puzzle game like Professor Layton presents that design problem in its starkest form. A puzzle game, clearly, is a collection of puzzles. But if the game is simply set up as a litany of mind-benders devoid of context, the player might as well buy a book of Sudoku or crosswords.Certainly at times the puzzles in Professor Layton can feel arbitrary. The inside joke in the story is that the inhabitants of the town are simply so enamored of puzzles that they usually won’t help you figure out the mystery of the hidden Golden Apple unless you help them with some problem (like that of the bartender who needs to separate eight quarts of juice into equal four-quart portions using only buckets of eight, five and three quarts each).Like much modern Japanese art and media, Professor Layton has an overall style that can feel childish by Western standards. But make no mistake, only the most precocious children will finish this game. At times I found myself falling back on techniques I devised years ago for the Law School Admission Test to move on to the next challenge. It took me about 15 hours to get through the main story line, and I still haven’t figured out all the answers.The inspiration for the game was a series of puzzle books called “Head Gymnastics” written by Akira Tago, a retired professor at Chiba University, that have sold more than 12 million copies in Japan. Mr. Tago is credited as puzzle master on Professor Layton.“The idea behind the Layton series came from turning Prof. Akira Tago’s series of best-selling books, ‘Head Gymnastics,’ into a game,” Akihiro Hino, Level-5’s chief executive, said in an e-mail message from Japan. “The original books were collections of puzzles and brain teasers that were popular with a wide range of readers, from the very young to the very old.“Right about this time,” he continued, “puzzle/brain games became very popular, and a number of titles in this genre hit the market. It was then that I decided that I wanted to create a game that did things a little differently, and I set out to produce a game that fused both story- and puzzle-based game elements to create a genre we call ‘puzzle adventure.’ The Professor Layton series was born out of this endeavor.”As a Westerner might put it, it’s pretty rad.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','The owners did not want to move from the Upper East Side, because they were worried that they might not have a similar clientele in another part of the city.This was also an issue for their former neighbor on 65th Street. Until February, Rita Ford Music Boxes was at 19 East 65th Street. Its lease expired in September, but the new tenant allowed the store to sublet the space for a few months. “We got one more Christmas in,” said Gerald Wright, who owns the business with his wife, Nancy.Mr. Wright said they had been scouring the neighborhood for a new space. “Anything we found that we could afford, we did not find suitable, and anything we found that was suitable, we could not afford,” he said.For the moment, the Wrights are operating the business out of their home in Berkeley Heights, N.J., through their Internet site, www.ritafordmusicboxes.com.Like Cambridge Chemists, Rita Ford Music Boxes had a long history on the Upper East Side. The store’s founder first set up shop there in 1947. Mr. Wright, who began working for Ms. Ford in the 1980s, said that she was “always a bit coy about her age,” but he thought she must have been in her 90s when she sold the business to his family in 1991.Brokers say that quirky local stores like these were once the norm in New York. But it is increasingly hard for them to find space at an affordable price.“New York was always a mom-and-pop retail town” until about 20 years ago, said C. Bradley Mendelson, an executive director and retail specialist at Cushman & Wakefield.Before that, he said, there were hardly any national chain stores in Manhattan, because rents were much cheaper in suburban shopping malls. But then in the 1980s and ’90s, he said, executives caught onto the fact that the greater volume of business in Manhattan more than offset the higher rents. Mr. Mendelson credits the Gap as being one of the first chains to move into the city, and he said the trend accelerated over the last decade.“Almost every time you see a store go vacant, it is because someone can’t afford to pay the new rent,” he said.Mr. Mendelson was hired last year to market the sole commercial space at 222 Park Avenue South, on the northwest corner of 18th Street. This was an early co-op apartment building, and the owners kept the 6,400-square-foot storefront, with an additional 4,600 square feet of storage space in the basement.He predicted the storefront would rent for around $250 a square foot annually on the ground floor. He said the space would most likely go to a large national retailer like a bank, pharmacy or home furnishing store.That would be a far cry from the business that vacated last summer. Alkit, a photo lab and camera store catering to professional photographers, is a family-run business that was established in New York in 1934. Last year, it moved to 227 East 45th Street, in the heart of the city’s photographic district. But rather than taking another storefront at street level, it moved to the 12th floor of an office building.One prominent second act recently has been the resurrection of Second Avenue Deli. This kosher deli, which for more than 50 years was on the corner of Second Avenue and 10th Street, in the heart of the East Village, has reopened on a side street in Murray Hill — at 162 East 33rd Street, between Lexington and Third Avenues.The main reason the new owners went a bit off the beaten path was that they wanted to buy a building where they could reopen. They acquired this building, which has seven rental apartments above the restaurant, for $5.3 million early last year.“It’s not really an issue of whether it is cheaper to own or to rent, because you still have to pay the mortgage,” said Jeremy Lebewohl, 25, who is the co-owner of the new restaurant with his 27-year-old brother, Joshua. “The main thing is who is in control.”The original Second Avenue Deli closed two years ago in a rent dispute, some 52 years after Abe Lebewohl, the brothers’ uncle, founded it. A Chase bank branch is there now.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','Similarly, the biotech giant Cargill has begun manufacturing a polymer from vegetable oils that is used in polyurethane foams, which is found in beddings, furniture and car-seat headrests. Cargill says that using the polymer does more than save crude oil and reduce carbon emissions: the foam it produces has a more uniform density and load-bearing capacity.Researchers say these products are a good beginning, but that new cost-effective processes are needed before biorefineries can replace all petroleum-based chemicals. Many of the solutions, they say, could come from novel ways of harnessing biology.That’s what John Frost and Karen Draths, a husband-and-wife team of chemists, showed in the late 1990s when they engineered micro-organisms that could convert glucose into aromatic alcohols — compounds traditionally produced from a petroleum product and used to make plastics.Dr. Frost said that the research had been inspired by his fascination with microbes as a child, when his father, a dentist, described the work of patients who happened to be chemists. “I thought this was pretty cool stuff,” he said.Dr. Frost and Dr. Draths, who left their jobs as professors at Michigan State University in December 2006 to start Draths Corporation, have more recently developed a microbial process for making phloroglucinol, a chemical to replace formaldehyde, a carcinogen, in adhesive resins. The company is also commercializing a way to make nylon entirely from renewable feedstocks like starch and cellulose.“In this approach,” Dr. Frost said, “what was last growing season’s carbon dioxide is this quarter’s carbon used for the manufacture of chemicals and polymers.”To make biobased manufacturing economically appealing, researchers are also determining ways to reduce the energy costs of transforming hydrocarbon building blocks like sugars and alcohols obtained from biomass into polymers. Dr. Gross and his colleagues at Polytechnic University have been using enzymes for that goal — making, among other things, a biodegradable polyester coating.Some researchers are exploring renewable feedstocks as a source for novel materials, which could provide another economic incentive to companies to pursue biobased chemical production.Dr. George John, a chemist at the City College of New York, and others, for example, have designed a polymer gel for drug ingestion using a byproduct of the fruit industry as a starting point. By adding an enzyme to the gel, which breaks it down over a few hours, the researchers can control the release of the drug after it is swallowed.More players are expected to enter the field as rising oil prices force countries to increase production of biodiesel, providing a bigger supply of the byproduct glycerol.“It could prove to be a very valuable commodity,” said Keith Simons, a chemist who consults for the Glycerol Challenge, a project started by a group of British companies and universities. The $3.6 million-a-year effort is aimed at developing catalysts and other technologies that will use glycerol as a feedstock “for making various downstream chemicals,” Mr. Simons said.The payoffs from developing biobased chemicals could be huge and unexpected, said Dr. John Pierce, DuPont’s vice president for applied biosciences-technology. He pointed to DuPont’s synthesis of propanediol, which was pushed along by the company’s goal to use the chemical to make Sorona, a stain-resistant textile that does not lose color easily.Soon DuPont scientists realized that bioderived propanediol could also be used as an ingredient in cosmetics and products for de-icing aircraft. The high-end grades that are now used in cosmetics are less irritating than traditional molecules, Dr. Pierce said, and the industrial grade used in de-icing products is biodegradable, which makes it better than other options.“It looks like we found a bit of a gold vein,” he said.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','There can also be legal consequences, although this case was resolved without such action. “If you’re not controlling your virtual machine sprawl, then you’re not in Sarbanes-Oxley compliance,” he said.A new generation of start-up companies is offering potential solutions. Virtualization technology itself is also maturing, as the dominant player, VMware of Palo Alto, Calif., prepares for heightened competition from big names in the tech world, including Microsoft, Oracle, Sun Microsystems and Citrix Systems.While virtualization has its roots in mainframe computing, it was only about a decade ago, after Mendel Rosenblum, a Stanford computer-science professor, and his students developed a way to trick modern PCs and servers into running multiple operating systems, when the technology took off.Mr. Rosenblum and his wife, Diane Greene, went on to found VMware, which put virtualization on the map last year with a successful initial public offering. VMware, which is majority-owned by the EMC Corporation, now counts every company in the Fortune 100 as a customer, and analysts estimate that it controls 70 to 90 percent of the virtualization market. It had $1.3 billion in revenue last year.About 10 years ago, virtualization software was used only to develop other software applications, said Stacey Schneider, director of marketing at Hyperic, a San Francisco software company. But it has since taken a more public role, exposing it to attacks from the outside. “It is quick and easy to add virtual servers,” Ms. Schneider said. “But it makes the system manager’s job harder.”Virtualization solved one problem of large data centers: machine sprawl. Data centers, which are the backbone of corporate computing environments, now need far fewer physical machines. But a new problem arose, said Sameer Dholakia, chief executive of VMLogix of Palo Alto: virtual machine sprawl.“Thousands of virtual machines have been created,” he said, and now I.T. managers need to figure out “who created them, what’s on them, when should they be taken down.”While VMLogix competes with VMware — the “vm” in both names refers to virtual machine — VMware also has more than 500 technology companies as partners selling compatible software.“There’s a whole ecosystem of companies using virtualization as a platform to solve all of these problems,” said Raghu Raghuram, VMware’s vice president for data center products and solutions.Simon Crosby, chief technology officer for the virtualization and management division of Citrix Systems, challenged VMware’s assertion that it has allowed many other companies to flourish. He said that VMware had been charging monopoly prices, but that will change when Microsoft releases its Hyper-V virtualization technology later this year. Microsoft released the software in nearly final form in March.“The objective here is to reduce customers’ concerns around getting stuck with a proprietary code base from any one vendor,” Mr. Crosby said. “There is about to be a viable ecosystem. There never has been around VMware. It’s been VMware with its billion dollars in revenue a year, and everyone else starving.”VMware said that its partners included several security software companies. “Security attacks can happen in a virtual environment that couldn’t happen in a physical environment,” Mr. Raghuram of VMware said. “But it’s also possible for security to be better in a virtual environment than in a physical environment.”One company working with VMware is Altor Networks, established last year in Redwood City, Calif. Its chief executive, Amir Ben-Efraim, said that Altor aimed to improve the security aspects of virtual machines.“Virtual machines can communicate with each other and with the outside world, which is great from a productivity perspective,” he said. “The problem is, they lie outside the scope of all the security that exists in the physical world. As virtual machines communicate with each other inside of a particular server, that traffic is what we call a blind spot.”Altor sells a tool that helps I.T. managers see those blind spots. It works with VMware, as well as with XenSource, a competitor that Citrix acquired last year.StillSecure, a security software vendor, also has a product that it says can help make virtual-to-virtual communication more secure.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','Senator John D. Rockefeller IV personally apologized to Senator John McCain of Arizona on Tuesday after remarking in an interview that Mr. McCain’s years as a Navy pilot would not have given him an understanding of everyday issues faced by Americans.In an interview in his home state, West Virginia, on Monday, Mr. Rockefeller, a Democrat, told The Charleston Gazette that Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, could not relate to the everyday concerns of people on issues like health care.According to the article, Mr. Rockefeller said: “McCain was a pilot, who dropped laser-guided missiles from 35,000 feet. He was long gone when they hit. What happened when they get to the ground? He doesn’t know. You have to care about the lives of people. McCain never gets into those issues.”On Tuesday, the McCain campaign demanded an apology, not just from Senator Rockefeller, but also from Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, because he has received the West Virginian’s endorsement.“I have deep respect for John McCain’s honorable and noble service to our country,” Mr. Rockefeller said in a statement. “I made an inaccurate and wrong analogy and I have extended my sincere apology to him. While we differ a great deal on policy issues, I profoundly respect and appreciate his dedication to our country, and I regret my very poor choice of words.”'"
"'08-04-09,'0','Mr. Obama then danced with them around the question of what constituted success in Iraq. “I’m not suggesting that we yank all our troops out all the way, I’m trying to get to an endpoint,” Mr. Obama said, then suggested that the United States might define success downward toward a “messy, sloppy status quo.”Mrs. Clinton never raised her voice or showed the passion she did at General Petraeus’s last Washington hearing, in September, when she told him that his Iraq report required “the willing suspension of disbelief.” The remark has since been hurled at her by her opponents.“What conditions would have to exist for you to recommend to the president that the current strategy is not working?” Mrs. Clinton asked General Petraeus, with only a slight edge of exasperation in her voice. The conditions, she added, “are unclear, they lack specificity.”General Petraeus, who at that point was more than three hours into the hearing, responded that “there has indeed been progress in the political arena,” and then said, in an elaborate answer that might not have satisfied Mrs. Clinton, “there’s even sort of a political-military calculus that you have to consider, again, in establishing where the conditions are met to make further reductions.”Mr. McCain, whose seniority on the committee gave him the advantage of being the second to question the general, asked about the recent assault against Shiite militias in Basra, when some Iraqi forces refused to fight or fled their posts.“What’s the lesson that we’re to draw from that, that 1,000 Iraqi Army and police deserted or underperformed?” Mr. McCain asked.General Petraeus responded that the forces were new and that it was difficult for the Iraqi police to operate where there was “serious intimidation” of their families.“Suffice it to say, it was a disappointment,” Mr. McCain replied.Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton reserved their real fire for each other. Shortly after the hearing began, Mr. McCain was out of the gate with an opening statement calling on Americans to reject proposals for a “reckless and irresponsible withdrawal of our forces at the moment when they are succeeding.” Promising such a withdrawal, he said, “regardless of the consequences,” was “a failure of political and moral leadership.”Mrs. Clinton, who has repeatedly called for troop withdrawals, fired back when her turn came three hours later, close to 12:30 p.m., but by then Mr. McCain had left.“I just want to respond to some of the statements and suggestions that have been made leading up to this hearing, and even during it, that it is irresponsible or demonstrates a lack of leadership to advocate withdrawing troops from Iraq in a responsible and carefully planned withdrawal,” Mrs. Clinton said. “I fundamentally disagree. Rather, I think it could be fair to say that it might well be irresponsible to continue the policy that has not produced the results that have been promised time and time again.”The two entered the room together, shortly before the 9:30 a.m. start of the Armed Services hearing. General Petraeus immediately jumped up to say hello to Mrs. Clinton. Despite some tough political talk from her on the morning news programs (she told MSNBC that General Petraeus did not have a “convincing argument” and said on ABC that “clearly the surge hasn’t worked”), she greeted him as an old friend. For several minutes, as photographers swarmed, Mrs. Clinton smiled and talked animatedly with General Petraeus, looking straight into his eyes and lightly touching his arm.In another part of the hearing room, a group of senators — Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts; John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia; Joseph I. Lieberman, an independent of Connecticut; and Mr. McCain — were kibitzing. Eventually, General Petraeus made his way to greet them.Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain did not appear to make any major mistakes in the hearing, although Mr. McCain did seem to get momentarily tangled over Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia.It happened just after Mr. McCain asked General Petraeus if he still viewed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni group, as a major threat, and elicited the response, “It is still a major threat, though it is certainly not as major a threat as it was, say, 15 months ago.”Mr. McCain responded, “Certainly not an obscure sect of the Shiites over all ... .”Mr. McCain continued, “Or the Sunnis or anybody else.”Senator McCain was embarrassed last month when, on a trip to Jordan, he stated several times that the Iranians were training Iraqi Qaeda operatives in Iran and then sending them back into Iraq. After one of his traveling companions, Mr. Lieberman, corrected him, Mr. McCain explained that he had meant to say that the Iranians, who are Shiites, were training other extremists.'"
"'08-04-09,'0','“This is my 12th or 13th season out here,” Woods said Tuesday, adding that in nine of those years he has won five or more tournaments. “So, just got to win the right four. That’s what it boils down to.”Woods is close to becoming a cultural brand for golf. He dominates his sport like no other athlete.In 1997 he became the youngest player, at 21, to win the Masters. He won his second in 2001, giving him a victory in four consecutive majors. When he won the Masters again in 2002, Woods became only the third player in tournament history to defend his title (the others were Nick Faldo in 1989-90 and Jack Nicklaus in 1965-66). Woods won his fourth green jacket in 2005.He is a transcendent figure, a magnet for the casual fan who tunes in to watch Woods play. For some golf fans, a tournament is not a tournament unless Woods is competing. For players around the world, Woods, more than any player of his generation, has been an inspiration.Jeev Milkha Singh of India said: “I think that for what Tiger’s done, all the players should be grateful to him because of what he’s doing. It’s a global sport; there are more tournaments and more prize money to play for. And he’s set some standards for the other players to look at. You’ve got to work hard, you’ve got to do mental training and you’ve got to practice. It’s a full package and he does that.”So what continues to drive him? The pursuit of excellence? Of perfection? An unattainable quest to beat the game?“I love winning,” Woods said Tuesday. “I just love getting out there and mixing it up with the guys here; they’re trying to beat me and I’m trying to beat them. That’s fun.”For any other golfer on the tour, half of what Woods has accomplished might constitute a superb career.But Woods is competing against a different standard: He is chasing history and not merely any history. Woods is chasing living history: Jack Nicklaus.While Woods is the greatest of his era, Nicklaus is regarded as the greatest player in golf’s history. Woods has won 13 majors; Nicklaus won 18.A number of years ago, Nicklaus predicted that Woods would win 10 Masters. Woods said that at the time he could not see it — he had not even made a cut. With a victory this week, Woods would be halfway there. He would also have a 14th major title. Perhaps that is what drives Tiger: The pursuit of Nicklaus, the quest for that elusive Grand Slam.“I play for myself and my family,” he said. “That’s it. That’s what my father always said to me, and that’s what I’ve always done.”Meanwhile, the pack of golfers continues to chase and nip at his heels. The pack chases, but Woods has no consistent rival. In fact, over the last decade Woods has often been so far ahead of the pack that he seems, at times, to be playing another game.Of course, there is a young, rambunctious player who sometimes feels his oats. Last month, Jason Day, a talented PGA rookie, boldly predicted that he would be the one to “take Tiger down.”When asked about Day, Woods said: “I think it’s just funny. My father’s always taught me just go out there and just play and let your clubs to the talking, and that should be enough.”'"
"'08-04-09,'0','Xai Xai, on West 51st Street, a block away from Casellula, specializes in South African snacks served with South African wines. It, too, is often packed.Cafe Katja on the Lower East Side has an excellent list of Austrian wines and bites like soft, fat pretzels served with two mustards and a tangy cheese spread.Pata Negra in the East Village serves Spanish hams — glistening jamón Ibérico is among the world’s great delicacies — cheeses and tidbits, with Spanish wines, of course.Gottino in the West Village has an Italian theme, but its creative menu goes way beyond the salumi-and-cheese places, with enticing dishes like sweet-and-tart beets, cooked in parchment and bathed in a bright horseradish sauce.Paradoxically, wine can sometimes seem like an afterthought. Too many wine bars have inconsequential selections, as dull as another plate of stale prosciutto. But the good ones always offer something to intrigue even the most jaded palate.At Cavatappo, a storefront on the Upper East Side barely bigger than a breadboard, the selections on a recent visit included a couple of earthy lambruscos, and while the nibbles are largely Italian, the wines include the superb Gaia Thalassitis, from the Greek island of Santorini.Solex, a cavernous French-themed place in the East Village, offers wines from lesser-known appellations like Arbois and Savoie, along with good selections from Austria and Germany.Black Mountain Wine House in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, has an eclectic assortment that includes Montevertine, the superb Tuscan producer, and R. López de Heredia, a singular Rioja.Well-known chefs and restaurateurs have jumped in. Jody Williams, chef at Morandi in the West Village, is the chef and a partner in Gottino. Marco Canora and Paul Grieco of Hearth and Insieme have opened Terroir in the East Village. Blue Ribbon has a wine bar on Downing Street. The biggest name of all of them, Daniel Boulud, has opened Bar Boulud, a wine bar more in name than style.With so many wine bars opening, standing out from the crowd has resulted in some unexpected blends of genre. Ayza on West 31st Street bills itself as a wine and chocolate bar. The sign for Buceo 95 on West 95th Street reads “Vins/Tapas.” And Brian Keyser, an owner of Casellula, insists, “We don’t think of ourselves as a wine bar; we’re a cheese bar.”Where wine bars were once a novelty in New York, their very unremarkableness today indicates how they’ve become an accepted part of the New York landscape, local hangouts like the corner bar or the coffee spot. It was different 25 years ago when the opening of a wine bar here was seen as a sign of cultural arrival.Bartenders tended to preface each glass with extended lectures on winemaking techniques or soil content. With great self-satisfaction wine bars would spotlight their gadgets, like the Cruvinet, which supposedly kept open bottles fresh by enveloping them in nitrogen, hence avoiding oxidation.Consumers were encouraged to order wines in academically inspired flights, with names like Three Sides of Cabernet Sauvignon or A Study in Riesling. They seemed aimed more at teaching customers that wine was gravely important rather than satisfying them.Most of these early places lasted a few years and closed. A new wave would open and the cycle would repeat.It wasn’t until the late 1990s that a different kind of wine bar took root in New York. Relaxed, unpretentious Italian places like ’Ino on Bedford Street and Bar Veloce and Il Posto Accanto in the East Village familiarized New Yorkers to words like panini, tramezzini and quartino.There was no proselytizing, no lectures. They simply served wine and let customers set the pace.The low-key vibe and the easy prices made these places appealing to consumers regardless of their wine orientation, especially to women who wanted to avoid the testosterone-driven pickup scene at bars. That is still true today.But far more crucial to the latest wave of wine bar openings has been the soaring cost of opening a restaurant in New York City.“Economics is the overriding factor,” said Mr. Grieco, an owner of Hearth and Insieme, who just opened Terroir on East 12th Street. “A wine bar can fit into a footprint that a restaurant couldn’t. The cost of real estate, the cost of labor, all the equipment that you need to get a restaurant up and going: a wine bar allows an aspiring restaurateur entree without breaking the bank.”Less than a block from Terroir, my friend Rafael Mateo opened Pata Negra in February. Mr. Mateo had long nursed a desire to open a restaurant while he worked as a schoolteacher in East Harlem. Finally in 2006 he made the break, first overseeing the wine program at La Nacional on West 14th Street, then managing Ostia, a tapas bar in Greenwich Village.But he thirsted for a place that would be entirely his own. A full restaurant, though, would overstep his bank account.“Unless you’re a known chef or have financial backers, you’re more out of your mind opening a restaurant than becoming a schoolteacher,” he said.Working within his small budget he found a storefront with an affordable lease on East 12th Street. Gas ranges and the venting they require are an enormous expense, so he restricted himself to an electric convection oven and a sandwich press. No more than three people, including himself, work at any one time.His vision was based on the small Barcelona bars he fell in love with years ago, specializing in, as he put it, “beautiful sliced ham, beautiful cheese and great wine.”“In the first month I broke even, which any restaurant owner will tell you is a dream,” he said. “That’s beyond successful to me, and in March I doubled what I did in February, which is great.”Mr. Keyser of Casellula had also wanted to open his own restaurant. Eight years in fine dining establishments like Chanterelle and the Modern had fatigued him, but he too had to rein in his ambitions to fit a realistic Manhattan budget.“A full kitchen was not reasonable,” he said. “A lot of square feet was not reasonable.”The potential for savings is not lost on restaurant entrepreneurs like Jim Mamary, who owns six restaurants in Brooklyn, including Patois, Pacifico and Pomme de Terre. He opened Black Mountain Wine House with the idea of eliminating as many expenses as possible, so he has no gas, no heat except the fireplace, one dishwasher and no prep cooks.“It’s amazing how you can control your costs,” he said.While wine is no longer treated as pedantically as before, the educational impulse can still be felt. Most wine bars typically pour tastes of several wines so customers can decide which to order, and they are poised to offer information as requested.Social barriers are even broken as complete strangers offer one another tastes from their glasses. Meanwhile, proprietors like Mr. Grieco of Terroir are simply becoming more creative in how they dispense information.“I think we’ve become a lot more subversive in our application of knowledge to guests,” he said, with more enthusiasm than can be contained in Terroir’s 500 square feet. Plans for T-shirts of wine heroes, wine bingo and wine merit badges spill out in rapid succession. “If you don’t offer education I don’t think you’re a wine bar,” he said.While most wine bars are concentrated in outlying neighborhoods, the mystery, said Tyler Colman, who follows wine bars on his blog drvino.com, is not why the Lower East Side may be the wine bar capital of America, but why there are so few wine bars in Midtown Manhattan.“You would think people would be spilling out from offices,” he said. “As profitable as they may be, there are limits. Obviously, selling coffee is more profitable.”'"

"'08-04-10,'1','A spokeswoman for Mr. Prentice said that the government had no further comment. Neither MacDonald Dettwiler nor Alliant responded to requests for comment.The major asset of MacDonald Dettwiler, a satellite in an unusual polar orbit that uses radar to peer through clouds and under the soil and ice, has also proven to be the greatest stumbling block to the company’s sale.While owned by MacDonald Dettwiler, most of Radarsat-2’s construction and launch costs were financed with 450 million Canadian dollars from the government, which now has broad access to its images.When the satellite was launched in October, the government called it a crucial element of its efforts to assert control of the Arctic. Canada has long clashed with the United States and other countries about its claim to the Northwest Passage, a potential shipping channel through the Arctic. High commodity prices have also prompted interest in minerals that lie under the region.“This satellite will help us vigorously protect our Arctic sovereignty as international interest in the region increases,” the Canadian government said in a news release issued at the time of the launch.Since A.T.K. initiated its bid, several legal specialists and many politicians, including some Conservatives who are not known to be critics of the United States, charged that American laws would effectively give Washington control of the satellite.“If the United States becomes the licensing authority, Ottawa’s ability to control what the satellite is used for and to commandeer the equipment in emergencies might be lost,” Michael Byers, a professor of international law and global politics at the University of British Columbia, told a parliamentary hearing last month.“Suppose, for instance, that Canada wanted priority access for sovereignty assertion purposes just as a major war involving the United States was breaking out in the Middle East,” Mr. Byers said. “One can even imagine the U.S. government using RADARSAT-2 in ways that directly contradict Canada’s interests.”Among the critics is Marc Garneau, a former astronaut and one-time president of the Canadian Space Agency.“It is certain that other countries with strategically important space companies would not allow such foreign takeovers,” Mr. Garneau told Parliament.While the United States government has not commented about the sale, Daniel Friedmann, the president and chief executive of M.D.A., has rejected the idea that the Canadian government would lose any control of the satellite.Mr. Friedmann, however, has his own complaints about the Patriot Act and other recent measures in the United States. Their restrictions against foreigners working on sensitive projects like satellites, he said last week, limit M.D.A.’s ability to bid on contracts in the United States. That effectively has left the Canadian government as the company’s only customer, a fact which prompted the sale.The public profile of M.D.A. and its predecessor companies is much greater in Canada than its financial records would suggest. Most Canadian schoolchildren still learn that the robotic arm in the space shuttle was made in Canada. The attachment last month of a M.D.A.-built, Canadian-financed robotic arm on the international space station was prominent news for several days.Several critics of the sale have compared it to the decision of a Conservative government in 1959 to shut down a program to produce a fighter known as the Avro Arrow. While the aircraft was advanced for its time, it had few prospects of significant foreign sales and was a drain on Canada’s finances.Although Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, is a leading producer of executive jets and regional airliners, the termination of the Arrow program is still regularly cited as a major setback to Canada’s aerospace industry and even became the subject of a television miniseries in 1997 starring Dan Ackroyd.Raymond Simard, a Liberal member of Parliament, said the M.D.A. sale “has the potential of being an Avro Arrow. It will be a benchmark decision. And 10 years down the road, we’ll be looking back and saying, ‘My God, we made a bad decision.’ ”M.D.A. now has 30 days to appeal the government decision.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','In the recent audits, to determine if the airlines are complying with F.A.A. orders, “we found we had achieved 99 percent compliance, but it’s the other 1 percent that keeps me up at night,” Mr. Sabatini said.But he used stronger language to describe what Southwest had done in flying airplanes that it knew had not been properly inspected. While the airline has insisted this was not a safety-of-flight issue, Mr. Sabatini’s prepared testimony said the flights were “putting thousands of passengers at risk.”In separate testimony, the agency’s inspector general said there had been “fundamental breakdowns” in F.A.A. oversight of Southwest Airlines, raising concerns about the agency’s overall effectiveness, especially as groundings of planes have spread.The “serious lapses” in the agencies oversight of airlines’ compliance with inspection regulations, he said, “are symptomatic of much deeper problems in several key areas.”Some senators at the hearing, which continued Thursday afternoon, said that a data-driven system — in which F.A.A. inspectors mostly review records rather than looking at airplanes. — the agency may have lost touch with the actual conditions of the system.But the inspector general, Calvin L. Scovell 3rd, said that at Southwest there was an “overly collaborative” relationship between the airline and its inspectors. The problems dated back to 2003, he noted, and his office has been seeking changes in the agency’s approach for years, but they have not yet been put into effect.In addition to the current maintenance crisis, the agency faces severe challenges in hiring and replacing legions of employees like air traffic controllers and safety inspectors, thousands of whom have reached retirement age in the last few years or will do so soon.But the biggest safety challenge may not be either of these, but the risk of runway collision, according to another witness on Thursday, Steven Chealander, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which has repeatedly called for system to warn pilots in cockpits.Asked by Senator Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia, if the aviation system was on “borrowed time” before its next crash, Mr. Chealander said that the number of serious runway incursions was double this year what it was early last year. Asked where the next accident was likely to occur, he said, “ I believe it’s in that area.”The agency is investigating an incident last weekend at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport in which a tug pulled a Boeing 777 across a runway as another jet, an MD-80 was landing, F.A.A. officials said.The tug tried to stop but the momentum of the airplane pushed it into the runway.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','The remake of “The Blob” won’t feature a gelatinous alien gobbling up everything in its path. The new monster will be a Fox variety show that captivates more than 20 million people each week, auditions and rejects thousands of contestants, and even snubs the next commander in chief.Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton, Barack Obama and John McCain made taped appeals for charity on a special edition of “American Idol” on Wednesday night that didn’t make the cut. The telethon for needy children around the world entitled “Idol Gives Back” drew the likes of Fergie, Bono, Brad Pitt, Mariah Carey and Miley Cyrus, and went too long. The candidates’ contributions were kicked back to Thursday night’s episode.It was Simon Cowell, the “Idol” judge, who admonished the nation about the health care crisis in the United States, narrating a short, gauzy film that showed him visiting and consoling a low-income family with no insurance. It was Reese Witherspoon who spoke on behalf of the Children’s Defense Fund, the organization for whom Mrs. Clinton worked as a young lawyer. It was Brad Pitt who praised the American can-do spirit in rebuilding New Orleans and received a standing ovation.The night, a mix of songs, skits and documentary-style shorts chronicling poverty in African villages and mobile homes in Appalachia, was a commendable exception to the show’s ruling formula of commercialized pop music and corporate cross-promotion (viewers who want to hear the contestants on the “Idol” Web site must download their songs from Itunes). It was another laurel for “American Idol,” proving it can draw top celebrities and donations — the first “Gives Back” event last season raised $76 million.As these star-studded events go, it wasn’t egregiously self-congratulatory. In show business, giving is the new getting; the real measure of a performer’s status is not how many millions he is paid per film or concert, but how many millions he gives away to charity.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','Gazprom of Russia, the natural gas producer, and Eni of Italy are preparing to join forces to pipe natural gas from Libya across the Mediterranean to Southern Europe. The deal would enable Russia to increase Europe’s dependence on Gazprom, which is state controlled. Paolo Scaroni, left, chief executive of Eni, said the deal with Gazprom would involve “the swap of assets outside of Russia.” Russia already supplies more than a quarter of Western Europe’s energy needs. Some analysts said that if Gazprom succeeded in Libya and in Algeria, where it is competing for contracts, it could end up dominating the supply routes to Southern Europe.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','When politicians talk of reforming the health care system to rein in costs, skeptical patients often worry that they will be forced to accept shoddy treatment in second-rate institutions. So it is a relief to learn that the famed Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and the renowned Cleveland Clinic in Ohio offer outstanding care at bargain prices — at least compared with higher-priced, equally prestigious medical centers elsewhere.The comparison comes via the latest edition of the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care, published by Dartmouth’s Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice. Researchers there have long pointed to large disparities in medical spending in different areas of the country and shown that patients usually do no better — and often fare worse — where the spending is highest.This year’s atlas focuses on Medicare spending for patients in the last two years of life at the top five teaching hospitals, as ranked by U.S. News & World Report. The medical center at the University of California, Los Angeles, was the most extravagant, averaging some $93,000 per patient. Johns Hopkins, at $85,000, and Massachusetts General, at $78,000, came next. The Cleveland Clinic, at $55,000, and the Mayo Clinic, at $53,000, were far more cost-effective.The reason for the disparities is not that one hospital charges a lot more for a given service than the others. Rather, the high-cost hospitals provide a lot more services for patients than the lower-cost hospitals: keeping patients in the hospital and in intensive care for longer periods, sending them to a slew of specialists and doing a lot more tests and procedures.No doubt the high-cost institutions think they are “going the extra mile” for their patients, but some patients don’t want such aggressive care and most don’t experience any health benefits from it.Few will be surprised to discover that doctors in high-expenditure institutions are typically paid on a fee-for-service basis, which means they earn more if they do more. Mayo Clinic doctors, by contrast, are on salary and have no financial incentive to do anything more than the patient clearly needs.'"

His nomination in Parliament and the presidential approval he requires to become prime minister are now little more than formalities. He will succeed Bertie Ahern, who has announced that he will resign on May 6. Mr. Cowen, known as an intellectual heavyweight, said there would be a difference in style from the populist Mr. Ahern. “Bertie Ahern certainly, literally night and day, lived the job,” he said. “There is, as I said last week, a private life and a family side of my life that I wish to see respected.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','Advisers to Mr. Obama said a decision about public financing would not be made until resolution of his Democratic primary fight against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has not said whether she would take part in the system.No major-party candidate has turned down public financing for the general election since the system took effect in 1976. But while $84.1 million for the two-month fall campaign is a sizable amount of money, Mr. Obama’s fund-raising machine has shown an ability to eclipse the figure easily, having raised $55 million in February alone and an additional $40 million in March.David Axelrod, chief strategist to Mr. Obama, said the candidate’s suggestion that the campaign had created a parallel public financing system was “an observation about what’s happened” rather than a signal that he would ultimately turn down government financing and the limits that go with it. Whatever the decision, Mr. Axelrod said, the goal of creating a more egalitarian political system will have been maintained.“The campaign finance system was constructed in order to reduce the influence of large donations and limit the amount of money,” Mr. Axelrod said in an interview in this Philadelphia suburb, where Mr. Obama campaigned Wednesday. “Here it’s happening naturally: people are sending $5, $10, $25, $100 contributions.”As for Mr. McCain, he has crusaded against the influence of money in politics in the Senate and has criticized Mr. Obama for hedging on his earlier decision to apply for public financing. But Mr. McCain drew criticism of his own earlier this year when he backed away from public financing for the primary elections. He initially sought those public matching funds, which come with limits of their own, after his campaign nearly ran out of money, but decided to bypass them after donations started coming in.While Mr. McCain had his best fund-raising month yet in March, bringing in $15 million, he has significantly trailed both of his Democratic counterparts. If he accepts public financing and Mr. Obama does not, he will most likely face a significant spending disadvantage.But Mr. McCain’s advisers believe they will be able to make up much of the difference with strong fund-raising for the Republican National Committee, which has so far enjoyed a big edge over the Democratic National Committee. The Republican committee had $25 million in cash on hand at the end of February, compared with less than $5 million for the Democratic committee.The parties can work on behalf of their respective nominees, with some restrictions. The McCain campaign and the Republican Party have now established a joint fund-raising arm, McCain Victory 08, that allows donors to write a single check that can be divided between the two. While checks for the campaign would be limited to $2,300 for the fall (should Mr. McCain ultimately decide against public financing), they can be up to $28,500 for the party, and Mr. McCain’s advisers believe that the joint fund-raising committee can raise more than $150 million.While some of Mr. McCain’s advisers say privately that it is almost certain he will accept public financing, campaign officials emphasize that no final decision has been made.“We could sit down in July or August and say, ‘Hey, we’re raising a lot of money and maybe we should forgo it,’ ” said Charles Black, a senior McCain adviser. “We don’t have enough data.”For now, McCain advisers have indicated that they will seek to exploit the issue if Mr. Obama indeed opts out of public financing for the general election. With an obvious interest in reining in the Obama fund-raising juggernaut, the McCain campaign seized Wednesday on Mr. Obama’s remark of Tuesday night.“Barack Obama publicly promised the American people that he would accept public financing if he is the nominee of his party,” said Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for Mr. McCain. “Launching his campaign by going back on a promise to voters would be dishonest, and exposes his politics of hope as empty rhetoric out of a typical politician.”As he campaigned in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Mr. Obama intensified his focus on Mr. McCain, but did not discuss fund-raising. Mr. Axelrod, however, was ready with a rejoinder to Mr. Bounds.Alluding to a $4 million line of credit that Mr. McCain obtained late last year, secured in part by the promise of federal matching money for the primaries, Mr. Axelrod said the rest of the primary season “should give Senator McCain time to figure out whether he was in or out of the campaign finance system in the primary, which is still an open question.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','The indictment was not the first time Scruggs had been tied to distributing performance-enhancing drugs to baseball players. In the Mitchell report, Troy Glaus of the St. Louis Cardinals and Scott Schoeneweis of the Mets were cited for receiving steroids after Scruggs had written them prescriptions.“It’s already been discussed and hashed out,” Schoeneweis said at Shea Stadium. “It’s all old news.”That information stemmed from an investigation into an Internet ring of pharmacies and antiaging clinics by authorities at the Albany County district attorney’s office in New York and federal authorities in Alabama. Lawyers familiar with the case had said Scruggs wrote prescriptions for players besides Glaus and Schoeneweis.Rob Manfred, baseball’s executive vice president for labor relations, said the commissioner’s office was cooperating with the federal investigation and declined further comment.The New York Times reported in March that agents in California for the Drug Enforcement Administration had been investigating Scruggs for several years. That investigation regained momentum in the last year after it had become dormant, lawyers familiar with the case said.The indictment of Scruggs, along with the two associates — Allan Danto, a consultant, and Heidi Macpherson, an office manager — is another instance in which the United States attorney’s office in the Northern District of California has taken on a matter involving professional athletes and performance-enhancing drugs.The indictment was signed by Matt Parrella and Jeff Nedrow, the two assistant United States attorneys who have done much of the work in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative investigation, dating to 2002 . The I.R.S. special agent Jeff Novitzky, who has become the face of most of the federal government’s investigations into the distribution of performance-enhancing drugs to professional athletes, is not believed to be playing a key role in the Scruggs case.Scruggs operated his medical practice out of the New Hope Health Center in Tustin, Calif. State authorities have detailed numerous times he has improperly written prescriptions for patients across the country whom he never examined.Documents filed by the state medical board in June 2004 and updated in June 2006 said Scruggs had “prescribed approximately 6,073 prescriptions of dangerous drugs or controlled substances over the Internet without a good faith examination of the patients” in and out of California since 2000. Scruggs settled the matter and accepted a $4,800 fine and 35 months of probation.Scruggs was described as “an antiaging and performance specialist” in an interview in 2000 on the Web site anabolicextreme.com. He said at the time that he was concerned about how other doctors viewed him.“If you want to know the truth, I don’t like taking 22- or 23-year-olds and putting them on steroids; it makes me nervous,” he said. “Yet I’d rather have them come to me, and manage their steroid use, than have them do it on their own.”Scruggs has admitted to taking human growth hormone and also complained that there were few “steroid-friendly pharmacies.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoft on Thursday plans to introduce a Web-based service for driving directions that incorporates complex software models to help users avoid traffic jams.The new service’s software technology, called Clearflow, was developed over the last five years by a group of artificial-intelligence researchers at the company’s Microsoft Research laboratories. It is an ambitious attempt to apply machine-learning techniques to the problem of traffic congestion. The system is intended to reflect the complex traffic interactions that occur as traffic backs up on freeways and spills over onto city streets.The Clearflow system will be freely available as part of the company’s Live.com site (maps.live.com) for 72 cities in the United States. Microsoft says it will give drivers alternative route information that is more accurate and attuned to current traffic patterns on both freeways and side streets.A system for driving directions that Microsoft introduced last fall was limited, because without Clearflow there was no information available about traffic conditions on city streets adjacent to the highways. Because the system assumed that those routes would be clear, drivers were on occasion sent into areas that were more congested than the freeways.The new service will on occasion plan routes that might not be intuitive to a driver. For example, in some cases Clearflow will compute that a trip will be faster if a driver stays on a crowded highway, rather than taking a detour, because side streets are even more backed up by cars that have fled the original traffic jam.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','“I typically stand between the cars, and it could be very dangerous because people could be leaning against the door,” said Neil McGrath, who commutes between Princeton and New York. “It’s kind of dodgy. You could easily get thrown out of the door.”Riders are routinely told not to stand between cars, but feel compelled to do so during peak hours when cars are so crowded that it is standing- room-only and conductors cannot make their way through the aisle to collect fares.When questioned, rail industry consultants said they wondered whether New Jersey Transit is cutting corners on maintenance, or is stretched too thin as it tries to keep up with record demand.“It raises concerns and sounds to me like something that needs to be reviewed in detail,” said James E. Burnett Jr., a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, the federal government’s safety watchdog responsible for investigating accidents. “It’s a serious thing for doors to come open and cars to come uncoupled. The ideal response is to investigate this and to determine where the responsibility lies, not necessarily for accountability, but to make safety corrections.”In an internal report to New Jersey Transit’s board members submitted this week, Richard Sarles, the agency’s executive director, said that “on a fleetwide basis, the railroad does not have systemic safety issues with doors,” and that no one was injured in the door-opening incidents this year.Rather, Mr. Sarles blamed an assortment of mechanical problems or, in one case, human error, when an engineer left a key in a door control panel. As for questions about safety, he said that in 2007, injuries to employees and passengers fell to their lowest levels in four years.Stephen Klejst, the deputy general manager of safety and training at New Jersey Transit’s railway operations, said that even though the agency is running about 40 more trains a day this year, the condition of the cars and the routine for maintaining them has not been affected.Mr. Sarles did acknowledge that “over the last several years,” newer cars manufactured by Alstom, known as Comet V cars, have had door problems, although the railroad declined to say how many door-related incidents were reported in 2007. By comparison, the Long Island Rail Road said that the doors opened on a moving train just once last year, and Metro-North confirmed two such incidents.The Federal Railroad Administration does not require commuter railroads to report incidents of doors opening while trains are in motion, nor does the American Public Transportation Association, an industry group that keeps these statistics.Rider advocacy groups like the Lackawanna Coalition give New Jersey Transit high marks for its safety record.But Patrick F. Reilly, the chairman of the United Transportation Union, Local 60, which represents New Jersey Transit’s conductors, said the railroad’s main concern is keeping to its schedules and that cars are being put into service that might otherwise be left in the yard to be fixed. He added that some of the problems with the doors might be caused by the mixing of car models in a single train, which can lead to computerized safety features being out of sync.“Current management’s No. 1 priority is on-time performance,” Mr. Reilly said, “but there’s a lack of interest in safety. I’m trying to blow the whistle before an accident occurs.”Mr. Klejst said that mixing car models was done regularly without incident.Problems with train doors are nothing new. In 2006, a man was caught in a New Jersey Transit train door and killed after being dragged along the platform at Bradley Beach. The family of the man, John D’Agostino, filed a lawsuit against the agency, which fired the two conductors and one engineer who worked on the train that day. On March 31, an arbitrator reinstated the engineer, but upheld the agency’s decision to fire the conductors.Mr. Reilly insists that faulty equipment was to blame, and that the crew members were turned into scapegoats. But the Federal Railroad Administration said in a report about the incident that the crew failed to confirm that the doors were still open because a passenger was stuck between them.In the meantime, New Jersey Transit riders keep encountering malfunctioning doors. On the morning of March 14, an eastbound train pulled into Pennsylvania Station in Newark. As the doors opened and passengers began to enter, a man was struck by a door that had shut quickly.“The door closed on the man, but the other doors remained open,” said another passenger, Blake Zoephel. “The man didn’t seem hurt, but what if that door had closed on a young child or a 70-year old woman?”In February, the center and end doors of a train opened as it sped through the tunnel under the Hudson River. A week later, a door on a Raritan Valley Line train shut on a passenger and remained shut until fellow riders pried it open.In the face of these incidents, New Jersey Transit, in the annual revision of its conductors’ manual, changed several rules last month on how to operate doors.On March 19, a passenger got stuck in a door at the Bay Street station, according to Mr. Reilly, and the next day, the doors opened on their own after the train pulled into the station in Summit. “I never thought it was possible for the doors to open while the train was moving,” said Ms. Papapietro, “but now I know better.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','In addition, Mr. Eagleburger said, “there is no question that a lot of my far right friends have now decided that since you can’t beat him, let’s persuade him to slide over as best we can on these critical issues.”Mr. McCain, who is aware of the concerns, told reporters on his campaign plane early this week that he took foreign policy advice from a wide variety of people. “Some of them are viewed as ‘more conservative,’ quote,” he said, adding, “but I do have a broad array of people that I talk to, and hear from, and read what they write.”Mr. McCain has always promoted his reputation for departing from ideological orthodoxy in both foreign and domestic policy. As an unwavering supporter of the Iraq war, he is closely associated with the issue that is most clearly identified with the neoconservatives, even though he often criticized Mr. Bush’s execution of the war.He has been sympathetic to neoconservative views on some other issues, like taking a hard line with Russia and a proposal to establish a new international body made up solely of democracies as a counterweight to the United Nations. In other aspects of foreign and national security policy, he tilts toward the pragmatist camp, as in his promise to work more closely with allies.“I don’t think that Senator McCain splits the difference so much as he bridges the difference” between the two factions, Mr. Scheunemann said. “You’ve got well-known realist figures as well as neo-cons,” but “they are signing up to John McCain’s campaign; he’s not necessarily signing up to their views on how best to lead.”Still, as prominent pragmatists and neoconservatives have started to part company over the war, they appear to be jockeying for influence in Mr. McCain’s campaign and, should he be elected, in his administration.One of the chief concerns of the pragmatists is that Mr. McCain is susceptible to influence from the neoconservatives because he is not as fully formed on foreign policy as his campaign advisers say he is, and that while he speaks authoritatively, he operates too much off the cuff and has not done the deeper homework required of a presidential candidate.In a trip to the Middle East last month, Mr. McCain made an embarrassing mistake when he said several times that he was concerned that Iran was training Al Qaeda in Iraq. (The United States believes that Iran, a Shiite country, has been training Shiite extremists in Iraq, but not Al Qaeda, a Sunni insurgent group.) And on Tuesday at hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee he briefly referred to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia as a Shiite group, rather than a Sunni group.The worry about Mr. McCain is centered among a group of foreign policy realists who have long been close to him and who lost out to the hawks in the intense ideological battles of the first term of the current White House. The group includes former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, former Deputy Secretary of State Richard L. Armitage and Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to the first President Bush.While Mr. Powell and Mr. Armitage supported Mr. Bush’s decision to invade Iraq while they were in office, they have become critics of the management of the war. Mr. Scowcroft incurred the anger of the current President Bush when he wrote a 2002 opinion article in The Wall Street Journal that argued against the invasion of Iraq.Conservatives around Mr. McCain counter that the other side’s concerns are groundless because Mr. McCain is hardly an empty vessel who might succumb to the views of one group or another.“I would say his world view is so established that there is not a real battle going on,” said Mr. Kagan, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “A struggle over individual policies I could imagine, but the broad view, no. People would agree on what McCain thinks. This is not one of those situations like Bush all over again, with some titanic struggle going on between different factions.”Mr. McCain’s advisers say he talks to realists like former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. Mr. Kissinger said in an interview that he had talked with Mr. McCain “15 to 20 times in the last year,” including on a bus ride to a fund-raiser on Long Island.“In his speeches and daily pronouncements, I generally have no input,” Mr. Kissinger said. “When we meet for lunch or dinner, or on the one or two occasions he has come to my home, we have had philosophical discussions. When he calls me now, it will be mostly ‘this event has happened and what do you think?’ ”Mark Salter, one of Mr. McCain’s closest advisers, called the concerns of the pragmatists “utter nonsense” and added that “if John McCain on a given issue would talk to Bob Kagan about 30 percent as often as he talks to Henry Kissinger, for some people that is 30 percent too much.”Although the concerns at this point are focused more on access to Mr. McCain than on major policy differences, there have been some substantive areas of dispute. Mr. Kissinger was said to have been disturbed by Mr. McCain’s hardline attitude on Russia and the Russian president Vladimir Putin in the March 26 speech, viewing it as “going far beyond anything that is necessary” and “something that he has got to be talked out of,” according to someone who has spoken recently with Mr. Kissinger.“I have no comment on that paragraph,” Mr. Kissinger said when asked directly. “You have to take my judgment from what I have written. But I am a strong supporter of the senator.”Similarly, Mr. Scowcroft is said to have expressed reservations about Mr. McCain’s call for creating a League of Democracies as a complement to the United Nations. An associate of Mr. Scowcroft said he viewed it as an effort to diminish the United Nations — a target of scorn among neoconservatives — and inhibit engagement with enemies.But Mr. McCain’s positions on many other issues appeal to the pragmatists. In the Los Angeles speech, he rejected the unilateralism that has been the hallmark of the Bush administration’s foreign policy in favor of what he called “being a good and reliable ally to our fellow democracies.”Before the Iraq war, Mr. McCain generally opposed aggressive assertions of American power abroad. As a freshman congressman he criticized Ronald Reagan’s deployment of marines in Lebanon in 1983; later, in the 1990s, he sought to cut off financing for American troops in Somalia, at first wanted to limit the American response to Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait to the air, and opposed military intervention in Haiti.So far, Mr. McCain has not established a formal foreign policy briefing process within his campaign. If he needs information or perspective on an issue, advisers say he picks up the phone and calls any number of people, among them Mr. Kissinger, Mr. Shultz or Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut.Mr. Scheunemann, who works out of McCain campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va., serves as the coordinator who sends advance copies of Mr. McCain’s speeches to the foreign policy advisers and receives information from them to send to the candidate and throughout the campaign.Philip D. Zelikow, a former top adviser to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice who is not working for Mr. McCain, said it was not surprising that there were worries among the realists about the presumptive Republican nominee.“It’s partly because McCain hasn’t settled himself in one camp, and hasn’t told Rich, you’re my man, Rich, you’re the lodestar,” said Mr. Zelikow, referring to Mr. Armitage. “But if you’re in McCain’s position, is it in his interest to settle the argument now? It’s in his interest to embrace the largest number of Republicans and not declare that he is in favor of one faction or another.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','MEXICO CITY — President Felipe Calderón late Tuesday sent to Congress long-awaited legislation meant to overhaul Mexico’s state oil monopoly. But the limited measures effectively ended any expectation that Mexico would soon take steps to open important parts of its energy industry.With one of the world’s most protected energy sectors, Mexico is the third most important supplier of crude oil to the United States. But production by the state-run oil company, Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, has fallen more than 10 percent since reaching a peak in 2004. Crude oil exports, too, have begun to slide.Pemex has failed to invest enough in exploration or refining, and pipelines and storage facilities have deteriorated. Mexico now imports 40 percent of its gasoline. Analysts predicted that the proposed legislation would do little to change all that.“They are maybe taking 50 tiny steps in the right direction,” said David Shields, an analyst based here who writes extensively on Pemex. “That’s better than nothing, but it’s not much better than nothing.”In a significant change, the law, if passed, would allow private companies to build and operate refineries, pipelines and storage facilities. But they would not be permitted to invest in exploration or production, even in joint ventures. And privately owned refineries would still have to buy their crude oil from Pemex and sell gasoline back to the company at controlled prices.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','For Mrs. Edwards, who battled breast cancer, health became an issue at the start of the race, when she and her husband announced that they would continue his campaign even though her cancer had spread to the bones. It has not spread further, she said. Other than side effects of medications, she said, she is doing “fine” and has lots of energy.In reasserting her interest in public policy, Mrs. Edwards said her husband, a former senator from North Carolina, had decided to attend to her needs first because their lives had revolved around his past campaigns. While he has not outlined a path for his future, she predicted he would focus on antipoverty efforts.In the long run, she said, she believed that the ways Mr. Edwards had pushed his fellow candidates on issues like poverty and guided the party would have effects far beyond this campaign.With Mr. Edwards keeping a low profile since leaving the race, Senators Clinton and Barack Obama stepped off the campaign trail to seek his support.“We did talk about health care with Senator Obama and Senator Clinton,” Mrs. Edwards said. “And where there are differences, we talked about those differences and why I believed John’s was right.”She dismissed reports that the couple were “turned off” by those discussions with Mr. Obama. His health plan would initially mandate coverage just for children. Mrs. Clinton’s would require coverage for all Americans.Mrs. Edwards added that the couple’s expressed concerns were “apparently not sufficiently persuasive enough that anybody has changed their position.”With the primary in the Edwardses’ home state, North Carolina, less a month away, Mrs. Edwards called endorsements overrated, even her husband’s. She asked, after Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico had endorsed Mr. Obama, “Was there really a change anywhere?”She said she and her husband had not been asked to appear with either Democrat leading up the North Carolina vote on May 6. But she said they had decided to go to Walt Disney World the week before.She said she saw no problem with the fight over the Democratic nomination going to the national convention. And she said she agreed with Mrs. Clinton that superdelegates should weigh in as appropriate and did not necessarily need to vote the way their state or caucus had voted.Mrs. Edwards faulted the news media for what she said was focusing on a minute part of the campaign, the perceived “sniping” between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton.“As long as they continue to have a dialogue about the differences between them,” she said, “I think it’s good for the party.”Asked whether Mr. McCain might benefit because he has more time to prepare for Election Day in November, Mrs. Edwards said healthy competition made for a better contender.“He did better when he had opposition than without, I think,” Mrs. Edwards said. “Everybody is better with a foil.”“It might’ve been better for John Kerry to continue to have to make his case in the interim between March and July, maybe to be subject to criticism,” she said of her husband’s running mate in the 2004 presidential campaign.For the two Democratic rivals now, she said, “I think their profiles have been enhanced, as opposed to diminished.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','The suit seeks to force the city to provide sidewalks, adequate road repairs, sewers, fire hydrants, snow and trash removal and other basic services that the owners say the city has withheld for more than 40 years. It is also asking for unspecified damages for past neglect.Supporters of the plan, however, say the suit is just another attempt by business owners to stop development proposals, a battle over various proposals going back to the days of the master planner Robert Moses.Mayor Bloomberg’s office deferred questions about the suit to the city’s Law Department. Connie Pankratz, a spokeswoman for that agency, said in a statement, “We have not yet received the legal papers, but will review them thoroughly upon receipt.”Jeff Roberts, a spokesman for the city’s Economic Development Corporation, said the city could not build a sewage system with the current businesses in place. As for the other services the owners said they were not getting, Mr. Roberts said: “I don’t know that that’s accurate. We are trying to look into exactly what is being done. I believe the F.D.N.Y. and all the other city agencies have been serving the area.”About 100 business owners and workers joined Queens lawmakers at a rally at City Hall on Wednesday, carrying poster-size photos depicting barely paved streets riddled with craters and flooded by rainstorms.“Some of the photos you see behind me — you see floods, you wonder if this is New York City in 2008 or Baghdad after a few mortar rounds,” said Councilman Hiram Monserrate of Queens, whose district includes the area.Councilman Eric N. Gioia, also of Queens, said the threat of eminent domain, even as a last resort, was “like walking into a negotiation, putting a gun on the table, and saying, ‘I’d like to strike a fair deal; I’ll only use the gun if I have to.’ ”The landowners say that if the city repaired the roads, installed storm drains and put in a sewage system, development would follow on its own.“We essentially have no essential services provided for us there, no snow removal, no grass cutting,” said Anthony Fodera, president of Fodera Foods Inc., one of the plaintiffs. “The streets — I’ve been there for 35 years; I have yet to see them fill a pothole.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','According to the BBC, it has been widely reported in China that Mr. Brown would attend the opening celebration.Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, accused Mr. Brown of ducking the issue, particularly when two other European leaders, Angela Merkel of Germany and Nicolas Sarkozy of France, have suggested that they may not attend.“Chancellor Merkel in Germany and President Sarkozy in France saying quite specifically that they might not go to the opening ceremony shows that the debate has always been about the opening ceremony,” Mr. Clegg told the BBC.“So now suddenly to be asked to believe by No. 10 that they never really intended to go in the first place either smacks of a rather odd way of going about things or just downright incompetence.”Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York praised Mr. Brown’s announcement. “I wanted to commend Prime Minister Gordon Brown for agreeing not to go to the opening ceremonies of the Olympics in Beijing,” she said at an event in New York, calling it “an important decision by Prime Minister Brown.”According to a poll conducted in Britain by YouGov for Channel 4 News, 43 percent of those surveyed said that Mr. Brown should not go to the opening ceremony, 29 percent said that he should go and the rest did not know or did not care.Along with leaders of other countries, Mr. Brown has been put in a difficult position over how to deal with increasingly vociferous public outrage over China’s human rights abuses and its policies toward Tibet and Sudan while also supporting the country’s athletes in the Olympics.Britain was embarrassed by the chaotic scenes that followed the progress of the Olympic torch through London on Sunday, when demonstrators protesting China’s record in Tibet disrupted the procession at every turn.When the torch arrived at Downing Street at the end of its fraught journey, Mr. Brown pointedly greeted the athletes but did not touch the torch.He said that had been the plan all along, too.“It was made clear beforehand that the torch would be passed between the athletes — it was not a torch for politicians to try and sort of get their hands on,” he told the BBC.“Everybody was told beforehand I wasn’t going to be carrying the torch or touching it.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','A lonely newt, a strong-willed Scottish princess and modern-day elves are among the stars of 10 new animated movies from Walt Disney Studios and its boutique animation unit, Pixar. On Tuesday Disney unveiled its animation plans for movie theater owners and the news media. The message of the presentation: Disney’s acquisition of Pixar has rejuvenated the company’s entire animation business. The slate, not entirely a surprise to Disney followers, is certainly ambitious. During the next five years Disney’s offerings will include four straight-to-DVD animated features starring Tinker Bell and her friends; the company’s first hand-drawn musical in nearly two decades, “The Princess and the Frog”; a 3-D retelling of “Rapunzel”; and installments of the “Cars” and “Toy Story” franchises. Among the original features Pixar is attempting are “Newt,” a summer 2011 film about a lizard cooling his heels in a community college science lab; “The Bear and the Bow,” a holiday 2011 fantasy about an impetuous Scottish princess; and “King of the Elves,” a 2012 offering focusing on elves and trolls living in modern-day Mississippi.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','Still, neither Mr. Hammond nor Mr. Wilcher planned to provide money for Mr. Brooks’s venture, Henry Milbourne & Son Ltd. of Arcadia, Calif. (The Web site, http://henrymilbourne.com, is still in the works.)Mr. Brooks said he had contacted about 500 angel investors and angel-investor groups and 40 venture capital firms and boutique investment bankers over the last year to raise the $2.5 million he thinks he needs. But only nine have put up any money, including his former wife. The total he has raised so far is $475,000.To some extent, Mr. Brooks is snared in the Catch-22 paradox that bedevils many entrepreneurs who have come up with a promising product and marketing plan: investors are reluctant to open their wallets until they see a functioning business. But it is difficult to create a functioning business until the investors open their wallets.In addition, he may be looking in the wrong places. Some of the investors he has contacted get involved only in deals worth at least $5 million.“We have everything in place,” Mr. Brooks said. “We have the premises rented; the Web site under construction; the logo done; the marketing plan set up.” Even the boxes for the $365 custom shirts, $235 ready-to-wear shirts and $108 hand-made silk neckties, all British-made, have been designed, he said. (He plans to branch out from those core products to silk underwear, cashmere hosiery, toiletries, cufflinks and leather goods, and to fragrances made by the supplier to Truefitt & Hill, barbers to the British royal family.)Moreover, he has invested $600,000 of his own money, including $300,000 for the Henry Milbourne & Son trademark rights, and has spent two years trying to put the company together, paying himself no salary.Mr. Brooks, a native of St. Vincent in the West Indies, said his African heritage might also be an impediment. The issue is not racism, he said, but the fact that he does not have a network of well-heeled friends and acquaintances that he can tap.Luke Visconti, co-founder of DiversityInc magazine, which covers diversity in the workplace, said aspiring black entrepreneurs are at a clear disadvantage. “There are almost no black-run venture firms and very few black angel investors,” Mr. Visconti said. “Successful black entrepreneurs are scarce, and they are getting hit on every day.”As for family and friends, a traditional first stop for start-ups, Mr. Visconti said the average wealth of black households in the United States is one-tenth that of white households.“The circle of wealth that black people can tap into is minuscule compared with what is available to well-connected white people,” he said.Mr. Visconti added that the slowing economy might also be cutting into the funds available for a start-up.Mr. Brooks conceded that investors were more cautious than they were a year ago, but he said he believed that there were still plenty of deep pockets in search of opportunities.The real problem, potential investors he has contacted say, is that he needs to narrow his hunt for money.Mr. Hammond of Copana Partners, for example, said the deal was too small for his firm. “Unfortunately, start-ups like Henry Milbourne often find themselves in no man’s land when looking for capital between $1 million and $5 million,” he said. “The capital requested is too small to attract big institutional investors.” On the other hand, it can be difficult to raise even $1 million from acquaintances or angel investors, he said.Paul Azous, managing member of the A.Z.O. Group, a consulting firm in Seattle, said, “That much money for a start-up without a track record — I’ve never seen it happen.”These investors did have some words of advice. Mr. Hammond urged Mr. Brooks to “better the odds by creating a proof of concept,” notably by developing a “full-blown professional-looking home page to communicate to investors his exact brand image, layout, style and Web site.” He also suggested that Mr. Brooks take a quick test of his products’ appeal by standing outside an office building and handing out fliers, then going inside and making pitches door to door. “Prove to investors that demand exists,” he said.Mr. Azous encouraged Mr. Brooks to open a store, seek investors who specialize in retailing and, above all, be persistent. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” he said.Mr. Brooks accepted some of the advice, like aiming at investors more carefully. But he rejected other parts, like going after tiny investments or peddling high-end apparel on the street.He remains confident that he can meet his goal of raising $2.5 million by summer. Realizing he needs to jump-start the process, he has hired several professionals over the last month, including lawyers with connections to high-wealth individuals, to scout around for him. “Three or four good investors would take care of it,” he said.In his favor, he has the entrepreneurial gene. As a child growing up in St. Vincent, he made money photographing villagers with his Kodak Brownie 127. In 1989, he started Bio-Dental Technologies with $16,000 in savings and built it into a $33 million distributor of dental products before selling it to Zila for $35 million in 1994, making a seven-figure profit for himself.His other big money-making adventure was engineering reverse mergers, in which he created public companies, combined them with privately held firms that wanted to go public without dealing with a lot of regulatory problems, and cashed out. He completed eight such transactions, he said, grossing about $2 million.He said he continued to make progress in his latest venture. Late last week, he said, two investors who previously were not interested in his company took a new look at it, and one wrote a check for $75,000, while the other seems close to making a commitment. He renewed talks with a third investor this week.“We hope to be operational in about three months,” Mr. Brooks said. “This is a company whose time has come.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','The new rule does not take effect until 2011 but its passage lit a fire under small-business groups who say it is unfair and who are fighting for its repeal.“This is our No. 1 priority issue for this Congress,” said Molly Brogan, a spokeswoman for the National Small Business Association.With the economy slumping, Congress could once again adopt last-minute measures to raise revenue. A growing number of lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, want to pay for new spending by closing what is known as the “tax gap” — the shortfall of some $300 billion in uncollected taxes. The government says that at least $100 billion of that comes from underreporting by the self-employed.But small-business lobbyists say small enterprises are already overburdened by current requirements for tax withholding, record-keeping and reporting.“There are some fraudulent actors,” conceded Grafton Willey IV, a principal in Tofias P.C., a certified public accounting firm, a former chairman of the small-business association. “But most of the so-called tax gap comes from the extraordinary complexity of the tax code.”Individual merchants say the reporting of credit card receipts will add significantly to their paperwork, and make it easy for the I.R.S. to initiate audits if credit card totals do not match what the small-business owner reported.Online sellers, like Evan Prytherch, who operates a musical instruments and accessories Web site called evanp.com, say such a requirement will fall most heavily on them because their sales are almost totally by credit card.“And returns are a big part of our business,” he said, “so the yearly total can be very different when returns and things like people who don’t pay are taken into account.”As a result, he said, he would have to match each entry with the paper receipt to make sure it had been paid and was accurate.More worrisome to some small companies is the Treasury Department proposal that businesses report payments to corporations over $600. Businesses are already required to provide a 1099 Form for independent contractors. Expanding that to corporations, small-business groups argue, will add paperwork.“I do business with hundreds of corporations, but I don’t keep my books by company,” said Eric Blackledge, owner of Blackledge Furniture in Corvallis, Ore. “We’re a typical small business, and like most, I keep them by accounts such as business supplies.”Mr. Blackledge, the fourth generation to run the residential and office furniture supplier, said he “would have to redo my entire accounting system to keep track of this, and it would be a tremendous expense.”The Treasury Department plans to push Congress to add its measures to coming legislation. The credit card provision alone “is expected over a 10-year period to bring in $18.7 billion in taxes that would otherwise not be collected,” said a department spokesman, Anthony C. DeSouza.Small-business advocates like the Coalition for Fairness in Tax Compliance, formed in 2006 by the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business Legislative Council, say they will continue to battle such measures.“Paperwork burdens and regulatory requirements already are big concerns for small business,” said Giovanni Coratolo, small-business director at the United States Chamber of Commerce. “This would be adding something new that would cost more money for businesses which are already in compliance.”'"
"'08-04-10,'1','The transition from war to peace here has been exceptionally difficult, with the period before the elections characterized by violence and intimidation among rival parties. The Maoists have been accused in a majority of the cases, particularly their youth wing, known as the Young Communist League, which has been taken to task for bullying and beating members of other parties and preventing them from campaigning freely.The latest violence has turned the tables on the Maoists. In western Dang district, at least six members of the Young Communist League were fatally shot Tuesday night by security forces accompanying candidates from the largest party, Nepali Congress.Earlier on Tuesday, in nearby Surkhet district, Rishi Prasad Sharma, a candidate of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist), was shot dead. The authorities have not said who was responsible.On Wednesday, when protesters defied a curfew, the police fired, killing one.Voting has been delayed indefinitely in the election district where Mr. Sharma was running.On Wednesday, Ian Martin, the United Nations chief envoy in Nepal, urged all parties to “avoid provocations of one another” and called for an independent investigation of security forces suspected of using excessive force.The Constituent Assembly elections are occurring two years after King Gyanendra, who had seized control, returned power to the last elected government. The Maoists locked up their guns, ended their quest for a Communist state and joined the legislature. This vote would legitimize their role in the government because they would have elected seats for the first time.The new assembly will be entrusted to resolve some of the most intractable problems facing Nepal, including whether it will remain a monarchy and how its traditionally marginalized ethnic and caste groups will be represented. Upper-caste men have dominated Nepal’s politics, including the leadership of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist).Already the elections had been delayed because of violence in the southeastern plains known as the Terai, where residents have been demanding more autonomy, sometimes violently. Even these elections would be threatened were it not for a recent agreement between the government and the main Terai groups.Most are now participating, but a handful of the most radical groups called for a boycott, which could suppress turnout in some areas.More than 800 international observers were to spread across Nepal on Thursday. Results are not expected for several weeks.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','“We deeply regret the disruption and disappointment these changes will cause for our customers,” Scott E. Carson, the president of Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a conference call with analysts and reporters. “We’ve decided to add additional margin to the program. It’s a more conservative approach, and it is the right way to go.”Boeing’s presentation appeared to reassure investors. Cai von Rumohr, an analyst with Cowen & Company, said that Boeing’s announcement was “not a surprise.”“The stock had been struggling,” Mr. Von Rumohr said, “and what this announcement said was that things are not worse than what was expected. The company will hit its earnings guidance for 2008 and have strong gains in 2009.”Since late last year, Boeing shares have fallen by nearly $30, which translates into a loss in market value of about $20 billion, said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies & Company. This decline, Mr. Rubel said, was far greater than the actual dollar value of the delay-related costs at Boeing.“The stock was down 10 times more than the delay was worth,” he said. “The market wanted some certainty, and Boeing’s presentation was credible and deliberate.”The latest postponement is related to a shortage of parts and to problems within Boeing’s global supply chain, which has been unable to deliver parts to the company’s assembly plants in Everett, Wash., on schedule.In addition, the company found that it needed to strengthen the design of its center wing box, a critical component that attaches the wings to the plane, adding to its cost and its weight.Boeing said the problems with the 787 are under control. To help resolve some of the problems with suppliers, especially those in Japan and Russia, Boeing executives have been traveling the globe and say they have improved communications with makers of critical components.“Our supply base is healthy,” Mr. Carson said during the conference call. “We’ve improved the assembly of our major sections. We’re focused, and we are applying lessons learned. We are close to overcoming the delays, and will bring this breakthrough plane to our customers.”Many Boeing customers waiting for their 787s expressed disappointment but declined to say whether they would seek compensation for the delays. All Nippon Airways of Japan, which has 50 planes on order and was to be the first to receive the plane, said it was “extremely disappointed” in the delay and that it was considering seeking compensation.Continental Airlines is the largest American customer, with 25 planes on order. The company said that “we are disappointed, yet Boeing is a valued business partner and the 787 will be a game-changer,” according to Dow Jones News Service.Boeing’s first announcement of problems with the 787, which came last year, was a shock to the aerospace industry. Up to that point, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner had been such a hit with carriers that it looked as if the rivalry between Boeing and Airbus, the European plane maker, had tilted in Boeing’s favor.In July 2006, Airbus was even forced to redesign a rival widebody jet, the A350, to make it even wider and more competitive with the 787 — it gained the new name A350XWB for “extra wide body.” But Boeing’s latest misfortune may do little to help the A350 program, which remains at least four years behind the 787 in development and is not scheduled for delivery until 2013.'"
"'08-04-10,'1','This fall, a Christopher Peacock Cabinetry showroom will open in San Francisco, adding to his showrooms in Greenwich, Boston, Los Angeles and Chicago; next year, he will open one in Manhattan. Starting this month, he is selling Christopher Peacock paint — 90 shades of “bespoke” color, as his publicist, Lane Brooks described it, which he developed with Fine Paints of Europe (and at $125 for two-thirds of a gallon, one of the most expensive paints out there, Mr. Brooks claimed with pride) — as well as Christopher Peacock furniture, luxuriously monastic and slightly Asian style pieces from Peacock & Beale, a tony furniture store he and the decorator Connie Beale opened on Putnam Avenue here last fall.Mr. Peacock is not the first kitchen designer to capitalize on his name and the ongoing primacy of the kitchen in the American home. A few years back, Clive Christian, who is based in London and New York, and is the Liberace of the kitchen world, with his use of gargoyles, columns and crystal chandeliers, put his name on a perfume.Like Mr. Peacock’s paint, the perfume’s staggering price — more than $865 for 1.7 oz. at Nordstrom — is a selling point. “Often with luxury goods you’re telling people, you want this or that,” said Scott Salvatore, a high-end Manhattan decorator who has given his clients nine Peacock kitchens over the past decade. “And sometimes they just don’t. I think Christopher really hit a nerve. Those Italian kitchens are sexy as hell, and they’re not selling here, at least not among my clients.”Faith Popcorn, the trend-spotter, said the brands doing well right now are those selling what she called authenticity. She said: “That’s the theme I’m getting from his kitchens. You look at someone’s watch and say, oh, that’s nice, stainless? And they say, No, platinum. While big show-offy things like the big S.U.V. would be uncool to have right now, the one thing it’s still O.K. to spend on is authenticity.”Though new, his kitchens “read” as old. Lush with creamy paint, Gosford Park-like styling and chrome and sterling silver hardware at the high end, Mr. Peacock’s Scullery, Refectory and Private Collection kitchens seem to have touched a nerve in a buying public that yearns for history and provenance.Like the spanking new “old” house — found, say, in a development designed by Robert A. M. Stern (with whom Mr. Peacock is collaborating these days) — the kitchen is like a luxury car with retro styling.“My husband wanted a Christopher Peacock kitchen — period,” said Lisa Skinner. Her Scullery kitchen arrived in her new Greenwich home in September, she said, over the protests of her builder, who wanted to replicate a Peacock kitchen and promised to do so for less money.Ms. Skinner said her husband, Chip, who is a fund manager, “just kept saying, ‘When you spend a lot of money you go to a specialist.’ ”“It wasn’t because he had to have this fancy name,” she said. “He drives a 10-year-old Defender. He’s not a Ferrari guy.” She said the couple, originally from Nashville, spent nine years in London, imbibing the British aesthetic.Milton Pedraza, chief executive of the Luxury Institute, a market research company, said the English white kitchen stands for purity and pedigree. “People who have a brief history like Americans love something with a long lineage,” he said. “It imbues us with that same halo.”With aging-rock-star good looks and British accent, Mr. Peacock has been just the guy to deliver, never mind that his own provenance, as he cheerfully pointed out, involves a semidetached house in Essex, a London suburb.Before he was a kitchen designer, he was a drummer in a local new-wave band called Risque. Despite having made a few records and played some well-known London clubs, he said, “we weren’t exactly making any money.” So when the lead singer’s father offered him work driving a truck for his kitchen business, it seemed prudent to take it.Mr. Peacock graduated from driving trucks to designing kitchens, and then left for Heal’s, the English furniture store. He has been drawing kitchens ever since: for SieMatic, which brought him to New York in 1987, and for Smallbone, for whom he opened a showroom in Greenwich, just before the last recession, which cost him his job there. He’s been on his own since 1993, when a former customer asked him to build a white kitchen with a black granite counter in nearby Bedford.Mr. Peacock and his wife, Jayne, who was the best friend of the lead singer in his old band, live in Wilton in a new colonial with their three sons, one dog, a white kitchen and two dishwashers, he said. Still a musician, on the weekends, he plays drums in a cover band called “Bob’s Your Uncle.”Mr. Peacock likes to say that the best kitchen is a Manhattan galley kitchen, and said he spends a lot of time telling clients “that they aren’t who they think they are.” “They’re not going to be having huge dinner parties, with caterers using a pantry as a staging area every weekend.” His first act is often to cut 25 percent of the space out of new home kitchens.For the record, a kitchen designer is not a craftsman, and Mr. Peacock is no Norm Abrams.“People think I’m a master carpenter,” he said. “But you do not want me amid hand tools. I draw things, I don’t build them.”For most of the ’90s he drew pretty French country kitchens, as was the style then. “There was a lot of yellow, and glazing, and stencils of roosters and fruit baskets everywhere,” he said. His kitchens were always beautifully made, first by local carpenters, and then, as business grew, by his factory in Wardensville, W. Va., which he bought near the end of the ’90s. It takes roughly 12 weeks, once a plan has been approved, to make and deliver a kitchen.Early in this decade, Mr. Peacock was expanding rapidly. Then Sept. 11 happened, and “everything just stopped,” he said. “I almost lost my shirt.” Asked to design a kitchen for the Kip’s Bay Decorator Show House the next spring, Mr. Peacock sketched a “plain white kitchen with some cool hardware,” he said. “It was a reaction to all that pretty stuff. And everybody wanted it. The white kitchen just took off, and we’ve been labeled with it ever since.”Not that he’s complaining. “It’s what put us on the map,” he said.Last week, there were Molton Brown candles flickering alluringly in every room of the Peacock showroom here, and hushed groups at the vast wood and marble islands: clients, all women, and their designers parsing the meaning of honed statuary marble versus semi-honed breccia imperiale marble. Mr. Peacock showed off the leather straps on shelves in the Refectory kitchen, the cunning stainless steel lip on a garbage drawer in the Scullery kitchen, and the sterling silver knobs and hinges in the Private Collection kitchen.“The person who buys this kitchen isn’t polishing their own hardware,” said Mr. Peacock, stating the obvious. The Private Collection, he said, is an heirloom-quality room, with more detailing, hand-selected woods, those silver knobs, and a higher price, about 25 to 30 percent more than his other kitchens, he said, which on average, including the appliances and countertops he recommends, go for $185,000.Tellingly, the high cost of certain products, as Mr. Pedraza of the Luxury Institute pointed out, might boost sales. Mr. Pedraza cited a recent study by researchers at the Stanford University Graduate School of Business and the California Institute of Technology which mapped the brains of volunteers as they drank red wine. Though the wine offered was the same cheap plonk ($5 a bottle), the pleasure receptors of the brains of the study group lit up more when the subjects were told the price was $45. “Knowing you are able to pay for the best is a very special thing, and it gives you real endorphins,” he said.Donald Albrecht, curator of architecture and design at the Museum of the City of New York, offered a different analysis about the draw of a Peacock kitchen. The latch of the Refectory kitchen, which recalls antique ice-box hardware, is “the Humvee of hardware,” Mr. Albrecht said.“It’s a lot of elaborate protection for just a kitchen cabinet, and of course we live in a time where people are obsessed about protection,” he said.Certainly they are still obsessed with their kitchens. If whiz-bang gadgetry — appliance garages! smart refrigerators! — marked the kitchen in the first part of this decade, nearer the decade’s end the space has become a philosophical arena, with the locavore and Slow Food movements transforming the very act of cooking into something political.“The kitchen is less and less of a showplace, with people relying on convenience foods, and more of a place to make healthy, fresh and local food you prepare with your family,” said Amy Elbert, senior architecture editor at Traditional Home magazine, who featured a Peacock kitchen in her coming special issue on kitchens.Mr. Peacock concurred. “I have lately seen a strong movement back to the basics of what a kitchen is all about,” he said. “With everything going on in our world and the environment, the kitchen is more and more of a hub. It’s where it all comes together.”He described the kitchen as a sensual experience, a place for smelling, tasting and touching. “It’s a caveman-type thing,” he said.Here are 10 items Christopher Peacock said clients have asked for but don't often use, and 10 items they don't think to ask for, but should consider.'"

"'08-04-10,'1','The talks between Microsoft and News Corporation are at a sensitive stage, people involved in the discussions said. “There’s a long way to go before anything is definite,” one person involved in the talks said.A Microsoft spokesman said he could not immediately comment. A spokesman for Yahoo declined to comment. A News Corporation spokesman said the company did not comment on “speculation.”It is also possible that News Corporation could still participate in a deal with Yahoo on its own, though the disclosure of its talks with Microsoft may complicate that relationship.Terms of the proposed union are still being worked out, these people said, and remain murky. News Corporation would probably contribute its Fox Interactive Media unit, which includes MySpace, and possibly cash to a partnership with Microsoft as part of an acquisition of Yahoo, they said.The talks represent a change of sides for Mr. Murdoch. Just days after Microsoft made its bid, he flew to the West Coast and had dinner with Jerry Yang, Yahoo’s chief executive, offering his assistance in fending off Microsoft.A deal between them would have involved joining forces with Google to use its lucrative advertising system on the companies’ sites. Antitrust concerns have, however, all but scuttled those talks, at least in that form.On Wednesday, Yahoo suggested that it might be willing to cede part of its core business to Google, an archrival, to remain independent.Yahoo said it would begin outsourcing a small portion of its search advertising to Google. The limited test is meant to determine whether the company could extract more revenue if Google ran its search advertising system. The test results might also back Yahoo’s contention that Microsoft’s offer undervalues the company, a person briefed on the plan said.In the two-week test, Yahoo will use Google’s search advertising system to deliver ads that appear alongside Yahoo’s search results. The test will involve searches conducted in the United States on Yahoo.com, not on any of the company’s search affiliates, and will be limited to no more than 3 percent of all search queries, Yahoo said in a statement. Yahoo also said there was no guarantee that the test would lead to a broader deal.Microsoft immediately blasted the idea of a search advertising partnership between Yahoo and Google, saying it would be anticompetitive. “Any definitive agreement between Yahoo and Google would consolidate over 90 percent of the search advertising market in Google’s hands,” Microsoft said in a statement.In Washington, Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, also warned about the potential anticompetitive implications.“We will be following closely the results of the short-term test alliance between Yahoo and Google,” Mr. Kohl said in a statement. He had previously raised concerns about a Microsoft-Yahoo combination.Yahoo’s board is expected to meet this week to discuss its options.For Yahoo, the idea of outsourcing its search advertising system to Google is not new. Investors and some executives inside the company have long recommended that it do so, as it could help the company increase revenue and cut costs.Yahoo executives have resisted the outsourcing idea, saying that search and search advertising are essential pieces of the company’s business. Yet in a presentation to investors last month, Yahoo estimated that Google’s search advertising generated 60 percent to 70 percent more revenue on average than Yahoo’s.Eric E. Schmidt, Google’s chief executive, also offered his assistance to Yahoo soon after Microsoft announced its offer. Executives from the two companies held talks to discuss, among other things, a search advertising partnership, but those talks cooled.The talks appeared to have heated up again recently. Mr. Yang and Yahoo’s president, Susan Decker, visited Google in the last two weeks, said a person briefed on their visit.Yahoo has recently stepped up discussions about a possible partnership with AOL, people involved in the talks said, but no deal is imminent. Such an agreement could include a search advertising partnership with Google, these people said.The advertising test may be a way for Yahoo to show Microsoft that it still has alternatives, said Carl W. Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. “But if this were to go forward as a full proposal, there would be some serious concerns in the antitrust area,” Professor Tobias said.'"

"'08-04-11,'0','If you are in the mood for a movie about the rejuvenation of an aging, widowed college professor — and don’t pretend you aren’t — then this is a weekend of rare and unexpected abundance. By some miracle of film industry serendipity, two such movies are opening today in limited release. Even more bizarre: each is pretty good.In “The Visitor”, Richard Jenkins plays an economist whose flagging joie de vivre is restored when he takes up drumming. “Smart People” is more or less the same deal, except that its protagonist, played by Dennis Quaid, is a specialist in Victorian literature, and his flagging joie de vivre is restored when he goes to bed with Sarah Jessica Parker. Whatever gets you through the semester, I guess.Seriously, though, what these two films — one a restrained drama, the other a frisky comedy — share is less the situation of their main characters than the superior work of the men who portray them. There is something about impersonating thwarted intellectuals, their early promise and ambition fading into vanity and irrelevance, that inspires a certain kind of actor to tap into deep veins of pathos and wit. Jeff Daniels struck the modern template for this kind of performance in “The Squid and the Whale,” and in their different ways Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Quaid live up to his high standard.Mr. Quaid, his handsomeness distorted and obscured by stooped shoulders, a sagging belly and wayward facial hair, plays Lawrence Wetherhold, an English professor at Carnegie Mellon whose general unpleasantness seems less like a personality trait than like a belief system. His narcissism is a seamless coat of many colors, a weave of grief for his dead wife, resentment at how much the world demands of him and the conviction that he is smarter than everybody else.His son, James (Ashton Holmes), an aspiring poet and a student at the college, finds Lawrence’s imperiousness nearly intolerable, while his daughter, Vanessa (Ellen Page), carefully tends the flame of her father’s ego and takes him as a role model in contrarianism. Secure in the sense of her own superiority and proud of her political conservatism, Vanessa is Diablo Cody’s Juno rewritten by Ayn Rand.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','Americans’ confidence in the economy has withered in the last few weeks, falling to the lowest level since the recession of the early 1980s.A series of recent financial shocks, including the meltdown of the investment bank Bear Stearns, and a significant weakening in the labor market appears to have weighed heavily on Americans who fear a prolonged and severe slowdown in the economy, according to a survey released Friday by Reuters and the University of Michigan.Americans have a bleaker outlook than any time since July 1980, the tail end of the stagflationary era that plagued the country for years.Confidence about the current financial situation fell to a 26-year low.“I think we should be hunkering down for an extended period of very weak consumption,” said Ian Shepherdson, a London-based economist at the research firm High Frequency Economics.That would mean a rough patch ahead for the nation’s economy, more than two-thirds of which is driven by consumer spending.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','The prospect of a McCain victory is a powerful incentive for Mr. Bush to remain silent in the face of criticism. If Democrats take the White House, the policies the president cares about most, beginning with the war in Iraq, would quickly come undone. Republicans, who already blame Mr. Bush for losing control of Congress in 2006, would undoubtedly blame him for costing them the White House as well.“If Bush is followed by a Republican, every Republican will have fonder memories of Bush than if he’s followed by a Democrat,” said Grover Norquist, the conservative activist and president of an anti-tax group in Washington. “If he’s followed by McCain, McCain will not spend four or eight years trying to erase Bush. So it’s hugely important to Bush and his place in history. Reagan was great because he replaced himself. Clinton was a bum because he failed to.”Former President Bill Clinton made no secret of his discontent with the way his vice president, Al Gore, ran his 2000 campaign. He bristled openly at Mr. Gore’s attempts to distance himself, and complained Mr. Gore was not using him enough on the campaign trail -- something Republicans say Mr. Bush is unlikely to do.“He’ll play whatever role Senator McCain asks of him, and he’ll be happy not to play a role if asked,” said Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. “I really don’t believe he’s itching to be asked.”Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain have “a better understanding than Clinton and Gore did,” said Bruce Buchanan, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin. “Bush has signaled that he would tolerate departures. He understands that he’s a liability and he knows he’s got to tolerate swipes by McCain.”Even so, the McCain camp must be careful not to swipe too openly. The senator’s speeches are written so that criticism is only implied; the foreign policy address did not even mention Mr. Bush’s name. And the campaign ran it by the White House before the senator delivered it.“It’s not exactly the speech the president would have given,” said Charlie Black, a senior McCain adviser, “but we did inform him and we didn’t have any complaints.”Of all the Republicans who ran for the nomination, Mr. McCain may have the easiest time distancing himself from Mr. Bush, if only because they have disagreed so publicly in the past.Mr. McCain’s critique of Bush policies on matters like treatment of terror suspects and the early military strategy in Iraq are well known, and come as no surprise to Mr. Bush. One Republican with close ties to both men said he believes Mr. Bush will tolerate departures by Mr. McCain — so long as the senator’s views seem genuine, and not trumped up to draw a contrast between himself and the White House.“As long as they’re deeply held views that the president doesn’t believe are for political expediency, then I believe the president will do what he’s done so far, which is basically stay silent and supportive of McCain,” this adviser said.And in the end, some Republicans say, there may be little Mr. Bush can do. Senator Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, predicted Mr. Bush would take criticism from Mr. McCain with “a knowing shrug,” even if it irritated him.“Bush may push back at some point,” Mr. Sessions said. “He’d have every right to. But I would say that when you’re finishing your term, one reason you’re called a lame duck is there’s not much you can do to fight back when people criticize you.”'"

"'08-04-11,'0','Starting a year ago, well before the current credit crisis, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. had said that the financial stability forum’s work was needed to help guide governments through the new world of complex securities and such new but largely unregulated players in the markets as hedge funds and private equity funds.The report, which Treasury officials say has been completed, is expected to receive the endorsement Friday of the finance ministers from the leading industrial democracies known as the Group of 7, which will be discussing the world economy.With its cautious approach to greater regulation by central banks or other authorities, the forum’s report mirrors a similar set of recommendations issued last week by a group within the Bush administration and led by Mr. Paulson.That group also called for an overhaul of the hodgepodge of federal regulatory agencies that oversee various categories of financial institutions. But Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified in Congress last week that he was concerned about having more authority but fewer tools to carry it out.Every spring the United States Treasury secretary plays host to most of the world’s finance ministers as they meet in Washington to assess the global economy. A year ago, their discussions were clouded by the furor over the leadership of Paul D. Wolfowitz, then president of the World Bank.It was then that leading finance ministers informed Mr. Paulson that Mr. Wolfowitz no longer had their confidence, and Mr. Wolfowitz was ousted a few months later.This year, the main topic of conversation is certain to be the global economy, and administration officials acknowledge that there will be tough questions for the treasury secretary about the Bush administration’s steps to avoid a recession or pull out of one if it has already started.With ministers and bankers starting to arrive in Washington, a mildly discordant note occurred when the International Monetary Fund, which along with the World Bank is holding the meetings, issued a dire warning about the global economy and the damaging effect of the American subprime mortgage crisis.Jaime Caruana, head of the fund’s monetary and capital markets department, said this week that “financial markets remain under considerable stress” because of weak financial institutions, falling home prices and weak growth worldwide.The United States, the I.M.F. said, was a main cause of the slower world economic growth, which it said would grow at 3.7 percent in 2008 compared with 5 percent last year. A major factor in the downturn was what Simon Johnson, the chief economist of the fund, said was a “mild recession” this year and a weak recovery next year.That assessment clashed with a somewhat more upbeat view from the Bush administration, which has avoided the word “recession” to describe the current troubles. Mr. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, also said last week that although a recession was possible, he was not prepared to say that one had begun or would occur this year.Challenging the I.M.F. view, the Treasury’s top international economic official, David H. McCormick, said it was “unduly pessimistic.” He acknowledged that “ongoing weakness of U.S. residential housing markets,” chaotic markets, inflation and high oil and commodity prices were posing a threat.“That said, we remain positive about the long-term resilience of the global economy, as well as the long-term resilience of the U.S. economy,” said Mr. McCormick, who is under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.Like the World Bank, which is now led by Robert B. Zoellick, the International Monetary Fund has a new president, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a former finance minister of France. He has brought about changes at the fund, which has 185 countries as members, including allowing a greater voice for China and other emerging market countries.Mr. Strauss-Kahn said in a news conference on Thursday that the current financial turmoil posed the greatest financial crisis since the 1930s, but that “it is a new kind of crisis” and that the I.M.F. could play a role in improving the economy by doing more to monitor the vulnerabilities of its member countries.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','But now the issue is back, pulled to the fore by an economy turning down more sharply than at any other time since the welfare changes were imposed. With low-income people especially threatened by a weakening labor market, some advocates for poor families are raising concerns about the adequacy of the remaining social safety net. Mrs. Clinton is now calling for the establishment of a cabinet-level position to fight poverty.As social welfare policy returns to the political debate, it is providing a window into the ways in which Mrs. Clinton has navigated the legacy of her husband’s administration and the ideological crosscurrents of her party.In an interview, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that “people who are more vulnerable” were going to suffer more than others as the economy turned down. But she put the blame squarely on the Bush administration and the Republicans who controlled Congress until last year. Mrs. Clinton said they blocked her efforts, and those of other Democrats, to buttress the safety net with increased financing for health insurance for impoverished children, child care for poor working mothers, and food stamps.Mrs. Clinton expressed no misgivings about the 1996 legislation, saying that it was a needed — and enormously successful — first step toward making poor families self-sufficient.“Welfare should have been a temporary way station for people who needed immediate assistance,” she said. “It should not be considered an anti-poverty program. It simply did not work.”During the presidential campaign, she has faced little challenge on the issue, in large part because Mr. Obama has supported the 1996 law. “Before welfare reform, you had, in the minds of most Americans, a stark separation between the deserving working poor and the undeserving welfare poor,” Mr. Obama said in an interview. “What welfare reform did was desegregate those two groups. Now, everybody was poor, and everybody had to work.”Mr. Obama called the resulting law “an imperfect reform.” Like Mrs. Clinton, he called for an expansion of government-provided health care, child care and job training to assist women making the transition from welfare to work — programs he says he helped expand in Illinois as a state senator.Asked if he would have vetoed the 1996 law, Mr. Obama said, “I won’t second guess President Clinton for signing.”Among some advocates for the poor, the growing prospect of a severe recession and evidence of backsliding from the initial successes of the policy shift have crystallized fresh concern. Many remain upset that Mrs. Clinton, once seemingly a stalwart member of their camp, supported a law that they contend left many people at risk.“If there is no national controversy about welfare reform, we paid an awfully high price,” said Peter Edelman, a law professor at Georgetown University who has known Mrs. Clinton since her college days, and who quit his post as assistant secretary of social services at the Department of Health and Human Services in protest after Mr. Clinton signed the measure.“They don’t acknowledge the number of people who were hurt,” Mr. Edelman said. “It’s just not in their lens. It was predictably bad public policy.”Forcing families to rely on work instead of government money went well from 1996 to 2000, when the economy was booming and paychecks were plentiful, economists say. Since then, however, job creation has slowed and poverty has risen. The current downturn could be the first serious test of how well the changes brought about by the 1996 law hold up under sharp economic stress.“We should have enormous concern about the lack of a fully functioning safety net for families with children,” said Mark H. Greenberg, director of the Poverty and Prosperity Program at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group.In many ways, Mrs. Clinton has sought to moderate her liberal image since leaving the White House. But on welfare, she has faced the opposite problem: accusations from some liberals that she sold out their principles for a politically calculated centrism.On the campaign trail, Mrs. Clinton is largely focused on the middle class. Since the departure from the Democratic race of John Edwards, who had made poverty a centerpiece of his campaign, there has been little debate about social welfare policy. But in promising on Friday to establish a cabinet-rank poverty-fighting position if she is elected, Mrs. Clinton reintroduced the topic and the question of her record.In the interview, conducted last month, Mrs. Clinton said she had followed through on her promise to address what she viewed as shortcomings in the welfare law after being elected to the Senate in 2000. She said she had pressed for legislation that would have increased financing for child care for poor mothers by up to $11 billion, seeking to expand food stamps, and allowing welfare recipients to draw cash aid while attending school.Those provisions were blocked by the Republican leadership.“We’ve had to mostly spend our time since President Bush came in to office preventing bad things from happening,” Mrs. Clinton said.Many welfare advocates dispute Mrs. Clinton’s characterization. Since entering the Senate, they say, she has shown a predilection for compromise at the expense of the poor.When the overhaul bill came up for reauthorization, Sandra Chapin, a former welfare recipient affiliated with a coalition called Welfare Made a Difference, lobbied Congress to allow more women to attend college while they received aid. Mrs. Clinton “wouldn’t have anything to do with it,” Ms. Chapin said.Ms. Chapin, now program director of the Consumer Federation of California, posted an e-mail message to a discussion board in February accusing Mrs. Clinton of having “had a hand in devaluing motherwork in this country, and no doubt sending thousands of children and their families deeper into poverty.”In the interview, and in her memoir, Mrs. Clinton said she had serious misgivings about some of the changes proposed to the welfare system as the issue percolated through Washington in the mid-1990s.Her husband had taken office with a pledge to dismantle the old system. He embraced time limits for cash aid and allowing states to largely decide for themselves how to spend the money. He set out to expand job training, access to health care, child care and food stamps.When the Republicans took over Congress after the 1994 elections, making Newt Gingrich the House speaker, they seized the initiative. Twice, they passed bills seeking to impose time limits on welfare benefits while cutting other aid. Twice, Mr. Clinton vetoed the bills, with the encouragement of Mrs. Clinton.In August 1996, three months before Election Day, Congress sent the White House a third bill. This one imposed time limits on cash benefits and barred most legal immigrants from receiving welfare. But it maintained guarantees for Medicaid and food stamps and increased financing for child care. This time, Mr. Clinton signed.“I agreed that he should sign it and worked hard to round up votes,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in her memoir.Mrs. Clinton remained troubled by parts of the bill, she wrote in her memoir, particularly the provision barring welfare for legal immigrants. But “pragmatic politics” had to be considered. “If he vetoed welfare reform a third time,” she wrote, “Bill would be handing the Republicans a potential political windfall.”Marian Wright Edelman, the founder of Children’s Defense Fund, an activist group that had given Mrs. Clinton her first job, blasted the Clintons as betraying the poor, opening a rift that Mrs. Clinton called “sad and painful.” Mrs. Edelman’s husband, Peter, quit his administration post.In the years that followed, the number of those on welfare rolls plummeted by more than 60 percent. A study last year by the Congressional Budget Office found that from 1991 to 2005, poor families with children saw their inflation-adjusted incomes climb by 35 percent, as employment climbed.In recent years, however, low-skilled women have struggled. The percentage of poor single mothers neither working nor drawing cash assistance surged from under 20 percent before the welfare overhaul to more than 30 percent in 2005, according to the Congressional Research Service. During the same period, the number of children in poverty rose to 12.8 million from 11.6 million, according to census data.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','The mortgage plan that Mr. McCain unveiled — which his advisers said was designed for needy homeowners, and not financial institutions — would apply to people who were falling behind on payments on their primary residences who could show that they would be able to meet the terms of a new, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage. Mr. McCain also called for the Department of Justice to investigate the industry.In his remarks, Mr. McCain did not mention how much his plan would cost, but his aides said it would help 200,000 to 400,000 homeowners. That would help more people than President Bush’s plan, but fewer than the plans put forward by Democrats. Aides said it would cost $3 billion to $10 billion.In both tone and substance, Mr. McCain’s speech was a departure from the remarks he made last month in California.The Democratic presidential candidates used that address to try to paint Mr. McCain as out of touch and uncaring; Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, who has proposed $30 billion in federal aid to states to help homeowners, said it sounded “remarkably like Herbert Hoover.” But some Republicans expressed concern as well.One of Mr. McCain’s supporters, Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, said after the speech that he would give Mr. McCain “an incomplete.”“He stated the obvious, which is that we cannot rescue those who made poor investments and poor decisions,” Mr. Martinez said last month on CNN’s “Late Edition.” “However, where I think he fell short, and I think you will agree with me, is the fact that we need to do some things that can help families, that can help people.”The Democratic presidential candidates reacted dismissively on Thursday to Mr. McCain’s proposal.Senator Barack Obama of Illinois suggested in Gary, Ind., that the proposal was too tepid. It was the latest in the ever-escalating exchanges between the two senators and their campaigns.“I’m glad he’s finally offered a plan. Better late than never,” Mr. Obama said. “But don’t expect any real answers. Don’t expect it to actually help struggling families. Because Senator McCain’s solution to the housing crisis seems a lot like the George Bush solution of sitting by and hoping it passes while families face foreclosure and watch the value of their homes decline.”At a news conference in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Clinton called Mr. McCain’s proposal a “warmed-over, half-hearted version of the very plan he criticized.”“Just two weeks ago, Senator McCain said he’d rather do nothing than something about the housing crisis,” said Mrs. Clinton, who ran an advertisement suggesting that Mr. McCain was unprepared to handle middle-of-the-night emergency phone calls about the economy.“Apparently, Senator McCain got the message,” she said. “Letting the phone ring and ring is not the way to respond to housing crises.”Mr. McCain, who does not always sound comfortable discussing the economy, is also laboring to undo any damage from the Republican primaries, when he was accused by a fellow Republican, Mitt Romney, of not knowing much about the economy.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','Federal immigration authorities received about 163,000 petitions for temporary work visas for highly skilled immigrants for the year starting Oct. 1, officials said Thursday, nearly twice as many as the number of visas available.The government each year offers 65,000 visas, known as H-1Bs, for highly educated foreign workers, and 20,000 visas for immigrants with a master’s degree or doctorate from an American college or university. Citizenship and Immigration Services closed the application period Tuesday after it had been open for the five-day minimum.Although petitions for the 2009 fiscal year increased by about 23 percent over 2008, immigration officials said they had expected an even higher number. A new rule penalizing employers who presented more than one petition for the same worker helped keep down the numbers, said Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman for the immigration agency.Sometime next week, the agency will conduct an electronic lottery to select 85,000 immigrants to receive the H-1B visas, which are valid for three years and can be renewed for another three.The visa announcement brought renewed calls from American technology companies to raise the annual limits. On Thursday, senators led by John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, introduced a bill that would raise the H-1B cap to 145,000 visas each year through 2011. It would also allow businesses to use, over a three-year period, some 150,000 visas that were available in past years but were never issued.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','“If they just talk about the same old issues and don’t reflect what we now know and the concession the government has made, that would be a huge disappointment,” Ms. Dunkle said.Ms. Dunkle’s niece, Hannah Poling, of Athens, Ga., was 19 months old and developing normally in 2000 when she received five shots against nine infectious diseases. She became sick and later developed autism.Her parents sued, and late last year government lawyers agreed to compensate the family on the theory that vaccines may have aggravated an underlying mitochondrial disorder. When news of the government settlement became public, vaccine skeptics said the government had finally conceded that vaccines cause autism.Government officials and researchers said they had conceded no such thing.“The Poling case has changed the media coverage of mitochondrial disorders but has added nothing to the discussions of what causes or doesn’t cause autism,” Dr. Edwin Trevathan, director of the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview Thursday.On Friday, many of the main players involved in this debate — including Hannah’s mother and her grandparents, prominent vaccine skeptics and some of the government’s top vaccine researchers — will all be in the same room to discuss research priorities.The meeting is the result of a 2005 report by the Institute of Medicine, which suggested that the disease control agency might engender more trust among skeptics if it included them in its research planning.At the time, vaccine skeptics were lobbying to have greater access to the agency’s Vaccine Safety Datalink system, a huge set of health records assembled by large managed care organizations. The agency uses the system to conduct epidemiological studies to measure whether vaccines or their components cause common problems.Such studies, for instance, have found no link between the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism, and they have found no link between a once-common vaccine additive, thimerosal, and autism.In the face of such studies, vaccine skeptics have increasingly demanded clinical research, not epidemiological studies, to determine whether small groups of children may somehow be more susceptible to vaccine injuries than the general population. Such subsets of children might get lost in large epidemiological studies, they say.But that kind of clinical research is generally undertaken or underwritten by the National Institutes of Health, not the disease control agency.The issues raised by the Poling case “can’t go very far tomorrow because it’s really not in C.D.C.’s lane,” Dr. Gellin said.No decisions are expected to come out of Friday’s meeting; rather, it would allow researchers to hear the public’s priorities.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','“This is not a protectionist government,” he said.A spokesman for Alliant, a rocket and weapons maker better known as A.T.K., had little comment.“I can confirm that discussions with the Canadian government are ongoing,” the spokesman, Bryce Hallowell, said. MacDonald Dettwiler had no comment beyond confirming the government’s decision.A.T.K. now has 30 days to persuade the government to reverse its position, an outcome few predicted as likely.While Mr. Prentice offered little detail about the decision, he said that “jurisdictional issues” surrounding a satellite owned by MacDonald Dettwiler but built largely with $450 million from the Canadian government played a role.The government’s financing gives it broad access to the satellite’s data, which is also sold by MacDonald Dettwiler to businesses and other governments, including the United States.The satellite, Radarsat-2, follows an unusual polar orbit and uses radar to peer through clouds. Before the launch from Kazakhstan last December, the Canadian government cast it as an important element of its efforts to assert control of the Arctic. United States and other countries reject Canada’s claim over the Northwest Passage, a potential shipping channel through the Arctic. High commodity prices have also prompted interest in minerals under the region.“This satellite will help us vigorously protect our Arctic sovereignty as international interest in the region increases,” Mr. Prentice said in a statement issued in October.Canadian legal experts and many politicians, including some Conservatives, said that a sale of MacDonald Dettwiler would put the satellite under the control of American laws that emphasize the need for satellite policies to follow the United States’ foreign and economic policy interests.“If the United States becomes the licensing authority, Ottawa’s ability to control what the satellite is used for and to commandeer the equipment in emergencies might be lost,” Michael Byers, a professor of international law and global politics at the University of British Columbia, told a parliamentary hearing last month.“Suppose, for instance, that Canada wanted priority access for sovereignty assertion purposes just as a major war involving the United States was breaking out in the Middle East,” Professor Byers said. “One can even imagine the U.S. government using Radarsat-2 in ways that directly contradict Canada’s interests.”Marc Garneau, Canada’s first astronaut and a former president of the Canadian Space Agency, also recommended that the sale be stopped.“It is certain that other countries with strategically important space companies would not allow such foreign takeovers,” Mr. Garneau told Parliament.At separate Parliamentary hearings, Daniel E. Friedmann, the president and chief executive of MacDonald Dettwiler, and an A.T.K. executive rejected the idea that the Canadian government would lose any control of the satellite.The United States Embassy in Ottawa referred questions about the satellite’s status to the State Department, which did not respond to requests for comment. In an e-mail note, Kristin Scuderi, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said the office “has no role in this and therefore we decline to comment.”MacDonald Dettwiler has its own complaints about the Patriot Act and other recent measures in the United States. Their restrictions against foreigners working on crucial projects like satellites, he said last week, limit MacDonald Dettwiler in bidding on contracts in the United States. That has left the Canadian government as the company’s only real customer, a fact that prompted the sale of its space unit.Laura Ritchie Dawson, an assistant professor at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs at Carleton University here, said the government’s decision to finally block a takeover under a law that was recently amended to include national security concerns does not make further rejections more likely.“It does seem that this case is an exceptional one,” Ms. Dawson wrote in an e-mail message. “We would not be likely to see the government use the national security card much in the future nor should it have a chilling effect on investment.”'"
"'08-04-11,'0','The United States Forest Service has released new regulations for managing the country’s 155 national forests, after a federal judge struck down an earlier set of rules.The service’s associate chief, Sally Collins, said the rules, which took effect Wednesday, gave forest managers more power to react to natural disasters and climate change and to decide how land they supervise should be used.The new regulations also end the requirement that each species be evaluated for sustainability. Instead, the service will focus on the overall habitat in and around a national forest, it says.Environmental groups say the rules remove critical protections for wildlife and will allow more logging. At least one environmental law firm, Earthjustice of Oakland, Calif., said it would challenge the rules.“This is a parting gift from the Bush administration to the timber industry,” said Trent Orr, a staff lawyer for Earthjustice. “It is just a complete gutting of the provisions to protect wildlife.”'"
"'08-04-11,'0','Stocks rose on Thursday for the first time in three days, helped by a decline in unemployment claims and a better-than-expected sales performance by discount retailers.The Labor Department said initial unemployment claims fell more than expected last week, relieving some of the concern raised a week earlier when the agency said the four-week average of claims had risen to a two-and-a-half-year high.And while many retailers, from Gap to Saks, said March sales slid as consumers grew more frugal, Wall Street was encouraged that other companies were weathering the economic weakness. Discount retailers Wal-Mart Stores and the Costco Wholesale Corporation reported sharp increases in March sales and indicated they expect sales to keep rising.“The jobless claims snapped back down following the sharp rise last week,” said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist for RidgeWorth Capital Management. “Combined with the news from Wal-Mart, it suggests that the consumer may be able to muddle through. That’s providing some support for an otherwise strained market.”Questions about the health of the global financial system ahead of next week’s bank earnings, however, continued to unsettle the market. Lehman Brothers Holdings disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had liquidated three funds because of the tight credit markets and brought the assets of those funds, valued at $1 billion, onto its books Feb. 29. The investment bank said it also bought deteriorated assets valued at $800,000 from other distressed funds.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','A New York State Supreme Court judge on Thursday denied a request by CBS to dismiss a lawsuit filed by Dan Rather, who contends the network violated his contract by giving him little to do on camera after it forced him off the evening news in 2005.But the judge, Ira Gammerman, set aside large parts of Mr. Rather’s suit, which he filed in September, including individual claims against Sumner M. Redstone, the executive chairman of CBS; Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS; and Andrew Heyward, the former president of CBS News. The judge said Mr. Rather could continue to pursue his claim that CBS, as an entity, had breached its contract.The ruling enabled both sides to claim partial victories in a case that focuses on the fallout over a September 2004 report on the weeknight edition of “60 Minutes,” narrated by Mr. Rather, that raised questions about favoritism regarding President Bush’s National Guard service during the Vietnam War.CBS later said that it could not verify the documents on which the report had been based, and Mr. Rather was forced to step down as anchor of the “CBS Evening News” in March 2005, a year earlier than he had planned.A lawyer for Mr. Rather, Martin R. Gold, said in a statement that the judge’s decision “leaves in place the entire essence of Mr. Rather’s lawsuit.” Specifically, the judge said he would permit Mr. Rather to argue that CBS had violated his contract by effectively marginalizing him for more than a year after he left the evening news.During that period, Mr. Rather was assigned to the weeknight edition of “60 Minutes,” and later the main broadcast on Sunday nights, though he was given few stories on which to work.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','Nick Lowe’s public ambition is pressed down beneath strata of irony, modesty, stylish self-effacement. Now 59 and tall, thin, white-haired and well dressed, he appears to have little to do with any of the phases of rock that happened around him in his youth — British invasion, glam, folk, punk. He’s sunny, mordant and normative. He looks like Dick Van Dyke.If that’s all a pose — if there really is a grasping, narcissistic, status-seeking pop monster inside him — then wow, he’s good at it. On Wednesday at the Manhattan Center’s Grand Ballroom, he gave an elegant and nearly devastating performance with just his acoustic guitar, his voice and a little bit of reverb; his charisma was restricted to his rhymes and cadences, the measured control of his playing and singing. It’s spooky to see such excellence from a regular guy.In the late ’70s and early ’80s, as a member of Rockpile and on his solo records, he was fascinated by youth and vitality as it played out in pop. (He also produced a string of Elvis Costello’s early albums.) Now he has allowed himself to sound older, and he has become fascinated by aging and disengagement. He often sang from the minds of emotional freaks: people morbidly over- or underconfident. In “I Trained Her to Love Me,” a song from his recent album “At My Age,” his character gets up every day and breaks women’s hearts as if it’s an office job.In a new song, “I Read a Lot,” he presents the opposite: a man who has pathetically redirected his love to printed words from a woman. “Not just magazines,” mind you, “but much more serious things too”: “I can’t put it down/While others are painting the town/You’ll find me in a world of fantasy/Population one: that’s me.”This comes from the part of him that’s fascinated by the work of ’50s and ’60s country songwriters like Leon Payne and Hank Cochran: unreliable-narrator songs packing together the mundane and the wretched. But Mr. Lowe also has a light touch as a reliable narrator. Another song from “At My Age” offers only the truth, and it isn’t lame: “People change, that’s the long and short of it/Prepare yourself.”Mr. Lowe is still a formalist, putting his own conceits within styles he reveres. He borrows a riff or a vocal cadence from songs like “Spanish Harlem” and “Wake Up Little Susie.” And his voice takes on the delivery of older singers; he seems to have merged the cadences, phrasing and melodic patterns of Sam Cooke and Johnny Cash.'"
"'08-04-11,'0','The Korean king Chongjo, who ruled during the last quarter of the 18th century, was an ardent bibliophile. He is known to have remarked, “Entering one’s study and touching the books can brighten one’s mood even if one is unable to read regularly.” The king surrounded himself with painted screens, or ch’aekkori (CHAK-oh-ree), that depicted piles of reading material with scholarly accessories and collectibles. By the early 20th century these screens had become a staple in the homes of wealthy Koreans.Organized by Soyoung Lee, assistant curator of the department of Asian art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s tightly focused exhibition “Beauty and Learning: Korean Painted Screens” places four marvelous examples of ch’aekkori painting alongside related decorative objects from the permanent collection. The Met owns one of the screens; the others are on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and a private collectorCh’aekkori combine prosaic objects with rarities, and straightforward still lifes with spatial illusions. They are products of a culture that viewed books as a status symbol, placing them in the company of prized collectibles and treasures from the natural world.The idea of a simulated bookcase may seem redundant to contemporary viewers accustomed to open storage, but Koreans historically stored their books in closed chests. The paintings of books, then, served to impress visitors with symbols of erudition and reinforce the owner’s sense of self-worth. Never mind that artists rarely bothered to depict specific titles; the idea of a book, and the image of an elaborately patterned cover, were enough.“Beauty and Learning” includes a superb example from King Chongjo’s court. Its eight panels show ceramics, plants, fruits, brushes and scrolls arrayed in a trompe l’oeil bookcase with a striking, lapis-blue “interior.”'"
"'08-04-11,'0','The Democratic presidential candidates tried to paint Mr. McCain as out-of-touch and uncaring after the California speech — Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has proposed $30 billion in federal aid to states to help homeowners, said it sounded remarkably like Herbert Hoover” — and some Republicans expressed concern as well.One of his supporters, Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, said after the speech that he would give Mr. McCain “an incomplete.”“He stated the obvious, which is that we cannot rescue those who made poor investments and poor decisions,” Mr. Martinez said late last month on CNN. “However, where I think he fell short, and I think you will agree with me, is the fact that we need to do some things that can help families, that can help people.”The Democratic candidates reacted dismissively to Mr. McCain’s new plan — which the senator announced at a window store in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, a week before he plans to make what his aides are billing as a major speech on the economy.Mrs. Clinton said in a statement that “Senator McCain is apparently of two minds on the housing crisis and neither seems to know how to steward the economy effectively.”“Just two weeks ago,” her statement continued, “Senator McCain said he’d rather do nothing than something about the housing crisis and attacked my plan with tired right-wing talking points. Today, it looks like he’s proposing a warmed-over, half-hearted version of the very plan he criticized, to help families restructure mortgages to save homes and keep housing prices from falling further.”And Senator Barack Obama — who was outlining his own proposal for a $30 billion economic stimulus package that included the creation of a $10 billion foreclosure prevention fund and $10 billion in relief for the state and local governments hardest hit by the crisis — said he was glad that Mr. McCain had “finally decided to offer a plan.”“Better late than never,” Mr. Obama said in prepared remarks he planned to deliver in Gary, Ind. “But don’t expect any real answers. Don’t expect it to actually help struggling families. Because Senator McCain’s solution to the housing crisis seems a lot like the George Bush solution of sitting by and hoping it passes while families face foreclosure and watch the value of their homes erode. The American people can’t afford this kind of do-nothing approach. They need help immediately.”Mr. McCain outlined several other proposals today, including one to stop filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to drive down the price of oil by driving down the demand.Mr. McCain was introduced in Brooklyn by Michael R. Bloomberg — the ex-Democrat, ex-Republican, currently unaffiliated mayor of New York — whom the senator endorsed and campaigned for in 2001 when Mr. Bloomberg ran as a Republican. Mr. Bloomberg credited Mr. McCain with teaching him the rudiments of retail politics, and he fondly recalled a visit to the McCain ranch in Arizona and the barbecued ribs Mr. McCain made for him. “My recollection is they were slightly on the well-done side,” he said.'"

"'08-04-12,'0','The Rangers’ playoff success so far against the Devils has followed the pattern of the regular season. In going 7-0-1 against the Devils, the Rangers outscored them by 7-1 in the third period. Now, after two playoff games, the edge is 12-2.It gives the Rangers a two-game lead in the series as it heads to Madison Square Garden for Games 3 and 4 on Sunday and Wednesday.The results might seem logical based on the regular-season series between these teams, but it feels illogical based on the Devils’ playoff history. Tight, scoreless games have felt like home to them because they rely on a withering defense to pound the life out of opponents.Now, the Rangers have seemingly learned how to beat them at their own game. Game 1 was tied, 1-1, going into the third period, and the Rangers won, 4-1. This one was scoreless going into the third, and the Rangers persevered again.“Patience is the key,” said Rangers center Scott Gomez, who learned that formula playing his first seven seasons with the Devils. “One thing about the Devils is they are not going to make a mistake. They’re going to jump on teams’ mistakes. Now I think that’s what we’ve been stressing here. That’s the way it’s got to be. You’ve got to wait for that little bounce.”That the little bounce came from Jagr is a continuation of the last part of the Rangers’ regular season, when he finally seemed to find his scoring touch. He managed only 25 goals all season — the fewest in an N.H.L. career that began in 1990 — but he scored five in the last four games.“I think he’s just skating and moving,” said Rangers center Brandon Dubinsky. “He’s huge. I work with him after practice, done some one-on-one stuff and, boy, I think I’m pretty strong, but he’s in his own world like that. When he’s moving his feet, he’s tough to stop.”For the second straight game, though, Avery scored the goal that put the game away. That came just 23 seconds after Jagr scored, when a shot by Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi was blocked on the way to the net and the puck bounced to Avery.After that goal, Brodeur had to endure sarcastic chants in his own arena because Rangers fans again made up about a third of the crowd.From there, the Devils engaged in a mad scramble to come back. A possible goal with 6:56 left was disallowed after a video review showed that the puck never crossed the line. The Devils managed their only goal with 1:23 left when a shot by forward Patrik Elias was deflected in by Madden.Henrik Lundqvist, the Rangers’ goalie, stopped 26 shots and has given up just two goals in the two games.“We’ve just got to find a way to beat Lundqvist,” Devils forward Jay Pandolfo said.Brodeur added: “We’re right there. It’s not like they are dominating us right now.”Before the Rangers grabbed control of the game, the second period had devolved into a series of shoving matches after the whistle. Of the game’s 17 penalties, 14 came in the second period. At one point Gomez squared off with Jamie Langenbrunner, the Devils’ captain. Neither player is known for his belligerence.“Hey, it’s the playoffs,” Gomez said. “It’s not about being friends.”Right now for the Rangers, it’s about carrying their momentum forward and using any tiny slices of space their forwards can find. Or create.The game was delayed for several minutes in the first period when the door to the Devils’ penalty box broke. The start of the second period was delayed when the goal light behind the Rangers’ net would not turn off. ...The game was played exactly 33 years after Islanders forward J. P. Parise eliminated the Rangers from the playoffs with a goal 11 seconds into overtime in the deciding game of their playoff series in 1975. Parise’s son, Zach, now plays for the Devils. He lost his front teeth in this game, taking a high stick from Rangers defenseman Christian Backman in the second period.'"
"'08-04-12,'0','“When I go to bed at night, I worry about it,” said Ms. Beaton, who is a financial manager for a vineyard.“If you don’t have the money, there you are, in a serious, ulcer state. You feel inadequate.”According to a recent New York Times/CBS News poll, 70 percent of parents surveyed were “very concerned” about how they would pay for college; only 6 percent were not concerned.To ensure continued availability of federal loans, the secretary of the federal Education Department met on Friday with representatives of the state agencies and nonprofit companies that guarantee federal loans on behalf of the government. The goal was to work out how the guarantors would serve as lenders, if necessary. This emergency safety net has never been pressed into widespread use.Though there is no major problem now, the lending industry is warning of a credit squeeze without action. “I would say there is widespread belief,” said Margaret Spellings, the education secretary, “that we will have a real problem, that the lender of last resort or some other solution will have to be used this year.”Last year, students and their parents borrowed nearly $60 billion in federally guaranteed loans, a figure that has grown more than 6 percent annually over the last five years after taking into account inflation. In recent years, the growth rate has declined but may pick up as the economy slows and as other borrowing options fade.“I want to make sure we are going to do our part, and that students will be able to go to college this fall,” Ms. Spelling said.Lawmakers in Washington have proposed increasing the amounts that students can borrow through federal programs and authorizing the Education Department to purchase federal loans, thereby providing banks with cash to make more loans. The House Education Committee approved legislation this week that would allow dependent students to borrow a total of $31,000 through federal programs to pay for their undergraduate education, up from $23,000 now.Still, it is difficult to gauge whether a financing problem will emerge later this year for students and, if so, how serious it might be. The disruption in the federal lending program so far has mostly been from borrowers shifting to another lender. Ms. Beaton, for example, expects her $5,000 loan request to eventually be granted. “By the time I get the money, school will probably be over,” she said.Financial aid administrators say few students had been shut out. “I haven’t heard anything about any sort of unusual trends so far, not to say that it isn’t going to intensify,” said Daniel C. Walls, associate vice provost for enrollment management at Emory University in Atlanta. “I suspect there’s going to be more negotiating around financial aid this year than any other year that we’ve experienced.”Admitted students are just now receiving financial aid awards from colleges, and the test will come when tuition payments for the fall term are due, aid administrators say.“By mid- to late June, certainly July, will be the months that we really begin to understand the relative financial situations of families,” said Jean McDonald-Rash, director of financial aid at Rutgers in New Jersey.Students attending several expensive and wealthy colleges will enjoy expanded financial aid, as those institutions move to replace need-based loans with grants. Harvard and Yale recently announced expansions of aid to families making as much as $150,000, displaying a degree of generosity that few institutions can match.Some student advocates say lenders are exaggerating the obstacles they face in search of a bailout from Washington.“Student lenders are trying to hype the current credit crunch to scare Congress into providing them additional subsidies and to discredit last years’ hard won higher education reform,” said Luke Swarthout of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group in Washington, referring to cuts lawmakers made last year to the subsidy payments to lenders of federal loans.Kevin Bruns, executive director of America’s Student Loan Providers, dismissed such criticism as baseless. “Lenders’ only goal is to get the administration to use its existing authority to provide liquidity to the capital markets that fund federal student loans,” he said. “Lenders don’t need to overstate anything — the facts speak for themselves.”There are clear signs of potential problems in the fall. It remains difficult for lenders to sell securities backed by student loans, in turn making it harder to raise capital. One guarantor of private loans, a nonprofit company called the Education Resources Institute, filed for bankruptcy protection this week.“Everything that’s happened in the capital markets with this credit crunch has caused the fixed-income investor base to shrink, so there are fewer potential buyers of securities backed by the loans,” said Andrea L. Murad, senior director at Fitch Ratings in New York.The House legislation seeks to address this situation by allowing the Education Department to buy student loans itself. At least 25 loan companies — including big lenders like the College Loan Corporation; the Student Loan Xpress unit of CIT; and NorthStar Education Finance — have stopped making federal loans, according to the Education Department. Some estimates put the number at nearly twice that.Colleges generally say that more than 2,000 companies make student loans, and there are plenty of lenders to step into the breach.No doubt to sidestep any related problems, more than 100 colleges and universities have applied to participate in the direct loan program since the end of February, according to the department. Ms. Spellings, the department secretary, has said the direct loan program could double the amount of new loans it makes to students, if necessary.Some commercial education companies have already taken steps to ensure that their students can find lenders, in some instances by preparing to make loans themselves.Problems are more likely for those seeking private loans, which do not have any government backing. The terms of private loans, like other consumer loans, vary depending on the credit histories of individual applicants and in some cases can top 20 percent.In the last several months, rates on those loans have risen by nearly one percentage point, according to research by Mark Kantrowitz, who publishes the financial aid Web site FinAid.org. Lenders have also tightened their standards, making it costlier for those with weak credit histories to obtain loans.Private loans have grown sharply in popularity over the last 10 years, as families have looked for ways to pay the difference between tuition, on the one hand, and their savings and federal loan options, on the other. Last year, according to the College Board, students took out more than $17 billion in private loans, up from just $1.6 billion a decade earlier.“If the financial aid system had kept pace with inflation, there wouldn’t be any need for private loans,” said Paul Wrubel, co-founder of TuitionCoach.com and a consultant for families trying to figure out how to pay for college.Families also have closed the gap between college costs and federal loans by borrowing against their homes — and that is another option vanishing as house prices fall and lenders clamp down. Millions of homeowners now owe more than their houses are worth, leaving no equity to borrow against.There is no data on how many parents may have used home equity loans to pay for higher education, researchers and aid administrators said, but there is no doubt many did, to take advantage of tax breaks and lower rates.Tapping into home equity was always part of the college finance plan for Connie and Dave Orient of Canonsburg, Pa. She is a paralegal at a law firm in Pittsburgh and he is in the family construction business. Their older son, Christopher, is a sophomore at California University of Pennsylvania, a public institution relatively inexpensive for in-state residents. The younger son, Luke, a high school junior, wants to go to Virginia Tech, which she said would cost three times as much.“I believe that I am in an area that is not depressed or anything,” Ms. Orient said. She added that she hoped still to be able to borrow against the house she and her husband built 25 years ago, but was unsure how much equity she really has in it and how much a lender would be willing to extend. “Nothing’s selling anywhere right now.”'"
"'08-04-12,'0','“If we can’t promise protection, they’re not going to talk,” Mr. Shurtleff said in telephone interview.Texas state officials said Friday at a news conference that they believed that the girl was among the children taken into protective custody, but that she had not identified herself so they could not be sure.Arizona’s attorney general, Terry Goddard, a Democrat, was also blunt about the possible consequences of the raid.“We’re in uncharted territory,” Mr. Goddard said. “The last time something of this scale happened was Short Creek, and connections with the communities broke off for almost 50 years after that. I personally think we will have to redouble our efforts now.”In both Utah and Arizona there have been recent cases in which the authorities have won the confidence of under-age coerced brides who have cooperated with state prosecutions, most notably in the criminal case last year against Warren S. Jeffs, the prominent polygamist leader in Utah. In other instances, the authorities in those states have managed to persuade polygamist families to allow state officials and social services into their communities.In the world of fundamentalist polygamy, the phrase “Short Creek” has resonated since 1953, when the police descended on the twin communities of Hildale, Utah, and Short Creek, Ariz., now Colorado City. More than 30 men were arrested, and hundreds of children were rounded up and taken into custody. Psychological walls went up as the communities retreated and taught the young to believe that the government was the enemy.“The state became the bogyman,” Mr. Goddard said.Since then, the problems associated with fundamentalist polygamy, especially the practice of taking under-age wives, have become more glaring, and the numbers of polygamists have grown, as well, elevating and complicating the issue. Though still small in the number of participants — the biggest group has an estimated 10,000 members — the issues are often front-page politics in the West.The Texas lawmaker who represents Eldorado, Representative Harvey Hilderbran, a Republican, said the authorities had been looking for a tool, if not a spark, to combat the particular form of polygamy that arrived here in 2003, when the group’s members came from Utah and Arizona.Mr. Hilderbran led the push in 2005 to raise the marriage age in Texas to 16 from 14, a legislative process in which Mr. Shurtleff, the Utah prosecutor, came to testify in support of the change.“We’ve been fighting this for awhile, trying to do something about it,” Mr. Hilderbran said. “But we needed a complaint. You can’t just say: ‘Golly, I can’t get into that ranch, I bet you lots of awful stuff is going on in there.’ ”Mr. Hilderbran said that based on recent conversations with law enforcement officials, they had been poised to respond if and when a cry for help came.“There was some anticipation, at least some preparation,” Mr. Hilderbran said.“There was great concern not to have something like Waco,” he added, referring to the raid on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco in 1993, in which more than 80 people were killed. “So we want to know how to handle it, to have our ducks in a row.”“I think our agencies and law enforcement did a good job,” Mr. Hilderbran said of the raid last week.Mr. Shurtleff has become deeply identified with the polygamy issue, taking his advocacy even beyond Utah’s borders.Last month, he spoke to a group of civic and business leaders in Austin, Tex. He was accompanied by a former child bride from the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which owns the ranch here.Mr. Shurtleff’s message was that polygamy had victims.When it was over, Mr. Shurtleff said, more than a few people promised to help.“They and their wives were saying, ‘I know this person, this legislator, and I’m going to use our influence, to try and get something done over there,’ ” he said.Mr. Shurtleff said he had no idea whether that day in Austin influenced the events of last week, when 700 state law enforcement and child welfare officials arrived here and surrounded the Yearning for Zion ranch, as the F.L.D.S. compound here is called.Mr. Hilderbran, the legislator, said he was unaware of any recent pressure to take action beyond the girl’s call. The business executive who organized the event in Austin did not return calls on Friday.In Eldorado, a dusty and remote spot in the Hill Country where goat herds line the sides of the road and free-range chickens are not just a description on a supermarket package, tolerance for the secretive sect members — mixed with suspicion — seems to have been the norm.The newcomers kept to themselves, neither giving to the community nor asking much in return. But that is a trait most people here respect, no matter the rumors of what went on behind closed gates.“They haven’t bothered anybody,” said Jerry Swift, a sheep, goat and cattle rancher. When they came to Eldorado to buy supplies, which was rare, the men dressed in work clothes, “not any differently than us,” Mr. Swift said.Members of the sect have practiced “plural marriage,” as they call it, since they split more than a century ago from the mainstream Mormon church, which is based in Salt Lake City.Both groups look back to Joseph Smith as their founder and first prophet. But the main branch of the faith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, disavowed polygamy more than a century ago and excommunicates polygamists today.That Utah and Arizona would take leadership in combating polygamy is not surprising, because those states also have two of the highest percentages of mainstream Mormons in the nation, many of whom bristle at the long-outdated association with polygamy. That animosity complicates interfaith relations and politics.A more immediate question is how the history of the Texas raid will be told in the cloistered places of polygamists where sermons and oral tradition rule and where television, radio and newspapers are all alien.“We have no control over their internal communications,” said Mr. Goddard, the Arizona attorney general. “And right now they feel they’re a target.”'"
"'08-04-12,'0','Yahoo’s board met Friday to evaluate Microsoft’s takeover bid and other alternatives but did not make a formal decision on which option to pursue, people briefed on the meeting said.Yahoo’s board did authorize the company’s management to continue meeting with Microsoft and with Time Warner, these people said, and meetings with both are expected to be scheduled for next week.In addition to Microsoft’s proposal, the board is considering a plan to merge with the AOL unit of Time Warner, these people said. Yahoo has also been discussing a complementary plan to outsource its search advertising business, one of its principal sources of revenue, to Google, in an effort to increase revenue and try to remain independent.The meeting followed a flurry of activity around Yahoo in recent days. It began last Saturday with a threat by Microsoft’s chief executive, Steven A. Ballmer, to begin a proxy fight to oust the board unless the companies reached a negotiated merger agreement by April 26.On Monday, Yahoo said that it was not opposed to a deal with Microsoft but reiterated its position that the software giant’s offer undervalued Yahoo. Microsoft’s Jan. 31 offer was initially valued at $44.6 billion, or $31 a share, but after a decline in Microsoft’s shares, it has fallen to about $41.6 billion, or $28.95 a share.'"

"'08-04-12,'0','As for business travel, Mr. Hanson says companies have cut back so much since 2000 that there is not much fat left to trim, but they are enforcing travel policies more strictly to control costs. And full flights may affect business travel in a different way: no room on the plane for executives who make last-minute plans.“If you decide two days before a travel date and can’t find a reservation, travel just doesn’t happen,” Mr. Hanson said.It turns out that demand for travel is less influenced by the overall economy and airport struggles than all kinds of factors not easily measured — like how much snow is on the ground, where grandpa and grandma live, and even whether a favorite football team is doing well.“Since the Packers made it to the N.F.C. championship, our business was slow in January,” said Chip Juedes, director for marketing for Fox World Travel, an agency his grandfather started in 1960 that now has 14 locations in Wisconsin.Mr. Juedes said business was flat so far this year, after years of growth, but he attributed that mostly to Easter overlapping with spring break in March, rather than having two separate travel times. The silver lining was record snowfalls throughout the state.“We’ve had a terrible winter, and that’s affected us, too — in a good way,” he said. “Everyone wants to get out of here.”Although the airlines are struggling with skyrocketing fuel prices, aging planes and calls for tighter regulation, one bright spot for the industry is that passengers are still filling up seats and booking flights.“We’re concerned about a recession, but probably more in the second half of the year,” said John Heimlich, chief economist for the Air Transport Association, pointing out that airlines have not announced widespread fare sales.“That to me is always a sign of an effort to stimulate traffic — and we haven’t seen a lot of that,” he said.Nor have hotels been doing much discounting. Room rates in the United States were up 6 percent in 2007, to an average of $104 a night, and increased 5 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Smith Travel Research.Despite higher prices, especially in cities like New York, where the average rate is $270, the number of rooms sold increased 1.2 percent last year and is forecast to increase about 1.4 percent in 2008.One factor bolstering this demand is the influx of foreign travelers. In 2007, some 57 million foreigners traveled to the United States, spending $123 billion — a record on both counts, according to the Department of Commerce.“Although the weak dollar hasn’t been helpful for U.S. travel abroad, it has been quite helpful for international travelers coming here,” Mr. Heimlich said.Over all, airlines based in the United States carried 769 million passengers last year, an annual record.What is surprising travel agents is that Americans are still going to Europe in record numbers, even though a cappuccino can cost up to $10 when they get there.In 2007, 13.25 million Americans visited Europe, a 2.7 percent increase over 2006, and some industry analysts expect that number will at least remain flat, if not increase slightly, this year.But some European travel has shifted to less expensive countries. The number of American visitors to Portugal, for instance, increased 20 percent last year. The current data may also reflect trips planned long before the recent turmoil in the financial markets.Darren Katz, president of a communications company in Atlanta, said he still planned to vacation in Italy this summer with his family, but watching the dollar plunge against the euro has made him nervous about the trip’s rising cost.“We planned this trip probably over a year ago and so as the dollar has slipped, everything that we’re planning on doing is becoming exponentially more expensive,” he said.Americans are economizing on trips to Europe by opting for hotel rates guaranteed in dollars, buying all-inclusive packages or cruises or shortening their trips.“They’re really being more savvy and resourceful and taking advantage of all the discounts and offers available to them,” said Mona Hamouly, a spokeswoman for American Express Travel. That same pattern is reflected in the business travel market, according to Matthew Patterson, global project manager for Carlson Wagonlit Travel.“That’s the biggest change I’ve seen for the past three to six months: companies are trying to make smarter buying decisions,” he said.These efforts include encouraging employees to book tickets earlier for lower fares, requiring them to choose flights based on price rather than departure time or reining in spending on meals.But most corporate travel managers pointed out that in a global economy, companies cannot afford to keep employees at home, even when air travel is frustrating.“Business travel happens for a specific reason, and carrier service issues aren’t going to drive bookings down,” Mr. Patterson said.It is also possible that certain inconveniences are overstated, like the effect of gas prices on summer driving trips.“The average trip that people take is about 600 miles each way,” said Roger Dow, president and chief executive of the Travel Industry Association. If a car gets 15 miles per gallon and gas prices rise 20 cents, he said, “That’s a $16 or $20 increase in the price of a trip.”The association still expects the number of domestic travelers will grow 1.5 percent this year, a signal of how essential travel has become.“Despite not knowing where the price of oil is going to go or the roller coaster stock market, I think people are very committed to family time, vacation time and multigenerational travel,” said Jennifer Wilson-Buttigieg, co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel, an agency based in New York City. “They’re still going to go.”'"
"'08-04-12,'0','Frontier Airlines on Friday became the latest budget carrier to file for bankruptcy protection, but the airline promised to continue normal operations.Frontier, based in Denver, said it had filed for protection after its main credit card processor tried to hold back substantial proceeds from its tickets sales. But the airline said it would continue to operate its full schedule of flights and honor ticket reservations.“To be clear, we filed for very different reasons than those of other recent carriers, and our customers and employees can be confident that we intend to keep on flying and providing outstanding service and products,” Sean Menke, Frontier president and chief executive officer, said in a statement. He said the airline promised to continue “normal operations throughout our reorganization process.”On Wednesday, Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, a long-haul budget carrier that tried to offer premium service and spacious seats at low prices, suddenly went into liquidation and canceled all flights. At that time, it was the fourth budget carrier worldwide to halt operations over a period of a week and a half. The series of bankruptcies could undermine travelers’ confidence in budget airlines.The high price of jet fuel has taken a heavy toll on the airline industry and particularly on low-margin discount carriers. The other three to shut down since March 31, all in the United States, are Aloha Airgroup, ATA Airlines and Skybus Airlines.“We felt that Frontier would be able to withstand the challenges confronting the U.S. airline industry, which include unprecedented and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel and the impact of the credit crisis in the financial markets, without seeking bankruptcy protection,” Mr. Menke said in the statement.Frontier said that it is in its 14th year of operation, and that it offers routes linking its Denver hub to 70 destinations.'"
"'08-04-12,'0','Couples was matter-of-fact about the end of the streak.“The reason I have that streak is because I won in ’92, which was the big honor,” he said. “And to make the cuts, to be quite honest with you, I don’t consider that great of a deal. Playing well in this tournament I think is my goal.“And even as well as I played last week, you know, I think I set my sights a little high yesterday and I went out and I struggled and I tried to hit better shots than I could, and I went from two over to three over to four over, and you’re kind of done.”Couples was referring to last week’s tie for fourth at the Houston Open, which encouraged him to think he could not only make the cut and break the record but also contend for a second green jacket this week.But Couples was pressing from the start in the first round here, and he could not make anything happen.When it became clear he was out of the field for the weekend, he shrugged.“I’m not going to make it,” he said. “I’m kind of disappointed in that. But I’m really disappointed with the way I played.”SNEDEKER CHIPS IN All those years scratching around the municipal courses in Nashville taught Brandt Snedeker a thing or two. With his ball sitting on a big knob at the back of a green Friday, he grabbed a lob wedge.“I knew there was a couple members worried when I took out the lob wedge,” Snedeker said, referring to what might have been the shot of the day at the Masters. “But I figured it would be O.K. if I didn’t take a divot, and I didn’t. So the green is no worse for the wear.”Saving himself a bogey or worse, Snedeker chipped in, making birdie on the par-3 sixth hole on his way to a four-under-par 68 that put him a stroke behind Trevor Immelman.(AP) PLAYER SAYS HE WILL RETURN Gary Player came to Augusta this week to break a tie with Arnold Palmer by playing in his record 51st Masters and to break 80 on the course.He accomplished both goals and said he would return after missing the cut for the 10th consecutive year.Player, 72, had planned to walk away from the Augusta course if he was unable to break 80. After an opening-round 83, Player had a six-over-par 78 in the second round Friday.“I want to be a role model for young children,” said Player, who won in 1961, 1974 and 1978.'"
"'08-04-12,'0','“We did a study last week on the 11 big carriers I follow and Frontier was the only one we thought was in danger,” Mr. Neidl said. “I am surprised it happened so early.”On Wednesday, Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, a long-haul budget carrier that tried to offer premium service and spacious seats at low prices, suddenly went into liquidation and canceled all flights. At that time, it was the fourth budget carrier worldwide to halt operations over a period of a week and a half. The series of bankruptcies could undermine travelers’ confidence in budget airlines.The high price of jet fuel has taken a heavy toll on the airline industry and particularly on low-margin discount carriers. The other three to shut down since March 31, all in the United States, are Aloha Airgroup, ATA Airlines and Skybus Airlines. As with most airlines Frontier has struggled with higher fuel costs. In addition, it has faced increased competition from United and Southwest at its large hub in Denver.Mr. Neidl said Frontier was threatened after Southwest Airlines decided that it would aim at Denver, which was not big enough to support several carriers.Mr. Menke said in the statement said, “We felt that Frontier would be able to withstand the challenges confronting the U.S. airline industry, which include unprecedented and significant increases in the cost of jet fuel and the impact of the credit crisis in the financial markets, without seeking bankruptcy protection.”“Unfortunately, our principal credit card processor, very recently and unexpectedly informed us that, beginning on April 11, it intended to start withholding significant proceeds received from the sale of Frontier tickets,” he said. “This change in established practices would have represented a material change to our cash forecasts and business plan. Unchecked, it would have put severe restraints on Frontier’s liquidity and would have made it impossible for us to continue normal operations.”The credit card processor, the First Data Corporation, did not have an immediate comment Friday, according to The Associated Press.In its court petition, Frontier said that First Data had notified the airline that it was increasing the amount of collateral it required to $130 million from $54.5 million and that it would retain 50 percent of the airline’s bank card sales.In a report to investors, JPMorgan said that Frontier’s Chapter 11 filing was not expected to have any material near-term implications, “though it will likely propel the issue of credit card holdbacks to the forefront of many investors’ minds, particularly as it relates to discount airlines.”The report said that a similar situation may have occurred at Skybus.In its bankruptcy filing, Frontier listed its largest creditor as Wells Fargo, which is owed $93.5 million. Frontier in its 14th year of operation, and that it offers routes linking its Denver hub to 70 destinations.In the case of Oasis, the bankruptcy filing stranded thousands of passengers in Hong Kong, London and Vancouver. Many of the would-be passengers stuck in Hong Kong were children trying to return to British boarding schools after spring break.Mr. Neidl said he expected the airline industry would lose $1.2 billion in the first quarter.“Traffic remains strong but with a weakening economy, we expect demand, especially from higher yielding business travelers, to begin falling off as we move into the heavy spring-summer travel months,” he wrote. “Recent attempts at ticket price increases have begun to fail though oil prices have remained stubbornly high.”'"

"'08-04-13,'0','I couldn’t figure out the difference between opinion and a point of view, and I asked Nocera. “To be honest, I think it is distinction without a difference, and I don’t really understand it,” he told me in a message from China, where he is traveling. “I do believe that my job is to tell readers my opinion about business matters, so that is what I do.” He said the distinction that makes sense to him is that he invests a lot of old-fashioned legwork into reporting that forms the basis of his opinions, while an Op-Ed column may or may not contain original reporting.Nocera can be quite clear about his opinions. Last fall, he wrote a series of columns about efforts by the National Football League to get its proprietary channel carried on cable systems. The league was threatening to seek regulatory help from the federal government. “I know who I’m rooting for: the cable guys,” Nocera wrote.Nocera writes only columns, which gives him greater latitude in my view than a columnist who also writes news articles and therefore faces the daunting challenge of shooting down the middle one moment and venturing an opinion the next. He has colleagues in the business news department who write both columns and news articles. When one of them, Andrew Ross Sorkin, was covering Rupert Murdoch’s bid for Dow Jones last spring, he reported on Murdoch’s strategy and three days later wrote a column that could easily have been interpreted as an endorsement of his offer.Liptak is another reporter-columnist. He was just named to succeed Linda Greenhouse as the next Supreme Court reporter for The Times, one of the newspaper’s most important and most scrutinized beats.Last Tuesday, a “Sidebar” column by Liptak appeared on the front page, exploring the startling (my opinion) fact that Congress gave the homeland security secretary the power to waive any law at all in order to build a border fence. Environmental groups have appealed to the Supreme Court, saying that Congress ceded too much of its power. Liptak, a lawyer who was a counsel for The New York Times Company before becoming a reporter, explained the constitutional issues and the arguments on both sides, just as he would have in a news article. But with flicks of language that his editors call “voice,” he led me to a conclusion — right or wrong — that he thinks it is a bad law. He cemented that impression for me with one of the oldest tools at a columnist’s disposal, a ringing kicker, or last paragraph, that gives one side the last word, in this case a quote that Liptak called “apt” from Justice Anthony Kennedy: “Concentration of power in the hands of a single branch is a threat to liberty.”Liptak said his kicker was “high school civics” and that he was writing a reported analysis, not expressing an “ideological opinion.” I don’t think it is ideological: I suspect that there are legal scholars on the left and right alike who would take exception to the extraordinary grant of power to a single member of the executive branch. But I do think a reasonable reader would see it as opinion — from a reporter, on the front page.Bill Keller, the executive editor, strongly defended Liptak’s column, though he said it contained at least implicit opinion. The mandate of columnists in the news pages “is fundamentally analytical,” he said. “They may have a point of view on an issue, but they are not partisan or ideological. They don’t endorse candidates. They don’t prescribe outcomes. ... They are free to express opinions of a certain type that grow out of a particular expertise and a body of reporting.”Keller added: “I do think it is important that we maintain the impartiality of the news pages. We do that by rigorously policing the fairness and accuracy of news stories, by clearly labeling material that comes with a point of view, and by confining outright advocacy and partisanship to the opinion pages.”The Times has reporters with years of accumulated knowledge on their beats, and Suzanne Daley, the national editor, said the newspaper wants to give readers the benefit of it, “so you aren’t left with he-said, she-said, and you can’t make head or tail of it.”I agree that journalism that is mere stenography is of little use to readers and is often even misleading. News reporters should provide context. They should challenge false assertions by authority. They should write articles giving their expert analysis. But it may be one step too far to have the same reporter write a column with voice and opinion — explicit or implicit — and news articles that are supposed to be completely impartial. That is taking a big risk with the trust of readers already inclined to believe that the news media, including The Times, are biased.'"

"'08-04-13,'0','“He’s never been a lot of flash and style and whiz-bam, but he’s a steady hand, and he’s seen a lot of political battles,” said Scott Reed, a Republican lobbyist who first met Mr. Black on a House race in 1982. “He’s the exact complement McCain needs.”A little too exact, perhaps, for critics who question how Mr. McCain, a self-described straight talker who rails against the power of special interests, can be advised by one of the city’s best-connected lobbyists. Mark Penn — whose firm, Burson-Marsteller, owns Mr. Black’s firm — stepped aside last week as chief strategist for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s campaign after he met with representatives of the Colombian government, which is pursuing a trade pact that Mrs. Clinton opposes. In an effort to defuse similar concerns about potential conflicts of interest, Mr. Black resigned from his firm, BKSH, the previous week.Even his resignation displayed the agility that has defined him. Mr. Black has worked for some of the city’s most controversial clients (Jonas Savimbi, Philip Morris, Blackwater) and with the baddest boys of Republican politics (he cut his teeth on Jesse Helms’s campaigns, and was a mentor to Lee Atwater). But he has managed to stay ahead of controversy himself.“Charlie’s a survivor,” Mr. Reed said. “When his candidates win, he does well, and when he doesn’t win, he’s still on everyone’s team. That’s a remarkable skill in Washington.”Said Harrison Hickman, a Democratic pollster who, like Mr. Black, has worked often in his native North Carolina: “It’s a terrific trait of cats and political operatives: landing on your feet. He dresses up well; he’s become more corporate over the years. But inside that well-made suit is the heart and instinct of a political operative.”A courtly Southerner, Mr. Black is an unflappable spinner, responding in the heat or silliness of a campaign with the well-modulated tone of a man who cannot believe that not everyone would see his position as the only reasonable one.Blackwater, he says over steak salad at the Morton’s off the K Street lobbying corridor, “is a fine company that’s provided a great service to the people of the United States and Iraq.” Saudi Arabia, another client: “a great ally.” Mr. Savimbi, the brutal Angolan leader whom President Ronald Reagan promoted as a freedom fighter but many Democrats derided as an ally of apartheid South Africa: “a great pleasure to work with.”He describes Mr. McCain, elected to Congress a quarter-century ago and running against two potential “firsts” in the White House, as “the only candidate of change.”The two first met when Mr. McCain was Navy liaison to the Senate in the late 1970s, and they became close on Phil Gramm’s presidential bid in 1996.One of five senior advisers to Mr. McCain, Mr. Black is considered the Republican Wise Man. It has fallen to him to work the Republican establishment — he was there, for instance when Mr. McCain hosted Republican senators and governors at his Arizona ranch in early March. He is a frequent McCain surrogate on television.On the trail, he sits in a big swivel chair at the front of the Straight Talk Express, joining in Mr. McCain’s rolling news conferences when the topic turns toward historical precedents or coordination between the campaign and the Republican National Committee.He is often joined by his wife, Judy, a lobbyist and former Tobacco Institute executive who is a chairwoman of Women for McCain. (Even on a quick vacation to their second home in Arizona, they were at the McCains’ for drinks on Christmas Eve.)Other McCain advisers and Republican Party operatives say his value is in his even keel. As he described his philosophy, “The most important thing in political campaigns is figuring out what matters and what doesn’t.”“He has this aura of he’s seen it all before,” said Jeffrey Bell, a Republican strategist who worked for Mr. Black in the 1980 Reagan campaign. “But the thing is, he was that way when he was young. He could convince you the moon was made of green cheese if that was his task.”Mr. Black grew up in Wilmington, N.C., the son of Southern Democrats who switched affiliation to vote for Barry Goldwater in 1964. He joined Young Americans for Freedom at the University of Florida, and moved to Washington to work for the group’s national staff, where he met one of its big supporters, Mr. Helms.In 1975, Mr. Black and two other young conservatives, Roger Stone and Terry Dolan, founded the National Conservative Political Action Committee, which set a new standard for negative advertising with its campaigns against six liberal senators in 1980, portraying them as “baby killers” for their support of abortion rights, cozy with Castro and soft on national defense. His first hire at the 1980 Reagan campaign was Lee Atwater, who was just becoming famous for a slashing brand of politics.Yet while his partners delighted in their reputations as princes of darkness, Mr. Black has avoided celebrity.“I’ve always believed you’re in politics to help these candidates and not yourself, and you should stay out of the news if you can,” he said. “Roger and Lee are examples of guys who never did anything to discourage a little bit of a bad boy image.”He started his lobbying firm in 1980, as he said, “thinking someday I’m going to need a real job in between campaigns.” Black, Manafort and Stone — it would later expand to include Mr. Atwater, who died in 1991 — became one of the most aggressive and well-connected Republican lobbying shops in Washington.The firm was so entwined with the Reagan White House that administration officials gave it a heads-up so it could cancel its contract with a client, President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, two hours before Reagan withdrew his support.It became bipartisan in the mid-1980s, and its political consulting wing was so successful that its partners frequently worked for both sides in a race. Senior partners were granted Mercedes-Benzes and memberships to the country clubs of their choice. In 1990, they sold the firm to Burson-Marsteller, reportedly making them multimillionaires.In recent years, Mr. Black’s clients have included AT&T, Johnson and Johnson, the worldwide lottery firm GTech, Lockheed Martin, United Technologies, Yukos Oil, and the governments of Greece, Armenia and Cyprus. BKSH worked for Ahmed Chalabi and the Iraqi National Congress, as well as the Lincoln Group, hired by the Pentagon to generate positive stories about the Iraq war.Mr. Black says Mr. McCain has never given his clients preferential treatment. In the late 1990s, he pointed out, Philip Morris and other tobacco companies fought against what called their newspaper ads called “the McCain Tobacco Tax.”But health advocates now say that Mr. McCain has softened his position on tobacco, voting against a 61-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes that would have financed children’s health insurance. Mr. McCain explains his position as a matter of no new taxes. And Mr. Black insists that he has not lobbied him on that or any issue. Still, there is potential for conflict on any number of issues, whether on military policy or the bid for Puerto Rican statehood, whose opponents Mr. Black has represented.Mr. Black describes his role, as he does most of his success in Washington, as a matter of relationships. “If I hadn’t known McCain a long time, I wouldn’t have been in a position to step into a big role,” he said.He worked against Mr. McCain for George W. Bush in 2000. He says he did not support Mr. McCain because he did not believe he could raise enough money to win.His ability to move from one campaign to another surprises few who know him.“Ronald Reagan and George Bush didn’t particularly like each other and had a pretty bitter contest for the nomination, and Charlie Black got along with both of them,” Mr. Stone said. “John McCain and George W. Bush don’t really like each other and had a pretty bitter contest for the nomination, and Charlie Black gets along with both of them.”“He can be as aggressive as he needs to be to win, but it’s not personal,” Mr. Stone said. “He understands that losers don’t legislate.”'"

Milan, the defending champion, was eliminated from this season’s Champions League by Arsenal in the first knockout round.The club has struggled to score and create goals with the Brazilian Ronaldo playing only a handful of games before sustaining a season-ending knee injury. Striker Alberto Gilardino and Kaká, the world player of the year, have had mediocre seasons.WENGER IS NOT WORRIED Arsène Wenger has been acclaimed for transforming Arsenal from a dour, results-driven club into a team that has gained worldwide admiration for its style.Because the titles have dried up, however, the praise is turning to criticism.If the Gunners lose at Manchester United on Sunday, another chance for a title will have slipped away after they were eliminated by Liverpool in the Champions League last week.It would no league trophy for four seasons and the sound of disapproving fans and critical news media will get louder, questioning why Wenger relied on a short bench and failed to make moves in the transfer market.“It doesn’t worry me,” said Wenger, who has been with the club since September 1996. “I don’t mind that I’m questioned. I would prefer that I’m questioned rather than the players.“I can handle that. I have to accept it. I’m in a position where you have to accept being criticized. My position is not my problem or worry. My only worry is to be at my best every day and to act as if I will spend the rest of my life here at the club.”Arsenal is 6 points behind United and 3 behind Chelsea in the Premier League. Chelsea plays Monday against Wigan.A Gunners victory, however, will put the team within striking distance of both its rivals. United and Chelsea are scheduled to play at Stamford Bridge on April 26.“It will be the greatest achievement of my career to win the Premiership now because we are swimming against the stream at the moment,” he said. “But I still believe this team can produce it. For us the game on Sunday is the game of the season. If we do not win this game we have no chance.” (AP)EXECUTIVE IS OUT IN CHICAGO The Fire of Major League Soccer, which lost its coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, to the Red Bulls, has now lost John Guppy, the club’s president and general manager.Guppy and the team “agreed to part ways,” the Fire owner/operator Andrew Hauptman, who acquired the team late last year, said Friday. He was replaced by Javier León, who was the chief executive at Chivas USA until this February.Guppy, a former executive with the MetroStars who replaced the popular Peter Wilt in Chicago in 2005, was in San Jose with the team before Saturday’s match against the Earthquakes. He told MLSnet.com that he was “surprised by the timing.”The move by Chicago presents the possibility that Guppy could return to the New York area as the Red Bulls’ top executive after the announcement last week that Marc de Grandpre was leaving as the Red Bulls’ managing director.There has been much animosity between the two clubs since Osorio, who joined Chicago in the middle of the 2007 season, decided to leave the Fire for the Red Bulls late last year. At the time, Hauptman threatened to file tampering charges with the league, but the teams agreed to a compensation package, and Osorio is now on the Red Bulls’ bench.'"
"'08-04-13,'0','In short, the nation steeped in the thinking of a man who blamed government for the Depression now beseeches government to lift it to safety. If Mr. Friedman, who died in 2006, were still among us, he would surely be unhappy with this turn.“What Milton Friedman said was that government should not interfere,” said Allen Sinai, chief global economist for Decision Economics Inc., a consulting group. “It didn’t work. We now are looking at one of the greatest real estate busts of all time. The free market is not geared to take care of the casualties, because there’s no profit motive. There’s no market incentive to deal with the unemployed or those who have lost their homes.”To Mr. Friedman, such sentiments, when turned into policy, deprived the economy of the vibrancy of market forces.Born in Brooklyn in 1912 to immigrant parents who worked briefly in sweatshops, Mr. Friedman retained a sense that America was a land of opportunity with ample rewards for the hard-working.His intellectual bent was forged as a graduate student at the University of Chicago, a base for those who saw themselves as guardians of classical economics in a world then under the spell of woolly-headed revisionists.The chief object of their scorn was John Maynard Keynes, and his message that government had to juice the economy with spending during times of duress. That notion dominated policy in the years after the Depression. Mr. Friedman would spend much of his career assailing it: He argued that government should simply manage the supply of money — to keep it growing with the economy — then step aside and let the market do its magic.So firm was his regard for market forces, so deep his disdain for government, that Mr. Friedman once said: “If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there would be a shortage of sand.”This antagonism toward bureaucracy seemed to spring from Mr. Friedman’s conception of his country as a bastion of rugged individualism. During an interview on PBS in 2000, he noted that Adam Smith, the father of classical economics, published his canonical work, “The Wealth of Nations,” in 1776, “the same year as the American Revolution.”He spoke in the interview of his concern at the end of World War II that socialism was gaining adherents because countries had been forced to organize collectively to produce armaments.“You came out of the war with the widespread belief that the war had demonstrated that central planning would work,” Mr. Friedman said. “The left, in particular, ... interpreted Russia as a successful experiment in central planning.”Mr. Friedman’s brand of libertarianism rested on the assumption that economic and political freedom were one and the same. It meshed with and fed the cold war thinking of his time, as the United States offered up capitalism as liberty itself in contrast to the authoritarian Soviet Union.His first breakthrough came in the 1950s with his idea that people’s savings and spending were not a function of psychological factors, but based on rational estimations of wealth.His greatest contribution came the following decade, when Mr. Friedman dismantled the consensus view that inflation was a tolerable byproduct of high employment. He demonstrated that high inflation would eventually cost jobs, as businesses were discouraged to invest by the higher wages they had to pay.“This triumph, more than anything else, confirmed Milton Friedman’s status as a great economist’s economist, whatever one may think of his other roles,” Paul Krugman, an economist (and a New York Times columnist) wrote last year in The New York Review of Books.Mr. Friedman captured the era with a new formulation known as monetarism: that the government should gradually and predictably inject cash into the financial system, and then let the market figure out where it should go.“Any honest Democrat will admit that we are now all Friedmanites,” Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Clinton administration Treasury secretary, wrote in an appreciation published in this newspaper when Mr. Friedman died. “He has had more influence on economic policy as it is practiced around the world today than any other modern figure.”But the reviews for Mr. Friedman’s work grow mixed when the subject moves to his role as chief proselytizer in the drive to reduce the role of government in public life.He laid out a blueprint in his 1962 book, “Capitalism and Freedom,” calling for the end of the military draft, the abolition of the licensing of doctors and the creation of “education vouchers” that parents could use to send children to private schools, injecting competition into public education.Two years later, Mr. Friedman put those principles to work as an economic adviser to the presidential campaign of Senator Barry Goldwater, a Republican from Arizona. The campaign called for the abolition of government oversight of the energy, telephone and airline industries and the dismantling of the Social Security system and national parks.Mr. Goldwater took a drubbing at the hands of Lyndon Johnson. Mr. Friedman would remain in the policy wilderness until the rise of President Reagan. Then, his notions about rolling back government took on the force of dogma.This was so not only in the United States, but also throughout much of the world. As former Iron Curtain countries embraced free markets, they did so with Mr. Friedman’s books in hand. The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank leaned heavily on his ideas in prescribing policies for countries from Asia to Latin America.“Among the cognoscenti, he became the figure that represented the war against the overwhelming welfare state,” said Hernando de Soto, a prominent Peruvian economist. “The idea that people are responsible for progress far more than government. One should reserve most of the action for the private sector. From Brazil to Mexico, that idea is still in place.”But Mr. De Soto faulted Mr. Friedman for failing to temper his admonitions with an understanding of poverty and income inequality.“The problem with Milton Friedman and his fellow libertarians is they never took into consideration the importance of class,” Mr. De Soto said. “They ignored the way elites were able to distort the policies they prescribed for their own benefit.”In much of Latin America, economic growth never reached the poor, laying ground for the socialist backlash now led by Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez.In the United States, the reconsideration of the Friedman doctrine came via the global financial crisis that has resulted from the collapse of American real estate. Many economists blame regulators for ignoring warning signs that banks and investors were growing reckless. One Friedman acolyte has taken the brunt of such criticisms — Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve.But as America reaches for regulation to tame the markets, the keepers of the Friedman flame remain resolute that government is no solution.“Friedman taught some fundamental long-run truths and he was adept and skilled and almost brilliant at getting them into the public domain,” said Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon. “Now we’ve come into a crisis that has dampened enthusiasm for those policies, and we’re headed back into a period of more regulations that will do the same bad things as in the past.”'"
"'08-04-13,'0','Lanaux speaks with the perspective of someone who returned to the neighborhood when it was eerily dark for weeks after Katrina hit in August 2005.He lived alone, without electricity, in the upstairs of his stucco home on Audubon Boulevard, one of the more elegant streets in town. Flooding had ruined nearly everything on the first floor. His wife temporarily moved their children to Houston to put them in school.“It was weird, the first month after the hurricane, when I’d drive from here to work in pitch black,” he said.Only trace evidence of disaster remains in Lanaux’s neighborhood, which is easily seen from the stands as a backdrop of large live oak canopies, palm trees, arched windows and burnt-orange terra cotta ridge lines on expansive rooftops.The $10.5 million ballpark is an architectural landmark wedged into an edge of campus where Super Bowls and Sugar Bowls were once held at the old Tulane football stadium.With dark-green bucket seats, and a red brick design on walls behind home plate and between two levels of the infield stands, it combines a nostalgic look with modern amenities like private suites and an open-air club patio.Along the right-field foul line, a steep pavilion — where students sit and heckle opposing players — towers over a narrow street separating the campus from a stretch of old one- and two-story wood-frame homes that sometimes take knocks from foul balls hit high enough to clear the suites.Tulane Coach Rick Jones, in his 15th season with the Green Wave, said neighbors never complained, nor did they return any balls.They cherish the return of baseball, he said.“Around here you talk to people who say they grew up selling Cokes in the old Tulane Stadium during the Super Bowl, and they’re Tulane fans from birth,” he said.Because the park is on the same spot as the old, smaller Turchin Stadium, which held about 3,500, the stands had to be built on a steeper incline, so fans in the last row have the impression of being on top of the action.“It feels almost like you’re in an amphitheater when you’re on the field,” Jones said.Tulane’s team held together after the storm because Texas Tech hosted it for the fall 2005 semester, setting up players with classes, housing and practice facilities.Because much of Tulane’s campus did not flood, it reopened the next semester. The baseball team spent the past two seasons playing home games at Zephyr Field, a minor league park in the suburbs that is also home to the Mets’ Class AAA affiliate. Many students and neighborhood residents were unwilling or unable to make the 20-minute drive each way regularly, and games were usually played before a lot of empty seats.Julia Otis has been attending games for years; she lived within walking distance of the on-campus ballpark before relocating after the flood. She drives now but still takes heart in seeing nearby residents flock to games from rebuilt homes.“It’s a little piece of regular activity,” Otis said. “A lot of the fans here have been coming for so long, they walk over here, ride their bikes or they’re five minutes away.”“There’s always someone sitting out there on the roof,” she added, glancing at Lanaux’s place.Players say they are delighted because they no longer take a bus to practice or home games, and because the new synthetic turf field drains well, so typical spring showers cause only minimal delays.The crowds are more lively as well.“Our student section was pretty much nonexistent the last two years,” outfielder Warren McFadden said. “This adds a little life to the campus. People get excited about games. They can just walk right down the street.”The senior outfielder Grayden Griener, who was part of Tulane’s last College World Series team, in 2005, struggled to think of a comparable college baseball stadium.He said, “As far as the fans being on top of you and the noise level, it’s more electric than any place I’ve ever been in, and I’ve played in a lot of good places.”Jones suspected the stadium would help him recruit, and he was not disappointed; he received commitments from the first 11 recruits who visited after it was built.“This is something I’ve been waiting for for 15 years, and now that it’s here I have to pinch myself once in a while, because after the storm all bets were off,” Jones said. “The university didn’t have to do this and everyone would have understood, including me. There’s no manual to go by when you’re dealing with the nation’s largest natural disaster.”Like others in New Orleans, officials at Tulane took the approach of combining needed repairs with improvements. Many at the university contend that the entire campus looks better than ever.Certainly, the new ballpark, which will host the Conference USA tournament May 21-25, helps.“Like it was rising from the ashes, it was amazing to watch it be built,” said Rick Lacey, who graduated from Tulane in 1971 and is a regular at games. “It’s pretty awesome. To a certain degree, a facility like this is kind of showing the way. I hope so anyway.”'"
"'08-04-13,'0','As homeowners, shareholders and federal investigators pick through the subprime wreckage, many have asked how effectively front-line financial monitors carried out their duties. Ratings agencies responsible for signing off on the creditworthiness of securities, and regulators responsible for overseeing banking practices and safeguarding the entire financial system, have already been roundly criticized for not sounding alarms earlier.Now, attention is turning toward yet another steward of financial reporting ensnared in the subprime debacle: accounting firms.While accounting firms don’t exert legal or regulatory authority over their clients, they do bestow seals of approval, the way ratings agencies do. People in the financial industry, as well as investors, have reason to believe that a green light from an auditor means that a company’s accounting practices have passed muster.Accounting practices drew increased scrutiny after Enron collapsed and its auditor, Arthur Andersen, went out of business in 2002 amid a federal prosecution. Analysts say the mortgage crisis may not result in criminal charges against auditors, but it is certain to renew interest in how accountants conducted themselves.The interpretive waltz between a company and its auditor, of course, can be complicated and open to varying perceptions. But New Century’s accounting and KPMG’s review of the mortgage lender’s financial statements offer a window onto some of the problematic practices that helped lead to the mortgage bust.A recently unsealed report by an examiner for the United States Bankruptcy Court in Delaware raises the question of whether New Century’s accounting obscured an early signal that the mortgage freight train was about to run off the rails.New Century’s accounting methods let it prop up profits, charming investors and allowing the company to continue to tap a rich vein of Wall Street cash that it used to underwrite more mortgages. Without the appearance of a strong bottom line, New Century’s financial lifeline could have been cut even earlier than it was.“It would have had widespread repercussions for the lenders who were buying loans from New Century,” Zach Gast, an analyst at the research firm RiskMetrics, said about the possible impact of an earlier profit warning from the lender. “It may have even accelerated the whole downturn of the subprime market.”Still, some accounting experts question how appropriate it is to take auditors to task for judgment calls that, even in hindsight, are hard to make.“I think it’s a stretch to blame everything on the accounting profession,” said David Aboody, a professor of accounting at the University of California, Los Angeles. “What does the S.E.C. want? Does it want an auditor who tries to predict the future? Or does it want an auditor to record what is clearly going on at the time?”ANALYSTS say that auditors, because of in-depth knowledge of complex accounting rules and first-hand relationships with corporate management, are there to push back, examining how executives calculate numbers and assessing the financial health of enterprises.In New Century’s case, the court examiner, Michael J. Missal, concluded that KPMG was not skeptical enough and that the lender’s creditors could pursue negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims against the auditor. But the examiner did not accuse KPMG of fraud or intentional wrongdoing. The examiner said he also “did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that New Century engaged in earnings management or manipulation.”KPMG strongly contests any suggestion that it was derelict in its duties or that it went overboard trying to retain a well-paying client. It resigned from its New Century engagement shortly after the lender filed for bankruptcy, and it never completed the audit of the lender’s statements for 2006, the year in which New Century’s accounting was at its most improper, according to the examiner.KPMG says that it’s unclear whether the examiner’s conclusions are derived from objective evidence available at the time it worked for New Century, or simply represent assumptions that are now being made in hindsight.“The examiner was appointed by the court to identify potential lawsuits in a bankruptcy case,” said Kathleen M. Fitzgerald, a KPMG spokeswoman. “Consistent with that charge, he has prepared an advocacy piece, which has many one-sided statements and significant omissions. In the end, the examiner concluded that the bankruptcy estate may be able to file a lawsuit against KPMG for negligence — a claim we strongly dispute — and a claim even the examiner notes in his report for which KPMG has strong defenses.”Even so, the examiner’s report has signaled to some analysts that something may have gone seriously awry in KPMG’s relationship with New Century.“Allegations that an auditing firm didn’t engage in due professional care and made recommendations that are inconsistent with GAAP must be taken very seriously,” said Kathleen M. Hamm, a former senior enforcement official at the Securities and Exchange Commission, referring to the “generally accepted accounting principles” that public companies must follow. Ms. Hamm is now a managing director at a consulting firm, the Promontory Financial Group.The examiner’s investigation is also the latest in a string of embarrassing episodes for KPMG. In March, Xerox and KPMG settled a securities lawsuit relating to decade-old accusations of accounting manipulations. And KPMG has been criticized for its audit of the Federal National Mortgage Association, after it was revealed that the company, known as Fannie Mae, had overstated its earnings by billions of dollars over several years.And, finally, nearly three years ago, federal prosecutors came within an eyelash of filing criminal charges against KPMG over dubious tax shelters it set up for clients, leading to a deferred prosecution agreement and a wrenching internal investigation.“For KPMG, this comes on the heels of all of the tax-shelter stuff, and they just got rid of having a court-appointed examiner, so this is difficult for them,” said Jack Ciesielski, editor of The Analyst’s Accounting Observer, a trade publication.FROM the 11-story glass-and-steel tower that housed its headquarters in Irvine, Calif., New Century ruled during the recent housing boom as one of the nation’s largest lenders to individuals with weak, or subprime, credit.The company’s three founders, Robert K. Cole, Edward F. Gotschall and Bradley A. Morrice, met while working at the same mortgage bank in the early 1990s. They founded New Century in 1995, and KPMG became the company’s auditor.At the epicenter of the subprime boom, New Century and its founders grew wealthy as the company’s stock soared. The company churned out billions of dollars worth of subprime mortgages, many of which it then sold to Wall Street banks. And, quarter after quarter, it generated robust earnings.Behind the scenes, however, the explosive growth at New Century shot beyond the company’s internal controls and policies as well as the managerial abilities of some of its key executives, the bankruptcy court examiner concluded.For instance, the examiner said in his report that the company did not have a formal policy spelling out exactly how to calculate reserves it might need to repurchase loans if Wall Street rejected them. The lender also used simple spreadsheets to evaluate its own mortgage securities holdings, the examiner said. KPMG flagged some of these shortcomings to the management, but because KPMG considered them to be “inconsequential,” they were not reported publicly, according to the examiner’s study.The relationship between New Century’s executives and board and KPMG also became strained as early as the end of 2005, the examiner report said.Some members of New Century’s board were uncomfortable with what they believed was a lack of acumen displayed by certain accounting and financial managers at the company. Others, like the director Richard A. Zona, appeared to have had early concerns about whether the company was being conservative and thorough enough in various aspects of its accounting.In one of two resignation letters that Mr. Zona drafted in late 2005 but never submitted to the board, he called New Century’s management team “dysfunctional.” A former vice chairman of U.S. Bancorp and a former partner at Ernst & Young, Mr. Zona told the examiner he had not left the board because other directors persuaded him to stay.A lawyer representing New Century’s former directors said Mr. Zona and other directors declined to comment.According to the report, Mr. Zona and some of his fellow directors did ask New Century’s management and KPMG whether the lender was setting aside enough money to repurchase loans rejected by Wall Street.In 2005 and 2006, the number of mortgages sent back to New Century skyrocketed as some borrowers became delinquent in payments as early as the first few months after taking out a loan, indicating shoddy lending practices, according to the report.On the evening of Sept. 7, 2006, a senior New Century executive, Kevin Cloyd, sent an e-mail message to the chief executive, Mr. Morrice, and Patti M. Dodge, the company’s chief financial officer, saying, “We got our teeth kicked in with regard to repurchase requests in Aug. and thus far in September,” according to the examiner’s report.An hour later, Mr. Morrice sent a livid e-mail response, criticizing Mr. Cloyd for the timing of this revelation, especially because it came shortly “after sending a positive report” to New Century’s board.Yet the very next day, New Century issued a press release about its August lending levels, which it said had climbed 9 percent from July. Saying it had “strict underwriting guidelines” and “skilled risk management,” the company asserted in the release that the increase in repurchases because of early-payment defaults at the end of August “has been modest.”Despite the internal misgivings, the company made no effort to recall or correct the press release, according to the examiner’s report. Mr. Cloyd did not return phone calls. Ms. Dodge could not be reached. And a lawyer representing Mr. Morrice did not return calls.Although New Century sold more than $40 billion in loans in the first nine months of 2006, it had reserved only $13.9 million as of Sept. 30 that year to repurchase loans, according to the firm’s securities filings. Those filings were not audited by KPMG, but they were reviewed by the firm.The reserve was woefully inadequate, according to the examiner’s report. By the end of September 2006, New Century already had $400 million in pending repurchase requests — meaning that the $13.9 million it had set aside represented just 3.5 percent of that troubled pool of loans. Officials in New Century’s accounting department and on the KPMG audit team told the examiner that they were not aware of the rising backlog of repurchase claims.The examiner asserted that New Century had made two glaring errors in how it calculated its repurchase reserves: first, it assumed that it would be asked to buy back only loans sold in the previous three months, though it was fielding requests for loans it sold as much as a year earlier.“New Century and KPMG each share responsibility for failing to correct the repurchase reserve calculation methodology that permitted the backlog claims to be excluded from the repurchase reserve through all accounting periods,” the examiner’s report said. He said New Century provided information to KPMG officials that showed pending repurchase claims totaled $188 million at the end of 2005, adding that that “should have made KPMG investigate the issue.”But Ms. Fitzgerald said KPMG determined that the reserve for 2005 was appropriate and added that the “examiner’s report itself makes clear that even if the entire $188 million of repurchase claims were separately considered, the estimated result would have been only $8 million of increased reserves against reported net income of over $400 million.”Second, in the summer of 2006, the company simply stopped estimating the losses on loans it would have to buy back, a breach of standard accounting practices, according to the examiner.New Century’s low reserve levels, meanwhile, were catching the attention of outside analysts. In reports in November and December of 2006, Mr. Gast of RiskMetrics said he believed that the company was setting aside far too little to buy back loans. The reports created a stir at New Century, and the accounting department prepared a rebuttal.Settling into his new job, Mr. Bindra, the chief financial officer who succeeded Ms. Dodge in November, raised the issues in Mr. Gast’s report with New Century’s controller, David Kenneally, and the KPMG partner in charge of New Century’s audit, John Donovan, according to the examiner’s report and interviews with former New Century executives who requested anonymity because of their concerns about being entangled in litigation.Until late January, according to the report, Mr. Kenneally defended the company’s reserve calculations. After that, the report said, Mr. Donovan told him that a further accounting review showed that New Century had made a mistake.Mr. Kenneally’s lawyer declined to comment, and KPMG declined to make Mr. Donovan available for comment. Mr. Bindra’s lawyer also declined to make him available.By underreserving, New Century was able to show still-rising profits in the second quarter and declining, yet positive, earnings in the third quarter of 2006. Had New Century been more conservative about its reserves, second-quarter profits would have been halved and it would have reported a loss in the third quarter, the examiner determined.Eventually, these problems burst into public view. In March 2007, after New Century disclosed that it would need to restate its earnings and would probably be shown as unprofitable during the last six months of the previous year, its lenders pulled the plug on the company. In April, it filed for bankruptcy.But some experts say that regardless of what KPMG did, New Century would have collapsed.“The business model of New Century depended on real estate values that would continue to go up and certainly not go down,” said Roman L. Weil, an accounting professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. “The economic model here is what is at fault. It’s the cause of what happened, not anything that KPMG did.”AMONG the “Big Four” auditing firms, KPMG is the smallest. Yet it is the go-to auditor for banking and financial services firms and real-estate investment trusts like New Century, according to Audit Analytics, an independent research firm. Deloitte & Touche and Ernst & Young also have many financial services clients.KPMG is the auditor for such prominent mortgage players as Wells Fargo, Citigroup, HSBC Finance, Countrywide Financial and Thornburg Mortgage, according to an examination of annual reports.Those relationships put KPMG in a potentially vulnerable spot as authorities increased their scrutiny of the subprime business. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it has 17 continuing investigations of possible corporate and accounting fraud related to subprime lending. That number, the F.B.I has said, is likely to increase.Although federal prosecutors are examining the trading activities of New Century executives, KPMG is not a target of the inquiry, according to a person briefed on the matter who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.Moreover, the appetite for prosecuting accounting firms has diminished since Arthur Andersen was convicted of obstruction of justice as part of the Enron investigation, according to analysts. In 2005, the Supreme Court overturned that conviction, but it was too late to save the firm. With only four large accounting firms left, the government is unlikely to push any of them too hard, experts say.“The Justice Department learned from its prosecution of Arthur Andersen that threatening entire firms jeopardizes our system of private auditing,” said Lawrence A. Cunningham, a professor at the George Washington University Law School. “What’s vital is that individuals be held responsible for wrongdoing.”A MORE likely threat to auditing firms and mortgage companies could be civil, rather than criminal, lawsuits. Shareholders have already filed a raft of lawsuits against lenders that failed or whose stocks have dropped sharply. In some cases, shareholders are trying to add the auditors as defendants.In January, New York City and New York State pension funds that are leading a class-action lawsuit against Countrywide added its auditors, KPMG and Grant Thornton, as defendants. KPMG declined to comment on the suit. A spokesman for Grant Thornton said the firm was confident it would be dropped from the suit because it had not audited Countrywide for four years.Last week, liquidators of two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns sued the bank and its auditor, Deloitte & Touche. They contend that the firms hid the true financial risks and health of the funds, which invested in mortgage-linked securities. Bear Stearns declined to comment, and, in a statement, Deloitte said that the suit was without merit and that the firm intended to defend itself.It is unclear whether the creditors in the New Century bankruptcy will try to recoup losses from KPMG. Even the court examiner, Mr. Missal, notes in his report that creditors of New Century could pursue negligence claims against KPMG but that such a case could be hard to win.Even if KPMG is safe from large damages and a criminal prosecution, Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the S.E.C., said the findings were still troubling.“The examiner cites different pieces of evidence that do raise concerns about whether or not you had an honest-to-goodness independent audit going on,” Mr. Turner said.For its part, KPMG says that it faithfully carried out its professional duties.“It is very easy — and totally unreasonable — to look at decisions made in 2005 or 2006 through a 2008 lens,” said Ms. Fitzgerald, the KPMG spokeswoman. “The full record shows that KPMG acted in accordance with professional standards. We will vigorously defend our audit work in the appropriate forum, which will allow for a complete hearing of the facts.”'"
"'08-04-13,'0','This article, for example, portrayed the cross-country phase as a dangerous “race” during which “penalties are assessed if the horse balks at a jump, if the horse or rider falls, or if their time is too slow.” Every course has an “optimum time” window in which the horse and rider aim for; either too fast or too slow is penalized.A cross-country ride is in no way, shape or form related to a race, as the only competition on the field is oneself. Additionally, some responsibility must be taken by the riders to know their own ability and the abilities of their horses, and they should adjust their rides accordingly.Thanks for alerting us to the human death toll in competitive riding. What you failed to mention is the equine casualties. How many mounts die in what has become a new blood sport? Why do we permit our own cruelty to prove that the dumb animals are the two-legged ones? Marshall L. SmithAs a lifetime rider and amateur competitor in equestrian sports, I have noted that the use of trainers has been largely ignored in the culture of eventing. I have logged more than 30 years competing in hunter/jumper horse shows, spending countless hours preparing for each show under the guidance of my trainers.In my few eventing outings, I have had the uneasy experience of watching many competitors go it alone without the help of a professional trainer. In fact, it served as a badge of honor that a rider was training/coaching alone.The expense of having a trainer may reduce the number of eventing competitors, and never eliminate accidents like that of the well-trained Christopher Reeve, it would surely add to the safety of the sport and the emergence of a better class of rider. Carla WardAnyone who looks at the multiple pictures of frightened, amped-up horses falling to uncertain injuries and uncertain fates in your slide show of eventing should recognize one thing. This is animal cruelty, and the fact that wealthy people are doing it to unbelievably expensive yet clearly abused animals does not excuse it.The riders can at least make the decision as to whether they wish to take those risks. The horses may not.If 12 riders were killed in the last year, what are the statistics for horse deaths and horse injuries that require euthanasia?Although riders of a bygone period might not have been any more capable than some riders of this age, they had one distinction that I see regularly in portraits of military riders. Their coats had high stiff collars, which I have read served as neck braces to reduce or eliminate neck injuries to the riders during the jouncing they took during their rides, not to mention falls.It remains possible that riders should consider wearing at least elements of clothing that were part of a bygone era, which might also serve to protect them better. Some components from motocross might translate well since they protect from the same kind of falling injuries. Gus Tarin'"
"'08-04-13,'0','By most measures both companies, with hundreds of employees, qualify as vibrant businesses. Each has revenue in excess of $50 million annually.Moreover, there is also a range of smaller organizations, like the Internet Archive in San Francisco, with smaller but sustainable revenue streams. Significantly, an ecosystem is emerging that involves support groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which provides legal services, and the Internet Systems Consortium, which plays the role of an independent Internet service provider for the community.“There is a lot of discussion taking place right now about a whole new organization form around social enterprise,” said James Fruchterman, president of Benetech, a social enterprise incubator based in Palo Alto. “Many of these efforts can make money; they will just never make enough to provide venture capital rates of return.”Brewster Kahle, who has founded a number of successful Internet companies, as well as the nonprofit Internet Archive, said: “If we do this right, I think there is momentum here. The next major operating systems company might be a nonprofit.”The Internet Archive, which runs Web crawlers — programs that index information stored on the Internet — and offers the popular Wayback Machine, which allows surfers to find previous versions of Web sites, now has two self-sustaining projects. The first is digitizing books and the second is creating and maintaining Web repositories for national libraries.Mr. Kahle says he is developing a set of principles that he hopes will help formalize his idea that there is a middle ground between the technologists and the capitalists. He ticks off operating guidelines like transparency, staying out of debt, giving away information and refusing to hoard.TechSoup stumbled upon its business eight years ago after it began sending a truck around San Francisco to pick up donated commercial software to distribute to nonprofit groups. Today, the organization distributes products from 32 commercial companies, including Cisco Systems, Microsoft and Symantec, to roughly 50,000 organizations annually, for a small administrative fee.“We were just trying to meet the needs of nonprofits,” said Rebecca Masisak, co-chief executive of TechSoup.Nonprofits with revenue are not new or restricted to Silicon Valley, and there is a great deal of debate over whether they offer a sustainable approach.The new stream of technology-centric and successful nonprofits, however, appears to be driven in part by a set of microelectronics technology trends that have sent shock waves through many industries, from publishing to music and movies.“Computer technology and the Internet are lowering the cost of doing business,” said John Lilly, the chief executive of Mozilla, the Web browser developer that is being subsidized by advertising revenue from the search engine business.That blends with the strong sense of social purpose held by a number of the best and brightest in Silicon Valley.“We went through all these decades where we had nonprofits that thought business was evil and sustainability was irrelevant,” said Debra Dunn, an associate professor at the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design at Stanford who advises social entrepreneurs. “Now there has been an influx of business thought. People are saying, ‘I have enough money and I care.’”STILL, most technology-oriented social entrepreneurs acknowledge that the hybrid model is by no means a one-size-fits-all approach, and there is significant debate about how far it can reach. Moreover, the approach hasn’t always worked.For example, beginning in 2002, the Lotus Development founder Mitchell Kapor invested more than $5 million in the Open Source Applications Foundation, with the intent of finding a sustainable business. The group had a number of strategies for obtaining revenue from the distribution of free software, but it was unable to get far enough along to begin the experiment. The project never got to the point where the calendar program Chandler could be widely distributed, and Mr. Kapor has since scaled back the project.The experience, however, has not dulled his optimism.“You can use a lot of the methods of business, specifically entrepreneurial start-ups, in ways that are directed at having a positive social impact,” Mr. Kapor said. “Mozilla and the Archive are cases where we are harnessing powerful techniques of value creation that were originally forged in the Valley and putting them to use.”'"
"'08-04-13,'0','Another was the ending of the uptick rule in short sales. (This allowed short-sellers to sell even if there were no immediately preceding uptick in sales price, and is widely believed to have greatly increased downward volatility in markets.)Yet another was allowing commercial and investment banks to pile on leverage on a scale that no one even conceived of 20 years ago.But for whatever reason, there is a problem out there that needs immediate attention. To divert attention from it with long-term plans for reformulating regulation makes as much sense as calling in an interior decorator to redo a sailboat that is taking on water.What’s needed are some brave Coast Guard heroes, not decorators. To the extent that Mr. Paulson’s proposals divert the nation from such urgently needed measures as real solvency guarantees for the banks, they prevent us from addressing a genuine need.The proposals themselves are also strange. One in particular startles me. The idea is to merge the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. There are fine people at both places. But the C.F.T.C. is about making sure there are free markets and lots of “action” in commodities trading. The S.E.C. is about investor protection and redemption of fiduciary duty guarantees. (At least it is supposed to be.) To merge them is to tell investors that the federal government is no longer eager to guarantee their rights. This is an attack on basic legal protections of investors.BUT the most upsetting part of the hoopla around Mr. Paulson’s plans had to do with two arguments made by him or his pals. In one, he suggested that regulation wasn’t going to solve the problems of credit crises in the capital markets. These, he said, happened every 5 or 10 years no matter what the state of regulation.This is nonsense. Capital markets crises on this scale did not happen in the 1940s, ’50s, ’60s and ’70s, when there was genuine regulation under both Republicans and Democrats. They are not natural phenomena like hurricanes or earthquakes. They happen because the false god of deregulation allows unscrupulous people to loot the system. Think of the Drexel Burnham Lambert and savings and loan debacles, as thrifts were allowed to hold bonds. Think of the giant high-tech frauds from Wall Street. Think always of the repeal of Glass-Steagall, a law that kept commercial banks from becoming investment banks and trading houses and casinos.The second argument, still being made by a number of Mr. Paulson’s pals, is that they don’t want any regulation that keeps Wall Street from competing with London and Hong Kong as a financial center. Individual investors go to the back of the bus — the people who bought shares in money market funds threatened by collapsing S.I.V.’s (so-called structured investment vehicles), the people who were wiped out in Bear Stearns stock, the people who were hurt badly as the banks imploded.The effect of the proposals is to allow the inside players on Wall Street to keep playing, and getting the huge paychecks. It is to allow the supersized egos of Wall Street to be fed — maybe not with marble palaces as with my neighbors in Beverly Hills, but with staggering compensation, even as stockholders and taxpayers are slaughtered. “Socializing risk and privatizing gain,” as Nouriel Roubini, a distinguished economics thinker, has eloquently said.So, when I see that decent, lovely red brick house that could be replaced by a monument to ego, I think of our glorious Wall Street and its best pal in Washington, and I don’t feel so good about the future.'"

"'08-04-13,'0','Mr. Green writes tellingly of the latent meanings expressed in language “shy of fluency.” Music itself may be a prime carrier of such latent meanings.In “Some Enchanted Evening,” Emile DeBecque sings of his own foreign, “strange” and fugitive qualities through an exotic and yearning augmented chord applied to the subdominant, a harmony that can be argued to represent a fleeing from the ego.We know that Nellie is charmed by the characterization, as she later sings through the same unusual harmony in her musical identification of Emile at the end of “A Wonderful Guy,” its sound clearly counterpoised against the Kansas-corny chords by which she portrays herself.The audience knows through this latent musical motif how deeply Nellie has bonded with Emile, but does not necessarily grasp the fluency of Richard Rodgers’ language in helping it draw the connection.The writer is the chairman of the department of music theory at the University of Michigan.'"
"'08-04-13,'0','Pamela Paul’s riveting, ribald and sophisticated review of Mary Roach’s “Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex” (March 30) is accompanied by an intriguing pink portrait of a hypothetical organic molecular entity. Perhaps this molecular banner was meant to represent the pheromonic chemical science behind sex research. If so, with its dozen brazen errors, among them dangling, flaccid atoms, the flagrant partnering of carbons with a harem of five bonds and a ménage à trois of oxygens and hydrogens, it was a lesson in aberration. Could it be that this molecule was so captivated by its inclusion in Paul’s review that it wantonly chose to form new, revealing bonding relationships, ones that are simply unheard of in our more staid and prudish chemistry?Alan M. RosanMadison, N.J.The writer is a professor of chemistry at Drew University.The figure accompanying the review of “Bonk” made me cringe. I’m not sure what its use is, other than to give the article a “scientific” feel. It is the chemical equivalent of stringing together a bunch of English words in some random order. Sure, it may look like a paragraph to someone who doesn’t speak English, but for those who do, it is nothing short of atrocious.

"'08-04-13,'0','It is painful to wear a corset for 15 hours a day. They only loosen you up for lunch, and you would think that you would lose weight, but somehow you don’t. Movie sets are like 30 people grazing all day, eating sandwiches.Does the corset help you to get in character?Absolutely. You immediately feel regal. In this movie, we tried to combat the stuffy costume-drama approach. We see the private side of Victoria, when she was young and rebellious. She had a very overprotected childhood — she wasn’t allowed to walk down stairs without someone holding her hand. But she had a great sense of her position: at 10, she told her governess, “I will be good.”Did you have to learn proper royal manners?We had an etiquette coach on the set at all times. He is very close to the royal family, and he watched everything we did and said. He wanted us to be correct but vivid: after all, the royals go to the toilet, they have sex, they are human beings.In your last film, you have only two scenes, and one of them is pretty much in the nude. Was that difficult?Oh, my poor father blushed when he saw the film. asked me to do the movie, and when Mike Nichols asks you, you nod your head excitedly and then you realize what you have said yes to! The scene was with , and the whole time I was distracted by images of him in It was a bizarre thing to be crawling around him nearly naked. I should have gotten stoned to do it. But Tom was the best guy — a complete gentleman. He got some flak from his friends for playing such a sexed-up character at his age and stature, but I think everyone is entitled to be sexy in movies at any age. The movie was an ironic look at America at war, and if there are some naked Jacuzzi scenes along the way, all the better.Did you have any interaction with , who was also in the film?Sadly, no. When I was around 10, rather inappropriately, I watched I remember asking my grandmother what Julia Roberts was showing . They were brightly colored, and I thought they were sweets. “That’s a ,” my grandmother said. I went, “Oh right, oh right.” I had no idea what she was talking about.Movies can be so educational.Oh, yes. As actors, we know a little about a lot. For I had to learn to ride sidesaddle, and for the film I’m making now — a werewolf movie — I also had to learn how to waltz. But I can’t stand it when I hear actors talk about their “process.” It always sounds like they’re trying to justify their paychecks. And I don’t believe actors who say they don’t watch themselves. We’re self-indulgent people — of course I watch myself.Is it true that all British actors want to conquer America?Yes and no. They want to conquer America and dismiss America at the same time. It’s O.K. to step out of the circle as long as you come back. I love working in both places, but I always want to come back to . Acting feels like more of a craft here, like you are acting for the right reasons.Why do the Americans hold the British in such high esteem?Because they think we’re all related to .'"
"'08-04-13,'0','FOR many Tibetans, the case for the historical independence of their land is unequivocal. They assert that Tibet has always been and by rights now ought to be an independent country. China’s assertions are equally unequivocal: Tibet became a part of China during Mongol rule and its status as a part of China has never changed. Both of these assertions are at odds with Tibet’s history.The Tibetan view holds that Tibet was never subject to foreign rule after it emerged in the mid-seventh century as a dynamic power holding sway over an Inner Asian empire. These Tibetans say the appearance of subjugation to the Mongol rulers of the Yuan Dynasty in the 13th and 14th centuries, and to the Manchu rulers of China’s Qing Dynasty from the 18th century until the 20th century, is due to a modern, largely Western misunderstanding of the personal relations among the Yuan and Qing emperors and the pre-eminent lamas of Tibet. In this view, the lamas simply served as spiritual mentors to the emperors, with no compromise of Tibet’s independent status.In China’s view, the Western misunderstandings are about the nature of China: Western critics don’t understand that China has a history of thousands of years as a unified multinational state; all of its nationalities are Chinese. The Mongols, who entered China as conquerers, are claimed as Chinese, and their subjugation of Tibet is claimed as a Chinese subjugation.Here are the facts. The claim that Tibet entertained only personal relations with China at the leadership level is easily rebutted. Administrative records and dynastic histories outline the governing structures of Mongol and Manchu rule. These make it clear that Tibet was subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers. Tibet was not independent during these two periods. One of the Tibetan cabinet ministers summoned to Beijing at the end of the 18th century describes himself unambiguously in his memoirs as a subject of the Manchu emperor.But although Tibet did submit to the Mongol and Manchu Empires, neither attached Tibet to China. The same documentary record that shows Tibetan subjugation to the Mongols and Manchus also shows that China’s intervening Ming Dynasty (which ruled from 1368 to 1644) had no control over Tibet. This is problematic, given China’s insistence that Chinese sovereignty was exercised in an unbroken line from the 13th century onward.The idea that Tibet became part of China in the 13th century is a very recent construction. In the early part of the 20th century, Chinese writers generally dated the annexation of Tibet to the 18th century. They described Tibet’s status under the Qing with a term that designates a “feudal dependency,” not an integral part of a country. And that’s because Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus. When the Qing dynasty collapsed in 1911, Tibet became independent once more.'"
"'08-04-13,'0','In January, while looking for an apartment, he quit his law job to devote more time to his start-up, called Wakozi (wakozi.com). He started the business after lugging home beer and wine bottles for a party, and saw a need for a site that listed liquor stores that deliver. He found office space for Wakozi in West Midtown. Still, the business, which is expanding to include listings of local grocery stores and delis that deliver in many neighborhoods in Manhattan, was sapping Mr. Rizzo’s interest in looking for a place to live. As the boss, “you never get time off,” he said.So when he saw a banner advertising rentals on the Hudson Crossing Building on West 37th Street, just a few blocks from his office, he called. He was shown a studio for around $2,600. It was more than he wanted to spend, “so I was going to start dipping into savings or moving things around in my budget,” he said.Its proximity to his office meant he could pop over during the day to walk Sarah, saving money on the dog walker. But he returned later that day with his girlfriend, who noted that it overlooked the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.“I can work with that,” Mr. Rizzo said. “I sleep kind of heavily. I think I am less sensitive than the average person.” Besides, drivers wouldn’t honk, would they? “I am an optimist by nature,” he said.But his girlfriend’s hesitation “was enough to bring me to my senses, or to her senses,” he said.Mr. Rizzo assumed rents would be lower in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where a good friend lived. So he spent a rainy day there with an agent, only to find prices as high as those in Manhattan.He was depressed after seeing a tiny fifth-floor walk-up. “I figured, I am going out to Brooklyn; I don’t need to go above two flights,” he said. There was a school across the street, which to Mr. Rizzo meant that children would be outside early in the morning. “I will live on top of the Lincoln Tunnel, but not with little kids,” he said. “I think traffic is more of a drone, whereas little kids’ screeching is tough to deal with.”He next checked the Web site of Equity Residential, which managed Hudson Crossing, and decided to look at a building that the firm was listing in the financial district, at 71 Broadway. Downtown, he figured, he would get more space. That was true, though a large studio cost around $2,700. And the neo-Classical-style building, formerly called the Empire Building, felt too much like the office building it had once been, he said.By this time, with the help of Alexandra Gerardi, one of his four employees, he was on to the East Village. She jumped at the chance to help.“Rob was so miserable about having to look for another place,” she said. But she had loved looking for her own rental when she moved to New York last fall. “Every time I went into an apartment, it was a new experience,” she said.Besides, Mr. Rizzo didn’t seem hard to please. “He has no requirements except for space for the dog,” Ms. Gerardi said. “He doesn’t care about anything as long as it is not four floors up on a walk-up.”But “I wasn’t so optimistic about his price range,” said Ms. Gerardi, who shares a studio in the East 20s with a friend. (The full rent is $3,000.) “I was sure he was going to up his price.”She found a listing for a one-bedroom rental on First Avenue near Seventh Street, for $2,450. The 700-square-foot apartment was above a Korean restaurant, which might be why it felt so hot inside, Mr. Rizzo said. The view was of a busy McDonald’s. “You can’t get any closer to the avenue unless you are living in the restaurant,” he said.The listing agent, Michele Roderick of Citi Habitats, was prepared with a list of other East Village possibilities. The first one, a $2,500 ground-floor one-bedroom on East Seventh Street, wasn’t especially large, but it had a huge private backyard, perfect for a rambunctious dog.She showed Mr. Rizzo several more, including a place on East 10th Street near the Russian and Turkish Baths, where medicinal-smelling steam billowed out.Elsewhere in the East Village, a one-bedroom had a long, narrow hallway. “They were billing it as 500 square feet, and it might have been close, but a lot of that square footage was a hallway that you couldn’t use for anything because it wasn’t wide enough,” Mr. Rizzo said. “You couldn’t hang out there, and you couldn’t put a table there.”In any case, he had the yard on East Seventh Street in his head, and no other place compared. He took the apartment, after negotiating the rent to $2,400.He and Sarah moved in last month. His new home remains partly unfurnished, largely because the entryway is so small that his couch wouldn’t fit inside. He and his friends ended up leaving it outside for trash pickup.Meanwhile, he enjoys the yard as much as Sarah does. “She can get out some energy and that makes her less bark-ative, if that’s a word,” he said. In the morning and at night, he needn’t take her for a walk. He just opens the back door and out she bounds. The dog walker still takes her for a midday walk.“It makes my life easier because she gets tired out,” he said. “Anyone who has big dogs, particularly Labs, knows that to have them tired is like gold.”'"
"'08-04-13,'0','A talented historian who wrote a book with Rice, Zelikow came to be loathed by much of the commission’s staff for his arrogance. Some staff members and more than a few people in the Washington press corps even viewed him as a White House mole, intent on sanitizing the Bush administration’s record. According to Shenon, Zelikow did not inform the leaders of the commission of his role in drafting the White House’s September 2002 “pre-emptive defense” doctrine and was frequently in touch with both Rice and Karl Rove.The very first expert witness to appear before the commission was the State Department’s legal adviser during the Reagan administration, Abraham Sofaer, who championed the notion of pre-emptive war in his testimony. According to Shenon, “members of the commission’s staff would look back on Sofaer’s testimony as the first evidence that Zelikow might try to use the commission to promote the war with Iraq.”In addition, Zelikow extended an invitation to Laurie Mylroie, an eccentric academic at the American Enterprise Institute who believed that Saddam Hussein had been behind the first bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993, to testify that Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda were linked. “After the hearing with Mylroie,” Shenon writes, Zelikow “made it clear to the commission’s staff that he wanted the issue of Al Qaeda-Iraq links pursued aggressively.” Shenon’s verdict is unequivocal: “He wanted to put the commission’s staff on record as saying that there was at least the strong possibility that Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein had collaborated to target the United States before 9/11.” The commission staff rebelled and Zelikow retreated.Another major issue was the respective records of the Clinton and Bush administrations in confronting, or failing to confront, terrorism. Shenon suggests that the Clinton administration was, in fact, preoccupied by terrorism (even though it did too little to combat it), while the Bush administration focused on issues like Russia and China. The 9/11 staff, we are told, uncovered dozens of instances in which Clinton spoke about terrorism. Bush, by contrast, referred to it only in the context of state-sponsored terrorism and as demonstrating the need for missile defense. Once again, Zelikow apparently intervened, and, Shenon writes, “the comparison between Bush and Clinton came out of the final draft over the objections of the staff.”Other difficulties the commission encountered were highly questionable accounts from officials like the former C.I.A. director George Tenet: he claimed that he had not informed Bush about an Aug. 6 Presidential Decision Brief warning of a possible hijacking attempt, only to reverse himself. “Either Tenet’s memory was faulty to the point of dementia or he had lied,” Shenon writes, “hoping that no one would learn what had been discussed between him and Bush.”Obtaining access to such warnings was onerous. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales held an absolutist view of executive privilege and refused to hand over White House documents. The commission’s gifted investigator Warren Bass went so far as to memorize passages of a prophetice-mail message from the National Security Council staff member Richard Clarke to Rice warning of an imminent attack by Al Qaeda. He would rush back to his office to type them out.Though Shenon vividly illuminates the obstacles to holding high-level intelligence and government officials accountable for their bungling, he doesn’t discuss the reforms passed by Congress after the 9/11 report appeared. He might have noted that absent charges of personal culpability and punishment for failure, intelligence officials have little incentive to improve their performance. And for all the sound and fury about intelligence lapses, the Congressional reforms themselves amounted to little more than shuffling boxes on paper. Perhaps the greatest shortcoming of the commission itself was to endorse a patchwork of feel-good reforms that simply slathered on a new layer of bureaucracy in the form of the director of national intelligence, who lacks the authority to supervise the unwieldy 16 agencies that constitute the intelligence community.But even if it functions perfectly, this community can’t, as Shenon’s account abundantly demonstrates, control the politics of intelligence. If anything, the Bush administration’s ideological approach before 9/11 appears similar to its response to terrorism after it. The commissioner John Lehman probably got closest to the truth when he told Shenon that before 9/11, Bush administration officials were “just besotted” with missile defense, Iraq and other issues, concluding, “They were living in another world.”Apparently, they still are.'"
"'08-04-13,'0','YOU don’t have to pay retail for business-class seats anymore. A growing number of airlines are offering significant discounts on business-class tickets to travelers who book well in advance.In February, introduced a new business-class fare that is about half the normal price: about $4,000 for a round-trip trans-Atlantic flight when purchased 30 days in advance, compared with about $8,000 when booked just a week in advance or as much as $11,000 at the last minute. About the same time, restructured its business-class fares from a single flat rate — typically $10,000 between New York and — to a new tiered-fare system that offers deep discounts to travelers who book early. already offers a similar deal with business-class fares as low as $2,739 for a round-trip ticket between New York and booked more than 50 days ahead, compared with about $8,000 normally.The deals come as demand for those cushy seats in the front of the plane is sagging. Premium travel, highly sensitive to the economic cycle, has been slowing since its peak last August, according to the International Air Transport Association. In January, sales of business- and first-class tickets barely grew, rising just 0.4 percent compared with the month last year. And with the increasingly grim outlook for the economy and financial markets, could continue to slow.The new deals are aimed squarely at leisure travelers who have the flexibility to book well in advance, with the deepest discounts offered to customers booking as many as 60 days out. To make sure they don’t cannibalize their lucrative business clients, these fares come with certain requirements like Saturday-night stayovers. And unlike the so-called walk-up fares business travelers tend to buy, discount business-class tickets are almost always nonrefundable and come with hefty fees upward of $400 for any changes.For example, Air France is offering business-class tickets from to starting at $3,362 round trip, compared with about $5,100. But to get the lower fare, customers must book at least 30 days in advance, stay a minimum of seven days and connect through Charles de Gaulle International Airport in . Travelers who can book as many as 60 days in advance can score a ticket for as much as 60 percent off.'"

"'08-04-14,'0','The system, often called Tier 4, began in earnest with Medicare drug plans and spread rapidly. It is now incorporated into 86 percent of those plans. Some have even higher co-payments for certain drugs, a Tier 5.Now Tier 4 is also showing up in insurance that people buy on their own or acquire through employers, said Dan Mendelson of Avalere Health, a research organization in Washington. It is the fastest-growing segment in private insurance, Mr. Mendelson said. Five years ago it was virtually nonexistent in private plans, he said. Now 10 percent of them have Tier 4 drug categories.Private insurers began offering Tier 4 plans in response to employers who were looking for ways to keep costs down, said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans, which represents most of the nation’s health insurers. When people who need Tier 4 drugs pay more for them, other subscribers in the plan pay less for their coverage.But the new system sticks seriously ill people with huge bills, said James Robinson, a health economist at the University of California, Berkeley. “It is very unfortunate social policy,” Dr. Robinson said. “The more the sick person pays, the less the healthy person pays.”Traditionally, the idea of insurance was to spread the costs of paying for the sick.“This is an erosion of the traditional concept of insurance,” Mr. Mendelson said. “Those beneficiaries who bear the burden of illness are also bearing the burden of cost.”And often, patients say, they had no idea that they would be faced with such a situation.It happened to Robin Steinwand, 53, who has multiple sclerosis.In January, shortly after Ms. Steinwand renewed her insurance policy with Kaiser Permanente, she went to refill her prescription for Copaxone. She had been insured with Kaiser for 17 years through her husband, a federal employee, and had had no complaints about the coverage.She had been taking Copaxone since multiple sclerosis was diagnosed in 2000, buying a 30 days’ supply at a time. And even though the drug costs $1,900 a month, Kaiser required only a $20 co-payment.Not this time. When Ms. Steinwand went to pick up her prescription at a pharmacy near her home in Silver Spring, Md., the pharmacist handed her a bill for $325.There must be a mistake, Ms. Steinwand said. So the pharmacist checked with her supervisor. The new price was correct. Kaiser’s policy had changed. Now Kaiser was charging 25 percent of the cost of the drug up to a maximum of $325 per prescription. Her annual cost would be $3,900 and unless her insurance changed or the drug dropped in price, it would go on for the rest of her life.“I charged it, then got into my car and burst into tears,” Ms. Steinwand said.She needed the drug, she said, because it can slow the course of her disease. And she knew she would just have to pay for it, but it would not be easy.“It’s a tough economic time for everyone,” she said. “My son will start college in a year and a half. We are asking ourselves, can we afford a vacation? Can we continue to save for retirement and college?”Although Kaiser advised patients of the new plan in its brochure that it sent out in the open enrollment period late last year, Ms. Steinwand did not notice it. And private insurers, Mr. Mendelson said, can legally change their coverage to one in which some drugs are Tier 4 with no advance notice.Medicare drug plans have to notify patients but, Mr. Mendelson said, “that doesn’t mean the person will hear about it.” He added, “You don’t read all your mail.”Some patients said they had no idea whether their plan changed or whether it always had a Tier 4. The new system came as a surprise when they found out that they needed an expensive drug.That’s what happened to Robert W. Banning of Arlington, Va., when his doctor prescribed Sprycel for his chronic myelogenous leukemia. The drug can block the growth of cancer cells, extending lives. It is a tablet to be taken twice a day — no need for chemotherapy infusions.Mr. Banning, 81, a retired owner of car dealerships, thought he had good insurance through AARP. But Sprycel, which he will have to take for the rest of his life, costs more than $13,500 for a 90-day supply, and Mr. Banning soon discovered that the AARP plan required him to pay more than $4,000.Mr. Banning and his son, Robert Banning Jr., have accepted the situation. “We’re not trying to make anybody the heavy,” the father said.So far, they have not purchased the drug. But if they do, they know that the expense would go on and on, his son said. “Somehow or other, myself and my family will do whatever it takes. You don’t put your parent on a scale.”But Ms. Steinwand was not so sanguine. She immediately asked Kaiser why it had changed its plan.The answer came in a letter from the federal Office of Personnel Management, which negotiates with health insurers in the plan her husband has as a federal employee. Kaiser classifies drugs like Copaxone as specialty drugs. They, the letter said, “are high-cost drugs used to treat relatively few people suffering from complex conditions like anemia, cancer, hemophilia, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and human growth hormone deficiency.”And Kaiser, the agency added, had made a convincing argument that charging a percentage of the cost of these drugs “helped lower the rates for federal employees.”Ms. Steinwand can change plans at the end of the year, choosing one that allows her to pay $20 for the Copaxone, but she worries about whether that will help. “I am a little nervous,” she said. “Will the next company follow suit next year?”But it turns out that she won’t have to worry, at least for the rest of this year.A Kaiser spokeswoman, Sandra R. Gregg, said on Friday that Kaiser had decided to suspend the change for the program involving federal employees in the mid-Atlantic region while it reviewed the new policy. The suspension will last for the rest of the year, she said. Ms. Steinwand and others who paid the new price for their drugs will be repaid the difference between the new price and the old co-payment.Ms. Gregg explained that Kaiser had been discussing the new pricing plan with the Office of Personnel Management over the previous few days because patients had been raising questions about it. That led to the decision to suspend the changed pricing system.“Letters will go out next week,” Ms. Gregg said.But some with the new plans say they have no way out.Julie Bass, who lives near Orlando, Fla., has metastatic breast cancer, lives on Social Security disability payments, and because she is disabled, is covered by insurance through a Medicare H.M.O. Ms. Bass, 52, said she had no alternatives to her H.M.O. She said she could not afford a regular Medicare plan, which has co-payments of 20 percent for such things as emergency care, outpatient surgery and scans. That left her with a choice of two Medicare H.M.O’s that operate in her region. But of the two H.M.O’s, her doctors accept only Wellcare.Now, she said, one drug her doctor may prescribe to control her cancer is Tykerb. But her insurer, Wellcare, classifies it as Tier 4, and she knows she cannot afford it.Wellcare declined to say what Tykerb might cost, but its list price according to a standard source, Red Book, is $3,480 for 150 tablets, which may last a patient 21 days. Wellcare requires patients to pay a third of the cost of its Tier 4 drugs.“For everybody in my position with metastatic breast cancer, there are times when you are stable and can go off treatment,” Ms. Bass said. “But if we are progressing, we have to be on treatment, or we will die.”“People’s eyes need to be opened,” she said. “They need to understand that these drugs are very costly, and there are a lot of people out there who are struggling with these costs.”'"
"'08-04-14,'0','Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said the food crisis posed questions about the survivability of democracy and political regimes.“As we know in the past, sometimes those questions lead to war,” he said. “We now need to devote 100 percent of our time to these questions.”World Bank and I.M.F. officials noted that political instability had already hit countries as disparate as Haiti, Egypt, the Philippines and Indonesia because of food shortages, forcing some countries to limit food exports.Mr. Zoellick had earlier highlighted the food issue in speeches and presentations this weekend, saying the World Bank intended not only to help with the emergency situation but also to upgrade programs to help countries produce more food on their own. He cited Malawi, in southern Africa, as a country that has started going in that direction.But food has also become a symbol of the conflicting pressures that frequently emerge at the semiannual gatherings of finance and development officials and central bankers that take place in Washington every spring.Some ministers from poor countries, for example, are growing impatient with the way the West is addressing global warming by subsidizing and encouraging conversion of corn, sugar cane and other food products into substitutes for oil. The shift is helping to drive up prices, they say.Mr. Strauss-Kahn said he had heard from many financial officials this weekend that the West’s focus on fuel, at the expense of food, was a “crime against humanity.” Though he noted that the I.M.F. is primarily a monetary and financial agency, he said it would try to “review its tools” to help countries pay for food imports.In addition, many ministers meeting here appeared to be self-conscious about how much of the attention at the meeting has focused on the global credit crisis, which has caused hundreds of billions of dollars in losses for banks and investment banks, while there was less focus on the problem of feeding the world’s poor.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said on Friday that the subject of food shortages had come up at the meeting of finance ministers of the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan under the heading of the Group of Seven.“Every country sitting around the table was focused on it,” Mr. Paulson said of the Group of Seven’s concern about food, adding that Mr. Zoellick “made an impassioned plea.” But Treasury officials said they had no details of what aid the United States was prepared to commit.'"

Calling it “a new and monumental landmark,” King Harald V formally inaugurated the $840 million white marble structure, above, on the shore of the Oslo Fjord in the heart of the capital. On hand for the two-and-a-half-hour performance at the new home for the Norwegian Opera and Ballet was an invited audience that included Queen Sonja of Norway, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.

"'08-04-14,'0','John McCain says the “McCain Girls,” a trio of singing and dancing campaign supporters, are wonderful and entertaining.Given his flair for irony, it’s a little hard to tell whether he gets the joke.The McCain Girls videos, which were posted on YouTube last month with no clues about their provenance, are clearly meant to be imitations of — or parodies of — the “Obama Girl” videos, which themselves are parodies (right?).While the Obama Girl looks like a pinup and sings catchy tunes, the McCain Girls could not be confused with fashion models or pop music stars. Their first video, “Raining McCain,” set to the tune of “It’s Raining Men,” was posted on YouTube four weeks ago. A sample lyric: “In the 2008 election, the forecast calls for rain; the first time in history, it’s gonna start raining McCain.”That video recorded more than 1.6 million views and earned mentions on CNN and on ABC’s “Good Morning America,” with people alternately mocking it and wondering who was responsible. The singers seemed intentionally bad, which led many bloggers and YouTube commenters to assume that it was meant to insult Mr. McCain. The liberal blog Eschaton put it this way: “I believe the YouTube era begins the age when it is impossible to tell parody/irony/performance art from completely sincere product.”Drum roll, please: The creators of the McCain Girls turn out to be the comedy team behind 23/6, a five-month-old Web site owned by an affiliate of IAC/InterActiveCorp that parodies the news. The site, at 236.com, uses the motto “Some of the news, most of the time.”Indeed, the videos’ makers say they were trying to tread the line between sincerity and irony.“We wanted to parody the campaign-song phenomenon,” said Sarah Bernard, the president of 23/6. Because most of the so-called stars of YouTube are amateurs, the comedy site decided to take no credit for its creation.Jon Benjamin, a contributor to 23/6 who produced the “Raining McCain” video, had watched some of the more earnest campaign songs online. Recalling one particular video, an elaborate choir production called “Hillary4U&Me,” “it just looked like somebody paid them money to do it,” he said.'"
"'08-04-14,'0','PARIS — Prodded by the music industry and government, some Internet service providers are reluctantly exploring the adoption of a shunning ritual as 21st century punishment: banishing errant online users.But even as service providers test “three strikes” warning systems that can result in the disconnection of Internet users who are thought to have illegally downloaded copyrighted music or movies, resistance is building.Lawmakers in the European Parliament, in a symbolic vote Thursday, expressed their opposition to the approach, which has been championed by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and explored by governments of other countries. Consumer groups are also fighting such proposals.“It’s a breach of our civil liberties,” said Christofer Fjellner, a Swedish legislator in the Parliament who sponsored the vote.The notion of turning service providers into copyright cops has been gathering momentum since November, when Mr. Sarkozy announced the French plan, which was negotiated with the record industry and Internet providers. If the plan is approved in Parliament, service providers would cooperate with a new independent authority to identify and warn pirates, who could eventually be cut off from the Web.The proposed law is expected to be introduced into the French Parliament in May.Consumer groups say that the approach has been crossing national borders largely because of lobbying by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, which represents the recording industry in 73 countries.'"
"'08-04-14,'0','Google and Salesforce.com, two of Microsoft’s most conspicuous rivals, are expanding a 10-month-old collaboration in an effort to accelerate their sales of customer management and office software to businesses.On Monday, the two companies will announce that they have integrated Salesforce’s customer relationship management software and Google’s suite of office productivity applications, which includes e-mail, word processing and spreadsheets programs, into a single software package.Like most of the software the two companies create, the package will not require a download or installation, but rather will be delivered as a service over the Web.The offering will compete with Microsoft’s customer relationship management software, which is integrated with the its Office suite. The alliance could help Google, whose productivity programs are used largely by individuals, make inroads into businesses, where it is seeking to challenge Microsoft’s multibillion-dollar Office franchise.Already customers of Google’s and Salesforce’s programs can use them side by side. But Dave Girouard, Google’s vice president and general manager, said the integrated offering would bring users new functions.'"
"'08-04-14,'0','However, American and Iraqi officials say the arrival of the security forces in larger numbers has restored order to the streets and the nearby ports vital to Iraq’s oil industry.The clashes in Basra pitted the country’s two most powerful Shiite forces against each other: the Mahdi Army and the government security forces dominated by Mr. Sadr’s most powerful Shiite rival, the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq.The clashes also spilled over into the Iraqi capital, 300 miles north of Basra, particularly in Mr. Sadr’s stronghold, Sadr City, which is surrounded by Iraqi and American soldiers.Sadr City has been effectively divided in two since American and Iraqi troops moved into the southern edge of the district to stop rocket fire aimed at Baghdad’s high-security Green Zone. The rest of Sadr City is still under the control of the Mahdi Army and its allies in the heavily infiltrated police and security forces.Sadr City, a large and overwhelmingly Shiite urban sprawl of cheap housing and open street markets, has long presented a major security problem for the Americans and Iraqis, with ambushes and roadside bombs a favorite tactic.Last week, reporters saw Mahdi fighters burying artillery shells in the road as bombs to use against government forces if they pushed farther into the Mahdi-held areas. Those preparations continued in recent days as the militia appeared to be setting up an elaborate network of booby traps.On Sunday, wires from roadside buildings were visible leading to newly dug strips in a major road, in some places about every 100 feet.Mr. Sadr’s office in Sadr City would not allow Western journalists to enter the district on Sunday, refusing to give an explanation.Some Iraqi policemen were seen evacuating their stations from the area now controlled by government forces. On Saturday, police pickup trucks loaded with furniture, office materials and clothes headed out of Sadr City, along two exit routes.The reason for their departure was unclear. Some said they had been ordered out because their loyalties had been questioned, and others because the army wanted to use their buildings.Iraqi soldiers staffing one southern checkpoint confirmed that they had seen the police departing.“We have taken the police stations in the area that is under our control,” said one soldier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release information.One of his colleagues said that as the police drove past their position, they shouted complaints that the army “is pushing us out of our bases and our stations.”The soldier said that they said, “The government is dealing with us as if we were terrorists, and we are honest people.”The Iraqi government is being careful to portray the crackdown as an operation against criminals and illegally armed militias and not against Mr. Sadr’s forces, although the Mahdi Army is the most powerful armed force in Sadr City.Sadrists say Prime Minister Maliki and his American and Iraqi allies are using the pursuit of criminals as a pretext to weaken the Sadrist movement before coming elections.Ali al-Dabbagh, an Iraqi government spokesman, said he would not say “how many days or how many months” the government troops would continue their operations in Sadr City, but said “they will not come out until they are finished.”The United States military said that one of its Hellfire missiles had accidentally hit an American vehicle in the eastern district of New Baghdad on April 12, wounding three Iraqi civilians and two American soldiers. A statement in Baghdad said that a first missile had hit its intended target, killing two members of a team planting a bomb, but that the second “overshot,” setting fire to the vehicle and nearby houses. It said investigators were examining the cause of the “misfire.”An Iraqi judicial panel dismissed the last remaining criminal charge against a photographer for The Associated Press, Bilal Hussein, on Sunday, and ordered him released from custody, two years after he was detained by the United States military, The Associated Press reported.The committee said there should be no further action on allegations that Mr. Hussein, 36, may have had improper contacts with insurgents. In December 2004, Mr. Hussein and two other journalists were stopped by armed men and taken at gunpoint to photograph a body propped up with armed insurgents standing over it.Mr. Hussein has maintained his innocence and has said he was only doing the work of a news photographer in a war zone.Asked about the ruling, the United States military had no immediate comment. Previously, spokesmen had said officials would review the panel’s orders before deciding whether to release him.'"
"'08-04-14,'0','Stockyard denizens in blue blazers and in Carhartt overalls, in fine cowboy hats and in cheap baseball caps, pause in the gray morning cold to talk memories and to sell memorabilia. They assure one another that they’ll soon be catching up at Minnesota auctions in Albany and Zumbrota. But mostly they just wait to buy and sell and ship and talk and do the business of livestock.Here is John Barber, big and strong and 69, the yard’s main auctioneer for nearly four decades. What a voice he has, so deep and soothing that you want to bid on something, anything: Would there be room for a heifer in the apartment? He lubricates his throat with apple juice and Halls cough drops and says he doesn’t use a lot of filler words when singing his auction song because he doesn’t want to confuse people.But that voice breaks a bit when he talks about this day. His wife, Toots, works here as a clerk, and so did his three daughters, and so did his father, Bob, hauling livestock. When Mr. Barber was a boy, he would ride in the cab of his father’s Mack truck for those 150-mile night rides from Milroy — and then they were here, father and son, in the roiling, toiling, raucous yards.His father died not long ago at 93, he says. “You have to think about him” on this day, he says. And the slightest drop in that mellifluous voice tells you it’s time to talk about something else.And here is David Krueger, 50, in bib overalls, and his son, Paul, 27, in bib overalls, two farmers who know the stockyards as well as they know their own spread in nearby Hastings. The Krueger name goes back a long ways here, so much so that when they’re selling their livestock, Mr. Barber always calls it “reputation cattle,” and people know what that means.The Kruegers have donated a 900-pound heifer to be the last cow auctioned at the stockyards, with the sale proceeds going to an agricultural scholarship fund. Its father was a Simmental named Red Rock, and its mother was a Black Angus named, simply, N501 Commercial. As for its own name, chosen well before its historical role was determined: Timeless.Why the donation? Simple, says David Krueger: “To say we had the last one.”To understand their desire to claim this honor, you need only walk up the 18 rusty steps to the catwalk that stretches over acres of open-air pens brimming with snorting, urinating, defecating cattle — a black-white-brown sea surrendering puffs of steam from wet hides, and the occasional yardman shout of Hey! Hey! Hey!Hands inside his overalls, the elder Krueger wonders aloud about fortunes made and lost on these grounds, the packing companies come and gone, the characters who haunted Hog Alley and Sheep Alley. He wonders how many animals have moved through here since the yards opened.A mind-twisting sort of answer is contained in a stockyard brochure commemorating the end of this era: “If the 300 million head of livestock that came to the South St. Paul Stockyards since its opening in 1887 were placed head-to-tail, they would form a line 248,560 miles long that would extend around the earth at the equator more than 10 times.”Yes, but who would clean up afterward?The catwalk leads for the last time this gray day to the sales barn, a half-arena facing a ring covered with wood shavings as fine as beach sand. For the first part of the morning the stockyards have been auctioning off memorabilia to a standing-room-only crowd. A Ziploc bag of 10 pencils bearing the names of livestock-broker companies long gone goes for $180.“Folks, if you have a question, just raise your hand,” one of the auctioneers, Lyle Bostrom, jokes. “We’ll get right to ya.”After a while Mr. Barber reclaims his seat, signaling that the final cattle auction is about to begin. All that livestock from Minnesota and Wisconsin, unloaded from trucks and herded into pens, now to be rushed into the arena for some momentary preening, bought, rushed out, loaded up and carted away.At the same time there comes the smell of cooking beef — free hamburgers! — to settle over the arena and pens, and to underscore the fate of at least some of those gathered here.Mr. Barber gives a verbal tip of the Stetson to the Minnesota Beef Council, and to Barb, the owner of the stockyards cafe: “Stop in there, and Barb’ll fix ya up.” Then, with nothing else to say, he begins his auction song, a tongue-dancing scat of words and numbers that thwarts translation.He sings to the cattle trotting into the arena 10 and 20 at a time, many of them relieving themselves to convey what they think of the honor. He sings to the audience, from the old farmhand who keeps his callused hands down to the rich buyer who bids with mere flicks of a finger.He sings to the Kruegers in the pens, to Barb in the cafe, to Toots in the back and his girls far away. To his father. He sings with a voice steady and strong, as if he’s afraid to stop. As if the sheer force of his song can hold off the entrance of the final cow, the one called Timeless.'"
"'08-04-14,'0','Besides pirated DVD copies of first-run films, copies are also available online for illegal downloading, mainly through peer-to-peer file-sharing networks. High-definition camcorders, some not much bigger than a cellphone, can copy films from a movie screen with little loss of detail.No one can measure piracy accurately, given the nature of the business, but a study by the Motion Picture Association of America found that in 2005, $18.2 billion was lost through piracy by producers, distributors, theaters, video stores and pay-per-view operators around the world.“Retailers do not believe piracy is at a maintenance level,” said Bo Andersen, president of the Entertainment Merchants Association, a home entertainment trade group.No one expects to eliminate piracy. But given that a film’s opening weekend often accounts for 60 to 70 percent of the theatrical earnings, a few days’ delay in the availability of pirated copies can make a big financial difference.“In three years, the date that pirated copies of major motion pictures became available has gone from, at times, weeks before a theatrical release, to days after,” said Darcy Antonellis, Warner Brothers Entertainment’s head of technical operations.Surprisingly in this digital age, piracy in large part remains an amateurish operation. According to Michael Robinson, vice president and director of North American antipiracy operations for the M.P.A.A., 90 percent of new movie releases that are pirated are recorded with a camcorder. The industry employs monitors who use night-vision equipment to see pirates in action, and theater owners pay employees up to $500 for catching a surreptitious recorder in the act.Putting aside the fear of discovery and a federal conviction, an individual typically sits in a movie theater with a miniature tripod wedged into the cup holder and simply tapes the projected film. To improve the sound, a pirate might plug the camera into the theater’s audio system intended for the hearing-impaired.And as high-definition camcorders get cheaper, pirated copies get better. Today, high-definition camcorders from companies like Aiptek can be bought for as little as $130. Copies are then hawked on DVD or uploaded to file-sharing Web sites. Web distribution reduces the criminal’s capital outlay to near zero.Yet for those who do not share videos freely, one recording of a movie can sell for hundreds of dollars, even thousands, if it is a good copy of a popular movie that just opened in theaters.Various technologies to prevent such recording have been developed, but none have succeeded. In 2003, Cinea, a digital content security company in Reston, Va., received a federal grant to work on one such approach, but the company has abandoned its efforts, concerned that its approach could be foiled by determined pirates.But technology is helping those who wish to stop movie-sharing. Various technologies, which the industry prefers not to discuss, allow law enforcement to pinpoint which theaters have been used to create a pirated copy. As more theaters use digital projection, even the screen used can often be identified.A number of companies have developed technologies to identify pirated files, as well as the Internet protocol addresses of individuals who download those files.BayTSP, based in Los Gatos, Calif., and MediaSentry in Morristown, N.J., use proprietary technology to get the digital addresses of those who download illegal files. That information is given to the Internet service provider, which can ask the customer to stop. When flagged users try to download again, BayTSP identifies them as recidivists.“We have captured 12 to 18 million unique copyright violations and sent millions of cease-and-desist letters,” said Mark M. Ishikawa, BayTSP’s chief executive.Legal action has closed some sites that connect users with pirated movies. The M.P.A.A. won its battle with TorrentSpy, a peer-to-peer site that is now closed. But The Pirate Bay, a similar service based in Sweden, is still running. The Pirate Bay says it is merely a platform and is neither uploading nor downloading proprietary content.Troma Entertainment is fighting back with humor. Its new movie, “Poultrygeist: Night of the Chicken Dead,” is not due out till May, but apparently pirated copies are already online.The company hopes to flood download sites with fakes. Says Troma’s president, Lloyd Kaufman: “We’ll combine five minutes of the film with an old Tarzan movie and we’ll see what happens.”'"

"'08-04-15,'1','Economic policy is not just some academic exercise, and we in Washington are not just passive spectators. We have a responsibility to act -- and if I am elected president I intend to act quickly and decisively. We need reforms that promote growth and opportunity. We need rules that assure fairness and punish wrongdoing in the market. We need tax policies that respect the wage-earners and job creators who make this economy run, and help them to succeed in a global economy. In all of this, it will not be enough to simply dust off the economic policies of four, eight, or twenty-eight years ago. We have our own work to do. We have our own challenges to meet.Millions of working men and women in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and beyond can tell you how urgent is the work before us. One man put it this way to a reporter not long ago, in reply to a question about the job he had just lost. He said, ""I told my wife that I'll always keep a roof over her head. Now, I worry about keeping that promise."" In the monthly reports of our Labor Department, nearly 250,000 Americans like this man were let go recently and suddenly from jobs they thought were safe.A woman in the town of Trainer, in Delaware County, also captured the feeling of many when she described what it's like to work and save for years, and, at the age of 47, still struggle for the basics of life. The family has had medical problems, and as she puts it: ""Trust me, no one wants to be in our shoes. And lots of people are just a sick husband away from where we are."" For citizens like these -- doing their best to keep promises and meet obligations, there is no comfort knowing their problems are common and their worries are shared.Meanwhile, the people we expect to be most sober and level-headed in their economic decisions -- bankers and other home lenders -- forgot some of the basic standards of their own profession. Hard-working homeowners are learning for the first time about the endlessly complicated borrowing, bundling, and betting that has been going on in our capital markets. Americans worry about a system that allows 4 million bad loans to affect 51 million good ones. They wonder how assets can so quickly become liabilities, and why the high-risk schemes of a few were permitted to inflict such grievous harm on our entire financial system.Americans are also right to be offended when the extravagant salaries and severance deals of CEO's -- in some cases, the very same CEO's who helped to bring on these market troubles -- bear no relation to the success of the company or the wishes of shareholders. Something is seriously wrong when the American people are left to bear the consequences of reckless corporate conduct, while Mr. Cayne of Bear Stearns, Mr. Mozilo of Countrywide, and others are packed off with another forty- or fifty million for the road.I leave it for others to speculate on the technical definition of a recession. It's all a little beside the point, if it's your plant that's closing and your job that's gone... when you are facing foreclosure, or back in debt after years of hard effort, or hardly able to buy food, gas, or heating for your home. In the end, the truest measure of prosperity in America is the success and financial security of those who earn wages and meet payrolls in this country. Many are waiting for their first homes... their first big break... their first shot at financial security. And helping them will be my first priority in setting the economic policies of this nation.In so many ways, even now, the workers and entrepreneurs of America are taken for granted by their government, while the lobbyists and special pleaders are seldom turned away. By the tens of billions of dollars, our tax money is routinely squandered by the Congress on less than useless pork-barrel projects -- projects having nothing to do with the purposes of government, and everything to do with the preservation of power.In the same way, many in Congress think Americans are under-taxed. They speak as if letting you keep your own earnings were an act of charity, and now they have decided you've had enough. By allowing many of the current low tax rates to expire, they would impose -- overnight -- the single largest tax increase since the Second World War. Among supporters of a tax increase are Senators Obama and Clinton. Both promise big ""change."" And a trillion dollars in new taxes over the next decade would certainly fit that description.Of course, they would like you to think that only the very wealthy will pay more in taxes, but the reality is quite different. Under my opponents' various tax plans, Americans of every background would see their taxes rise -- seniors, parents, small business owners, and just about everyone who has even a modest investment in the market. All these tax increases are the fine print under the slogan of ""hope"": They're going to raise your taxes by thousands of dollars per year -- and they have the audacity to hope you don't mind.They and others argue that the tax increase is necessary in part to finance Social Security and Medicare. Unfortunately, this claim only serves to remind us of Congress' consistent failure to repair both of these programs even under the best of circumstances. For years, Congress has been buying time, and leaving the great challenge of entitlement reform for others to deal with. And now the two contenders in the other party have even proposed enormous new federal commitments before the old commitments have been kept -- trusting that others, somewhere down the road, will handle the financing and make all the numbers come out right.But there will come a day when the road dead-ends, and the old excuses seem even more hollow. And it won't be the politicians who bear the consequences. It will be American workers and their children who are left with worthless promises and trillion-dollar debts. We cannot let that happen. And you have my pledge: as president I will work with every member of Congress -- Republican, Democrat, and Independent -- who shares my commitment to reforming and protecting Medicare and Social Security.In so many ways, we need to make a clean break from the worst excesses of both political parties. For Republicans, it starts with reclaiming our good name as the party of spending restraint. Somewhere along the way, too many Republicans in Congress became indistinguishable from the big-spending Democrats they used to oppose. The only power of government that could stop them was the power of veto, and it was rarely used.If that authority is entrusted to me, I will use the veto as needed, and as the Founders intended. I will veto every bill with earmarks, until the Congress stops sending bills with earmarks. I will seek a constitutionally valid line-item veto to end the practice once and for all. I will lead across-the-board reforms in the federal tax code, removing myriad corporate tax loopholes that are costly, unfair, and inconsistent with a free-market economy.As president, I will also order a prompt and thorough review of the budgets of every federal program, department, and agency. While that top to bottom review is underway, we will institute a one-year pause in discretionary spending increases with the necessary exemption of military spending and veterans benefits. ""Discretionary spending"" is a term people throw around a lot in Washington, while actual discretion is seldom exercised. Instead, every program comes with a built-in assumption that it should go on forever, and its budget increase forever. My administration will change that way of thinking.I'll hold the agencies of the federal government accountable for the money they spend. I'll make sure the public helps me, and I'll provide federal agencies with the best executive leadership that can be found in America. We're going to make every aspect of government purchases and performance transparent. Information on every step of contracts and grants will be posted on the Internet in plain and simple English. We're going to post an agency's performance evaluation as well. We're going to demand accountability. We will make sure that federal spending serves the common interests... that failed programs are not rewarded... and that discretionary spending is going where it belongs -- to essential priorities like job training, the security of our citizens, and the care of our veterans.In my administration there will be no more subsidies for special pleaders -- no more corporate welfare -- no more throwing around billions of dollars of the people's money on pet projects, while the people themselves are struggling to afford their homes, groceries, and gas. We are going to get our priorities straight in Washington -- a clean break from years of squandered wealth and wasted chances.I have a clear record of not asking for earmarks for my state. For their part, Senators Obama and Clinton have championed a long list of pork-barrel projects for their states -- like that all-important Woodstock museum that Senator Clinton expected Americans to pay for at the cost of a million dollars. That kind of careless spending of tax dollars is not change, my friends: It is business as usual in Washington, and it's all a part of the same wasteful and corrupting system that we need to end.The goal of reform, however, is not merely to check waste and keep a tidy budget process -- although these are important enough in themselves. The great goal is to get the American economy running at full strength again, creating the opportunities Americans expect and the jobs Americans need. And one very direct way to achieve that is by taking the savings from earmark, program review, and other budget reforms -- on the order of 100 billion dollars annually -- and use those savings to lower the business income tax for every employer that pays it.So I will send to Congress a proposal to cut the taxes these employers pay, from a rate of 35 to 25 percent. As it is, we have the second-highest tax on business in the industrialized world. High tax rates are driving many businesses and jobs overseas -- and, of course, our foreign competitors wouldn't mind if we kept it that way. But if I am elected president, we're going to get rid of that drag on growth and job creation, and help American workers compete with any company in the world.I will also send to the Congress a middle-class tax cut -- a complete phase-out of the Alternative Minimum Tax to save more than 25 million middle-class families more than 2,000 dollars every year.Our tax laws and those who enforce them should treat all citizens with respect, whether they are married or single. But mothers and fathers bear special responsibilities, and the tax code must recognize this. Inflation has eroded the value of the exemption for dependents. I will send to Congress a reform to increase the exemption -- with the goal of doubling it from 3,500 dollars to 7,000 dollars for every dependent, in every family in America.The tax laws of America should also promote and reward innovation, because innovation creates jobs. Tax laws should not smother the ingenuity of our people with needless regulations and disincentives. So I will propose and sign into law a reform agenda to permit the first-year expensing of new equipment and technology... to ban Internet taxes, permanently... to ban new cell phone taxes... and to make the tax credit for R&D permanent, so that we never lose our competitive edge.It is not enough, however, to make little fixes here and there in the tax code. What we need is a simpler, a flatter, and a fair tax code. As president, I will propose an alternative tax system. When this reform is enacted, all who wish to file under the current system could still do so. And everyone else could choose a vastly less complicated system with two tax rates and a generous standard deduction. Americans do not resent paying their rightful share of taxes -- what they do resent is being subjected to thousands of pages of needless and often irrational rules and demands from the IRS. We know from experience that no serious reform of the current tax code will come out of Congress, so now it is time to turn the decision over to the people. We are going to create a new and simpler tax system -- and give the American people a choice.Better tax policy is just one part of a pro-growth agenda that includes smarter regulation and a leaner, more focused government. Among the many benefits to America, these reforms will help to create jobs, improve the investment climate, attract global investors, and strengthen the dollar.Americans also worry about stagnant wages, which are caused in part by the rising cost of health care. Each year employers pay more and more for insurance, leaving less and less to pay their employees. As president, I will propose and relentlessly advocate changes that will bring down health care costs, make health care more affordable and accessible, help individuals and families buy their health insurance with generous tax credits, and enable you to keep your insurance when you change jobs.Many retired Americans face the terrible reality of deciding whether to buy food, pay rent or buy their prescriptions. And their government should help them. But when we added the prescription drug benefit to Medicare, a new and costly entitlement, we included many people who are more than capable of purchasing their own medicine without assistance from taxpayers who struggle to purchase their own. People like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet don't need their prescriptions underwritten by taxpayers. Those who can afford to buy their own prescription drugs should be expected to do so. This reform alone will save billions of dollars that could be returned to taxpayers or put to better use.There's never been a problem Americans couldn't solve. We are the world's leaders, and leaders don't fear change, pine for the past and dread the future. We make the future better than the past. That is why I object when Senators Obama and Clinton and others preach the false virtues of economic isolationism. Senator Obama recently suggested that Americans are protectionist because they are bitter about being left behind in the global economy. Well, what's his excuse for embracing the false promises of protectionism? Opening new markets for American goods and services is indispensable to our future prosperity. We can compete with anyone. Senators Obama and Clinton think we should hide behind walls, bury our heads and industries in the sand, and hope we have enough left to live on while the world passes us by. But that is not good policy and it is not good leadership. And the short-sightedness of these policies can be seen today in Congress' refusal to vote on the Colombian Free Trade Agreement.When new trading partners can sell in our market, and American companies can sell in theirs, the gains are great and they are lasting. The strength of the American economy offers a better life to every society we trade with, and the good comes back to us in many ways -- in better jobs, higher wages, and lower prices. Free trade can also give once troubled and impoverished nations a stake in the world economy, and in their relations with America. In the case of Colombia, a friend and crucial democratic ally, its stability and economic vitality are more critical now, as others in the region seek to turn Latin America away from democracy and away from our country. Trade serves all of these national interests, and the interests of the American economy as well -- and I call on the Congress once again to put this vital agreement to an up or down vote.I know that open markets don't automatically translate into a higher quality of life for every single American. Change is hard, and while most of us gain, some industries, companies and workers are left to struggle with very difficult choices. And government should help workers get the education and training they need -- for the new jobs that will be created by new businesses in this new century.Right now we have more than a half-dozen different programs that are supposed to help displaced workers, and for those who are not working at all. We have an unemployment insurance program straight out of the 1950s. It was designed to assist workers through a few tough months during an economic downturn until their old jobs came back. That program has no relevance to the world we live in today.If I'm elected president, I'll work with Congress and the states to make job training and unemployment insurance what they should be -- a swift path from a job that's not coming back to a job that won't go away. We will build a new system, using the unemployment-insurance taxes to build for each worker a buffer account against a sudden loss of income -- so that in times of need they're not just told to fill out forms and take a number. And we will draw on the great strengths of America's community colleges, applying the funds from federal training accounts to give displaced workers of every age a fresh start with new skills and new opportunities.These reforms must wait on the next election, but to help our workers and our economy we must also act in the here and now. And we must start with the subprime mortgage crisis, with the hundreds of thousands of citizens who played by the rules, yet now fear losing their houses. Under the HOME plan I have proposed, our government will offer these Americans direct and immediate help that can make all the difference: If you can't make your payments, and you're in danger of foreclosure, you will be able to go to any Post Office and pick up a form for a new HOME loan. In place of your flawed mortgage loan, you'll be eligible for a new, 30-year fixed-rate loan backed by the United States government. Citizens will keep their homes, lenders will cut their losses, and everyone will move on -- following the sounder practices that should have been observed in the first place.It's important as well to remember that the foolish risk-taking of lenders, investment banks, and others that led to these troubles don't reflect our free market as it should be working. In a free market, there must be transparency, accountability, and personal and corporate responsibility. The housing crisis came about because these standards collapsed -- and, as president, I intend to restore them.The grave problems in the housing market have been viral, spreading out to affect the credit and buying power of Americans even as the price of oil and gas is rising as never before. There are larger problems underlying the price of oil, all of which I will address in my energy plan, but in the short term there are crucial measures we can take.I propose that the federal government suspend all taxes on gasoline now paid by the American people -- from Memorial Day to Labor Day of this year. The effect will be an immediate economic stimulus -- taking a few dollars off the price of a tank of gas every time a family, a farmer, or trucker stops to fill up. Over the same period, our government should suspend the purchase of oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which has also contributed to the rising price of oil. This measure, combined with the summer-long ""gas-tax holiday,"" will bring a timely reduction in the price of gasoline. And because the cost of gas affects the price of food, packaging, and just about everything else, these immediate steps will help to spread relief across the American economy.By summer's end, moreover, millions of college students will be counting on their student loans to come through -- and we need to make sure that happens. These young Americans, including perhaps some of you at CMU, are among the many citizens whose ability to obtain a loan might be seriously hurt by faraway problems not of their own making. So, today, I propose that the Department of Education work with the governors to make sure that each state's guarantee agency has the means and manpower to meet its obligation as a lender-of-last-resort for student loans. In the years ahead, these young Americans will be needed to sustain America's primacy in the global marketplace. And they should not be denied an education because the recklessness of others has made credit too hard to obtain.These are just some of the reforms I intend to fight for and differences I will debate with whoever my Democratic opponent is. In the weeks and months ahead, I will detail my plans to reform health care in America... to make our schools more accountable to parents and taxpayers... to keep America's edge in technology... to use the power of free markets to grow our economy... to escape our dependence on foreign oil... and to guard against climate change and to be better stewards of the earth. All of these challenges, and more, will face the next president, and I will not leave them for some unluckier generation of leaders to deal with. We are going to restore the confidence of the American people in the future of this great and blessed country.I do not seek the presidency on the presumption that I am blessed with such personal greatness that history has anointed me to save my country in its hour of need. I seek the presidency with the humility of a man who cannot forget that my country saved me. I am running to serve America, and to champion the ideas I believe will help us do what every American generation has done: to make in our time, and from our challenges, a safer, stronger, more prosperous country and a better world.As I have always done, I will make my case to every American who will listen. I will not confine myself to the comfort of speaking only to those who agree with me. I will make my case to all the people. I will listen to those who disagree. I will try to persuade them. I will debate. And I will learn from them. But I will fight every moment of every day for what I believe is right for this country, and I will not yield.'"

"'08-04-15,'1','Officials who took the children into state custody sent many of their mothers away on Monday. Of the 139 women who voluntarily left the compound with their children since the raid, only those with children 4 or younger were allowed to continue staying with them, said Marissa Gonzales, a spokeswoman for Child Protective Services. She said she did not know how many women stayed.“It is not the normal practice to allow parents to accompany the child when an abuse allegation is made,” Ms. Gonzales said.The women were given a choice: Return to the Eldorado ranch or go to another safe location. Some women chose the other location, Ms. Gonzales said.The courtroom conference on Monday was held to work out the ground rules for a court hearing starting Thursday on the fate of the children. The state is accusing the sect of physically and sexually abusing the children and wants to strip their parents of custody and place the children in foster care or put them up for adoption.The judge made no immediate decisions on how the hearing would be carried out. The sheer numbers raised logistical challenges. “It would seem inefficient to have a witness testify 416 times,” Judge Walther said.Texas bar officials said that more than 350 lawyers from across the state had volunteered to represent the children free of charge. The mothers who voluntarily left the sect to be with their children might also hire lawyers, to help them fight for custody.Betty Balli Torres, executive director of the Texas Access to Justice Foundation, said it was vital that the mothers be represented by lawyers. Otherwise, they could lose their children, she said, in “what we call kind of the death penalty of family law cases.”Ms. Torres said 10 women went to the San Angelo legal aid office last week seeking help and reported that 100 more women needed lawyers. Lawyers began meeting with the women over the weekend.A church lawyer, Rod Parker, said the 60 or so men remaining on the 1,700-acre ranch had offered to leave the compound if the state would allow the women and children to return with child welfare monitors. The Children’s Protective Services agency said it had not seen the letter containing the offer.The sect practices polygamy in arranged marriages between under-age girls and older men. The group has thousands of followers in two side-by-side towns in Arizona and Utah. The sect’s leader, Warren S. Jeffs, is in prison for forcing an under-age girl into a marriage in Utah.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','SAN FRANCISCO — Intel, the biggest semiconductor maker, reported solid global demand for its chips, soothing investor concerns that economic softness would rattle the technology industry.The company reported that net income in the first quarter dropped 12 percent to $1.4 billion, or 25 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter. The company said revenue improved 9 percent to $9.7 billion. Operating income, before the costs of restructuring and asset impairment charges, was $2.1 billion or 23 percent above the same quarter last year.The net income was in line with expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected 25 cents a share and revenue of $9.63 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Financial.Paul Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, was upbeat about the company’s prospects and the economy. He said in a statement that the results showed “a solid global market environment,” adding that, “We remain optimistic about our growth opportunities.”Shares of Intel rose about 1 percent to close at $20.91 in regular trading, before the report was issued. Stock rose sharply in after-hours trading, moving as high as $22.19.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','The darker outlook prompted the International Energy Agency, a forecaster for developed countries, to cut its estimates for global oil demand this year by nearly half a million barrels a day. The energy agency expects oil consumption to grow by 1.3 million barrels a day in 2008, to 87.2 million barrels a day. That is 460,000 barrels a day less than its previous forecast.Higher energy costs are hurting business and consumers alike, and are adding up to the woes of an economy already ailing from a housing slump and a financial crisis. As a result, many analysts expect gasoline consumption to drop this year. The United States is the world’s top oil consumer, accounting for nearly a quarter of global demand.Oil producers are also facing a tougher time increasing their supplies. Russia’s production is reaching a plateau after its post-Soviet recovery, for example. Mexico’s production is declining because of insufficient investments by its state-owned oil company, Pemex.But this week also brought some potentially positive news for the future growth in supplies. The head of Brazil’s national oil agency suggested the country had discovered a massive offshore oil field that could potentially be three times bigger than the country’s current proven reserves.But little relief is expected in the short term. OPEC does not want to step in and bring prices down by increasing its production, as it expects oil demand to fall in coming months. The oil group accounts for 40 percent of the world’s oil exports. Its members are not scheduled to meet until September.Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries consider the global market well stocked with oil — that there is no shortage anywhere — and that prices are being conditioned more by market psychology than fundamental factors.Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, suggested last week that the current oil prices had little to do with global supplies.“I am not going to pull back, I’m not going to dump crude on the market,” Mr. Naimi told reporters last week, according to Reuters.On Saturday, Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah also suggested that new oil discoveries in the kingdom would remain untapped to preserve the nation’s wealth for future generation, according to various wire reports. “Let them remain in the ground for our children and grandchildren who need them,” the king said in a speech, according the official Saudi Press Agency.In its latest monthly report, OPEC said on Tuesday that it expected global demand to fall 1.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, a period of the year when consumption in the northern hemisphere typically slows after demand for winter fuels falls.Analysts have also blamed a weak dollar for pushing up oil prices as investors seek to buy commodity assets to hedge against the falling value of the dollar, as well as rising inflation. The dollar has dropped against the euro because of concerns about the states of the American economy. It recently traded at $1.5811 against the euro, close to its lowest levels.“The financial investors are coming at you from the sovereign funds, hedge funds, pension funds, and commodity fund managers are all betting on the weak dollar,” said Lawrence Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. “This is now as much about the direction of the dollar as it is about the direction of oil.”'"
"'08-04-15,'1','“For the mechanism to work, China will have to seriously engage,” Mr. Mandelson told a conference of the China-Britain Business Council in London. “If they do not, they risk a lot more exhausted patience in Europe. And that patience, in some political markets, is already pretty thin.”With a vigorous debate over Tibet and China’s staging of the Olympic games, the visit next week to Beijing will take place at a sensitive moment.The size of the delegation illustrates the breadth of the relationship between China and the European Union. Mr. Mandelson’s remarks Tuesday concentrated both on the growing economic interdependence of China and Europe and on the long-running tensions between the two trading blocs.Climate change would be central to Mr. Barroso’s mission, Mr. Mandelson said, adding that China “needs to be a constructive part of a global strategy because it is becoming the largest emitter of greenhouse gasses.”But Mr. Mandelson also expressed frustration at Beijing’s failure to dismantle trade barriers, which he said cost European businesses more than 20 billion euros, or $31.5 billion a year.European services companies complain regularly about the difficulty of gaining access to the Chinese market.“In Europe, we face booming imports and constrained export growth,” Mr. Mandelson said. “That spells growing anxiety, and frustration,” he said. “The wave of Chinese investment on the horizon risks deepening those anxieties. Europeans will only accept an open trading and investment relationship with China — which we should welcome — if they feel that this relationship is a two-way street. We expect China to match our openness with openness of its own.”Though China seeks technology transfer, it cannot provide the legal protection, under intellectual property rights, to make this a viable proposition for foreign countries, he added.Because of the weakening of the dollar, Europe is absorbing more imports from China and wants to see a “gradual appreciation” of the Chinese currency, he added.But Mr. Mandelson also emphasized that it would be “catastrophic” if China turned its back on the international system.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','Businesses continued to grapple with steep inflation last month as oil and food costs hit record highs, leaving Federal Reserve policy makers in a difficult spot ahead of their meeting later this month.A gauge of prices paid by American producers jumped 1.1 percent in March, the Labor Department said on Tuesday, sharply accelerating from a 0.3 percent increase in February.The increase, led by a surge in gasoline and home heating oil prices, was twice what economists had expected.The higher prices put pressure on businesses to pass on costs to consumers, though some economists said the housing slump and weakening job market could discourage businesses from raising their prices on cash-strapped consumers.“Given the weak nature of domestic demand now and going forward, it is unlikely that businesses will have as much success raising prices at the consumer level as they did in the not too distant past,” wrote Joshua Shapiro, an economist at the research firm MFR, in a note to clients.'"

"'08-04-15,'1','Eugene Ehrlich, a self-educated lexicographer who wrote 40 dictionaries, thesauruses and phrase books for the “extraordinarily literate,” not to mention people just hoping to sound that way, died on April 5 at his home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. He was 85.His son Henry confirmed the death, saying he had been ill for some time.Mr. Ehrlich’s works included “The Highly Selective Thesaurus for the Extraordinarily Literate” (1994). Another book in 1997 substituted “Dictionary” for “Thesaurus” and kept all the other words in the title in the same order. Another substituted “Dictionary of Golden Adjectives” (2002).Mr. Ehrlich — who wrote from three million to five million words about words — made it clear that he thought defining everyday words with familiar meanings was a waste of time. In his preface to the “extraordinarily literate” dictionary, he said his higher mission was being the antidote to the “effects wrought by the forces of linguistic darkness.”He also liked the respect linguistic agility could bring. “He loved how it made him sound authoritative,” Henry Ehrlich said. So just as Winston Churchill mobilized the English language and sent it into battle, in Edward R. Murrow’s phrase, Mr. Ehrlich could be said to have armed the average guy with rare words, piquant phrases, Latin expressions and French witticisms to astound, confuse and bore acquaintances at cocktail parties and water coolers.In “Les Bons Mots, or How to Amaze Tout le Monde With Everyday French” (1997), he provided guidance for the person ignorant of French who wanted to use the Gallic phrase for “suck the pear,” meaning to kiss passionately.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','DETROIT — Chrysler and Nissan Motor of Japan said Monday that they had agreed to build vehicles for each other in a deal that could signal closer cooperation in the future.Chrysler, which is based in Auburn Hills, Mich., and has been cutting truck production as demand falls for less fuel-efficient vehicles, will make a full-size pickup based on the Dodge Ram for Nissan at a factory in Saltillo, Mexico. In turn, Nissan will assemble a small car for Chrysler in Oppama, Japan. Both vehicles will be sold in North America, though Chrysler plans to sell the car in Europe and other markets, too.Officials from both automakers said the deal was limited to these two products, but analysts say Chrysler and Nissan could eventually join forces in many areas of their operations to become more competitive. Nissan has expressed an interest in having a North American partner join its alliance with the French carmaker Renault, since talks with General Motors in 2006 were called off, and Chrysler is eager to expand its footprint outside North America.“Forging the right tactical partnerships is critical to the long-term success of Chrysler,” said Thomas W. LaSorda, Chrysler’s president and vice chairman. “Nissan has a proven track record in these win-win product exchanges with multiple manufacturers around the world.”Both vehicles will be designed by the companies that will ultimately sell them. Nissan will begin distributing the car in 2010, and Chrysler will start building the truck, which replaces the Nissan Titan, in 2011.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','WASHINGTON — Senator John McCain threw himself into the culture war between Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday. He said at a gathering of news executives that comments by Mr. Obama about working-class voters were “elitist” and a “fundamental contradiction of what I believe America’s all about.”Mr. McCain’s remarks were his first public comments on the issue since Mr. Obama told a group of wealthy donors on April 6 that small-town Pennsylvania voters, “bitter” over their economic circumstances, “cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them” as a way to explain their frustrations.The comments on Monday reflected the strategy of Mr. McCain and his advisers — similar to Mrs. Clinton’s tactics — to portray Mr. Obama as out of touch with ordinary Americans, particularly the white working-class voters whom Mrs. Clinton and Mr. McCain are wooing for November.Mr. McCain stopped short of calling Mr. Obama an elitist, although he did not show great warmth for him in a question-and-answer session after Mr. McCain’s formal remarks at the annual meeting of The Associated Press at the Washington Convention Center.The A.P. meeting coincides with the annual conferences of the Newspaper Association of America and the American Society of Newspaper Editors.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','A federal district judge sentenced Samuel Israel III, co-founder of a hedge fund, the Bayou Group, now defunct, to 20 years in prison on Monday for his role in a scheme that cheated investors of more than $400 million.Mr. Israel, 48, pleaded guilty in September 2005 to charges of conspiracy and fraud in connection with bilking Bayou investors.The demise of Bayou, a Connecticut-based firm, shook many in the hedge fund industry and led to calls for more oversight.Judge Colleen McMahon of United States District Court in Manhattan ordered Mr. Israel to surrender on June 9 to begin serving the prison sentence. She also ordered that he pay $300 million in restitution.The sentence was among the longest handed down to a white-collar criminal defendant. The punishment was particularly severe because federal sentencing guidelines call for long sentences when there are substantial economic losses to investors in a financial fraud.Among long sentences meted out to those convicted of white-collar crimes, Timothy J. Rigas, former finance chief at Adelphia Communications, is serving a 20-year prison term; Bernard J.

"'08-04-15,'1','All six employees on the production staff of the New York Theater Workshop have been told that they will be laid off as of May 30, and that their jobs will be performed in the future by temporary workers in a bid to cut costs.Five of the employees have worked at the company for many years, including John J. Anselmo Jr., the master electrician, who has been there for more than a decade. The sixth has been filling in temporarily.The layoffs come as the workshop, a 25-year-old Off Broadway institution in the East Village, is facing a budget crunch. The board of directors recently told the theater’s management that it would need to reduce its yearly operating budget to $3.5 million from $4.5 million. This is partly because of the impending Broadway closing of “Rent,” which had its premiere at the workshop in 1996 and which has been sending royalties to the company during its 10-year Broadway run.But the elimination of a permanent production staff has a more immediate cause, said Fred Walker, the interim managing director of the workshop since December.Next season, instead of putting on six full productions as usual, the theater will put on three full productions and three shows in its new Off Again series, which presents scaled-down concert versions of Off Broadway musicals. For reasons having as much to do with scheduling as with the budget, there will be no production at the theater between May 18, when the last show of the 2007-8 season ends, and mid-September, when the first show of the 2008-9 season opens. That leaves four months with no shows and a full-time production department.“Given the season that we’re going to go forward with, this seemed the most fiscally responsible way to do it,” Mr. Walker said.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','The initial response to the epidemic, Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor of history at Columbia University, said recently, exposed more than ever the city’s divisions of class, race and religion. The disease hit hardest in the poorest neighborhoods, particularly the slum known as Five Points, where African-Americans and immigrant Irish Catholics were crowded in squalor and stench.“Other New Yorkers looked down on the victims,” said Dr. Jackson, editor of The Encyclopedia of New York City. “If you got cholera, it was your own fault.”Unlike most upper-class residents, John Pintard, the respected civic leader who was the historical society’s founder, remained in the stricken city. His letters to one of his daughters are included in the exhibition.The epidemic, he wrote in an attitude typical of his peers, “is almost exclusively confined to the lower classes of intemperate dissolute & filthy people huddled together like swine in their polluted habitations.”In another letter, his judgment was even harsher. “Those sickened must be cured or die off, & being chiefly of the very scum of the city, the quicker [their] dispatch the sooner the malady will cease.”Dr. David D. Ho, a biomedical scientist at Rockefeller University, noted the similarities between the views on cholera and the initial reaction to a more recent epidemic that took science by surprise: AIDS.When the first AIDS cases were reported in 1981, the victims were almost all white gay men. They were treated as outcasts.“It was a repeat of the cholera experience,” said Dr. Ho, the founding chief executive of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center. “The cause of the disease was unknown, and it affected a subset of the population. It was easy to brand the victims and blame the disease on their lifestyle.”Scientists moved quickly and effectively to isolate the virus that causes AIDS, which is by no means confined to gay men and is rampant in developing countries, particularly in Africa.Science and medicine advanced more slowly in the 19th century. It was 1883 before the bacterium Vibrio cholerae was discovered to be the agent causing the gastrointestinal disease. But a turning point in prevention came in 1854, when a London physician, Dr. John Snow, established the connection between contaminated water and cholera.Dr. Snow tested the idea by plotting cholera cases on a map of Soho. This showed that most of the victims drew their water from a public pump on Broad (now Broadwick) Street. An infected baby’s diapers had been dumped into a cesspool near the well. A recent book, “Ghost Map,” by Steven Johnson, recounts the discovery.The cholera research was an early application of mapping in medical investigations, a technique that has become widespread now that computers facilitate the display and analysis of such data. Historians of medicine credit Dr. Snow with advancing the modern germ theory of disease and laying the foundations of scientific epidemiology.The cholera menace thus prompted cities to begin cleaning up their fouled nests. This came too late for victims of the 1832 epidemic in New York, or one that followed in 1849. By then, the city’s population had doubled, to 500,000, and deaths by cholera rose to 5,071.The city in 1832 had expanded as far north as 14th Street. People were squeezed out of the lower wards by the influx of immigrants. Some, escaping earlier outbreaks of malaria and yellow fever, had sought a haven in the clean air and open land of the village called Greenwich.Walking in Greenwich Village today, one is struck by the number of small brick houses bearing markers with dates immediately after 1832. It may be no coincidence that John Blauvelt, a carter working the piers, built his on West 10th Street (then Amos Street) the year after the cholera epidemic.New Yorkers should have suspected that the scourge was on its way. Cholera, originally confined to South Asia, had started spreading in 1817 from seaport to seaport, presumably carried by infected sailors. The disease struck London in 1831 and reached New York the next June.No one was prepared, not even doctors. They generally believed that miasmas, the noxious vapors from rotting organic matter, carried infections, an idea inspiring literature of death in Rome and Venice. The cholera in Five Points seemed to bear out the hypothesis.Five Points was a slum that had metastasized from an intersection of five streets north of City Hall through the area that is now Foley Square and Chinatown. “All that is loathsome, drooping and decayed is here,” Charles Dickens wrote after a visit. Martin Scorsese’s movie “Gangs of New York” captures the lowlife there later in the 19th century, when it was still an urban sinkhole.The exhibition includes illustrations of the thugs and gamblers, the stray dogs and pigs that inhabited the streets of mud and manure. The pigs at least were useful as garbage collectors and sources of food.For victims, the onset of cholera was sudden: an attack of diarrhea and vomiting, followed by abdominal cramps and then acute shock, signaling the collapse of the circulatory system. Some survived the illness, despite the lack of effective remedies.Posters from the time described recommended treatments, including laudanum (morphine), calomel (mercury) as a binding laxative, and camphor as an anesthetic. High doses sometimes did more harm than good. Poultices of mustard, cayenne pepper and hot vinegar were also applied, as well as opium suppositories and tobacco enemas.Many victims, nearly half the cases at one hospital, died within a day of admission. After private hospitals began turning away patients, the city set up emergency public hospitals in schools and other buildings. One, on Rivington Street, bore the brunt, and sketches of its patients’ faces contorted in the throes of death look down from the exhibition walls.In stark contrast, Asher Durand, who had escaped with his family to their country home in New Jersey, painted his children happily eating apples in a sunny orchard. The idyllic canvas hangs a few feet, and a world, away from the scenes of Five Points.While many Protestants sat out the epidemic at safe distances, the city’s Catholics, many of whom were poor immigrants, mostly Irish, had no choice but to stay. Their nuns and priests also remained to offer comfort and some help, and they emerged as the few heroes in the ordeal. “The Sisters of Charity performed heroic service, and many of them died,” said Stephen R. Edidin, co-curator of the exhibition, with Joseph Ditta. “As a result, there was some reduction of anti-Catholic sentiments and a new respect for the Catholic clergy, who risked their lives in the epidemic. The feeling didn’t last, of course.”Despite the epidemics of ’32 and ’49, people still flocked to New York and other teeming cities. But the first outbreak bolstered support for the Croton Aqueduct system to bring clean upstate water to the city, a project, completed in 1842, that led to the phasing out of private and neighborhood wells that were often polluted with human and animal waste. In 1849, the municipal government banished more than 20,000 pigs to the outer reaches of the city. A similar effort in previous years had provoked riots, but this time a public chastened by epidemic complied.Finally, after the work of Dr. Snow in London and a lesser cholera outbreak in New York in 1866, the Metropolitan Board of Health was established with doctors in commanding roles and broad powers to clean up the city. Inspectors went to houses and burned clothing of people who had just died. They cleared the filth, spread lime and instructed survivors in proper sanitation.Cities had learned, or should have, that epidemics as a consequence of urbanization were their responsibility to prevent and control.Cholera is still a threat wherever drinking water is polluted. But Dr. Ho says that people should no longer die of it, if they are treated promptly and properly with rehydration fluids to restore their ravaged bodies.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','If your latest battle with your H.M.O. has you pounding your head with frustration, “Sick Around the World” on PBS may spur you to more drastic action, like leaving the United States altogether.In this “Frontline” report on Tuesday night, the Washington Post reporter T. R. Reid travels to five countries — Britain, Japan, Germany, Taiwan and Switzerland — that manage to provide some form of universal health coverage to their populations. In each nation, he reports, insurance premiums are significantly lower than those in America (in Britain there are none), and the waiting time to see a doctor is either tolerable (in Britain) or nonexistent.This fast-moving and entertaining hour starts from the premise that the American health care system, with its high costs, multiple gatekeepers and failure to provide insurance for much of the population, is a failure. And Mr. Reid makes the case (in about 10 minutes per country) that other capitalist democracies have not just cheaper and more equally available health care, but also better care over all, with longer life expectancies and lower infant mortality rates. The clinics and hospitals he visits may not be as spacious and well buffed as those in American suburbs, but surveys of these countries’ citizens — the actual consumers of care — show rates of satisfaction that should make American providers blush.How do they do it? The British, of course, have done it by nationalizing the medical profession, and Mr. Reid, who’s on the lookout for ideas that will work in the United States, admits that this one’s a nonstarter. In the other countries, however, the systems — doctors, hospitals, insurers — are for the most part private, and the difference lies in government regulation that is heavy by current American standards but far short of socialism.The key factors, Mr. Reid determines, are mandatory coverage (only in Germany are the rich allowed to opt out of the national insurance system), a competitive but nonprofit insurance system and price fixing in the medical industry. One of the greatest savings created by this increased regulation is, counter-intuitively, less bureaucracy: with no combat between insurers and insured, and with no fear on the part of doctors and hospitals that they won’t be paid, these systems have dramatically lower administrative costs than in America.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','When, as a child, I heard grandiose tales of my great-grandfather the dentist, I could have been forgiven for thinking that before he came along, dentistry was like something out of a sepia-toned comic skit, with mallet as sedative and crude pliers for extraction. And his arrival, in my imagination, instantly brought the modern dental office.But in this case, I was to learn, hyperbole and fact were surprisingly close cousins. For when I mention that fabled ancestor, G. V. Black, to dentists, roles are reversed and their jaws drop (though this has yet to translate into a free root canal). His statue stands in Lincoln Park in Chicago. And the reproduced office of the man considered “the father of modern dentistry” is a central feature of the National Museum of Dentistry in Baltimore.The museum, a Smithsonian affiliate, has been open for a decade, but having seen Black’s office years ago when it was at the Smithsonian in Washington, I had not ventured to Baltimore. But a recent, sizable gift from the family of a cousin (a fellow descendant, of course) went to spiff up the Black exhibit, prompting me to make that long-overdue visit. (Naturally, in deference to the occasion — and yes, at my wife’s insistence — I first brushed my teeth thoroughly at our hotel.)After making our way through a gaggle of preschool children who had yet to know the dentist’s drill, and walking past an intriguing variety of exhibits — George Washington’s dentures, film stars’ smiles, a poster for the 1938 Our Gang short “The Awful Tooth,” fearsome 17th-century instruments, 7th-century Mayan shell implants — we spied a life-size Greene Vardiman Black, in all his bearded, buttoned-up glory, surrounded by his leather dental chair and desk, cabinets of tools (most of which he invented) and elaborate pedal-operated drill (also his creation). An interactive display offered facts and photographs. (Wait! I have that picture, passed down from my mother, but didn’t know who it was. It’s G. V.’s father!)In that display were the bare bones of a remarkable life: Born in 1836 on an Illinois farm. A mere 20 months of formal schooling. (“The boy with his dog and gun learned more in a day than a teacher taught in a month,” as one biographer put it.) Apprenticed to his brother, a doctor, at 17. Learned all he needed to know — probably just about all there was to know — of dentistry in a few months. Served briefly in the Civil War. Set up shop in Jacksonville, Ill., doing tireless research into all things tooth. (A daughter born there, vintage 1876, became the fearsome grandmother of my youth.) Invention after invention: 102 “cutting instruments,” by one count; silver amalgam for fillings with just the right chemical balance. Joined the faculty of the Northwestern University Dental School in 1891, and in 1897 became its dean.In one striking photograph, Black is shown in a classroom, with tooth models, three feet tall, arrayed in front of him as teaching tools.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','Could there be an upside to high blood pressure? Well, it may lower the chances of having headaches, including migraines, researchers said Monday.That may well be the only good thing to be said for high blood pressure, a cause of any number of serious health problems. It also reflects a shift in thinking about what role blood pressure plays in headaches.For many years, the researchers write in the journal Neurology, scientists assumed that people with high blood pressure were more likely to get headaches. Then studies found no association.But in recent years, evidence has emerged showing that the relationship may be the opposite of what was first believed.The study, led by Dr. Erling Tronvik of Trondheim University Hospital in Norway, looked at data from more than 50,000 people in that country over two different periods.The biggest benefit was found in people with the highest pulse pressure, a measurement of the difference between the diastolic and systolic pressure at the moment the heart beats.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','“The problem is slowly changing from the financial sector to the rest of the economy,” Valérie Cazaban, a fund manager at Stratège Finance, said. “Now we’re going to price a recession into the market.”“Everyone was afraid of a systemic crisis, but that’s looking less likely now,” she added.A sobering earnings report from General Electric, which prompted sell-offs in Europe and the Americas on Friday, continued to be felt on Monday. G.E.’s stock fell 13 percent on Friday after it said its finance business had been hurt because “the extraordinary disruption in the capital markets in March affected our ability to complete asset sales and resulted in higher mark-to-market losses and impairments.”An earnings report from Philips Electronics on Monday cast a pall on the technology sector. The company said its North American sales fell 9 percent because of weakness in its flat-panel TV business. Its shares fell 2.9 percent.Mr. Hafeez said that judging by the language of the Group of 7 statement on currencies, there appeared to be little prospect of coordinated intervention in support of the dollar.“The euro is creeping back up toward where it was” before the weekend meetings, Mr. Hafeez said. “I think it’s likely to hit new records against the dollar.”The euro rose to $1.5827 in Europe Monday from $1.5803 in New York on Friday; the record, set last week, is $1.5911. The British pound rose to $1.9792 from $1.9698. The dollar slipped to 100.90 Japanese yen, from ¥100.94 and to 0.9980 Swiss francs from 1.0002 francs.Credit market conditions remain tight. The Euribor rate for three-month unsecured lending in euros among European banks on Monday reached a three-month high, Reuters reported. The rate reached 4.753 percent Monday, up from 4.747 percent Friday, despite efforts by the European Central Bank to calm the market.The Group of 7 officials’ concerns have registered with global banks, developments showed. Wachovia, the fourth-largest American bank, said early on Monday that it would raise $7 billion through a share sale to replenish its capital, which has been depleted by mounting housing-loan losses and the ill-timed acquisition of a big California mortgage lender. Wachovia also reported a loss of $393 million for the first quarter and said it was cutting its dividend.And a report in The Wall Street Journal said that Deutsche Bank was seeking to sell $20 billion of leveraged loans to clear up its balance sheet. Ronald Weichert, a spokesman for the German bank, declined to comment on the report.The benchmark oil contract on the Nymex, light low-sulfur crude for May delivery, fell 31 cents to $109.83 a barrel. Comex gold futures for April delivery fell $8 to $915.60 an ounce.'"
"'08-04-15,'1','THE FACTS As if left-handers did not have it hard enough.Already burdened with the minor mishaps that arise from living in a world designed for righties, their lot in life seemed to worsen considerably in the 1980s, when a study argued that southpaws had several times the risk of chronic headaches — and immune disorders — as their right-handed counterparts. The reason, it was theorized, had something to do with variations in fetal brain development, though no precise explanation was given.But a raft of evidence now suggests that the migraine finding, though intriguing, was less fact than statistical artifact. A more extensive study published in March by German scientists examined a group of 100 patients who had received a diagnosis of migraine based on standards set by the International Headache Society. After finding no evidence of a link between handedness and migraines, the scientists pooled data from five other studies and conducted a meta-analysis. Still, there was no evidence of a relationship — a conclusion echoed by many similar studies.Several studies have also examined whether there is any relationship between left-handedness and increased risk of immune disorders. The findings are inconclusive. Proponents argue that fetal exposure to high levels of testosterone could be responsible, and they point out that left-handedness is more common in men than women. Critics say more research is needed.THE BOTTOM LINE Most studies have found that being left-handed does not increase the risk of migraines.'"

"'08-04-16,'1','Microsoft’s pursuit of Yahoo, if successful, will come with more than one bill due.The shareholders, to be sure, will collect their payment, but Microsoft will mostly likely need to craft a package of financial incentives to prevent talented engineers and managers from hopping to other jobs in Silicon Valley.The employee retention program could be expensive, perhaps costing billions of dollars, based on what Microsoft did when it acquired another technology company last year.A look at that deal suggests how much people are the vital assets in companies that mainly generate ideas that become software and Web services. The hidden cost of “flight insurance” against employee defections may also be a reason Microsoft has resisted raising its bid.Microsoft last May bought Tellme Networks, a maker of voice-recognition software used in directory assistance and for searching the Internet to retrieve consumer and local business information using a cellphone. Microsoft paid $800 million for the private company in Mountain View, Calif., but put in another $100 million for employee retention programs, according to two people close to Microsoft. The $100 million for worker retention packages has not been reported before.Cash payments, stock options and grants intended to hold onto employees after a takeover are fairly standard in Silicon Valley, say venture capitalists and industry analysts. These incentive plans, they add, can extend deep into the engineering ranks, unlike in most other industries where retention packages, or “golden handcuffs,” are typically offered to a handful of top executives.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','TOKYO — The Japanese government said on Wednesday that it would block a British hedge fund from buying a larger stake in a power company, in a case that is being closely watched as a test of Japan’s openness to foreign capital.The trade ministry rejected a proposal by the hedge fund, the Children’s Investment Fund, to increase its holdings in Electric Power Development, an electricity wholesale company, to as much as 20 percent from 9.9 percent. The ministry was acting on the recommendation of a government-sponsored panel, which said the fund’s short-term profit horizon could hurt the company’s ability to provide electricity.The rejection is the latest in a series of setbacks for foreign investors in Japan that have raised questions about the country’s commitment to welcoming foreign investment and business. Recently, Japan has appeared adrift in economic policy, seeming to waver between embracing the global economy, and erecting barriers to keep it out.Japanese officials have insisted that the country remains open. They said that the electric company, commonly known as J-Power, was an exception because of its strategic role in supplying energy to Japanese homes and businesses. In its recommendation, the committee expressed concerns about the possibility of foreign investors getting access to sensitive technology used by the company, which operates nuclear power plants.The top government spokesman, Nobutaka Machimura, told reporters that the fund was just aiming for short-term profits, and the ministry’s decision would not deter other foreign investors.“This case is straightforwardly related to national security,” Mr. Machimura saidBut John Ho, the head of the investment fund’s Asian operations, called such concerns absurd, saying shareholders did not get access to sensitive technology. He said his interests were limited to improving returns for shareholders, including by pressing the company to raise dividends.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','José Canseco is scheduled to be questioned by federal authorities in Los Angeles on April 22, his lawyer said Tuesday.The I.R.S. special agent Jeff Novitzky and an agent from the F.B.I.’s Washington field office want to interview Canseco about Miguel Tejada’s and Roger Clemens’s suspected use of performance-enhancing drugs, said Gregory Emerson, Canseco’s lawyer.Federal authorities are investigating whether Tejada, a shortstop for the Houston Astros, and Clemens made false statements to Congress about their use of performance-enhancers.Canseco has written about both players and their possible connection to the use of banned substances. In his 2005 book “Juiced,” Canseco said Tejada had built a “new, pumped-up body” that appeared to come from steroids. He was more coy when talking about Clemens, saying his surge in his late 30s was because of hard work and “whatever else he may have been doing to get stronger.”In his second book, “Vindicated,” released April 1, Canseco said he had concluded that Clemens did not use steroids or human growth hormone.

"'08-04-16,'1','“It’s almost an insult,” she said of the Patersons’ $150. “It’s not like he doesn’t have enough to give away.”It is possible, of course, that Mr. Paterson gave many contributions to charity and just did not claim them as deductions on his tax return. Risa Heller, a spokeswoman for the governor, declined to comment.In any case, what seems clear — and it has become clearer and clearer in recent weeks — was that the man who ascended to the state’s top job last month after the abrupt resignation of Eliot Spitzer in a prostitution scandal never expected to be in a position where anyone would bother to look at his tax return at all.But there it was, on Schedule A, a single typewritten entry, $150 of used items to the Salvation Army, amounting to 0.06 percent of the Patersons’ income.On their New York State return, the Patersons did not check off the options to donate part of their refund — they will get $4,386 from the state — to a World Trade Center memorial fund or to breast cancer research or to help missing and exploited children.Many taxpayers said that they were disappointed because they think politicians should be models of civic responsibility. While Mr. Paterson may never have expected to be governor, he has long lived in the public eye, having been elected lieutenant governor in 2006 and served as a state senator for 20 years before that.“He was an accidental governor, but he wasn’t an accidental lieutenant governor,” noted Jonathan Wells, 43, who lives in Manhattan and works in a photography business. “You have to lead by example.”Mr. Paterson’s charitable deductions were certainly on the skimpy side compared with those of other top lawmakers in the region — and among people in his tax bracket.Andrew M. Cuomo, New York’s attorney general, gave $14,000, or about 3 percent of his income. A spokeswoman for Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, a former investment banker, would not specify Tuesday how much he had given to charity last year, but did say that his return included $920,000 in itemized deductions on gross income of $11,800,000, including the $1 salary he earns for leading the state.The spokeswoman, Lilo Stainton, said that in past years, the governor had “given heartily to schools, urban churches, arts causes and progressive groups” that promote peace, reproductive rights, and drug policy changes.Mr. Paterson also declared far less in donations than his financial peers: According to the Internal Revenue Service, the nearly 2.5 million taxpayers who earned $200,000 to $500,000 in 2005 and deducted charitable contributions gave an average of $8,528.Even people in the lowest tax bracket, or those with income of less than $5,000, gave more on average — $734 — than Mr. Paterson.Some taxpayers, while saying they gave generously themselves, insisted that everyone, politician or otherwise, should give what they feel is appropriate.“It’s up to an individual and someone’s conscience,” said Matthew Kelty, 38, who works at the New School and gave money last year to groups that included the Human Rights Campaign, the Gay Men’s Health Crisis, CARE and Save the Children.Still, he said, Mr. Paterson’s tax return made him wonder about the new governor’s character.“It’s interesting that someone who we put our trust in doesn’t seem to care,” he said.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','“This is our biggest legislative effort since the Tax Reform Act of 1986,” said Jerry M. Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders. Hundreds of the association’s members flooded the district offices of representatives and senators while they were home for the spring recess last month.Supporters of the bill, including Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, say it represents sound tax policy carefully focused to help stimulate the lagging economy. But the White House opposes the Senate bill, and Democratic leaders in the House not only have promised to provide more relief for individual homeowners, but have also dropped the corporate tax provisions from their version.Downtrodden automakers — Ford and General Motors — were especially dogged in securing a tax break that would let them collect alternative minimum tax credits, also known as the A.M.T., that would otherwise be out of reach because they did not pay enough taxes in recent years to claim a rebate.If the provision becomes law, it could mean checks up to $40 million for the car manufacturers, as long as the companies had made investments in plant or equipment in that amount.A Ford spokesman, Mike Moran, said he was aware that Ford would benefit from the tax credit in the bill passed by the Senate. But Mr. Moran said that the credit applied to a range of industries, not just automakers.A spokesman for General Motors, Greg Martin, said today that the autocompanies would only be able to use the tax credits to re-invest in theirAmerican operations, not their plants overseas. The credits ""will surelyhave a beneficial impact, which is part of the overall effort to stimulatethe economy,"" Mr. Martin said.Domestic airlines and manufacturers other than automakers would be eligible to claim the A.M.T. break as well. One lobbyist said that the companies that had sought the tax breaks in meetings with lawmakers included Ford, General Motors, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Goodyear Tire and Rubber.Companies could claim only one of the new tax breaks, which in all, are expected to cost $6 billion through 2018. The jockeying among industry groups, including Realtors, home builders and bankers, is certain to intensify in coming weeks as lawmakers move to reconcile the Senate bill with a more ambitious package of housing legislation now under way in the House.Lawmakers on the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee have omitted the corporate tax cuts from their version of the bill in favor of tax breaks for first-time home buyers and developers of low-income rental housing, and more aid for owners facing foreclosure.Congressional Democrats are also hearing from consumer advocates and other groups who say that the Senate bill does little to help Americans in danger of losing their homes to foreclosure.“The Senate legislation gave corporations and Wall Street billions in tax breaks,” Terence M. O’Sullivan, the president of the Laborers International Union of North America, said at a news conference on Tuesday to denounce the bill.“Tax breaks for corporate home builders won’t help stabilize the housing market, won’t create jobs and won’t prevent a single foreclosure,” he continued. “If anything, this multibillion-dollar windfall will make things worse.”Even Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and the main author of the Senate bill, said the measure did not live up to its name and that he wanted changes. But other lawmakers, and the lobbyists who seek to influence them, also recognize a golden opportunity when they sense that the political winds virtually guarantee a bill’s passage, and the housing crisis is just such a time.In a sign of how such legislation allows lawmakers to advance many other goals, the Senate bill also includes tax provisions to encourage alternative energy production at a cost of roughly $6 billion over 10 years.That provision was sponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, and Senator John Ensign, Republican of Nevada. A similar measure was dropped from a major energy bill last year and again from the economic stimulus bill in February.But without quick action to extend expiring tax incentives, Ms. Cantwell said, many companies would simply drop projects. The housing bill was the easiest and fastest way to get things moving.Other industries facing financial difficulties, like retailers, may realize that the tax provisions in the bill offer help for them, too.Over the next few weeks, industry groups that fought to secure tax provisions in the Senate bill are expected to argue that providing help for important industries offers the best chance of helping to reverse the economic downturn.To press their case on Capitol Hill, 15 of the biggest residential construction companies, including KB Homes and Toll Brothers, formed a coalition and hired a lobbying firm, the C2 Group, apart from the larger National Association of Home Builders.Tom Crawford, a founder of the C2 Group, met with staff members of the Senate Finance Committee, several of whose members had already begun expressing concern about the effect of the slowing economy on home builders and other businesses.The home builders were hardly the only industry that lawmakers heard from as the Senate housing legislation took shape and it became clear that the bill would provide more in the way of tax breaks aimed at stimulating the economy than direct assistance for distressed homeowners.The cause of the automobile manufacturers was taken up by Senator George Voinovich, Republican of Ohio, and Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, who pushed to allow them access to up to $40 million each in alternative minimum tax credits.Automakers and other companies that have lost money in recent years have accumulated billions of dollars in such credits, which are based on cumulative payments of the corporate alternative minimum tax. Companies, however, can claim a refund of such credits only in years when they pay regular corporate income taxes in amounts that exceed what they would owe under the alternative tax method.The provision benefiting home builders and other struggling businesses would allow operating losses to be carried back over four years rather than the two years in current law. It is a strategy that Congress has used as a way of stimulating the economy in previous recessions, most recently in 2002 with the support of the Bush administration.But the White House opposed the idea when members of Congress proposed it as part of the economic stimulus package earlier this year. And some House Democrats suggest that home builders and their lobbyists will face an uphill battle in trying to keep the provision when the Senate bill is reconciled with a rival tax package that was approved last week by the House Ways and Means Committee.These Democrats said that the Ways and Means chairman, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, and other leaders, including Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, would oppose the provision as benefiting builders at a time when Congress should be helping homeowners.“This ship largely sailed when Congressional Republicans left it out of the stimulus package,” said one House Democratic aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity so as not to interfere with negotiations.Unlike the Senate bill, which includes a tax credit of up to $7,500 for purchasers of foreclosed properties, Mr. Rangel’s bill provides a credit for all first-time home buyers — a move that drew strong support from the National Association of Realtors.“This is a meaningful incentive that should draw into the market many purchasers who, to date, have remained on the sidelines,” the president of the group, Richard F. Gaylord, wrote. “We believe this credit can convert ‘lookers’ into first-time home buyers.”Other industry groups were also eager to sign on as supporters of Mr. Rangel’s bill, even as many of them hope to push him to endorse a more expansive menu of tax breaks that will benefit them.Among them were the National Association of Home Builders, the Mortgage Bankers Association, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks and the American Hospital Association.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','CHICAGO — The packed rush-hour subway train had been stopped for about an hour Tuesday morning, held up by a malfunctioning train ahead. In air hot and stuffy, the passengers had turned nervous and impatient. Ignoring pleas of transit workers, they decided to leave the train and walk through the dimly lighted tunnel toward freedom.The unauthorized evacuation, transit officials said, caused a bigger problem. Fearing that passengers could be electrocuted by the third rail, officials cut off power to part of the Blue Line, which travels a large U-shaped route between the West Side and O’Hare International Airport. Service was disrupted for about four hours, and more than a thousand passengers had to be helped off several trains.“If those particular passengers had not self-evacuated, we could have gotten people out on trains and restored service much sooner,” said Ron Huberman, president of the Chicago Transit Authority.Esmeralda Cuevas, 26, who works as an administrative assistant, was on the train immediately behind the stalled one when she saw a few people walk by a window of her car.“I felt a sense like I want to be with them,” Ms. Cuevas said. “I was impressed with their courage. I thought, ‘I can stay in here with these people and feel hot and uncomfortable, or I can start walking.’ ”Walk she did. So did an undetermined number of other passengers from a total of four trains, who forged ahead despite intercom announcements asking them to return.About two hours after her ordeal began, Ms. Cuevas emerged from the subway crying, dirt on her hands and face. An executive at her office advised her to avoid the subway for a few days and take cabs. Since he did not offer to pay, she said, she plans to take the train, but on an elevated line.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','Intel’s report came amid rising concern on Wall Street about the possibility of a broad slowdown in consumer demand for computers. In January, Intel, a closely watched bellwether of the technology industry, issued a disappointing forecast for the first quarter, rattling investors.“Investors are likely to be encouraged by Intel’s execution, their new products and their gross margin expectation,” said Timothy Luke, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. “In a time of uncertainty, at least they’re delivering on what they can control.”The company, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it now expected gross profit margins of 56 percent in the second quarter, compared with its earlier forecast of 54.9 percent.Intel projected its gross margin, a measure closely watched by Wall Street, for the full year would be about 57 percent, beating estimates of about 56 percent for the year.The company reported financial results in line with analysts’ forecasts. Net income in the first quarter declined 12 percent, to $1.4 billion, or 25 cents a share, from $1.64 billion, or 28 cents, in the period a year earlier. The company said the quarter included a restructuring charge amounting to 4 cents a share.Intel has clearly benefited from the missteps of its chief rival, Advanced Micro Devices, which has suffered from technical glitches and repeated product delays. Intel, meanwhile, has regained some of the market share it had lost to A.M.D.Intel’s strong performance was in stark contrast to A.M.D.’s announcement last week that it blamed deteriorating business conditions for its decision to lay off 10 percent of its work force and reduce its financial guidance for the first quarter. Analysts expect A.M.D. to report a net loss of $263 million, or 42 cents a share, when it announces its earnings on Thursday.“With Intel and A.M.D. both preannouncing this quarter, even for different reasons, there was a concern about a problem in the PC market,” said Cody Acree, an analyst with Stifel Nicolaus. “It looks like Intel put that to rest. It doesn’t look like we’re seeing any deterioration in PC fundamentals.”In March, Intel blamed a steep drop in prices for NAND flash memory, the chips used in portable electronic devices, for its decision to lower its gross profit margin from its previous forecast of about 56 percent. An oversupply of memory chips, along with fierce competition, has put pressure on prices, the company said.“Our strengthening core business offset weakness in our NAND business,” Stacy J. Smith, Intel’s chief finance officer, said in an interview.Mr. Otellini said the company was currently rethinking its strategy in the NAND market and moved to assure analysts that he would not endure continued losses.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','But that has not stopped the chatter. After all, some noted, there was a time when few believed the rumblings that Mrs. Clinton would run for president.“It looks like she’s not going to win the presidency, so I guess you’ve got to figure out where she’s going next,” said Douglas A. Muzzio, a professor at the Baruch College School of Public Affairs.Those New York Democrats who were willing to talk on the record about the possibility of a Governor Clinton unfailingly emphasized their belief that she would be taking up residence in the White House come next year. But some conceded that the governor idea had its attractions — in theory, of course.“Especially since I’m supporting her for president, I would say she certainly could do a bang-up job as governor of the state,” said Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a prominent Clinton backer in New York.Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, dismissed the idea on Tuesday, saying that she would support Mr. Paterson.“This whole line of inquiry is ridiculous,” Mr. Wolfson said. “There are no circumstances under which Senator Clinton will run for governor.”Still, based on her experience in the Senate, some said, it is possible to imagine Mrs. Clinton having a smooth transition to Albany, especially compared with that of Eliot Spitzer, who entered office in 2007 as a political star in his own right. Upon arriving in Washington, Mrs. Clinton worked diligently to play down her celebrity. She devoted herself to bread-and-butter New York issues, sought out senior senators as mentors and reached across the aisle to prominent Republicans who tormented her husband during his presidency.After a tumultuous year of political battles between Mr. Spitzer and the Legislature, Mrs. Clinton’s fans say, Albany could use that kind of touch.“She would cross party lines to bring people together,” said Assemblywoman RoAnn M. Destito, an upstate Democrat who, like Mr. Lentol, said she believed Mr. Paterson was just as capable of bringing harmony to Albany. “That’s the trait she would bring to the presidency and — hypothetically — any job she would choose.”New Yorkers have always preferred their politicians to be larger than life — one factor, arguably, in their openness to making Mrs. Clinton a senator in 2000 despite her shallow roots in the state.But by the same token, should Mrs. Clinton aim for the governor’s mansion, voters might come to resent playing the eternal bridesmaid to Mrs. Clinton’s ambitions. “It would be like, ‘We gave you our vote for the Senate, and you ran for the presidency. That’s one thing,’ ” Mr. Muzzio said. “But now you’re going to run for governor?”Some of her fellow Democrats might have similar feelings, especially those who have been patiently waiting for Mrs. Clinton to depart New York’s political sandbox and pave the way for a successor. And any challenge to Mr. Paterson, a Clinton friend who has campaigned extensively for her, would carry particular risks. Mr. Paterson, who is serving out the remainder of Mr. Spitzer’s term, has indicated that he is likely to run in 2010.Mrs. Clinton has already dismayed some black voters by running against Barack Obama, a fellow Democratic senator. Any effort to nudge Mr. Paterson aside could provoke a deadly backlash from black voters. Indeed, several people said they assumed that Mr. Obama’s supporters were circulating the rumor in part to damage Mrs. Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary next week.“Even if it were real, it would destroy her potential base vote among blacks and boost up black turnout for Obama,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a New York political consultant who worked on Bill Clinton’s 1996 presidential campaign.Another Clinton supporter, an elected official from New York City who spoke anonymously for fear of offending Mrs. Clinton, said it was hard to imagine her ever running for governor. She would not even consider it, the official said, unless Mr. Paterson had been too weakened by his admissions of drug use and marital infidelity to stand for re-election, and party leaders appealed to her to run.“He’d have to be really, really weak,” said the official. “And there’d have to be some kind of consolation for him.”For the moment, however, Albany Republicans and Democrats alike appear eager to give the new governor a honeymoon. And polls show Mr. Paterson with fairly high approval ratings despite his rocky early weeks in office. New York Democrats, Mr. Lentol asserted, did not need a savior.“Not right now,” he said. “But you never know. You’ve got to take it one day at a time.”'"
"'08-04-16,'1','“It almost calls into question all legitimate research that’s been conducted by the pharmaceutical industry with the academic physician,” said Dr. Ross, whose article, written with colleagues, was published Wednesday in JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association. and posted Tuesday on the journal’s Web site.Merck acknowledged on Tuesday that it sometimes hired outside medical writers to draft research reports before handing them over to the doctors whose names eventually appear on the publication. But the company disputed the article’s conclusion that the authors do little of the actual research or analysis.The final work is the product of the doctor and “accurately reflects his or her opinion,” said a Merck lawyer, James C. Fitzpatrick.And at least one of the doctors whose published research was questioned in Wednesday’s article, Dr. Steven H. Ferris, a New York University psychiatry professor, said the notion that the article bearing his name was ghostwritten was “simply false.” He said it was “egregious” that Dr. Ross and his colleagues had done no research besides mining the Merck documents and reading the published journal articles.In an editorial, JAMA said the analysis showed that Merck had apparently manipulated dozens of publications to promote Vioxx.“It is clear that at least some of the authors played little direct roles in the study or review, yet still allowed themselves to be named as authors,” the editorial said.The editorial called upon medical journal editors to require each author to report his or her specific contributions to articles. “Journal editors also bear some of the responsibility for enabling companies to manipulate publications,” the editorial said.JAMA itself published one of the Vioxx studies that was cited in Dr. Ross’s article.In that case, in 2002, a Merck scientist was listed as the lead author. But Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis, JAMA’s editor, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that, even so, it was dishonest because the authors did not fully disclose the role of a ghostwriter.“I consider that being scammed,” Dr. DeAngelis said. “But is that as serious as allowing someone to have a review article written by a for-profit company and solicited and paid for by a for-profit company and asking you to put your name on it after it was all done?”Although the role of pharmaceutical companies in influencing medical journal articles has been questioned before, the Merck documents provided the most comprehensive look at the practice yet, according to one of the study’s four authors, Dr. David S. Egilman, a clinical associate medical professor at Brown University.In the Vioxx lawsuits, millions of Merck documents were supplied to plaintiffs. Those documents were available to Dr. Egilman and Dr. Ross because they had served as consultants to plaintiffs’ lawyers in some of those suits.Combing through the documents, Dr. Ross and his colleagues unearthed internal Merck e-mail messages and documents about 96 journal publications, which included review articles and reports of clinical studies. While the Ross team said it was not necessarily raising questions about all 96 articles, it said that in many cases there was scant evidence that the recruited authors made substantive contributions.One paper involved a study of Vioxx as a possible deterrent to Alzheimer’s progression.The draft of the paper, dated August 2003, identified the lead writer as “External author?” But when it was published in 2005 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, the lead author was listed as Dr. Leon J. Thal, a well-known Alzheimer’s researcher at the University of California, San Diego. Dr. Thal was killed in an airplane crash last year.The second author listed on the published Alzheimer’s paper, whose name had not been on the draft, was Dr. Ferris, the New York University professor. Dr. Ferris, reached by telephone Tuesday, said he had played an active role in the research and he was substantially involved in helping shape the final draft.“It’s simply false that we didn’t contribute to the final publication,” Dr. Ferris said.A third author, also not named on the initial draft, was Dr. Louis Kirby, currently the medical director for the company Provista Life Sciences. In an e-mail message on Tuesday, Dr. Kirby said that as a clinical investigator for the study he had enrolled more patients, 109, than any of the other researchers. He also said he made revisions to the final document.“The fact that the draft was written by a Merck employee for later discussion by all the authors does not in and of itself constitute ghostwriting,” Dr. Kirby’s e-mail message said.The current editor of the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, Dr. James H. Meador-Woodruff, the chairman of psychiatry at the University of Alabama, Birmingham, said he was not the editor in 2005 but planned to investigate the accusations. “Currently, we have in place prohibitions against this,” Dr. Meador-Woodruff said.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','LOS ANGELES (AP) — The animator Ollie Johnston, the last of the Disney “nine old men,” as the studio’s core group of senior animators was called, died on Monday in Sequim, Wash. He was 95.He died of natural causes, said Howard E. Green, a Disney vice president.Perhaps the two most accomplished of the nine were Mr. Johnston and his close friend Frank Thomas, who died in 2004; they were frequent collaborators and next-door neighbors. (The phrase “nine old men” came from President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s description of the Supreme Court. The label stuck to the Disney group when most were in their 20’s.)Mr. Johnston worked as an assistant animator on Disney’s first full-length feature, “Snow White” (1937), became an animation supervisor on “Fantasia” and “Bambi,” and was an animator on “Pinocchio.”He was especially proud of his work on “Bambi” and its classic scenes, including the heartbreaking death of Bambi’s mother at the hands of a hunter.“The mother’s death showed how convincing we could be at presenting really strong emotion,” Mr. Johnston said in 1999.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','The Senate passed a budget resolution last month that would make the F.D.A.’s allocated budget — that part of its spending that comes from taxpayer revenue, as opposed to user fees paid by drug and medical device manufacturers — $375 million greater in 2009 than this year. That would be a 20 percent increase, and Dr. von Eschenbach said he did not believe that the agency could absorb so large an addition in one year.A report last year by a panel of outside advisers to the agency said American lives were in danger because the F.D.A. did not have the money, the staff or the scientific expertise to protect them. And in a speech last month, Dr. von Eschenbach acknowledged that the F.D.A. “may fail in its mission to protect and promote the health of every American” and that “peril exists.”But he was far less pessimistic in his testimony on Tuesday.“I believe we have been eminently successful up to this period of time,” Dr. von Eschenbach said. “We are the world’s gold standard.“But if we want to continue that level of excellence,” he added, “we must change.”The Bush administration has proposed increasing the agency’s allocated budget next year by 3 percent, to some $1.8 billion, not enough to pay even for increased costs. Dr. von Eschenbach spoke Tuesday about plans to hire up to 700 new employees for the F.D.A. staff, but he acknowledged that the agency would not have the money to do any hiring next year if the president’s budget was adopted without changes by Congress.“We are on a trajectory to increased staff,” he said. “We just have to push it off a little.”Dr. von Eschenbach said the agency planned to open three new offices this year in the Chinese cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The combined staff there is to total 13 people, 5 of them to be hired locally.Addressing the controversy over the blood thinner heparin, the commissioner said in his testimony that contamination in samples whose active ingredient had been imported from China was “apparently, we suspect, done by virtue of economic fraud,” to enhance profit. This was the first time anyone at the F.D.A. had confirmed that the agency suspected that the drug’s contamination had been deliberate.But after the hearing, Dr. von Eschenbach said that he “probably went too far” in his testimony and that the agency did not have proof that the contamination had occurred as a result of fraud.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','The Labor Department said on Tuesday that the Producer Price Index jumped 1.1 percent in March, sharply accelerating from a 0.3 percent increase in February. The increase, twice what economists had expected, was led by a surge in gasoline and in home heating oil prices. That news comes not long after the International Monetary Fund sharply cut its global growth forecast amid troubles in the credit markets and warned that the United States economy might shrink.The darker outlook prompted the International Energy Agency, a forecaster for developed countries, to cut its estimates for global oil demand this year by nearly half a million barrels a day. In its most recent monthly report, the agency said it expected oil consumption to grow by 1.3 million barrels a day in 2008, to 87.2 million barrels a day. That’s 460,000 barrels a day less than its previous forecast. Higher energy costs are hurting businesses and consumers alike and are adding to the woes of an economy ailing from a housing slump and a credit crisis. As a result, many analysts expect gasoline consumption to drop this year. The United States is the world’s top oil consumer, accounting for nearly a quarter of global demand.While higher energy prices are spurring a fresh wave of investments in oil projects, oil producers are also facing a tougher time expanding their supplies.Russia’s production appears to be reaching a plateau after years of strong growth following its post-Soviet slump. Mexico’s oil output has been falling because of insufficient investments by its state-owned oil company, Pemex.This week also brought some potentially good news for the future growth in supplies. The head of Brazil’s national oil agency suggested that the country had discovered a huge new offshore field that could potentially be three times the size of the country’s proven reserves. Petrobras, Brazil’s national oil company, declined to comment about the find.Little relief is expected from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in the short term. While President Bush has urged oil producers to increase output, the oil cartel is unwilling to step in to lower prices.OPEC producers, which account for 40 percent of the world’s oil exports, see oil demand falling in coming months. They consider that the global oil market is currently well supplied with oil and that prices are being moved more by market psychology than fundamental factors.Members of OPEC are not scheduled to meet until September to consider new production targets. Saudi Arabia’s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said last week that current oil prices had little to do with global supplies.“I am not going to pull back; I’m not going to dump crude on the market,” Mr. Naimi said last week, according to Reuters.On Saturday, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia also said that new oil discoveries in the kingdom would remain untapped to preserve the nation’s oil wealth for future generations, according to various reports.“Let them remain in the ground for our children and grandchildren who need them,” the king said in a speech, quoted by the Saudi Press Agency.In its latest monthly report, released Tuesday, OPEC said it expected global demand to fall by 1.4 million barrels a day in the second quarter, when consumption in the northern hemisphere typically slows after winter.Analysts have also blamed a weak dollar for pushing up oil prices as investors seek to buy commodity assets to hedge against the dollar’s decline, and rising inflation. The dollar has also dropped against the euro because of concern about the status of the overall American economy. It recently traded at $1.5811 against the euro, near its lows.“The financial investors, such as sovereign funds, hedge funds, pension funds, and commodity fund managers, are all betting on the weak dollar,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation. “This is now as much about the direction of the dollar as it is about the direction of oil.”So far this year, oil prices have averaged about $100 a barrel. That compares with $72 a barrel last year, and $26 a barrel in 2001.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','Mr. McCain even called for cutting one tax before the Republican National Convention, let alone the election: he urged Congress to suspend the 18.4-cent-a-gallon federal gas tax from this Memorial Day until Labor Day. He said doing so would provide “an immediate economic stimulus,” but such plans have gained little traction recently in Congress, and some environmentalists fear such a cut would encourage more people to use their cars at a time when Mr. McCain has made combating global warming a central theme of his campaign.The McCain campaign put the cost of his tax cuts at roughly $200 billion a year, but its estimate did not include the cost of making the Bush tax cuts permanent, which would more than double that figure.The campaign said it would offset the lost $200 billion by eliminating from the federal budget earmarked pork-barrel projects; putting a one-year freeze on discretionary spending in most federal agencies, later eliminating wasteful programs; broadening the tax base by eliminating loopholes; and spurring economic growth. But its estimate of how much could be saved with such measures was far higher than those of some other independent budget analysts.Mr. McCain’s Democratic rivals mocked the proposals, with the campaign of Senator Barack Obama saying the plans represented a continuation of failed Bush policies, and aides to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton saying they would benefit corporations that had helped cause the nation’s current economic woes.Mr. McCain — who said in February in Wisconsin that he would balance the budget by the end of his first term as president — seemed to reconsider that on Tuesday, saying at a news conference later in Villanova that “economic conditions are reversed” and that he would have a balanced budget within eight years. His economic aides said they could pay for all the tax cuts with spending cuts.The Democratic National Committee did its own analysis, which it said suggested that Mr. McCain’s proposed tax cuts, coupled with the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that he wants to continue, would put the budget trillions of dollars into the red.In sum, Mr. McCain cast himself as someone who adheres to the general tax-cutting principles of the Republican Party, in a business-friendly way, while at the same time battling special interests and corporate wrongdoing, calling for unspecified “smarter regulation” of the financial markets and companies.And he called for smaller government, while conceding that government job training programs were vital to dealing with the human cost of an economy undergoing rapid changes, and reiterating his new call — after initially signaling his opposition to broad federal intervention in the housing crisis — for having the government help refinance and guarantee some mortgages.Dipping into a contentious issue that has stirred up the Democratic Party, Mr. McCain made clear his unequivocal support for free trade even as Senators Obama and Clinton have been speaking about its downsides. Mr. McCain argued that the benefits of opening new markets outweighed the costs of losing some manufacturing jobs.“That is why I object when Senators Obama and Clinton and others preach the false virtues of economic isolationism,” Mr. McCain said in the speech. “Senator Obama recently suggested that Americans are protectionist because they are bitter about being left behind in the global economy. Well, what’s his excuse for embracing the false promises of protectionism?”Mr. McCain painted his Democratic rivals, who want to roll back some of the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy to pay for their health care plans, as tax raisers. “They’re going to raise your taxes by thousands of dollars per year, and they have the audacity to hope you don’t mind,” he said, in an allusion to the title of one of Mr. Obama’s books, “The Audacity of Hope.”Mr. Obama’s spokesman, Bill Burton, responded: “Senator McCain’s economic plan offers no change from George Bush’s failed policies by going full speed ahead with fiscally irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that John McCain himself once said offended his conscience. He also proposes a gift basket of new tax cuts for corporate America at a time when some C.E.O.’s are making more in a day than some workers make in a year. John McCain’s plan is one that could have been written by the corporate lobbyists who run his campaign, and probably was.”Mrs. Clinton’s policy director, Neera Tanden, said Mr. McCain’s tax cuts would most benefit corporations, while Mrs. Clinton’s would most help middle-class families. “John McCain promises straight talk,” Ms. Tanden said in a statement. “But his speech today is really double talk. Senator McCain spoke about the excesses of companies like Countrywide. But what he fails to mention was that Countrywide would have received a $500 million tax cut under his plan.”In one proposal rich with ideological overtones, Mr. McCain, who often complains that the Republicans have lost their way by not curtailing government spending, called for having wealthier Medicare recipients pay higher premiums to qualify for the prescription drug coverage that Mr. Bush and Congress added to the Medicare program a few years ago over his objections.“People like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett don’t need their prescriptions underwritten by taxpayers,” he said.The higher premiums for the drug benefit would not just be for billionaires, though. The campaign said the proposal called for charging them to single people earning more than $82,000 a year and married couples earning more than $164,000. Doing so, they said, would affect about 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries — about one million people — and net the government $2 billion over five years.Mr. McCain repeated his pledge to veto every bill that comes to his desk with earmarked pork-barrel projects in it, and called for a one-year freeze on increases in nonmilitary discretionary spending — a relatively small part of the overall federal budget — while he reviews every federal program, department and agency.'"
"'08-04-16,'1','Mr. McCain said that the savings from eliminating earmarks, reviewing federal programs and other budget reforms would be “on the order of $100 billion annually,” and that he would apply those savings to lowering business taxes. But it was unclear how Mr. McCain plans to pay for the other tax cuts that he outlined while the nation incurs large expenses fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.An analysis by the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank, estimated that the overall cost of Mr. McCain’s tax cuts would be three times as much as the $100 billion he estimates that he can save. And they questioned whether his programs would really save $100 billion a year.Mr. McCain also called for wealthier Medicare recipients to pay higher premiums to qualify for the prescription drug coverage that President Bush and the Congress added to the program a few years ago, over his objections.“People like Bill Gates and Warren Buffet don’t need their prescriptions underwritten by taxpayers,” he said. “Those who can afford to buy their own prescription drugs should be expected to do so. This reform alone will save billions of dollars that could be returned to taxpayers or put to better use.”The higher premiums for the drug benefit would not just apply to billionaires, though. The campaign said that the proposal calls for charging the higher premiums to single people earning more than $82,000 a year and married couples earning more than $164,000. Doing so, they said, would affect about 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries — about 1 million people — and net the government an additional $2 billion a year.Mr. McCain also called for state and federal action to make sure that the credit crunch does not make it harder for students to get loans for college.Mr. McCain took a few swipes at his Democratic rivals, Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton, for calling for a rollback of some of the Bush tax cuts. “They’re going to raise your taxes by thousands of dollars per year, and they have the audacity to hope you don’t mind,” he said, in an allusion to the title of one of Mr. Obama’s books, “The Audacity of Hope.”Mr. Obama’s spokesman, Bill Burton, responded: “Senator McCain’s economic plan offers no change from George Bush’s failed policies by going full speed ahead with fiscally irresponsible tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that John McCain himself one said ‘offended his conscience.’ He also proposes a gift basket of new tax cuts for corporate America at a time when some C.E.O.’s are making more in a day than some workers make in a year. John McCain’s plan is one that could have been written by the corporate lobbyists who run his campaign, and probably was.”Neera Tanden, the Clinton campaign’s policy director, called the McCain plan “a corporate lobbyist’s dream.” She said that Mr. McCain had proposed “an economic policy that Americans simply cannot afford,” based on corporate windfalls and tax cuts for the wealthy, and that ExxonMobil, which recently reported record profits, would get a $1.4 billion tax cut under the McCain plan.In his speech, Mr. McCain also reiterated his support of free trade, saying that while it poses challenges to the economy it also offers benefits by opening new markets to American goods.“That is why I object when Senators Obama and Clinton and others preach the false virtues of economic isolationism,” he said. “Senator Obama recently suggested that Americans are protectionist because they are bitter about being left behind in the global economy. Well, what’s his excuse for embracing the false promises of protectionism?”But while he called for a slew of tax cuts, Mr. McCain also suggested that he would be willing to break from some of the economic policies of the Reagan and Bush administrations. “In all of this, it will not be enough to simply dust off the economic policies of four, eight, or 28 years ago,” he said. “We have our own work to do. We have our own challenges to meet.”'"

"'08-04-16,'1','After a long delay and much back-and-forth with various American booking agents, Mr. Headley was able to secure a flight out of Dallas to Tulsa — a three-hour drive from his hometown — that evening. After plunking down nearly $100 for a rental car, he was able to make it back to Wichita by about 2:30 a.m. — roughly seven hours late. His bags, however, didn’t arrive until two days later.“Passengers on airlines are treated differently than other service customers,” he said. “Most customers have an opportunity to be face to face with a bona fide representative or the company itself. In the airline business, passengers are left to talk to gate agents or ticket counter employees. If they ever do get their complaint to higher levels, there is such an elaborate level of forms and letters and wait and wait. It’s one of the few pure customer businesses where the customer has very little connection with someone who can do something about their situation.”Passengers are entitled to a refund by law — even for a nonrefundable ticket — if they decide to cancel a trip because of a flight cancellation or significant nonweather-related change, like a delay of more than a day or a change from nonstop service to a flight with a stop. But with airplanes packed to near capacity these days, good luck finding an open seat on another flight for your family of four when chaos breaks out at the airport.“Each airline has its own policies about what it will do for delayed passengers waiting at the airport; there are no federal requirements,” according to “Fly-Rights: A Consumer Guide to Air Travel” from the Department of Transportation. After American grounded its MD-80s last week, some of its passengers were forced to wait as many as three days for a new flight before a seat became available.American issued an apology to its customers via e-mail for the thousands of flight cancellations, noting that it was providing meals, hotels and ground transportation for dislocated customers as well as vouchers for future travel for those stranded overnight.While it’s often in such extreme circumstances that the issue of passenger rights comes up, the fact is that airline passenger protections have slowly been eroding over the years. For example, after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress required competing airlines to charge passengers who had tickets on a failed airline only $25 for a one-way replacement ticket. (The fee was later raised to $50.) But as travelers holding tickets on suddenly defunct carriers like Aloha Airgroup, and Skybus Airlines recently found out, that safeguard, along with a law that gave passengers 60 days to ride standby at $50 each way, disappeared in 2006 after Congress let the requirement expire.The plight of passengers was acknowledged by a federal appellate court in three weeks ago, when ruling on a passenger bill of rights that would require airlines to provide food, water and bathrooms for passengers stuck in a grounded aircraft for more than three hours — as many were last February when parked planes for up to 10 hours during an ice storm. The court struck down a law, noting that, “Although the goals of the P.B.R. are laudable and the circumstances motivating its enactment deplorable, only the federal government has the authority to enact such a law.”Meanwhile, a similar bill introduced at the federal level was passed by the Senate Commerce Committee as part of the ’s budget reauthorization in May of last year. But the bill has been languishing for nearly a year now as the Senate cannot move forward on the legislation until the Finance and Commerce committees resolve the funding issues in the reauthorization.Ironically, some airlines are now trying to make money from passenger concerns about flight delays and cancellations.just introduced a new travel assistance service called On My Way. For $50 or $70 round trip, depending on the length of the flight, travelers get around-the-clock access to a dedicated group of specially trained Air Canada customer service agents who promise to rebook you on the first available flight on Air Canada or any other airline.The move highlights how the basic services offered by airlines to stranded passengers often fall short. In the regulated era, most airlines agreed to transfer a traveler of a canceled flight to another airline provided it could get the traveler to his or her destination sooner. This became known as the Rule 240 transfer. Today, each airline spells out its customer service commitments, including how it handles canceled flights, in a “contract of carriage.” A few carriers will transfer a passenger of a canceled flight to another airline if they don’t come up with another alternative within a specific amount of time. Others are less explicit.Delta, which labels its policy about flight delays and cancellations as Rule 240, states that it will transfer a passenger to another airline “at our sole discretion.” American says it will consider doing so only if it cannot provide a seat on one of its own flights, but doesn’t specify a time limit for finding passengers a seat.“They try to couch most everything in a way that gives them an out,” said Paul Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a nonprofit air passenger advocacy group, which helped defend the passenger bill of rights. “And that’s part of the reason we need a real bill of rights for passengers.”Perhaps the sheer customer neglect demonstrated by airlines could be forgiven if flights were on time, planes were impeccably clean, and bags were rarely lost. But the quality of overall airline service is the worst it’s ever been, according to the annual Airline Quality Rating survey co-authored by Mr. Headley of Wichita State and Brent Bowen of the at Omaha.The results of the latest survey, which is based on 2007 statistics from the Department of Transportation, were not shocking to anyone who has flown on a plane in the past year. More passengers were bumped off overcrowded planes, more bags were lost, fewer flights arrived on time and more travelers complained than in the previous year, the survey found. The researchers gave the industry a negative 2.16 overall quality score — the lowest in the nearly two decades they’ve been studying the airlines.Carriers say they do everything possible to take care of their customers at a time when their resources are being stretched to their limits by high fuel prices and other competitive pressures. “One of our primary missions right now, in the midst of this, is to make sure our customers are confident in our handling of this event,” Mark Mitchell, American’s managing director of customer experience, said of the airline’s recent flight cancellations. To win back customer loyalty, he added, American is offering a $500 travel voucher to customers who were inconvenienced in mid-journey with an overnight stay due to the cancellations.After customers were trapped on grounded planes during a February 2007 storm, JetBlue created its own “customer bill of rights” and promised to compensate passengers stuck onboard a grounded flight before it takes off for more than three hours with travel vouchers.For its part, the Department of Transportation also has formed a task force to come up with its own recommendations on how airlines should deal with planes stranded on the tarmac. It also has announced a new rule-making proposal to increase passenger rights and protections, including doubling the compensation for passengers who have reserved seats but are bumped from flights.For now, however, passengers are mostly left to fend for themselves when the airlines let them down. The Department of Transportation is urging customers who paid by credit cards for tickets on now defunct carriers like Skybus and ATA Airlines to file a claim with their credit card company.To minimize financial losses, more travelers are considering travel insurance that typically provides reimbursement for accommodations and expenses incurred because of covered travel delays as well as around-the-clock emergency travel hotlines for finding alternative transportation, help rebooking flights or making hotel and rental car reservations.Using an experienced travel agent can often help customers bypass long lines at the airport when chaos ensues and come up with an alternative when flights are canceled.George Hobica, founder of , recommends buying a backup ticket that is fully refundable, if you can afford it. “If your discounted American flight takes off, great: just get a refund on the United fare,” he recently posted on his blog. “But if American is a no go, you’ll get to your event on time.”'"

"'08-04-17,'1','The inquiry began just after the 4 p.m. shooting on Sunday, when Detective Nicholas Speranza of the Bronx Homicide Task Force and Detective Bulding went to Jacobi Medical Center to speak with Mr. Cruz, who had been shot in the right leg.Mr. Cruz said that he and Ms. Frazier had been robbed by a stranger after parking on a desolate street with their 14-month-old son, Alijah.The detectives took notes and asked Mr. Cruz to come back to the station house to help them in the investigation, which he did.At that point, detectives said, the case began to crack open.Mr. Cruz, 36, said his story of being robbed by a stranger was not true. For the first time, he mentioned his cousin, Mr. Miller, 25, whom the detectives had seen at the hospital. He said Mr. Miller, who was supposed to have met him at the parking spot, which is near Mr. Miller’s home, instead robbed him and shot him and Ms. Frazier.“Carlos was the first to admit that the story he gave wasn’t actually how it seemed,” said Lt. Kevin Moroney, the commander of the 43rd Precinct detective squad. “And he tried to implicate his cousin as doing a robbery and betraying him.”The detectives seized on the inconsistency.Mr. Miller, who had gone to the station house with other relatives, went upstairs to the squad room. Initially, he told detectives he was at his girlfriend’s house at the time of the shooting. But after hearing the account of Mr. Cruz — who detectives said was more like a brother than a cousin to him — he began to implicate himself, they said.In one office, Detectives Robert Martin and Michael Garrity spoke with Mr. Miller. In another, Detectives Bulding and Speranza and Detective Michael Tozzi spoke with Mr. Cruz.They gathered an account from one suspect and bounced it off the other to build the case, piece by piece. Mr. Cruz and Mr. Miller gave details that only someone familiar with the crime would know, detectives said. Each increasingly blamed the other, and pointed to the other as being the gunman.Then, after hours of conversation both probing and banal, Mr. Miller admitted that he had shot Ms. Frazier, detectives said.“And it was basically going back and forth then after that until we got both guys on the same page,” Detective Bulding said. “They gave different various statements through different courses of the night, and once we got them to have the same story, then we knew where we were.”An official from the office of the Bronx district attorney, Robert T. Johnson, was present at the station house throughout the interrogations. The suspects, who had waived their Miranda rights before being questioned, later made videotaped statements.As Mr. Cruz and Mr. Miller stood shackled, side by side, at their arraignment in the Bronx at 12:30 a.m. on Wednesday, they were silent. But a prosecutor, Douglas S. Meisel, recounted the statements they made to the detectives during the interrogations.Mr. Meisel told of Mr. Miller’s increasingly detailed description. Mr. Miller started off saying that his cousin had wanted to “bang his girl, Chelsea,” the prosecutor said. He then admitted being there and seeing the shooting, Mr. Meisel said, but tried to portray his involvement as merely spontaneous or unplanned.“I pulled up behind my cousin, and my cousin asked me to shoot him,” he said, according to the prosecutor’s account to Judge Judith Lieb.As for Mr. Cruz, his statements veered between a sense of sorrow and righteousness as he described what had occurred, according to the prosecutor’s account.“The plan was to shoot us both, with her injuries being more severe than mine,” he said at one point, according to Mr. Meisel.At another point, he said, “I planned to have Devon shoot Chelsea and shoot me.”In all their statements, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Miller never agreed on who provided the 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson used in the shooting. Each said the other had obtained it.After the two suspects confessed, detectives said, Mr. Miller led Detective Martin to a parking lot, at Willis Avenue and 138th Street, where the gun believed to have been used in the murder was found in a small plastic bag on the ground next to a car. Mr. Miller had dumped it there, he told detectives, hoping that someone would find it and take it. But it remained there for a day and a half. That surprised the detectives.“The old adage is that a gun doesn’t hit the ground for longer than 10 seconds in the Bronx,” one detective said.'"
"'08-04-17,'1','“I don’t know how much debt I was in, but I was in over my head,” Mr. Corbitt said. “I wasn’t trying to get out of my obligations; I was just defrauded.”Perhaps he was one of the luckier ones. In 2001, Mr. Spitzer said that more than 1,000 clients of Mr. Capoccia’s had been forced to declare bankruptcy.“I ended up taking care of my obligations the hard way,” Mr. Corbitt said. “I didn’t file for bankruptcy, and I didn’t miss a payment with the I.R.S.”He now turns to the formidable challenge of restoring an agency for which he worked for more than 25 years.The State Police came under scrutiny after a report by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo last summer that found that the administration of Governor Spitzer misused the agency while gathering travel documents on Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader and the state’s top Republican.Mr. Paterson, who took office on March 17 after Mr. Spitzer resigned amid a prostitution scandal, asked Mr. Cuomo late last month to conduct a sweeping review of the police to determine if it had been inappropriately collecting information on politicians, among other things.“Abuse of power is a terrible thing,” Mr. Corbitt said during his confirmation hearing on Tuesday. “What happened to Senator Bruno was inappropriate.”Even as Mr. Corbitt was confirmed, a high-ranking Republican senator, Dale M. Volker of the Buffalo area, raised new questions about the agency’s past during the confirmation hearing, saying he had been followed by someone affiliated with the State Police.“Sometimes I thought I was being paranoid, but I know I wasn’t being paranoid,” he said.A State Police spokesman had no comment on any aspect of the hearing.Mr. Volker, a former police officer, is chairman of the Senate’s codes committee, which has jurisdiction over law enforcement issues.Questions were also raised at the hearing about whether troopers should have reported Mr. Spitzer if they had evidence he was meeting with a prostitute. Mr. Corbitt said that troopers have a duty to report crimes to their superiors.He also said he would fully cooperate with Mr. Cuomo’s investigation and order an internal investigation of the agency’s executive service detail, which includes the governor’s security detail and the uniformed officers who patrol the Capitol.“The mission before me is basically to restore confidence not only to the senators and assemblymen, or Assembly people, but to the citizens of the State of New York,” Mr. Corbitt said. “That’s going to be a difficult task.”'"
"'08-04-17,'1','“I think boycotting Carrefour is a peaceful and polite way to express our anger, our Chinese feelings got deeply hurt by France,” said Li Meng, a 25-year-old mechanic who is selling T-shirts in support of the boycott movement in the city of Yantai, in eastern China. “France humiliated China during the torch relay and keeps making trouble for the Olympics.”American brands like McDonald’s and KFC have also been named as targets of a boycott because some American politicians seem to be supporting the Dalai Lama, whom Beijing blames for instigating violence in Tibet to disrupt plans for the Olympics.No one knows whether there is widespread support for the boycotts, but the opposition comes at a time when many of the world’s biggest brands — including Coke — are expanding aggressively in China and planning huge sales and marketing campaigns to coincide with the Olympics.Coca-Cola’s most recent quarterly results suggest the extent of its reliance on the Chinese market. During the first quarter, Coke’s unit case volume sales in China were up 20 percent in the quarter, one of the highest figures from any country. Over all, the company’s net income rose 19 percent in the quarter, to $1.5 billion, from $1.26 billion a year ago.Bill Pecoriello, research analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that 5 to 6 percent of Coke’s total revenue comes from China (Coca-Cola does not break out the figure).The importance of China for Coke should increase, Mr. Pecoriello said. He estimated that Coke sold 1.2 billion cases in China in 2007 and forecast that it would sell 1.5 billion cases there in 2008. That compares with larger but slower-growing sales in the United States: 5.4 billion cases in 2007 and 5.45 billion cases in 2008, Mr. Pecoriello said.Neither Coca-Cola nor any of the other Olympic sponsors has flinched in its public support for the games, but the groups that are protesting China’s policies in Tibet and Darfur are vowing to step up their pressure. This could lead to showdowns, or even to a possible whipsaw for the companies if Chinese youths start protesting en masse in the other direction.“We’re not asking Coke to solve Tibet’s problems,” Lhadon Tethong, the director of an organizing group called Students for a Free Tibet, told Mr. Isdell at the shareholder meeting on Wednesday. “We’re not asking you to do anything else but tell the I.O.C. this is not the time for the torch to go to Tibet.”Ms. Tethong added, “You have influence, and you know you have influence. Please don’t hide behind a spin.”Mr. Isdell — who will be succeeded by the company’s president and chief operating officer, Muhtar Kent, by the time the Olympics start in August — responded politely and at some length. “I want to thank you for your clarification and also for your declared integrity,” he said, adding that, technically, the route of the torch was not governed by the I.O.C., but by the Beijing Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games. On a philosophical note, Mr. Isdell added, “We still believe that the torch is a light of hope, and we trust that’s what it will be as it goes every single place in the world.”In the future, Mr. Isdell suggested, the company does still want to buy the world a Coke. “We are already a sponsor of the Olympic games — wherever they may go — through 2020, and I trust that will continue through 2028,” he said.Last week, several other sponsors, including Visa International, McDonald’s, Johnson & Johnson, Anheuser-Busch, Bank of America, Home Depot, United Parcel Service and AT&T reaffirmed their support of the Olympics and said that their marketing plans had not changed because of the protests.“As critical as Tibet is, I think sponsors are looking at the situation saying, ‘We’ve still got days to go,’ ” said Damien Ryan, director of Ryan Financial Communications, a Hong Kong media relations firm that has sponsors as clients. “Things can change quite quickly, and from their point of view, they realize that Beijing has got a long memory.”'"

"'08-04-17,'1','But Mr. Bush’s talk was also a slap at the Democratic-controlled Senate, which is about to consider legislation that would impose limits on emissions and allow companies to trade pollution credits — the so-called “cap and trade” approach. The White House vehemently opposes that approach, a point Mr. Bush restated on Wednesday.“Bad legislation would impose tremendous costs on our economy and on American families without accomplishing important climate change goals we share,” Mr. Bush warned.But rather than outlining his own legislative proposal, Mr. Bush emphasized advances in technology, like clean-coal energy, wind power and farm-grown fuels like ethanol, as a means to achieving emissions reductions. As he has in the past, he said the route to reducing emissions was through the free market and incentives for companies to invest — as opposed to mandates or new taxes.“The wrong way is to raise taxes, duplicate mandates, or demand sudden and drastic emissions cuts that have no chance of being realized and every chance of hurting our economy,” he said. “The right way is to set realistic goals for reducing emissions consistent with advances in technology.”Climate change is emerging as a powerful issue in the presidential race, with all the candidates, including Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, on record as supporting some kind of “cap-and-trade” program.The chief sponsors of the Senate bill, Senators John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, said they expected their legislation to go forward.Experts say that under the Warner-Lieberman bill, overall emissions in 2025 would drop from 2005 levels by as much as 32 percent.“The train is moving toward legislation to control heat-trapping gases in the U.S.,” David Sandalow, an expert on climate change who worked for the Clinton administration, said in reaction to the speech. “President Bush’s announcement appears to be an effort to throw sand in the gears, offering a weak goal in place of strong legislation.”Mr. Bush has faced international criticism for his views on climate change since the beginning of his presidency. He has steadfastly rejected the so-called Kyoto Protocol, which limits emissions of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide, on the ground that China and India — two of the world’s biggest polluters — were not bound by the accord in the same way as the United States would be if it joined. Instead, Mr. Bush emphasized a voluntary approach to reducing the gas emissions.Experts say it is unlikely that Mr. Bush could reach his goal of flattening emissions by 2025 without some kind of mandatory cap. Michael Oppenheimer, an author on several of the recent reports from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a climate expert at Princeton University, said that even if Mr. Bush somehow set the country on track to meet his target, he was sending the wrong signal to other nations.“U.S. failure to do more than stabilize emissions by 2025 likely means other developed countries won’t do any more than that, and that then ripples through to China’s position,” Mr. Oppenheimer said, adding that it is difficult to see how the world could avoid dangerous warming and sea-level rise under the Bush proposal.'"

"'08-04-17,'1','It is probably safe to say that regulation — especially when it comes to its friends in business and industry — is one of the Bush administration’s least favorite government responsibilities. So it should come as no surprise that even as the financial sector’s recklessness is tipping the economy into crisis, the Securities and Exchange Commission seems to be bending over backward to not discomfit the banks and firms it regulates.As Jenny Anderson reported in The Times last week, Wall Street’s watchdog has been rather unzealous in its pursuit of corporate malfeasance since Christopher Cox, the former Republican congressman, took the helm in 2005.Like other regulatory agencies, the S.E.C.’s enforcement division has had its budget cut in recent years and its staffing level has dropped, making it harder to do the necessary work. But staff lawyers also complain of commissioners overruling the findings of the S.E.C.’s enforcement division to water down fines and payments. In one instance, JPMorgan Chase had agreed to pay a $25 million settlement only to have the commissioners overrule the deal, reducing the bill to $2 million.Mr. Cox defends his agency, arguing that last year the S.E.C. brought the most corporate penalty cases in its history. Still, Ms. Anderson reported that penalties against individuals and firms fell by almost half last year, to $505 million. The S.E.C. also ordered companies to give up about $1.1 billion in ill-gotten gains last year, down from $2.4 billion in 2006. Democratic Senators Christopher Dodd and Jack Reed have asked Congressional investigators to look into the S.E.C.’s enforcement operations and particularly the sharp decline in penalties. We are eager to hear what they find out.The Bush administration has belatedly seized on the idea of regulatory reform for financial markets — but not before the housing crisis and credit crunch have wreaked havoc on the economy and the lives of far too many Americans. Whatever happens with future reform, the White House must ensure that current regulators take their jobs a lot more seriously.'"
"'08-04-17,'1','At a hearing here Wednesday, regulators indicated that the fee could raise $1.1 million annually. Refineries, power plants and cement plants would pay nearly 90 percent of total fees. The largest gas stations might be charged $1 a year; the Safeway bakery that supplies bread to all stores in the Bay Area would pay $85 a year.The biggest emitter of the gases, the Shell oil refinery in Martinez, would have to pay $195,355, based on 2005 emissions of 4.4 million metric tons.Regulators said the fee was designed to recoup costs associated with developing carbon dioxide controls, like compiling an inventory of regional emissions. The 850 facilities that would be affected by the new fee already pay a variety of other fees to obtain operating permits.At Wednesday’s hearing Linda Weiner, representing the Bay Area Clean Air Task Force, embraced the fee, saying, “We believe it sets a precedent as the first time that businesses and government agencies would face financial consequences for contributing to global warming.”But Dennis Bolt, of the Western States Petroleum Association, said that the agency was overstepping its authority and that the fee was likely to create duplication and confusion with the suite of climate-change measures being developed by the state’s Air Resources Board.“This just raises more uncertainty at a time of increasing uncertainties,” Mr. Bolt said. “It’s not productive.”Jack Broadbent, the executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management District, said lawyers for the district had been consulting with their counterparts at the Air Resources Board. The board, based in Sacramento, is charged with devising a way to carry out the landmark 2006 law mandating a cutback in emissions of heat-trapping gases.The board, Mr. Broadbent said, “hasn’t said this is not part of your responsibility. But it hasn’t said it is.”At Wednesday’s meeting, the district’s chairman, Jerry Hill, said, “My intention is we will go forward with this” fee, but Mr. Hill added that if the state air board imposed overlapping fees as part of its regulatory package, “we will integrate ours with theirs.”Annually, the nine-county area of the air quality district, which stretches from the wine-producing area of Sonoma County in the north to the expanding suburbs of Solano County in the east and southward through Silicon Valley in Santa Clara County, emits 85.4 million tons of carbon dioxide, according to a report by the air quality district’s staff.About half of the total comes from motor vehicles, which are not regulated by the air quality district.An earlier mandate by the Air Resources Board to cut tailpipe emissions of heat-trapping gases was effectively vetoed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency in December.'"
"'08-04-17,'1','Autechre pumped out colossal dance beats throughout its set at the Music Hall of Williamsburg on Tuesday night. It didn’t have to.Over its 15-year recording career, Autechre, the electronica duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth, has moved from steady, propulsive techno toward more abstract rhythms and textures, building an audience of fans who don’t mind standing still (or wearing earphones) as they listen.Most of Autechre’s latest album, “Quaristice” (Warp), is far too cerebral for a typical club D.J. set; the music often splinters the beat or omits it entirely. But Autechre hasn’t forgotten how to make a crowd move and shout, and it does that on its own terms.Its hourlong set — performed on a darkened stage, with barely enough light for Mr. Brown and Mr. Booth to work their few pieces of equipment — was crammed with ideas. For a few moments there were just hovering, sustained tones. Then the beat started, and so did the brilliant musical overload.Autechre’s music was constantly multitasking. Where much dance music is stripped down, Autechre’s set bristled with extras. If typical techno wears blinders, Autechre’s music was awash in peripheral vision. Alongside the foreground of beat and riff, there was a constantly changing counterpoint of hisses; sputters; indecipherable sampled voices; long, low throbs; unpatterned synthesizer lines and looming, implacable dissonances.Autechre is familiar with club music; it alluded to the blips of electro, the reggae undercurrent of drum and bass, the boom-bap of hip-hop, the African-tinged rhythms of tribal house and the headbanging acceleration of rave techno. None of it escaped Autechre’s own rigorous approach.'"

"'08-04-17,'1','A. There are plenty of fads in the design world but bamboo flooring seems different. It is increasingly being used in both remodeling and new construction because it makes practical sense.Bamboo is popular with some designers because of its sleek appearance. It is “more subtle, less ‘knotty’ ” than other wood, said Roger Ferris, an architect in Westport, Conn. “It’s not something you’re typically used to seeing. That makes it really suitable for contemporary and modern design schemes.”Steve Appolloni, a designer in Albuquerque, N.M., likes it for its “durability, cost, eco-friendly qualities and, depending on the source, its thickness and quality.”Bamboo is much denser than oak, Mr. Appolloni said, so it makes for a stronger floor that doesn’t warp as much. It is also less expensive than many other woods. (The average bamboo floor costs about $5 to $7 a square foot, not including installation, whereas walnut or pine can cost nearly $10 a square foot.) Because bamboo plants take only about five years to mature, unlike many trees, which can take 50 years or more, bamboo is environmentally sustainable.Like most woods, though, it can vary in quality, depending on the manufacturer and the finishing technique. Solid bamboo floors, which are the most durable, tend to be more expensive, and can cost as much as $9 a square foot. Engineered bamboo floors, which have multiple layers, can run as low as $3 a square foot, but the quality might not be as high.If you decide on an engineered floor, Mr. Appolloni recommends choosing one with a quarter-inch-thick top layer to ensure maximum durability. “And read the warranty carefully,” he said, noting that some manufacturers will replace floors that show premature wear.'"
"'08-04-17,'1','“I know,” I agreed, a certain unattainable Alexander McQueen bag stabbing into my memory.“Who can go in that place?”It’s true: Dumbo is lousy with them. They travel in packs of two and three, pushing five-digit-sticker-price strollers full of two-foot martinets named Sophie and Henry. They all seem jobless, but with limitless discretionary funds and rare bloodline pugs.Dumbo shops fall all over themselves to cater to them. Stylish nursery items of the Toddler Moderne variety are everywhere: Barcelona highchairs; rosewood alphabet blocks carved with English and Mandarin stock abbreviations; limited Bösendorfer editions of the classic wheeled xylophone.I want to write them a pop-up reference book: “Kids Who Know Wine.”I sometimes drift into Zoë, despite its clientele and its absurdly expensive handbags (which, for all their glory, unceremoniously clutter one end of the window as if waiting unclaimed at La Guardia). The store has a pleasingly vast and crowded inventory: racks smashed to capacity with well-chosen designer pieces I’d describe as “deceptive daytime casual.” Oh, this silly old thing I tie plastic bags on and wear to the dog park? It’s Prada.Zoë’s windows bloomed into spring with a Miu Miu silk micro-minidress soaring hazardously over the thighs, and another garment representing this season’s popular splatter-stained floral, apparently designed for both high tea and paintball.The shop seems reluctant to phase out the maternity blouson look favored by pre- and postnatal mothers, body-dysmorphic Hollywood actresses and its otherwise slightly lumpy customers. This worm is beginning to turn, though, in the shoe department, where, next to the usual height-stunting ballet flats (which I loathe), there are now excellently severe, nasty black-diamond-skill-level Lanvin open-toe platforms with a six-inch heel like a plywood prison knife ($917).Towering Chloé wedgies had big slices of icy Lucite embedded in the wooden heel ($945). I lusted after strappy gold Miu Miu platforms until I saw that the heels sarcastically resembled a bamboo placemat.“I liked those, too,” said my young sales assistant, in her deconstructed James Perse T-shirt, “but I was afraid they’d make me look like a tranny.”“That is something I have never been afraid of,” I told her. “The line between drag queens and actual women during my formative years was blurred at best.”A trend that I suspected was emerging is now in full bloom: clothes that look as if they should be worn by Dust Bowl sharecroppers. Thin cotton sackcloth dresses with button-up Sunday school collars in neutered retro-plaids with unfinished edges seem to say, “You come into my yard and bust up this chifforobe.”An A.P.C. skort-jumper was composed of a denim ordinarily associated with freight-yard labor ($310). A Moschino shirtdress seemed to be made of discarded mattress ticking ($1,395). A kimono dress by Derek Lam evoked the washwomen of feudal Japanese warlords ($1,390). A tiny Prada jacket in wadded leather with an elastic waistband is probably what all the A-list plumbers in post-Soviet Munchkinland are wearing these days ($2,780).But saddest of all were the Marni dresses.

"'08-04-17,'1','A team of Italian and Chinese physicists on Wednesday renewed a controversial claim that they had detected the mysterious dark matter particles that astronomers say swaddle the galaxies in halos and direct the evolution of the universe.The team, called Dama, from “DArk MAtter,” and led by Rita Bernabei of the University of Rome, has maintained since 2000 that a yearly modulation in the rate of flashes in a detector nearly a mile underneath the Gran Sasso mountain in Italy is the result of the Earth’s passage through a “wind” of dark matter particles as it goes around the Sun. Other groups of hunters of dark matter have just as consistently failed to find any evidence of the putative particles.At a meeting in Venice, Dr. Bernabei reported that a new, bigger experiment named Dama/Libra had now observed the same modulation. “No other experiment whose result can be directly compared in a model-independent way is available so far,” she said. The findings increase the chances that the modulation is real, outside dark matter experts say.Dark matter has taunted astronomers and physicists ever since the astronomer Fritz Zwicky of the California Institute of Technology pointed out in the 1930s that clusters of galaxies appear to be missing enough visible matter to hold them together gravitationally. Speculation has centered on the possibility that the dark matter consists of hypothetical elementary particles left over from the Big Bang — so-called WIMPs, or weakly interacting massive particles, that are immune to most forces of nature and so can pass through us and the Earth like ghosts.The Dama team uses sodium iodide, which flashes light when a WIMP smashes into it, as a detector. The first experiment, which ran from 1996 to 2002, had 220 pounds of sodium iodide; the second — which began in 2003 — 500 pounds. In both cases, Dr. Bernabei and her colleagues found that the rate of flashes was highest in June and lowest in December. Loud skepticism by the rest of the dark matter community about Dama’s claims in 2000 led to hard feelings, apparent on the group’s Web site, people.roma2.infn.it/dama/web/home.htmlBernard Sadoulet, a rival dark matter hunter of the University of California, Berkeley, who was present at the conference, said of the new results, “The tension between the measurements of this group and the rest of the community is increasing.” He added that it would take time to digest Dama’s results.Juan Collar of the University of Chicago, a member of another dark matter hunting team, said people were excited about the new results. “You wouldn’t put your hand on fire that this is wimps,” he said, but agreed that some kinds of WIMPs were still among many possibilities, including that the experiment was in error.'"
"'08-04-17,'1','On March 6, 1970, a bomb explosion destroyed a Greenwich Village town house, killing three members of the radical Weather Underground and driving other members of the group even deeper into hiding. On Wednesday night, those events emerged as the focus of a sharp exchange between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama at their debate in Philadelphia.Mr. Obama was asked by a moderator, George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, about his relationship with Bill Ayers, a former Weather Underground leader who is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago. In the early 1970s, the Weathermen, who took their name from a line in a Bob Dylan song, claimed responsibility for bombing the Capitol, the Pentagon, the State Department Building and banks, courthouses and police stations.Mr. Ayers is married to Bernardine Dohrn, another Weather Underground figure. Both were indicted in 1970 for inciting to riot and conspiracy to bomb government buildings, but charges were dropped in 1974 because of prosecutorial misconduct, including illegal surveillance.Mr. Ayers is listed as a member of the nine-member board of the Woods Fund of Chicago, an offshoot of the Woods Charitable Fund, founded in 1941 by a prominent lawyer and telephone company executive. According to the fund’s Web site, it has focused in recent years on “issues that affected the area’s least advantaged, including welfare reform, affordable housing” and “tax policy as a tool in reducing poverty.”For a time, Mr. Obama was on the board with Mr. Ayers, though he no longer has a formal association with the group. At the debate, he described Mr. Ayers as “a guy who lives in my neighborhood,” but “not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis.” Mr. Obama said he was being unjustly linked to “somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old.”'"

"'08-04-18,'1','Of course, the authors acknowledge the resolution would have little real influence were the matter of Mr. McCain’s eligibility hanging by a legal thread. Mr. Leahy is skeptical it is needed at all since he believes there is already no doubt Mr. McCain meets the standard. But he said he is willing to take the extra step.“We just want to make it very clear,” said Mr. Leahy.The matter arises, as they say in legal circles, because the Founding Fathers inserted the cryptic phrase “natural born Citizen” into the Constitution when listing the elementary requirements for seeking the presidency of the new nation. Given the absence of C-Span coverage of the deliberations, it has been a bit of mystery ever since just exactly what the founders meant by that phrase.At various points in the country’s history, it was widely assumed that it meant a presidential candidate must have been born to American citizens on the soil of any of what would become or are now the 50 states. It wasn’t so much a matter of citizenship as geography. Mr. McCain is indisputably a citizen.Through the years, some potential candidates took themselves out of the running because of their birth on something other than American soil. Those who were born elsewhere and ran never made it to the finish line so the issue was never fully tested or clarified. Some legal scholars say its meaning is still in doubt.As a result, should Mr. McCain be elected, he would be the first president not born within what became the continental United States. He was instead born in the Canal Zone in 1936 when his father, a Naval officer, was stationed there.Mr. McCain has dismissed any question of his eligibility as long settled. Many others consider the matter nonsense, saying it seems unlikely the founding fathers were interested in banning the offspring of military personnel stationed abroad from serving as president. (Of course, they probably didn’t envision having armies overseas since foreign occupation was one of the reasons they were unhappy with Great Britain in the first place.)The Senate resolution concedes the term natural born was not defined in the Constitution but notes there is also no evidence the intent was to ban someone like Mr. McCain, a war hero and long-time public servant.“The well-being of all citizens of the United States is preserved and enhanced by the men and women who are assigned to serve our country outside of our national borders,” says the resolution.Since the issue was visited in a New York Times article in February, at least three lawsuits have been filed, with cases still active in California and New Hampshire.But two of the top legal minds in the country say Mr. McCain has nothing to worry about. In a joint analysis, former Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson, a McCain adviser, and Harvard professor Laurence Tribe, an Obama supporter, determined the “circumstances of Senator McCain’s birth satisfy the original meaning and intent of the Natural Born Citizen Clause as confirmed by subsequent legal precedent and historical practice.”The men put a lot of stock in the fact that British law at the time held that children born abroad to natural born subjects were also natural-born subjects of the monarch.“The Framers substituted the word ‘citizen’ for ‘subject’ to reflect the shift from monarchy to democracy, but the Supreme Court has recognized that the two terms are otherwise identical,” said an analysis issued by the lawyers last month.They also note that Charles Curtis, who was vice president during the Hoover administration, was born in Kansas when it was a territory. Since the 12th Amendment requires that “no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of president shall be eligible to that of vice president,” they argue the precedent is already set for someone born within United States territory but outside the states to qualify for president.Many who have studied the issue say it can only be definitively resolved by a Constitutional amendment.“Obviously, we are not going to get the Constitution amended in the next two or three months,” said Ms. McCaskill, who was driven to clear up any ambiguity after learning of the potential problem. “We are just trying to send the strongest signal we can as quickly and simply as we can.”'"
"'08-04-18,'1','“If states are unable to guarantee such protection,” the pope said, “the international community must intervene with the juridical means provided in the United Nations charter and in other international instruments.” In an apparent allusion to countries that claim such international actions constitute intervention in their national affairs, he said instead they “should never be interpreted as an unwarranted imposition or a limitation of sovereignty.”He added, “On the contrary, it is indifference or failure to intervene that do the real damage.”On his fourth day in America —and his first visit as pope — Benedict traveled north from Washington on “Shepherd One,” the Alitalia papal plane, to New York, where he will visit ground zero and celebrate Mass at Yankee Stadium before departing for Rome on Sunday night. He was greeted by Cardinal Edward C. Egan, head of the New York archdiocese, and a host of state and Catholic officials at a low-key ceremony on the tarmac of Kennedy International Airport.After traveling by helicopter and motorcade to the United Nations, Benedict delivered a speech that touched on themes important both to his three-year-old papacy and his decades of writing as Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.At base, the pope presented the idea that there are universal values that transcend the diversity — cultural, ethnic or ideological — embodied in an institution like the United Nations, founded to help prevent the ruin of another world war. Those values are at the base of human rights, he said, as they are for religion. Thus religion, he said, cannot be shut out of a body like the United Nations, which he said aims at “a social order respectful of the dignity and rights of the person.”“A vision of life firmly anchored in the religious dimension can help achieve this, since recognition of the transcendent value of every man and woman favors conversion of heart, which then leads to a commitment to resist violence, terrorism, war and to promote justice and peace,” he said.Benedict was introduced to the thronged General Assembly hall by Mr. Ban, who called the United Nations a secular institution but is “home to all men and women of faith around the world.”Mr. Ban said the pope supported many of the goals of the United Nations, such as climate change, world peace, the eradication of poverty, and maintaining a dialogue among the world’s religions. The speech to the General Assembly is a papal tradition: Pope Paul VI made an appearance in 1965, and Pope John Paul II in 1979 and 1995.On Friday afternoon, Benedict met with members of the local Jewish clergy at the Park East Synagogue, a historic Upper East Side Orthodox congregation founded by Austro-Hungarian Jews in 1890. It was the first papal visit to a synagogue in this country, and only two other visits have ever been recorded, both in Europe.Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor who has led the synagogue since 1962, greeted Benedict and told him that his visit was “a reaffirmation of your outreach, good will, and commitment to enhancing Jewish-Catholic relations.” He presented Benedict with a silver seder plate and a box of matzoh, just in time for Passover, which begins on Saturday.“The Jewish community make a valuable contribution to the life of the city,” the pope told the crowded congregation, “and I encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood.”The pope then met and posed for photographs with several prominent Jewish New Yorkers, including Edward I. Koch, the former mayor. Benedict is expected to lead a prayer service on Friday evening at the Church of St. Joseph, also on the Upper East Side.So far, Benedict’s American journey has been notable for a willingness by the pope to address the sexual abuse scandals of the past decade, which have left lasting wounds for many American Catholics.In Washington on Thursday, the pope held an unannounced meeting with several victims of abuse by priests in the Boston area. The pope himself had requested the meeting, said the official, the Rev. Federico Lombardi, which took place at the papal nuncio’s residence. The pope prayed and spoke personally to the handful of victims who attended, in a meeting that lasted about 25 minutes. Some wept, Father Lombardi said.The meeting made clear that for all the messages that Benedict wished to send during his brief time in the United States, the one concerning priestly abuse was most central. He raised the issue first with reporters on his trip from Rome on Tuesday, and did so for a third time Thursday morning during a huge open Mass at Nationals Stadium before nearly 50,000 people, his first major encounter with America’s diverse church.“No words of mine could describe the pain and harm inflicted by such abuse,” the pope said in his homily. “It is important that those who have suffered be given loving pastoral attention.”But some abuse victims in the New York area have largely ignored the pope’s visit and say they are dubious about his public pronouncements about how deeply he has been affected by the crisis, even questioning the motives behind his meeting on Thursday.Jim Hackett, of Cheshire, Conn., who waited 30 years before going public with his account of abuse by a priest, said he is still waiting for Benedict to publicly articulate specific steps the church will take to help prevent others from suffering the way he did.Mr. Hackett and other abuse victims planned to stage vigil on Friday outside a SoHo art gallery displaying an exhibit of photographs of victims. As Benedict addressed the United Nations, Robert Costello, who said he was abused by a priest in West Roxbury, Mass., starting at age 10, planned to read aloud the names of victims.For years, victims of abuse in the United States had beseeched the Vatican for a meeting with the pope, first asking John Paul II, who died in 2005, and finally, six years after the outbreak of the scandal, one was granted. The scandal affected nearly every diocese in America, revealed more than 5,000 abusive priests and more than 13,000 victims and has cost the church more than $2 billion in settlements and legal fees. It also has cost the church trust and respect, both of which the pope clearly hopes to restore.Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley of Boston, who organized Thursday’s meeting and attended, gave the pope a notebook listing some 1,000 boys and girls who had been abused in the Boston Archdiocese alone going back several decades, a Vatican official said.“The fact that we finally got the pope to actually stand up and put a statement on record, I really think he set the bar this week,” said Gary Bergeron, who said he had been abused by a priest in Lowell, Mass.Mr. Bergeron, author of the book “Don’t Call Me a Victim,” traveled to Rome in 2003 and tried to meet with Pope John Paul II, with no success. “We made some progress this week, and that’s what’s important,” he said.Mitchell Garabedian, an attorney who represented hundreds of people abused by priests, none of whom attended the meeting with the pope, said he hoped that the pontiff would meet with more victims.“He certainly will need more than a half hour to understand the pain victims are feeling because of being sexually abused by priests,” he said.While some abuse survivors were encouraged to hear of the encounter, others said they would not feel comforted until the church calls bishops and those in the hierarchy to account.In Washington on Thursday, Benedict also gave a substantial address to Catholic educators, many of whom have been struggling with money shortages, changing missions and conflicts over whether Catholic schools are Catholic enough. He spoke to about 200 college presidents and the superintendents of Catholic schools in the nation’s 195 dioceses.In his speech, the Pope did not refer explicitly to recent controversies over what kinds of curriculums, outside speakers, campus clubs, and artistic expression are acceptable at a Catholic institution. But he said that church teachings must shape “all aspects of an institution’s life, both inside and outside the classroom,” in an insistence on adherence to church doctrine that Benedict stresses for Catholics in all parts of their lives, from their personal behavior to what kind of politicians they support.Benedict had additional healing work to do at his evening encounter with Muslim, Jewish, Buddhist, Hindu and Jain religious leaders. On a previous trip, to his German homeland, Benedict set off a paroxysm of anger with comments that appeared to denigrate Islam. He has also offended Jewish leaders by reinstituting a prayer for the conversion of the Jews in the Latin prayers on Good Friday.On Thursday, he attempted to offer an olive branch to Jewish leaders, and affirmed that all religions should have a common goal of working for peace. But he also issued a challenge, saying that interfaith dialogue that does not deal with existential “truth” is insufficient. And he talked of the need to protect religious freedom, pointing out that religious minorities in some countries are subject to discrimination and prejudice.'"
"'08-04-18,'1','The Conference Board said another of its indexes, which measures current economic activity, has also deteriorated in recent months, with weakness becoming more widespread among the components of both.The readings suggest “economic weakness is likely to continue in the near term,” Ken Goldstein, a labor economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement accompanying the report.The jobless numbers told the same story. The four-week average for jobless claims was 376,000, down only slightly from 376,750, the previous week. Aside from the period in the fall of 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, the four-week average for claims has risen to levels last seen in 2003 when the country was mired in a long jobless recovery after the 2001 recession.Meanwhile, the weakest business outlook report since 2001 from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve added to pessimism. The Philadelphia Fed regional survey of manufacturing demand and plans for capital spending showed new factory orders, shipments and employment dropping, its fifth straight reading below zero. A figure above zero indicates regional manufacturing is growing, while a number below zero indicates a decline.The index deteriorated from 17.4 in March to 24.9 this month. In the past, such streaks have indicated the economy is either in a recession or on the verge of falling into one, according to a Bear Stearns economist, John Ryding.Of the companies in the survey, 38 percent reported decreased activity in March, while demand for manufactured goods fell 18.8 percent.Cost increases continue to be widespread, according to the report, and more firms reported increased prices for their own manufactured goods this month.'"
"'08-04-18,'1','The CIT Group, a commercial lender hit hard by the credit crisis, posted a quarterly loss Thursday and said it would sell off chunks of itself and cut its dividend 60 percent to shore up capital.Its stock rose as investors got a better idea of what to expect in the coming quarters and took heart that the company appeared to be making some progress in dealing with its credit problems.CIT also said it was in discussions with three or four financial institutions for additional financing.The company reduced its quarterly dividend to 10 cents a share, from 25 cents, to bolster its balance sheet and preserve capital. CIT — which said in March that it had drawn down its entire $7.3 billion of bank lines — posted a first-quarter net loss of $257.2 million, or $1.35 a share, in contrast to a year-earlier profit of $200.6 million, or $1.01 a share.Excluding items, the company posted a profit of 19 cents a share, falling short of analysts’ expectation of 30 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.CIT said it agreed to sell $4.6 billion of asset-based loan commitments, on which $1.4 billion is currently drawn, and $770 million worth of aircraft.

She was 77.She died of pneumonia at the Motion Picture and Television Country House, a retirement home, said David Permut, a movie producer and longtime friend.“I hate to say it, but kids are pieces of meat,” Ms. Burton said in a 1984 People magazine article about child stars. “I’ve never had anything but filet mignon.

"'08-04-18,'1','The incident, largely unpublicized in the West, has crystallized the outrage and humiliation felt by many Chinese who have been stunned by the torch’s hostile reception as it hopscotches the globe. Although recent stops in Argentina, Tanzania, Oman, Pakistan and India went off smoothly, there were concerns about future stops, including Australia.“It’s just appalling that people would tarnish an event that the Chinese people have been awaiting for so long,” said Wu Tianren, 79, a retired economics professor, walking in a park here freshly planted with petunias and marigolds. “This makes us very sad.”Many people here, reflecting the state-controlled media’s point of view, believe that the demonstrators are acting at the behest of the Dalai Lama, who they say is seeking Tibetan independence, despite his assertions to the contrary. Another target of public anger is the French, who are accused of encouraging Tibetan rights advocates and failing to protect the torch.Internet message boards have been brewing with anger. A text message campaign is urging a boycott of French products and companies, especially Carrefour, a supermarket chain here.“The power of an individual is very small and limited, but if we get 1.3 billion Chinese united, anyone and any country would be shocked by our power,” read a posting on Yahoo by someone identified only as Liuanna.Foreign news outlets have been besieged by angry callers accusing them of running reports that glorify the Tibetan demonstrators and belittle the Chinese government. The state-controlled news media have stoked the fury through occasionally shrill coverage, feeding nationalist sentiment that often simmers beneath the surface of Chinese society.On the capital’s streets, the anger is palpable, lurching between indignation and wounded pride. Many people said they were unaware of the protests until they learned about the plight of Ms. Jin, the disabled torch bearer.Until then, coverage of the relay within China had been glowing, mostly omitting images of the anti-Chinese protests that have been a staple of Western television broadcasts.Those who knew about the demonstrations surrounding the torch relay seemed to conflate the chaos in Paris and London with foreign coverage of the rioting in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa. They said those news accounts of the riots had been blatantly sympathetic toward the Tibetans, despite their role — according to official government accounts — in the deaths of 19 people, most of them Han Chinese.“The media should be telling the truth, not injecting their point of view into reports,” said Yang Guang, 23, an electrical engineer. “I think they’re just trying to make China look bad”Public protests are rare in Beijing, so the sight of screaming demonstrators on television seems all the more jarring. For most Chinese, the Olympics are a sacred event, which they hope will showcase their country’s growing economic might and inspire new international respect.There is little sympathy on the streets of Beijing for Tibetan rights advocates. The idea that Tibet is an inseparable part of China is firmly entrenched, and many people resent what they view as ingratitude among Tibetans, who receive subsidies from the central government. To the average Beijing resident, the concept of an independent Tibet is as outlandish as, say, the notion of making Arizona a separate nation for the Navajo Indians.“You don’t hear Chinese interfering in America’s domestic affairs,” said Jiang Shuisheng, 26, a computer salesman taking a cigarette break. He said he was particularly unhappy with the United States, which he accused of maintaining a double standard on human rights. He cited the war in Iraq, which he said had caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of innocent people.Referring to a tense period between China and the United States over Taiwan, a close American ally, Mr. Jiang said, “When you had your Olympics in Atlanta in 1996, you didn’t see Chinese people ruining the event because they were unhappy about your government’s policy.”He acknowledged that the state media were using Ms. Jin to heighten national pride, but added that this was justified. “I’m not a nationalist, but if this happened to an American, it would be no different,” he said.None of the dozens who were interviewed acknowledged a contradiction between their desire for China’s acceptance as an equal among modern nations and the government’s suppression of dissent. College students, retirees and those in the newly rich entrepreneurial class agreed that anyone seeking to spoil the Games should be silenced.Bai Ru, 22, a business management student originally from Inner Mongolia, said she trusted the government to take whatever measures were necessary to ensure a seamless Olympics. She said personal sacrifice, including stifling one’s dissatisfaction with the political status quo, was for the collective good.“If the government takes harsh measures to crack down on protesters, of course I support that,” she said. “This is an issue of national pride and national esteem. The Olympics are our best opportunity for the outside world to see how far we’ve come.”'"
"'08-04-18,'1','DETROIT — A strike by about 2,300 members of the United Automobile Workers union at a General Motors plant near Lansing has halted production of three popular vehicles that have been bright spots in an otherwise dismal market.The strike, which began Thursday morning after talks broke down between G.M. and U.A.W.

"'08-04-18,'1','¶ Benji, a gay man from Indiana who became known as the Mayor of Sylvia’s. He was kicked out of the house after his father, who lived in New York, learned he was gay, and became a user and seller of crystal meth. He contracted H.I.V. from a boyfriend, a lawyer and drug user who became abusive.In the introduction, the Rev. Pat Bumgardner, the pastor of the Metropolitan Community Church of New York, whose church is part of a spiritual movement that ministers to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, writes that some studies have estimated that as many as 30,000 young people are homeless in New York City — and that about one-third identify themselves, in some way, as “queer.” Such youths are more likely to become victims of violence, abuse drugs, be infected with H.I.V. or become mentally ill than homeless youths who are straight, according to the Empire State Coalition, an advocacy group for homeless and runaway youngsters in New York.It was to meet the particular needs of this population that Ms. Bumgardner founded Sylvia’s Place in March 2003. The shelter was named for Sylvia Rivera, an important figure in the gay liberation movement who died of cancer at age 50 in February 2002.For the four principal subjects of the book — all in their early or mid-20s now — much is still uncertain. Malice, who was in a coma for more than a month after the beating, briefly went home to Florida to live with his mother — only to discover that she and her boyfriend were using crack cocaine. He now lives in Virginia Beach on federal disability benefits.Charlene lives in an apartment in New York City but still hangs out at the shelter. Eternity moved upstate and found a stable job. Benji’s whereabouts are unknown, but he “shows up occasionally at the shelter and seems to be doing better,” Mr. Michaels said.Mr. Michaels, who turns 28 this month, has a biography as eventful as those of the young people in the book.He was born in Greenville, Ohio, but grew up, in poverty, in Detroit with three brothers and their mother. (He was born Lucky Stephen Henderson but was known growing up as Stephen John Henderson; he legally changed his name, to Lucky Stephen Michaels, as a teenager.) After his mother fled an abusive domestic situation, the family briefly stayed at a women’s shelter in Detroit. Mr. Michaels finished junior high and high school in Traverse City, Mich., where his mother still lives.“I feel lucky to survive as long as I did in the environment I did,” Mr. Michaels said. “The one thing I never really had was peer support — somebody there to help me out. I had my brothers, but they were in the same predicament I was. Ever since I was little, I always wanted to be the person who helped others out. My art tends to be my way of escaping all that I deal with at the shelter. I also thrive off of being able to help these kids. It relates back to my childhood.” He began volunteering at the shelter when it first opened in 2002, while he was a student at Parsons the New School for Design.He said his project grew out of his closeness with his subjects. “My first priority was to the kids themselves,” he said. “I wouldn’t have put in so much time and energy if it hadn’t been for the kids. My priority was to be their counselor, their role model, a person they looked up to. They saw me regularly while I was going to school. They saw me as a father figure, and I was able to assess their situation in a way that I could tell which ones had their life together enough and fully understood what the project was and what their involvement would be in it.”When it was noted that Mr. Michaels is hardly much older than the youths at the shelter, he replied, “For the most part they didn’t know I was basically their age.”'"
"'08-04-18,'1','BEIJING — One of China’s most prominent human rights advocates has missed the deadline to appeal his recent conviction for inciting subversion after prison guards denied him the chance to meet with his lawyer to discuss whether to proceed, his wife and his lawyer said Thursday.The advocate, Hu Jia, 34, had faced a Monday appeals deadline. His lawyer, Li Fangping, said he went to the detention center on Monday afternoon intending to learn Mr. Hu’s decision on whether to appeal — a move his family encouraged.But Mr. Li said he waited for several hours as prison guards prevented a meeting. He said he eventually drafted a motion for an appeal, but a guard refused to forward it to Mr. Hu for his signature. Instead, the guard instructed Mr. Li to mail the motion to the responsible court authorities — which he did a day later.“I definitely can say that my work as a lawyer has been seriously restricted,” Mr. Li said. He said guards had told him that Mr. Hu was not available because he was undergoing a medical examination.On April 3, Mr. Hu was sentenced to three and half years in prison after a Beijing court determined that his critical essays about the Communist Party threatened the state and incited subversion. His conviction elicited international condemnation, including from Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.'"
"'08-04-18,'1','BEIJING — The Chinese authorities have detained a prominent Tibetan television broadcaster and intellectual who is also a popular singer, suggesting that the government crackdown after the disturbances in and around Tibet has yet to run its course.The reporter, Jamyang Kyi, 42, an announcer at the state-run television station in Qinghai, a western province bordering Tibet, was escorted from her office on April 1 by plainclothes police officers in the city of Xining, according to colleagues and friends. The authorities also confiscated her computer and a list of contacts, they said.Her husband, Lamao Jia, who is also a journalist and a writer, said he had received no word from his wife for more than a week and did not know where she was being held. “She is in serious trouble,” he said in a telephone interview on Thursday. “I’m very worried for her safety. I’m very sorry. I can’t say more.”There has been no official confirmation of the detention.Although she has worked in the Tibetan-language division of Qinghai Television for two decades, Jamyang Kyi is better known for her singing and song-writing, especially among overseas Tibetans. She has traveled and lectured abroad, appearing with other Tibetan performers, some of them prominent exiles.She is also a respected intellectual and blogger who has written about women’s rights and the trafficking of girls. Chukora Tsering, a researcher at the Tibetan Center for Human Rights and Democracy in Dharamsala, India, said he knew of nothing in her music or writings that might have provoked the authorities. “She is completely apolitical, but she is a proud Tibetan,” he said. “Still, given her background, we are not entirely surprised she has been detained.”'"
"'08-04-18,'1','Flood’s letter to the commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, in 1969 was the opening assault on baseball’s chokehold on the players. He wrote: “After twelve years in the major leagues, I do not feel I am a piece of property to be bought and sold irrespective of my wishes. I believe that any system which produces that result violates my basic rights as a citizen and is inconsistent with the laws of the United States and of the several States.“It is my desire to play baseball in 1970, and I am capable of playing. I have received a contract offer from the Philadelphia club, but I believe I have the right to consider offers from other clubs before making any decision. I, therefore, request that you make known to all Major League clubs my feelings in this matter, and advise them of my availability for the 1970 season.”Flood has not done well in the balloting by the baseball writers. He retired in 1971. In 1977, his first year on the ballot, Flood received 4 percent of the votes. In 1978, 2 percent; in 1979, 3 percent.Flood had a 15-year career as a major league baseball player, but only three years on the Hall of Fame ballot.After 1979, Flood’s name was not on the ballot, and his candidacy fell to the Veterans Committee.Thirty years ago, Flood was a casualty of a conservative sports news media that often sided, or at least identified, with management. Today?Thirty-seven years after Flood retired and more than 20 years after his death, Donald Fehr thinks an influential baseball official may still hold a grudge.“He took the personal risk to demonstrate what was wrong with the system,” said Fehr, the executive director of the players association. “That amounts to in the end basically saying, ‘A bunch of people who were running baseball back then didn’t treat me right, and didn’t treat a lot of people right, didn’t treat any of the players right.’ I think maybe that still grates. I hope it doesn’t.”Brad Horn, the director of communications of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, predicts that time will work in Flood’s favor.“Time, in one of those evolutionary ways, may show that 5, 10, 20 years from now Curt Flood is a stronger candidate for the Hall of Fame because of the perspective on his career, not only for the on-field accomplishment and achievements,” he said.Flood was a .293 hitter in his career, led the National League in putouts four times and won the Gold Glove award in his last seven full seasons. He batted over .300 six times. The Hall of Fame Museum has documented Flood’s impact on baseball.Over time the feats that Flood accomplished on the field — Gold Gloves, stolen bases, great plays in center field — were dwarfed by his decision to take on Major League Baseball.“The things he’s done off the field may have become more important that what he did as a player,” Horn said.“The intangibles tend to take longer to be realized.”No other player had the guts to jump out and challenge baseball. Flood is the patron saint of major league players. If well-compensated players have an iota of fiber, they should demand that members of the Veterans Committee induct Flood into the Hall of Fame.“His impact is still being developed, still being felt,” Horn said. “People look at Flood much differently in 2008 than they probably did in 1980.”In his book, “The Way It Is,” Flood described a scene from his court hearing against baseball when Jackie Robinson, his body ravaged by diabetes, his eyesight failing, entered the courtroom. Flood leaned back to thank him, to which Robinson, replied, “Well, you can’t be out there by yourself and I would be remiss if I didn’t share these burdens with you.”When will Hall of Fame voters?'"

"'08-04-19,'0','An animal rights group is not giving up on blocking the government and two states from harming California sea lions that are feasting on the spring chinook salmon run at a dam on the Columbia River. The group, the Humane Society of the United States, lost a bid on Wednesday for a preliminary injunction to protect the sea lions. Late Thursday, the society filed for an emergency order ahead of its lawsuit against the National Marine Fisheries Service and the States of Oregon and Washington. The ruling on Wednesday left open the possibility that the states could begin killing sea lions, but Rick Hargrave, a spokesman for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife, said no action would be taken before next week. The sea lions are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, but an amendment allows the federal government to authorize killing animals shown to have a “significant negative impact” on salmon runs. Oregon and Washington requested the authorization in 2006.'"
"'08-04-19,'0','The entity Mr. McCain was referring to — Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, also known as Al Qaeda in Iraq — did not exist until after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. The most recent National Intelligence Estimates consider it the most potent offshoot of Al Qaeda proper, the group led by Osama bin Laden that is now believed to be based on the Pakistan-Afghanistan border.It is a largely homegrown and loosely organized group of Sunni Arabs that, according to the official American military view that Mr. McCain endorses, is led at least in part by foreign operatives and receives fighters, financing and direction from senior Qaeda leaders.In longer discussions on the subject, Mr. McCain often goes into greater specificity about the entities jockeying for control in Iraq. Some other analysts do not object to Mr. McCain’s portraying the insurgency (or multiple insurgencies) in Iraq as that of Al Qaeda. They say he is using a “perfectly reasonable catchall phrase” that, although it may be out of place in an academic setting, is acceptable on the campaign trail, a place that “does not lend itself to long-winded explanations of what we really are facing,” said Kenneth M. Pollack, research director at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution.But some students of the insurgency say Mr. McCain is making a dangerous generalization. “The U.S. has not been fighting Al Qaeda, it’s been fighting Iraqis,” said Juan Cole, a fierce critic of the war who is the author of “Sacred Space and Holy War: The Politics, Culture and History of Shi’ite Islam” and a professor of history at the University of Michigan. A member of Al Qaeda “is technically defined as someone who pledges fealty to Osama bin Laden and is given a terror operation to carry out. It’s kind of like the Mafia,” Mr. Cole said. “You make your bones, and you’re loyal to a capo. And I don’t know if anyone in Iraq quite fits that technical definition.”Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia is just one group, though a very lethal one, in the stew of competing Sunni insurgents, Shiite militias, Iranian-backed groups, criminal gangs and others that make up the insurgency in Iraq. That was vividly illustrated last month when the Iraqi Army’s unsuccessful effort to wrest control of Basra from the Shiite militia groups that hold sway there led to an explosion of violence.The current situation in Iraq should properly be described as “a multifactional civil war” in which “the government is composed of rival Shia factions” and “they are embattled with an outside Shia group, the Mahdi Army,” Ira M. Lapidus, a co-author of “Islam, Politics and Social Movements” and a professor of history at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an e-mail message. “The Sunni forces are equally hard to assess,” he added, and “it is an open question as to whether Al Qaeda is a unified operating organization at all.”In recent months, Mr. McCain has also been talking more about the threat posed by Iranian influence in Iraq, bringing him in line with American military officials, who in the wake of the Basra fighting seem increasingly convinced that Iranian support for Shiite groups now constitutes the primary security threat in Iraq.Mr. McCain acknowledged those concerns on Tuesday night in an interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC when he said that “we now see the Iranians beginning to reassert an age-old Persian ambition, as you know, to increase their influence, particularly in southern Iraq.”In talking about both threats, Mr. McCain tripped up last month on a visit to the Middle East, when he mistakenly said several times that the Iranians were training Qaeda operatives in Iran and sending them back to Iraq. Prompted by one of his traveling companions, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, Mr. McCain corrected himself, saying that he had misspoken and had meant to say Iran was training “other extremists” in Iraq.And Mr. McCain went beyond what he usually says and what his foreign policy advisers believe during a back-and-forth with Mr. Obama at the end of February. It began when Mr. Obama said at a Democratic debate that while he intended to withdraw American forces from Iraq as rapidly as possible, he reserved the right to send troops back in “if Al Qaeda is forming a base in Iraq.”Mr. McCain seized on the remark. “I have some news,” he said at a town-hall-style meeting in Tyler, Tex. “Al Qaeda is in Iraq. It’s called ‘Al Qaeda in Iraq.’ My friends, if we left, they wouldn’t be establishing a base. They’d be taking a country, and I’m not going to allow that to happen.”In general, Mr. Obama’s views track with those of many independent analysts. In a speech last August, he criticized President Bush by saying: “The president would have us believe that every bomb in Baghdad is part of Al Qaeda’s war against us, not an Iraqi civil war. He elevates Al Qaeda in Iraq — which didn’t exist before our invasion — and overlooks the people who hit us on 9/11, who are training new recruits in Pakistan.”Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who wants to begin withdrawing troops, has spoken of leaving some troops behind to fight Al Qaeda, deal with Sunni insurgents, deter Iranian aggression, protect the Kurds and possibly help the Iraqi military. She warned last year of the dangers if Iraq turned into a failed state “that serves as a petri dish for insurgents and Al Qaeda.”Few, including Mr. McCain, expect Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni group, to take control of Shiite-dominated Iraq in the event of an American withdrawal. The situation they fear and which Mr. McCain himself sometimes fleshes out is that an American withdrawal would be celebrated as a triumph by Al Qaeda and create instability that the group could then exploit to become more powerful.“Al Qaeda in Iraq would proclaim victory and increase its efforts to provoke sectarian tensions, pushing for a full-scale civil war that could descend into genocide and destabilize the Middle East,” Mr. McCain said this month. “Iraq would become a failed state. It could become a haven for terrorists to train and plan their operations.”Randy Scheunemann, Mr. McCain’s senior foreign policy adviser, said during a recent conference call with reporters that in the event of an American pullout, “you might not necessarily see a single entity taking charge.” But such a withdrawal could empower Shiite militias in the south and Kurds in the north, leaving Al Qaeda “free to try to impose its will” and lead to increased sectarian violence that “would be very likely to draw neighbors into the conflict,” he said.While “it is absolutely incorrect to describe the Sunni insurgency in Iraq as driven by Al Qaeda, you can’t properly talk about Iraq without talking about Al Qaeda in Iraq” and its importance in the larger war against terror, said Reuel M. Gerecht, a former Middle East specialist at the Central Intelligence Agency who is now a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “Bin Laden is a pretty good judge of the history of his own organization and its future, and he looks upon Iraq as the great battle, the make-or-break issue that will decide the fate of the ummah,” the global community of Islamic faithful.When Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior military commander in Iraq, testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee last week, Mr. McCain sought an endorsement of his focus on Al Qaeda. But General Petraeus responded with an evaluation more nuanced than the argument Mr. McCain typically offers on the campaign trail. Al Qaeda “is still a major threat, though it is certainly not as major a threat as it was, say, 15 months ago,” he said.In response to another of Mr. McCain’s questions, General Petraeus replied, “The area of operation of Al Qaeda has been greatly reduced in terms of controlling areas that it controlled as little as a year a half ago.”'"
"'08-04-19,'0','The campaign has set up a hybrid campaign committee that will allow individual donors to contribute roughly $70,000 to Mr. McCain’s election efforts, far more than the $2,300 maximum that can be given to a general election campaign.Only $2,300 of the money would go directly to the campaign committee, $28,500 would go to the national committee, and nearly $40,000 would be divided among the state parties of four crucial states: Colorado, Minnesota, New Mexico and Wisconsin. The McCain campaign is also setting up state-based committees in California, Florida and Ohio.On Friday night, the McCain campaign released its list of bundlers, big donors who have raised large amounts of money. Like the Bush campaign, which dubbed its biggest fund-raisers Rangers and Pioneers, the McCain campaign is also bestowing honorary titles. The campaign announced Friday that it had 73 Trailblazers, who raised $100,000 each, and 33 Innovators, who raised $250,000. The list included former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato of New York, who had supported the presidential campaign of former Senator Fred D. Thompson of Tennessee; Robert Wood Johnson IV, the owner of the New York Jets football team; and the financier Henry R. Kravis.With the election about 200 days away and the Democrats yet to decide on a nominee, mapping out battleground states now is, to an extent, an exercise in fantasy electoral politics. At this point in an election cycle, both parties traditionally make claims about how they can expand their maps in a bit of muscle flexing intended to rev up supporters and donors with theories of how they can obtain the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House.The McCain campaign has been showing supporters color-coded maps of roughly two dozen tossup states, along with recent polling showing how it might do in some of those states against Mr. Obama or Mrs. Clinton.While the campaign would no doubt have to fight to hold on to some of the states that Mr. Bush won in 2004 — especially Ohio, but also Iowa, Nevada and Virginia, for example — advisers also see opportunities to pick up states that the Democratic candidate, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, won in 2004.Those include Pennsylvania, where they think Mr. McCain could appeal to independent voters; New Hampshire, where Democrats have made recent gains; Minnesota, where voters have an independent bent and where the Republicans are holding their convention, and Wisconsin, where Mr. McCain campaigned this week.His advisers said Mr. McCain, being from Arizona, could make gains in the West and hold on to the Southwest, even though Democrats have made inroads in some of those states. Mr. McCain even wants to take aim at California, which Republicans have singled out in recent years to no avail; he gave several major speeches there this month.Democratic Party officials, though, say they believe that when voters learn more about some of Mr. McCain’s positions, like his support for the Iraq war and his opposition to abortion rights, they will turn away from him. They say they believe that they are in a position to make inroads in the electoral map. In an April 10 memorandum to the Democratic National Committee, the pollsters Geoff Garin and Cornell Belcher said the Midwest and West, particularly, were “in full swing as there are continuing signs that the traditional Republican coalition is collapsing.”The drawn-out Democratic primary fight also means that the nominee will have campaigned in, mounted field operations in, registered voters in and advertised in more states than Mr. McCain before the general election campaign begins.But some Republicans see Mr. McCain, with a record of sometimes bucking his party and sometimes working with it, as the perfect Republican in a tough year.“I think that by rook or by crook or by providence or just dumb luck, we nominated the one guy who continually outpolls the Republican brand,” said Todd Harris, a consultant who worked on Mr. McCain’s campaign eight years ago and on Mr. Thompson’s this year.For now, though, how the electoral map shapes up will in part hinge on the outcome of the Democratic contest.“We have planned out two general election campaigns,” said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Mr. McCain.'"
"'08-04-19,'0','“The promotion of human rights remains the most effective strategy for eliminating inequalities between countries and social groups, and for increasing security,” Benedict told the United Nations General Assembly.“Indeed, the victims of hardship and despair, whose human dignity is violated with impunity, become easy prey to the call to violence, and they can then become violators of peace,” he said.He made no explicit reference to a nation or conflict in particular, and he laid no specific blame in the half-hour speech, which was densely packed with philosophy and theology. But he did mention briefly some specific priorities for the Vatican, like protecting the environment, and making sure that poor nations, especially in Africa, also reap the benefits of globalization.And in a passage that will have particular resonance for the current United Nations leadership, which is trying to establish the right of the outside world to intervene in situations where nations fail to shield their own citizens from atrocities, the pope said that “every state has the primary duty to protect its own population from grave and sustained violations of human rights.”The concept, known as “responsibility to protect,” is one that Ban Ki-moon, the secretary general, has backed as a way for international institutions to take action in regions like Darfur.“If states are unable to guarantee such protection,” the pope said, “the international community must intervene with the juridical means provided in the United Nations charter and in other international instruments.” In an apparent allusion to countries that claim such international actions constitute intervention in their national affairs, he said they “should never be interpreted as an unwarranted imposition or a limitation of sovereignty.”He added, “On the contrary, it is indifference or failure to intervene that do the real damage.”In his speech, Benedict touched on themes important both to his three-year-old papacy and his decades of writing as a cardinal and one of the church’s leading intellectuals.At base, the pope presented the idea that there are universal values that transcend the diversity — cultural, ethnic or ideological — embodied in an institution like the United Nations, founded to help prevent the ruin of another world war. Those values are at the base of human rights, he said, as they are for religion. Thus religion, he said, cannot be shut out of a body like the United Nations, which he said aims at “a social order respectful of the dignity and rights of the person.”“A vision of life firmly anchored in the religious dimension can help achieve this,” he said. “Recognition of the transcendent value of every man and woman favors conversion of heart, which then leads to a commitment to resist violence, terrorism, war and to promote justice and peace.Benedict was introduced to the thronged General Assembly hall by Mr. Ban, who called the United Nations a secular institution but is “home to all men and women of faith around the world.”The speech to the General Assembly is a papal tradition: Pope Paul VI made an appearance in 1965, and Pope John Paul II in 1979 and 1995.On Friday afternoon, Benedict met with local Jewish clergy at the Park East Synagogue, an Orthodox congregation on the Upper East Side founded in 1890. It was the first papal visit to a synagogue in this country; only two other visits have ever been recorded, both in Europe.Rabbi Arthur Schneier, a Holocaust survivor who has led the synagogue since 1962, greeted Benedict and told him that his visit was “a reaffirmation of your outreach, good will, and commitment to enhancing Jewish-Catholic relations.” He presented Benedict with a silver Seder plate and a box of matzo, just in time for Passover, which begins on Saturday evening.“The Jewish community make a valuable contribution to the life of the city,” the pope told the Jewish leaders, “and I encourage all of you to continue building bridges of friendship with all the many different ethnic and religious groups present in your neighborhood.”The pope then posed for photographs with several prominent Jewish New Yorkers, including Mr. Koch, the former mayor. Later in the evening, the pope met with the ministers of various denominations, including the Rev. Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.Ms. King declined to say what they discussed, saying only, “He blessed me.”'"

"'08-04-19,'0','IT’S hard to resist the siren song of the Internet, the belief that whatever you want can be found cheaper online.But I’m bitter about my experiences buying life insurance through an online agency.My husband and I could have obtained group coverage through a work policy, but the quote we got online was about 40 percent cheaper: altogether just $62.50 a month for two 20-year level-term policies worth $500,000 each.It seemed too good to pass up. We would have to take a short physical exam, give blood and urine samples and fill out a lengthy application. A nurse who was also a licensed life insurance examiner would come to our home. It seemed a small price to pay, given the bargain price.From now on I will instantly recognize the phrase “small price to pay” as a giant red flag.The physical went smoothly. In fact, the whole process was so painless I even bragged a little to friends about our terrific life insurance deal. That is red flag No. 2: never boast about a bargain before it’s hatched.A couple of weeks later we started getting strange messages from the insurance agency and Portamedic, the company that had sent the nurse to our home, urging us to complete our physicals in order to obtain our coverage. When I called Portamedic, to my dismay the customer service representative said they had never received our medical exams, nor our paperwork. She even sounded skeptical at my assertion that we had completed the whole package. After I pressed her, she agreed to look into it.'"
"'08-04-19,'0','CHICAGO (AP) — The heavy equipment maker Caterpillar parlayed an increased reliance on international markets to surprisingly strong sales and a 13 percent jump in first-quarter profits, impressing investors who had expected the company to be slowed more by the weak American economy and dollar.The stock surged more than 8 percent in Friday trading after company easily beat Wall Street’s earnings estimates, benefiting from its strategy of diversification.Shares rose $6.69, to $85.28, in afternoon trading and are now up more than 40 percent since mid-January, to within $2 of their record high.Sales were up 37 percent in the Asia-Pacific region, 30 percent in the Europe-Africa-Middle East region and 24 percent in Latin America, compared with just 4 percent in North America.Caterpillar executives said the weak dollar hurt the bottom line, with raw materials and other costs up at its international plants. But in sales alone, the currency impact added $310 million in the quarter.Caterpillar earned $922 million, or $1.45 a share, in the January-March period, compared with $816 million, or $1.23 a share, a year earlier. That blew past the $1.33-a-share estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial.Revenue rose 18 percent, to $11.8 billion, from $10.02 billion a year earlier, with $10.98 billion coming from machinery and engines sales and $817 million from financial products.

A militant group in Nigeria said it sabotaged a major oil pipeline, sending light crude for May delivery to a new trading record of $117 in after-hours electronic trading Friday. Earlier, it settled up $1.83 to a record $116.69 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was the fifth day in a row that crude prices had set new records.A survey of gasoline stations by AAA and the Oil Price Information Service found that the national average price of regular gas rose 2.7 cents overnight, to a record $3.445 a gallon.Citigroup, the nation’s biggest bank, encouraged investors with results that contained no big surprises. It reported a loss of $5.1 billion during the first quarter because of poor bets on mortgages and leveraged loans, but the loss was half the $10 billion recorded for the preceding quarter. Citigroup shares closed up $1.08, or 4.5 percent, to $25.11.'"

"'08-04-19,'0','Stephen Weiss, an investment banker who provided continuity in the leadership of Cornell University as a donor and a trustee, died on Wednesday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan, a Cornell affiliate. He was 72 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.The cause was heart failure, said his brother, Roger.Mr. Weiss made major gifts to Cornell, his alma mater, of both time and money, as chairman of the board of trustees from 1989 to 1997 and as a board member for 16 years before that; he was on the search committees that selected four presidents of Cornell.In 1980 he became the first chairman of the Weill Cornell Medical College Board of Overseers. He also served on the advisory councils of the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Veterinary Medicine.Mr. Weiss’s beneficence emphasized Cornell’s human resources rather than brick-and-mortar assets. His brother said Mr. Weiss developed heart problems in the early 1980s, which led to his endowment, with his wife, of the deanship of the medical college. He also sponsored two professorships in cardiothoracic surgery and one in cardiovascular biology and genetics. Among his many other gifts were endowments for a visiting professorship in English and a chair for the head coach of the men’s tennis team.His brother also went to Cornell, as did their father, Milton, a lawyer. His brother said of their father, “We could go to any school we wanted, he said, but the only one he would pay for was Cornell.”Stephen Henry Weiss was born on Oct. 3, 1935, in New York City. After graduating from Cornell in 1957, he spent 11 years in investment banking at A. G. Becker & Company. In 1970, he and his brother were co-founders of an investment management firm, Weiss, Peck & Greer, which they sold in 2001. After that he became a managing director of another investment firm, Neuberger Berman.'"
"'08-04-19,'0','“We are headed right down into conflict alley with these exclusive arrangements,” said Gerry Purcell, an Atlanta-based health benefits consultant to big employers. As exclusive or semi-exclusive distributors of specialty drugs, the benefit managers “can raise the prices at will,” Mr. Purcell said, “and the employer will have little chance but to pay the bill.”Express Scripts’ main competitors, CVS Caremark and Medco Health Solutions, have also built lucrative side businesses in specialty drugs. So have some of the biggest insurers that provide medical benefits to corporate America, including UnitedHealth Group, Wellpoint, Aetna and Cigna.When asked about the potential conflicts, Express Scripts and the other companies — which are known as pharmacy benefit managers — tend to describe themselves as mere middlemen with little influence over what the drug makers choose to charge.Steve Miller, an Express Scripts executive vice president, said of the H.P. Acthar Gel episode: “The increase was a manufacturing decision. I can’t comment on that.”The pharmacy benefit managers say that keeping a lid on employers’ drug costs is still their top priority. And they defend their involvement with specialty drugs, saying it helps them keep better track of the medicines’ use.“I don’t believe it is a conflict,” said Dave Rickard, an executive vice president of CVS Caremark. “We saved clients $115 million last year that would have been spent on specialty drugs that were not appropriate.”But CVS Caremark, meanwhile, sold nearly $6 billion in specialty drugs last year through its pharmacy benefit management business — nearly 14 percent of the company’s annual revenue.The main drug benefit managers make as much as 10 to 15 percent on each sale of a specialty drug, whose prices can range from $5,000 a year for certain anemia drugs to $389,000 in the case of Soliris, a drug for a rare blood disorder, whose distributors include Express Scripts’ specialty drug unit, CuraScript.Spending on specialty drugs rose 16.5 percent in 2006, growing twice as fast as traditional drug spending, and totaled about $62 billion — which was about 23 percent of overall drug sales in this country, according to Charles Boorady, a Citigroup health care analyst.Big employers and organizations including General Motors, Caterpillar and Calpers, the large California public employees health and pension group, say their spending on specialty drugs is growing at double the rate of the rest of their drug benefits for employees.In some cases, employers are starting to push back. A group of large- and medium-size companies like Kinder Morgan Energy, a Houston pipeline company, and Enodis, an international restaurant equipment maker with United States headquarters in Florida, recently pushed CVS Caremark to agree to hand back $15 to the employers on each prescription filled for all specialty drugs listed in a Caremark contract.The giveback is meant to let the employers share a portion of the rebates that the pharmacy benefit managers often collect from drug makers in addition to keeping a portion of sales. But the giveback is relatively minuscule, acknowledged David Dross, a drug benefits specialist at the Mercer benefits consulting group who helped organize the employer effort.With specialty drugs, the pharmacy benefit managers are “getting a lot more than the $15 in rebates,” Mr. Dross said.Susan A. Hayes, a drug benefits consultant based in Lake Zurich, Ill., said she had seen rebate contract terms that give the pharmacy benefit managers rebates of 3 percent to 10 percent of the selling price.Specialty drugs are aimed at diseases that include cancer, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis C. Some, for rarer disorders, may have federal “orphan drug” status that gives a manufacturer exclusive marketing rights for a certain period. Specialty drugs also include medications whose distribution is tightly regulated as federally controlled substances, like the narcolepsy treatment Xyrem, which is distributed through Express Scripts.Makers of specialty drugs can command lofty prices mainly because patients have few alternatives, and there is typically little or no competition — whether because the medicine still has patent protection or the drug is difficult to make. Or it may be, as with H.P. Acthar Gel, that the patent has long since lapsed but there is a relatively small number of patients.With specialty drugs representing about 60 percent of the new medicines submitted for approval by federal regulators, their overall cost will probably keep pushing up drug expenses well into the future.Express Scripts is smaller than Medco and CVS Caremark, but it gets a bigger share of its revenue from specialty medicines — 19.8 percent of its 2007 revenue of $18.3 billion.That compared with about 13 percent of Medco’s $44.5 billion total revenue last year. And it compared with about 13.9 percent of CVS Caremark’s total of $43.3 billion, not counting $2 billion sales of specialty prescriptions filled at CVS retail drugstores.Express Scripts also has a larger number of exclusive distribution deals, with sole rights to 7 specialty drugs, all of which have orphan drug designation, as well as 11 more that are available through only one or two other national distributors.Medco’s specialty unit, Accredo Health, lists 4 orphan drug exclusives and 21 more drugs it shares with one or two other distributors. CVS Caremark said it had one exclusive and 35 drugs available from a limited group of specialty pharmacies.In the case of H.P. Acthar Gel, an injectable anti-seizure medication derived from hog hormones, the fourteenfold price increase came after the maker, Questcor Pharmaceuticals, gave exclusive distribution rights to Express Scripts’ CuraScript unit last summer.“This sort of puts the spotlight on the greed angle of the business,” said Dr. Robert R. Clancy, a pediatric neurologist at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He has been using H.P. Acthar Gel to treat a severely ill 3-year-old girl, Reegan Schwartz. Employer health plans bear most of the drug’s steep cost, with individuals in many cases making only a standard co-payment. In the case of the two courses of Acthar treatments for Reegan, the cost to her father’s health plan was about $226,000. Her father, Mike Schwartz, who works for a large pharmaceutical company, Merck, that has no ties to Acthar or its manufacturer, said he ended up paying only $60 out of pocket for the Acthar therapy.Steve Cartt, a Questcor executive vice president, said the new price was chosen by looking at the prices of other specialty drugs and estimating how much insurers and employers would be willing to bear.“We did some market research,” Mr. Cartt said. Talking to pediatric neurologists and others about various pricing options “gave us some comfort that the strategy would work, and physicians would continue to use the drug, and payers would pay,” he said. “The reality was better than we expected.”'"
"'08-04-19,'0','Conservative Judaism reached a similar juncture a generation ago when it first admitted women as candidates for the rabbinate. Mr. Weininger was born in the same year, 1985, when J.T.S. ordained its first female rabbi, Amy Eilberg. In the months just before he won admission to the seminary, he happened to bump into Rabbi Eilberg at a synagogue in Jerusalem and solicited her advice.“I encouraged him to remember that since he is a pioneer, some people will project onto him feelings and assumptions that they have about ‘the cause,’ ” Rabbi Eilberg recalled of their conversation in an e-mail message. “As hard as it is not to take others’ criticisms and attacks personally — since they are personal — it is essential to work at remembering that this is about the larger issue.”Interestingly, the seminary chancellor who permitted gay rabbinical students to enroll, Arnold Eisen, spoke of Mr. Weininger and Mr. Chesir-Teran in almost an opposite way. “Face to face,” Mr. Eisen said in an interview, “you get to know the people and you get to like the people, not as representatives of a cause or an ideology.”The tension between being an individual and being an emblem animates both Mr. Weininger and Mr. Chesir-Teran. Both had staked out public positions as advocates of gay equality in the Conservative movement even before being allowed to apply to the seminary. Both were involved last month in a major conference at J.T.S. about issues of inclusion, provocatively titled “Adam and Eve, Meet Adam and Steve.” Mr. Chesir-Teran’s taste for the limelight even includes his current stint in an Israeli reality-TV series in which the parents of two gay households swap families.However visible both rabbinic students have been, and however necessary a certain boldness may be for any groundbreaker, the public stance followed years of private struggle. Mr. Weininger and Mr. Chesir-Teran each grew up deeply religious, attending Jewish day school. And as each reached his teenage years, the insistent reality of his homosexuality put him on the scorned periphery of their cherished faith.“All the stages of my life, I had to compartmentalize,” Mr. Chesir-Teran said. “Because of this message I’d received, both implicitly and explicitly, that being Jewish and being gay were irreconcilable. What I wanted to be able to do was live Jewishly in an integrated way. But I felt I had to leave Judaism behind to explore life as a gay man.”Now 37, Mr. Chesir-Teran earned a law degree and built a practice defending lawyers facing disbarment, not exactly pastoral preparation. Then, in the mid-1990s, he met and fell in love with someone he thought could not possibly have existed: a gay man who was the product of an Orthodox yeshiva. The men went on to become partners and the parents of three adopted children, overseeing a household that keeps kosher and observes the Sabbath.Before J.T.S. changed its policy, Mr. Chesir-Teran considered entering the Reform or Reconstructionist seminaries, but never applied for the simple reason that he considered himself a Conservative Jew. Yet he also recoiled from the option of gay J.T.S. students before him: stay in the closet just long enough to be ordained and get assigned the first pulpit.Even now, he said, “there’s a cost to being in a place that simultaneously legitimizes contradictory views.” In a 2007 survey of Conservative Jews’ attitudes toward ordaining gay members of the clergy, the highest degree of opposition (31 percent) came not from rabbis, lay leaders or educators, but from J.T.S.’s own rabbinical students, the future classmates of Mr. Chesir-Teran and Mr. Weininger.Through their first year in the seminary, both have sought out skeptics and outright opponents in the student body, inviting rather than avoiding inevitably tense conversations. “It’s a blessing to be here,” Mr. Chesir-Teran put it. “And it’s also a challenge.”'"
"'08-04-19,'0','Despite rapid economic and cultural development, South Korea still lacks social awareness of its disabled citizens and the facilities to aid them. Families with disabled members often keep them at home, sometimes hidden away, ashamed of their existence and afraid of discrimination. In fact, Dr. Lee’s decision to continue teaching at the nation’s most prestigious university has put him at odds with his wife and parents, who would prefer that he concentrate on restoring some motion to his limbs.Dr. Lee was injured on July 2, 2006, during a geological field trip in a California desert, when the car he was driving overturned. He emerged from a coma three days later, but his fourth cervical vertebra had been fractured.Nevertheless, he was back at work in early 2007.Every time he tested out a new device and adapted it for his own use, Dr. Lee said, he felt a little thrill, as if he had solved a scientific problem.He felt blessed when he found EZcaller, a device that allowed him to make and answer phone calls just by clicking his mouse. And he eventually settled on an on-screen keyboard program called Clickey, which allowed him to type by selecting each character with a click or a puff.During a recent lunch with his colleagues, Dr. Lee amazed onlookers as he touched a microphone on the headrest of his wheelchair with his right cheek to recline the chair to prevent bedsores.On his way back to his office from the cafeteria, Dr. Lee used his right cheek again, this time to shift the wheelchair into a mode that buffers the shock when he uses his head to steer it on a bumpy road.“It’s like downhill skiing,” he said.LEE SANG-MOOK was born in Seoul in 1962 and moved to Indonesia when he was 12, after his father, a banker, was transferred there. As a teenager, he became fascinated with National Geographic, devouring every issue of the magazine in the school library in Jakarta and stoking a desire to travel to remote places around the world.One day, he recalled, his father came home, somewhat tipsy after drinking with colleagues, and suggested that Sang-mook become a scientist of an unconventional kind. His father was convinced that oceanography was the field of the future. The son was so motivated by this first man-to-man talk with his father that he eventually went on to study oceanography at Seoul National University.His father later changed his mind and pressed him to become an herbal doctor, a position of considerable status in South Korea that would allow him to one day look after his aging parents or at least to stay close to them.“But becoming an herbal doctor meant a locked-up life for him,” said Lee Yu-jene, 45, Dr. Lee’s younger sister. “He refused relentlessly. It was the first time he defied our parents.”He went on to do his dissertation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. He conducted postdoctoral research on the midocean ridge south of Iceland and the southwestern Indian Ocean.He later spent about three months a year at sea on a research vessel for the Korean Ocean Research and Development Institute before joining his alma mater’s faculty in 2003.None of his globe-hopping played well back home. His father took to calling him “the sailor,” annoyed that his oldest son was away from home for so long when his friends’ children had settled jobs, Ms. Lee said.That changed when Dr. Lee accepted the teaching position. “Our father was happy once my brother got his professorship,” his sister said.But then came the accident, and the shattering new reality that he had lost the use of his limbs.The occupational therapists at the rehabilitation hospital in the United States immediately showed him seven models of a device that could serve as his computer mouse. He quickly got the hang of using one, so that he was discharged after only three weeks.He returned to South Korea ready to go back to work, and armed with the means to do so. The university was enthusiastic about having him back, and made sure he had all the space and facilities he needed to do his work. A colleague donated $100,000, which he used to customize his minivan to accommodate his wheelchair and, with the remainder, to establish a scholarship.But his family had other ideas.In the hope of activating his muscles again, “they want me to give up my life and devote everything to recovery,” Dr. Lee said. Not satisfied with Western medical treatments, his mother brought in an herbal doctor.But Dr. Lee shooed the herbal doctor away by reminding him that it is illegal to treat a patient without his consent.“I asked her, ‘Does praying make your limbs grow?’ ” Dr. Lee said.HIS parents had wanted Dr. Lee to stay in the United States after the injury, recalling that other disabled Koreans had moved there to escape prejudice in their homeland.So while Dr. Lee was becoming a media star and happily responding to requests to teach other people with disabilities how to use devices to assist them, his father — who had always taught him not to stand out — wanted his son to lead a quiet life.“My father said, ‘You are starting to become a messiah,’ ” Dr. Lee said.But he was undeterred by the family pressures, determined, his sister said, “to do everything that he used to be able to do anyway.”Last winter, Dr. Lee managed to go on a short business trip using a bullet train.“When I picked him up from Seoul station, he was so excited and said, ‘I think I can do this again,’ ” his sister said.But Dr. Lee is not satisfied with a local business trip. He wants to go to San Francisco in the fall to attend a conference of the American Geophysical Union.“We all flock there,” he said. “And I have to keep myself up to date in my field.”'"

"'08-04-20,'0','Edwards was docked 100 points and deprived of Bob Osborne’s company for six races because the lid on the oil tank of his No. 99 Roush Fenway Racing Ford was missing after a victory in March at Las Vegas.Osborne will miss the race next week at Talladega before returning May 3 at Richmond. In his absence, with team engineer Chris Andrews and general manager Robbie Reiser filling in, Edwards has finished 42nd (engine failure), 16th, 9th, 1st and 4th.Even before last week’s strong race at Phoenix, Edwards has had to reassure Osborne that he is indeed missed.“I mean, I can’t wait until he gets back,” Edwards said. “I didn’t realize until he was gone — you don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone, I guess, is the saying. I didn’t realize how much of a relationship we’d had built on the radio, how efficient our communication was.PULLING AWAY FROM THE PACK Jeff Gordon won both races last season at Talladega Superspeedway, where two- and three-wide racing in huge packs and multicar crashes are considered business as usual.“Jeff Gordon winning last year, he did a great job and gives credence that great drivers find a way to make it happen,” said his fellow Cup star Jeff Burton. “He didn’t have the fastest car.“A lot of times we see at Talladega, there’s about four, six, eight cars that are better than the field. On the track we know who the fastest cars are and, typically, one of those cars wins.”The late Dale Earnhardt was a master of restrictor plate racing and it was said he could see the air. It seems Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Gordon, two of the best current plate racers, have the same talent.“The interesting thing is being at the right place at the right time is so important there,” Burton said. “And knowing what to do and when to do it is so important and you see the same people able to do that. So there is a skill involved in it, there’s no question about it.”Although he acknowledges the close, tense racing on the 2.66-mile Talladega oval used to make him nervous, Gordon has 6 victories and 16 top-10 finishes in 30 races on the Alabama track. And he is no longer uptight about going there.“I am looking forward to Talladega,” he said. BUSY SCHEDULE FOR KYLE BUSCH So far this season, Kyle Busch has driven in all eight Cup races, all eight Nationwide events and all four Craftsman Truck Series races. He is second in the Cup standings, third in Nationwide and leading the truck series.And Busch, 23, just cannot seem to slow down.While his Joe Gibbs Racing Cup team is taking a rare weekend off, Busch is in Mexico City, aiming for his third Nationwide victory in a row.The big question is how long will he continue to race in all three of Nascar’s top professional series?Several drivers have raced the entire Cup and Nationwide — formerly Busch — Series in the same year. No one has even come close to running full schedules in all three.Busch has said he will eventually sit out some Nationwide and truck races. But with all this success, could he change his mind?“The consideration is there, but it’s a race-by-race deal for me right now,” Busch said after winning the Nationwide race last week at Phoenix.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Yet there was a ring of urgency in her voice as Mrs. Clinton, of New York, went through her stump speech at a faster clip than usual, as if ready to jump into her van to be whisked away to her next rally.In West Lawn, supporters half-filled a high school gymnasium, with one set of empty bleachers stacked against the wall. The scoreboard suspended from the ceiling flashed the words “Hillary Wins.”Mrs. Clinton bounded on stage with arguably her most valued ally in the state, Gov. Edward G. Rendell, who shouted to the crowd by way of introduction, “This young lady knows how to fight!” (Mr. Rendell, 64, is four years older than Mrs. Clinton.)Mrs. Clinton stayed close to her usual pitch, pressing on the issues of education, the war in Iraq and the economy, and she led the crowd in a chant of “Yes, we will,” her variation of Mr. Obama’s mantra of “Yes we can.”The two campaigns sparred over their respective health care plans, with Mr. Obama putting forth a television commercial that attacked Mrs. Clinton’s proposal. She returned the criticism, saying, “He chooses to attack my solution.”Early in the day, Mrs. Clinton put the hard sell to Pennsylvania voters as she stood on stage in front of a historic fire station in the Philadelphia suburb of West Chester.“We have got to realize that our future really depends on who the next president is,” she said. “This is not a throw-away election. This is one of the most important elections we’ve ever faced.”With only 10 contests remaining in the fight for the Democratic nomination, the Pennsylvania primary is a critically important one. Mrs. Clinton once held a 20-point lead in the state, but that lead has been whittled down to the single digits, according to many public polls.Nationally, Mr. Obama leads in the popular vote and delegate count. And on Saturday, he pulled closer to Mrs. Clinton’s lead in superdelegates, picking up Steve Achelpohl, the Democratic state chairman in Nebraska.Seeing the polls tighten and being outspent three to one, the Clinton campaign played down expectations for a sweeping victory on Tuesday in Pennsylvania.Mr. Obama’s advisers are counting on it, hoping that a stronger-than-expected showing from him could help wind down the protracted fight for the Democratic nomination.As Mr. Obama made the 100-mile journey from Philadelphia to Harrisburg, he delivered a rolling closing argument. In recent days, he has fired many of his criticisms at Senator John McCain of Arizona, the presumptive Republican nominee, but with two days before people here go to the polls, he used his time to draw sharp distinctions with Mrs. Clinton.“Her basic argument in this election — it’s become clear as time has gone on — is that you can’t really change Washington,” Mr. Obama said. “You can’t really change the say-anything, do-anything, special-interest driven game in Washington. And because you can’t change it, you might as well select somebody who knows how to play the game better because they’ve been at the game longer.”And then at an evening rally in Harrisburg, he said, “Senator Clinton would be vastly better than George Bush would be, but that’s a very low bar.”Mr. Obama, who was accompanied by Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, traveled on an antique, blue Georgia 300 Club Car, festooned with red, white and blue bunting. As he arrived in each town, strains of Bruce Springsteen’s “The Rising” filled the air.For more than a year, the field of presidential candidates have campaigned across America by plane and by bus. The trip across a corner of Pennsylvania — intended for its marketing appeal, as much as its method of transportation — marked the first train trip of the 2008 race.As he boarded his chartered Amtrak at 30th Street Station in Philadelphia, Mr. Obama pulled on the train’s whistle. “This is what I’m talking about,” he said.People waited hours for Mr. Obama’s train to arrive. Young children, perched on their fathers’ shoulders, waved blue Obama signs.But amid the revelry, Mr. Obama reminded people again and again that he needed their support on Tuesday.“We are going to be unified in November,” Mr. Obama said. “But right now, there is a real choice to be made.”'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Alan Garner, an oboist and English horn player who is the chairman of the players’ committee at the Royal Opera House, said that he and his colleagues had been told that they would have to wear earplugs during entire three-hour rehearsals and performances.“It’s like saying to a racing-car driver that they have to wear a blindfold,” he said.Already there are signs that the law is altering not only the relationship between classical musicians and their employers, but also between musicians and the works they produce.“The noise regulations were written for factory workers or construction workers, where the noise comes from an external source, and to limit the exposure is relatively straightforward,” said Mark Pemberton, the director of the Association of British Orchestras. “But the problem is that musicians create the noise themselves.”Rock musicians have talked openly about loud music and ear protection for years. The issue is more delicate for classical musicians, who have been reluctant to accept that their profession can lead to hearing loss, even though studies have shown that to be the case. At the same time, complying with the law — which concerns musicians’, not audiences’, noise exposure — is complicated.One problem is that different musicians are exposed to different levels of noise depending on their instruments, the concert hall, where they sit in an orchestra and the fluctuations of the piece they are playing. In Britain, big orchestras now routinely measure the decibel levels of various areas to see which musicians are subject to the most noise, and when.Orchestras are also installing noise-absorbing panels and placing antinoise screens at strategic places, like in front of the brass section, to force the noise over the heads of other players.“You have to tilt them in such a way so that the noise doesn’t come back and hit the person straight in the face, because that can cause just as much damage,” said Philip Turbett, the orchestra manager for the English National Opera.They are also trying to put more space between musicians, and rotating them in and out of the noisiest seats.At the Royal Opera House, the management has devised a computer program that calculates individual weekly noise exposure by cross-referencing such factors as the member’s schedule and the pieces being played.Musicians are spacing out rehearsals and playing more softly when they can. As the Welsh National Opera prepared for the premiere of James MacMillan’s loud opera, “The Sacrifice,” last year, the brass and percussion sections were told to take it easy at times in rehearsal to protect the ears of themselves and their colleagues, said Peter Harrap, the orchestra and chorus director.Conductors are also being asked to reconsider their habit of “going for a big loud orchestration,” said Chris Clark, the orchestra operations manager at the Royal Opera House. Composers, too, are being asked to keep the noise issue in mind.“Composers should bear in mind that they are dealing with people who are alive, and not machines,” said Mr. Nordwall of the Bavarian orchestra.And companies are examining their repertories with the aim of interspersing loud pieces — Mahler’s symphonies, for instance — with quieter ones. They are also buying a lot of high-tech earplugs, which are molded to players’ ears and cost about $300 a pair. Many orchestras now ask their musicians to put the earplugs in during the loud parts of a performance.“I have a computer program that gives me a minute-by-minute timeline chart through the whole piece,” said Mr. Turbett of the English National Opera. “I can go back to the musicians and say, ‘Between bar 100 and bar 200, there’s a very loud passage, so please put in hearing protection.’ ”But these remedies can bring problems. Some musicians in the brass and percussion sections resent being screened off from their colleagues, as if they were being ostracized. Musicians, even if they accept the need to use earplugs occasionally, tend to hate wearing them.Mr. Garner, the Royal Opera House oboist, said: “I’ve spent nearly 30 years in music and I know all about noise, and occasionally, if I’m not playing and there’s a loud bit next to me, I might shove my fingers in my ears for a few bars. But I have yet to find a musician who says they can wear earplugs and still play at the same level of quality.”The modern noise-level-conscious orchestra is also dependent, of course, on the indulgence of the conductor. Arriving at an orchestra to find that decisions have been based solely on musicians’ noise exposure can be galling to the sort of conductor who likes to be in control, which is most of them.Although Switzerland is outside the European Union, an extraordinary noise-related argument between the conductor and the Bern Symphony Orchestra disrupted the opening night of Alban Berg’s “Wozzeck” in March.The piece called for 30 string players and 30 wind and percussion players, all crammed into a too-small pit. When the stage director complained in rehearsals that the music was too loud, the conductor didn’t order the orchestra to play more softly, but instead asked for a cover over the orchestral pit to contain the noise, said Marianne Käch, the orchestra’s executive director.That meant the noise bounced back at the musicians, bringing the level to 120 decibels in the brass section, similar to the levels in front of a speaker in a rock concert. The musicians complained. The conductor held firm. But when the piece began, “the orchestra decided to play softer anyway in order to protect themselves,” Ms. Käch said.That made the conductor so angry that he walked off after 10 minutes or so, Ms. Käch said. Told that there had been “musical differences” between the conductor and the orchestra, the perplexed audience had to wait for the two sides to hash it out.In the end, the orchestra agreed to return and finish the performance at the loud levels. For subsequent performances, a foam cover that absorbed instead of reflecting the sound was placed above the pit, and the conductor agreed to tone things down.“This is the problem you find in many places, that the conductors are conducting more and more loudly,” Ms. Käch said. “I know conductors who have hundreds of shades of fortissimo, but not many in the lower levels. Maybe the whole world is just becoming louder.”'"
"'08-04-20,'0','“I know the city obviously knows what’s best for everybody,” said Daniel Scherotter, the group’s incoming president. “But at a certain point, it gets ridiculous.”The health plan was just one of several laws affecting businesses passed by the Board and the city’s voters in recent years, including ordinances mandating that employers pay for sick leave for employees and one establishing one of the highest minimum wages in the country.And those costs are being passed on to consumers.At Delfina, a popular restaurant in the nightlife-rich Mission District, diners receive a card with every meal that states that while owners are happy to offer their employees health care, their bills will include a $1.25 surcharge to cover the cost.“We must consider options that allow us to cover these costs which far exceed our current health care expenditures,” the card reads. Other restaurants have followed suit, including the well-known Zuni Cafe, which now adds a 4 percent fee to all bills. Still others have tried to pare costs, cutting back on trips to the butcher and outsourcing food preparation, Mr. Scherotter said.“People are somewhere between depressed and angry,” he said.The animosity has not slowed the Board’s momentum: in March, it followed New York City and passed an ordinance requiring chain restaurants to post nutritional information on every menu item and imposed a fee to pay for such notices.But restaurant owners are hardly the only group that is upset. Party promoters have been fuming about a change in rules that would require permits and insurance for some events, a category that opponents say could include everything from waterfront raves to weddings to benefits at the opera. Some deli proprietors have voiced displeasure about a proposal to prohibit new liquor stores within 500 feet of churches or recreation centers, setting the kind of distance requirement usually reserved for laws dealing with sex offenders.San Francisco voters have proved no less proactive, passing the 2006 sick leave law, which authorizes up to nine paid days off as credit for time worked. In 2003, voters also passed a minimum-wage act that currently sets it at $9.36 — more than $3.50 above the federal rate. And next year, it goes up.Health issues seem to be driving a variety of new laws, most prominently Healthy San Francisco, a first-of-its-kind plan to provide universal health care for city residents.Obesity was the justification for another proposal, made by Mr. Newsom in December, to charge big stores a fee when they sold drinks with high-fructose corn syrup. Still others are old-fashioned quality-of-life laws, like the proposed liquor store ordinance, which goes by the elaborately named “Alcohol Reduction and Safer Neighborhoods Act.”Despite the grumbling, some of San Francisco’s ideas are being floated at the state level and in other cities, including the ban on plastic bags at large grocery stores. A bill modeled on the city’s sick leave law was passed by a committee of the California Legislature last week.John Handley, the government relations director for the California Independent Grocers Association, said that the fees in San Francisco had exacerbated problems faced by grocers dealing with soaring costs and fears of a recession. “Food prices have gone up because of raw materials going up: corn, and fuel, mainly,” Mr. Handley said. “And this just makes things harder.”Steve Falk, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, said his members recognized the need for many of the laws, but that the “cumulative impact of all this really is starting to have a significant impact on midsized and smaller business.”“They’ve got profit margins of 8 to 10 percent,” Mr. Falk said. “And when you add fees for a health care requirement and another for sick days, that begins to cut into a significant amount of that profit.”Not all the recent proposals have found legislative traction. This month, the proposed change for promoters was rejected by the city’s Entertainment Commission, which found it too broad.Others said that their ideas were more like suggestions than hard and fast rules.“Do I really think there’s going to be some sort of light cop that’s going to go up to the 29th floor and see if someone’s working? Of course not,” said the Board’s president, Aaron Peskin, the author of the lights-off bill. “But you can kind to try to guilt-trip people with this kind of thing.”'"

Roma has a second potential suitor who could double an existing offer, according to a lawyer for the family that controls the team.Roma’s top shareholder, Italpetroli, which is linked to the Sensi family, said on Friday that it had held talks with a representative of a potential investor, but that a sale was not imminent.The potential investor was not named, but news media reports said representatives of the billionaire financier George Soros had met club officials. Soros told reporters on Thursday that he had no comment on whether he was pursuing Roma.

"'08-04-20,'0','Stephen Weiss, an investment banker who provided continuity in the leadership of Cornell University as a donor and a trustee, died on Wednesday at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital in Manhattan, a Cornell affiliate. He was 72 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.The cause was heart failure, said his brother, Roger.Mr. Weiss made major gifts to Cornell, his alma mater, of both time and money, as chairman of the board of trustees from 1989 to 1997 and as a board member for 16 years before that; he was on the search committees that selected four presidents of Cornell.In 1980 he became the first chairman of the Weill Cornell Medical College Board of Overseers. He also served on the advisory councils of the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Veterinary Medicine.Mr. Weiss’s beneficence emphasized Cornell’s human resources rather than brick-and-mortar assets. His brother said Mr. Weiss developed heart problems in the early 1980s, which led to his endowment, with his wife, of the deanship of the medical college. He also sponsored two professorships in cardiothoracic surgery and one in cardiovascular biology and genetics. Among his many other gifts were endowments for a visiting professorship in English and a chair for the head coach of the men’s tennis team.His brother also went to Cornell, as did their father, Milton, a lawyer. His brother said of their father, “We could go to any school we wanted, he said, but the only one he would pay for was Cornell.”Stephen Henry Weiss was born on Oct. 3, 1935, in Manhattan. After graduating from Cornell in 1957, he spent 11 years in investment banking at A. G. Becker & Company. In 1970, he and his brother were co-founders of an investment management firm, Weiss, Peck & Greer, which they sold to Robeco Investment Management in 2001. After that he became a managing director of another investment firm, Neuberger Berman.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Senator John McCain’s speech on taxes last week was widely seen as a stay-the-Bush-course pledge. Not true. Mr. McCain would dig a much deeper hole than even President Bush, exactly what the country does not need. Mr. Bush is already bequeathing his successor a government deep in debt, ill prepared to meet foreseeable challenges — health care, road and bridge repair, alternative energy — let alone emergencies.Unfortunately, Mr. McCain has reversed his earlier passionate — and correct — opposition to the Bush tax cuts. He now calls for permanently extending them. He also proposes to repeal the alternative minimum tax. Those two proposals alone would reduce tax revenue by $1 trillion over four years.His speech did not stop there. He proposed doubling the dependent exemption, to $7,000 per child, cutting revenue by $171 billion more over four years. He said the increase was needed to keep up with inflation, but the exemption has been adjusted for inflation every year since 1982. Then there’s his idea to suspend the 18.4-cents-a-gallon federal gasoline tax from Memorial Day to Labor Day. That would cost the highway trust fund $10 billion.Mr. McCain’s other big proposals — to cut the corporate tax and make the credit for research and development permanent — are fatally flawed by the fact that he offers no feasible way to pay for them. We do not doubt that Mr. McCain would try harder than Mr. Bush to cut spending. But his claim that he would offset hundreds of billions of dollars in new tax cuts by closing loopholes and cutting pork is just not credible. Pork spending, or earmarks, come to some $18 billion a year.Mr. McCain has admitted that he does not know a lot about economics. But he should have no trouble recognizing political pandering, which is the only explanation for many of his proposals. To be taken seriously, he needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a plan that shows how he would govern without adding to the fiscal damage of the past eight years.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Hourly workers had come a long way from the days when employers and unions negotiated a way for them to earn the prizes of the middle class — houses, cars, college educations for their children, comfortable retirements. Even now a residual of that golden age remains, notably in the auto industry. But here, too, wages are falling below the $20-an-hour threshold — $41,600 annually — that many experts consider the minimum income necessary to put a family of four into the middle class.The nation’s political leaders — Democrats and Republicans alike — have argued that education and training are a route back to middle-class wages for those who have fallen out. But the demand isn’t sufficient to absorb all the workers that the leaders would educate. Even now, roughly 15 percent of college-educated workers find themselves in jobs for which they are overqualified, the Economic Policy Institute reports, and many of these jobs pay less than $20 an hour.“People are mainly worried about having a job and only secondly what it pays and whether they are gaining ground,” said Frank Levy, a labor economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, trying to explain the absence of an outcry and a political debate in which the candidates do not quantify the decline. “If you aren’t gaining ground,” Mr. Levy added, “then you look for other ways to pay for consumption, going into debt or, until recently, refinancing your home.”Still, the erosion haunts the presidential campaign. Mr. Obama, competing against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary to be held on Tuesday, touched this nerve in his description of small-town voters who “cling” to their guns and their religion in their resentment over lost jobs. It was a description that prompted John McCain, the Republican candidate, to label Mr. Obama an “elitist,” and Mrs. Clinton to portray him as out of touch with small-town sentiment. But like Mr. Obama, neither spoke of dollars missing from paychecks, or of the disappearing $20-an-hour wage.That basic wage blossomed first in the auto industry in 1948 and served, in effect, as a banner in the ideological struggle with the Soviet Union. As the news media frequently noted, salt-of-the-earth American workers were earning enough to pay for comforts that their counterparts behind the Iron Curtain could not afford.As the years passed, unions succeeded in negotiating this basic wage not as an ultimate goal but as an early rung in their wage ladders. That was the union standard, particularly in heavy industries, and in the early postwar decades nonunion employers fell into line, spreading middle-class incomes broadly through the service sector.“The most important model that rolled off the Detroit assembly lines in the 20th century,” said Harley Shaiken, a labor economist at the University of California at Berkeley, “was the middle class for blue-collar workers.”The high point came in the 1970s, just as the United States was beginning to lose its controlling grip on the economies of the non-Communist world. Since then the percentage of people earning at least $20 an hour has eroded in every sector of the economy, falling last year to 18 percent of all hourly workers from 23 percent in 1979 — a gradual unwinding of the post-World War II gains.The decline is greatest in manufacturing, where only 1.9 million hourly workers still earn that much. That’s down nearly 60 percent since 1979, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports.The shrinkage is sometimes quite open. The Big Three automakers are currently buying out more than 25,000 employees who earn above $20 an hour, replacing many with new hires tied to a “second tier” wage scale that never quite reaches $20. A similar buyout last year removed 80,000 auto workers. Many were not replaced, but many were, with the new hires paid today at the non-middle-class scale, and with fewer benefits.The United Auto Workers agreed to this arrangement, accepting management’s argument that it must have labor cost relief to rebound and prosper. Whatever the justification, the new accord in effect abandoned the 1948 contract. That agreement is still hailed as historic. In contrast, the 2007 contract that reversed it is hardly recognized as a significant event in labor history. “It is significant,” Mr. Shaiken insisted, referring to last year’s contract. “The Big Three and the U.A.W. were the model for industrial America at its zenith.”This time the auto workers weren’t first. They ratified a practice that had spread to tire makers, heavy-equipment manufacturers, parts plants, groceries, retailers and longshoremen, diluting older workers’ resistance by preserving their status, while lowering earning power for new hires.Two tiers is one tactic. Another is filling middle-income jobs with temporary workers earning less. Add outsourcing to the list, and the off-shoring of such middle-income work as computer programming and radiology. Then there are the manufacturers who close a union plant and shift production to a nonunion one, often in the South but also in the Midwest.When Whirlpool, for example, acquired Maytag last year it closed a Maytag washing machine factory in Newton, Iowa, that had employed hundreds of workers at more than $20 an hour and shifted production to its plant in Clyde, Ohio, adding hundreds of workers at $17 an hour.Put givebacks on the list as well. Tens of thousands of workers have accepted wage cuts pressed on them by embattled employers, cuts that in many cases pushed their wages below middle-class levels. Flight attendants are a notable example. And as each new group acquiesces, the standard for what constitutes an acceptable wage comes down in America.“You can’t have an economy heavily invested in tradable goods and services that is completely oblivious to global wages,” said Ron Bloom, special assistant to the president of the United Steelworkers.The decline is most significant in the data that the Bureau of Labor Statistics collects for the nation’s hourly work force, which totals 76 million, or 52 percent of all workers, and ranges from managers and professionals to factory and construction workers to technicians, educators and sales people. The wages of many salaried workers show a similar trend, although the bureau does not convert their pay into hourly amounts.The trend in the hourly work force is striking. Take only the peak years in each business cycle, starting in 1979. The proportion earning at least $20 an hour declined from 23 percent that year, to 20 percent in 1980, to 18 percent in 1989, and to 16 percent in 2000. Manufacturing was hit the hardest.The current business cycle brought some relief. It reached its peak last year, before plunging into what now appears to be the opening months of a stiff recession. In 2007, before the plunge, the percentage of middle-income hourly workers earning at least $20 an hour had risen, to 18 percent. The improvement came mainly from a rising proportion of women in higher-end hourly work.Wages also held up in the public sector. Strip out that sector, and only 16 percent of privately employed hourly workers took home at least $20 an hour, just fractionally above the 2000 level.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','ON April 11, French commandos went in with guns blazing and captured a gang of pirates who days earlier had hijacked a luxury cruise ship, the Ponant, and held the crew for ransom. This was the French solution to a crime wave that has threatened international shipping off Somalia; those of us who have been on the business end of a pirate’s gun can only applaud their action.The British government on the other hand, to the incredulity of many in the maritime industry, has taken a curiously pathetic approach to piracy. While the French were flying six of the captured pirates to Paris to face trial, the British Foreign Office issued a directive to the once vaunted Royal Navy not to detain any pirates, because doing so could violate their human rights. British warships patrolling the pirate-infested waters off Somalia were advised that captured pirates could claim asylum in Britain and that those who were returned to Somalia faced beheading for murder or a hand chopped off for theft under Islamic law.A violation of human rights? In 2007, 433 crew members were either taken hostage, assaulted, injured or killed by pirates. Three seafarers are still missing and presumed dead. According to the International Maritime Bureau, the anti-piracy watchdog of the International Chamber of Commerce, over the past 10 years 3,200 seafarers have been kidnapped, 500 injured and 160 killed.Modern-day pirates are not like Errol Flynn or Johnny Depp swinging through the rigging, but well-armed militiamen equipped with rocket-propelled grenades, assault rifles, global positioning systems and high-speed motorboats who have long terrorized the shipping lanes in the Gulf of Aden and literally gotten away with murder. During the week before the French raid, half the pirate attacks in the world occurred in the gulf, a strategic waterway that leads into the Red Sea and thus to the Suez Canal and Europe. Two weeks before the attack on the Ponant, a huge crude-oil carrier — a monster of a ship as long as the Chrysler Building is tall — en route to the Middle East was attacked by pirates firing automatic weapons. The vessel managed to flee.The Ponant was not the first cruise ship attacked off Somalia. In November 2005, the American ship Seabourn Spirit was attacked. The quick action of the master and the use of a Long-Range Acoustic Device, a sonic weapon that can blow out eardrums, drove off the pirates (an unexploded rocket-propelled grenade, however, did embed itself in the stateroom of a passenger). The Ponant will not be the last cruise ship to be attacked; undefended passenger vessels are among the ships that are most vulnerable to pirates (the Ponant, for example, has a water-hugging swim platform that made it easy to board).Hijacking a ship and kidnapping the crew for ransom is a lucrative business in Somalia. It is less risky than robbing a bank and more profitable than pulling up half-empty fishing nets. Two weeks before the Ponant was captured, Somali pirates released the British-Irish-Russian crew of an ice-breaking tug traveling from Russia to Singapore who had spent 47 days in captivity. The captain had surrendered his vessel after the wheelhouse windows were blown out by gunshots. The ship owner paid a ransom of about $700,000. The French were reported to have paid $2 million for release of the 30 crew members of the Ponant before their military took action.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','From 1980 to 2004, the assets of stock funds increased 90 times, from $45 billion to $4 trillion. During that same period, fees paid by investors and collected by fund managers via fund management companies soared from $288 million to $37 billion. What’s more, the fund managers received their fees regardless of whether the prices of the stocks they selected went up or down.Not surprisingly, mutual funds continue to multiply like rabbits. By the beginning of 2007, there were about 4,800 mutual funds with $6 trillion invested in stocks and $3 trillion more invested in bonds and money market funds.“The remarkable growth is a reflection, no doubt, of pervasive anxiety about corporate pension plans and Social Security, a sense that people had better take care of themselves or they could be left out in the cold in their so-called golden years,” Mr. Lowenstein observes.But alas, the performance of the vast majority of mutual funds ranges from dismal to atrocious, especially in comparison to the highly profitable performance of the management companies that own them. The record of T. Rowe Price, which is widely regarded as a respectable mutual fund family, is one of Mr. Lowenstein’s many graphic cases in point.From 2001 to 2005, T. Rowe’s mutual fund assets under management soared 70 percent to $270 billion; the profit of the management company that owned the funds more than doubled. But most of the investors in T. Rowe’s five leading large-cap growth funds were treading water. During the five-year period ended Dec. 31, 2005, two of the funds gained 1.26 percent and 1.38 percent, barely outperforming the 0.54 percent return of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. The other three T. Rowe funds posted negative returns, ranging from minus 0.26 percent to minus 2.06 percent.Mr. Lowenstein cites several structural reasons for the failure of mutual funds to serve the best interests of their investors.One reason is that most mutual fund managers do not, as Mr. Lowenstein puts it, “eat their own cooking.” From 2003 to 2006, for example, T. Rowe’s chief investment officer amassed ownership or control of stock in the management company worth over $75 million. But his total personal investment in T. Rowe’s mutual funds was only $1 million.Mr. Lowenstein contends that most mutual funds intentionally set low performance standards for themselves. Their goal, he says, is not to beat the S.& P. 500 average or the average of a particular industry sector, but simply to “track,” or approximate, those averages so that their managers “don’t look bad.”The mutual fund industry offers 11,000 different asset classes, ranging from high-tech to old economy stocks that are sold to investors “like soap.” But rather than dealing directly with the public, mutual funds amass up to 90 percent of their money through retail brokerage firms, which, in turn, enjoy “pay to play” revenue-sharing arrangements. In 2005, for example, the Edward Jones brokerage firm collected a whopping $172 million from a favored seven mutual fund groups to which it had referred its retail clients.Mr. Lowenstein acknowledges that indexing a stock portfolio can have its virtues. He notes that a mutual funds analyst at Morningstar recently described T. Rowe Price funds as the type “you would feel good about your granny investing in,” though Mr. Lowenstein hastens to add, “Maybe your grandma, but not mine.”Mr. Lowenstein balances his critique of rapacious mutual funds with an analysis of two relatively new funds, Wintergreen and Fairholme, that buck the prevailing trends.THE Wintergreen and Fairholme business models mirror the Graham-Dodd philosophy of focusing on a few carefully selected stocks rather than diversifying in the name of safety, which is typically a euphemism for lazy research, Mr. Lowenstein says. Where the average mutual fund held 160 stocks, Wintergreen held 41 stocks and Fairholme held just 18 when the book was written. The annual returns of both funds were above 16 percent.Mr. Lowenstein discloses that he owns stakes in the Wintergreen and the Fairholme funds. Given his trashing of most of their competitors, he may be faulted for not specifying the exact amounts of what he describes as his “modest positions.”But at the risk of mixing metaphors, it seems clear that Mr. Lowenstein puts his money where his mouth is, and that the type of investing he praises is the kind of cooking that the general public deserves to be eating as well.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','THE retirement party, held in a back room at the Church of St. Agnes on East 43rd Street, had all the elements typical of such gatherings: teary photographs, a table piled with small gifts, even two cakes topped with the words “Happy Retirement,” although the retiree was not allowed to taste them.That did not appear to bother the guest of honor, a squirmy, 11-year-old snow-white Lab named Ruger who, on Thursday afternoon, was snapping up chunks of diced chicken tossed at him by an admirer.Ruger is a guide dog, and for the past nine years, he has guided Kevin Coughlin, a 46-year-old resident of Murray Hill, around the city. Mr. Coughlin, who lost his sight in 1997 as a result of a genetic condition, has waged several high-profile fights to require businesses in the city to open their doors to guide dogs, as they are required to do by law.Mr. Coughlin has twice filed complaints with the Taxi and Limousine Commission against cabbies who he said had refused to allow Ruger into their taxis.In 2002, Mr. Coughlin filed a discrimination complaint with the city against a coffee shop from which he said Ruger had been ejected. In that year, he also let a news producer with a hidden camera trail him as he and Ruger were turned away from various businesses. (“No dog,” said the tout outside a restaurant on First Avenue. “Maybe somebody no like dogs.”)But Ruger is not as spry as he was. After nearly a decade of trotting around the city, Ruger has developed arthritis. “He has more trouble with stairs now,” Mr. Coughlin explained, rubbing the dog’s back distractedly. Two days after the party, Mr. Coughlin and a friend planned to drive Ruger to his new home, a 30-acre spread with three ponds in Orange County, north of New York, where friends of Mr. Coughlin’s live.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','When Public Phones Are Too PublicPay phones wouldn’t be going the way of the dodo, as suggested in “Shrinking Portals to the Past” (The City Visible, April 13), if the telephone booth were still around. That truly was a street enclosure, with doors that kept out the deafening noise of the street and a generous shelf for pen and paper.It’s no surprise to me that phone booths are no longer lucrative. In their current state, they’re good only for depositing one’s garbage.At the Crosswalks, Perils for EveryoneYour article “For Aging Pedestrians, a Survey of Street Dangers” (April 13), about a study of pedestrian safety on the Upper West Side, neglected to mention a leading cause of pedestrians’ death and injuries in New York: the failure of drivers to yield when turning into a crosswalk.Until the mayor and the police and transportation commissioners declare zero tolerance for this lethal, illegal activity, all other safety measures will do relatively little to stop pedestrian deaths and injuries. The study group led by Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal should push to make enforcement a top priority.I’m also concerned that bicyclists’ breaking of traffic laws wasn’t mentioned. Running red lights, riding in an illegal direction and riding on sidewalks are major fears of the people who participated in the forums Assemblywoman Rosenthal sponsored, several of which I participated in.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Park Avenue co-op owners could easily have absorbed the $8 fee. But it would have been tougher for the Flatbush carpenter who does not want to schlep his toolbox on the subway so he can renovate a Tribeca kitchen or the Queens home care attendant who might have to take a bus to a subway to care for an elderly woman in Gramercy Park but is lucky enough to have a husband who can drop her off on his way to work.That $8 fee can amount to $2,000 a year, chump change for a Manhattan mogul but 5 percent of a year’s income for a young municipal worker or secretary. Somehow, Mr. Brodsky said, issues of economic equity got lost in the debate and shrugged off by environmental groups.“These pricing mechanisms try to modify behavior of people who can’t afford to do what it is we want them to do,” he said.Perhaps equity had nothing to do with it. Policy analysts pointed out that the New York State Legislature’s hostility to congestion pricing was a response to what legislators saw as the billionaire mayor’s dismissive stance toward them and his penchant for strategically doling out large gifts to political and advocacy groups that support his ideas. There were also strong arguments that the city’s subways and buses cannot now accommodate the spillover of motorists who would theoretically forsake their cars.Gene Russianoff, a senior lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group’s Straphangers Campaign, was impressed with how Mr. Brodsky, and his steel-trap-sharp and fast-talking style, honed in Brooklyn and Harvard Law School, led the charge, articulating the case against congestion pricing in the Democratic caucus and to reporters and backing himself up with thesis-sized reports.“I worked closely with him in the fall on the fare hike, and I opposed him on congestion pricing, and it’s much better to be on his team,” Mr. Russianoff said.Congestion pricing — and the $500 million a year it was supposed to raise to improve subways and buses — is not dead. The plan can be reconfigured to offer write-offs on city taxes to those working- and middle-class strivers who need to drive, not a bad idea in an age when the chasm between rich and poor keeps yawning.Some legislators say they think the easiest way to raise money is simply to increase taxes on people making over $1 million a year. That thought may have been buttressed last week by a front-page article in The New York Times showing how, despite recession jitters, hedge fund traders and other tycoons are buying $300,000 Bentleys and $35,000 bottles of Champagne. But politicians don’t want to be seen as raising taxes, so they champion disguised taxes like fees, tolls and tuition increases.There’s also an approach taken by the city of London, which already has congestion pricing but had to double tolls after a year and a half to make it work. It charges a premium on tolls for inefficient cars like S.U.V.’s or limousines.There’s a fair argument to be made that we already have pricing mechanisms — subway fares and bridge tolls — that burden rich and poor alike. But opponents like Mr. Brodsky say that if a relatively novel twist like congestion pricing succeeds, governments desperate for money could start charging people for taking a walk in a city park or entering a library.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Many customers were lured in by the “Last Winery” sign, Mr. Walker said. “Sometimes you think people only know us for the sign,” he said. “I used to tell them, ‘You know, you can come in and taste it, too.’ ”So, which winery on the Island would inherit the honor of being the Last Winery? Mr. Walker said he had pondered this question himself. According to longitudinal coordinates given by online maps, it seemed that Wölffer Estate in Sagaponack, on the South Fork, would.To the east on the North Fork, there are no full wineries, but there are several vineyards, he said. One is owned by the Kontokosta family, one of whose employees recently stopped by and offered to buy Ternhaven’s famous sign.“I told him he could buy it as soon as we close,” Mr. Walker said.Michael Kontokosta, whose family owns a 22-acre vineyard to the northeast, just outside Greenport village, said that he plans to open a full winery in a year or two and that “I would proudly take the distinction.”“I think I’d be the next one to lay claim,” he said by phone on Monday. “I’d be honored to have the designation. It’s a catchy sign, great idea they came up with. Would I have to pay him for the right to it?”I called Roman Roth, the winemaker at Wölffer. He said he had not done the research to confirm if Wölffer could now rightfully claim the easternmost title. But if so, “We would rather be known as the first winery after France, not the last winery before it.”“We would rather be first than last,” Mr. Roth said.Actually, Wölffer used to make a bigger deal over its geographical relationship to better-known wine countries, he said. “When I first came to Wölffer in 1993, we had a sign pole that said, ‘3,500 miles to California’ and ‘3,600 miles to Bordeaux,’ ” he said.But Long Island wines have so improved over the past decade, he added, why even give a nod to those greater regions?“Long Island stands on its own merit as a wine country now,” said Mr. Roth, who also has his own personal label, called Grapes of Roth.I tried to pull him into a North Fork versus South Fork debate, but he resisted, explaining that he actually buys riesling grapes from Mr. Kontokosta’s vineyard on the North Fork. But the easternmost question is no small matter to a Long Island winemaker, he said. While inland vineyards farther west in Riverhead get colder winters and hotter summers, eastern parts of the North Fork are closer to both the Peconic Bay and Long Island Sound on either side and get more temperate climate conditions, allowing longer ripening time in the spring.Mr. Kontokosta agreed, adding, “It’s such a fine point, but it’s something certain people out here could argue about all day long in a bar.”At Ternhaven, Mr. Walker put me on the phone with Mr. Watts, who had been an economics professor at Columbia and began making wine in his Manhattan apartment. In 1994, he planted merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc grapes in a former potato field on Alvah’s Lane in Cutchogue.He later opened his winery, which he operated as a garagiste, a French term for a winemaker who often produces and sells wine out of his home. The term means garage owner, and in Mr. Watts’s case it was a pun on the automotive origin of his winery.Mr. Watts told me the Last Winery idea was thought up by his friend Sy Weissman, who also helped create television commercials as part of catchy ad campaigns for Bumble Bee tuna, Bounty paper towels and Wisk detergent.The winery equipment has been sold, the last wine barrel stood in the corner of the small tasting room and there were stacked cases of the last remaining wine, the 2003 merlot and claret. Mr. Walker said the place would close for good once the final 200 cases were sold.“Then we’ll sell the sign,” he said.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','The charismatic example of Mr. Flórez is inspiring a whole new generation of tenors, among them two Americans: Lawrence Brownlee, 35, often tapped for productions when Mr. Flórez moves on; and Alek Shrader, 26, now at the Juilliard Opera Center, where in November he sang the fiendishly difficult title role of Rossini’s “Comte Ory,” an opera expected at the Met with Mr. Flórez in 2010-11.Last season Met audiences witnessed Mr. Flórez in all his glory as Count Almaviva in “Il Barbiere di Siviglia.” His performance crested, as Rossini intended, with the eight-minute pyrotechnics of “Cessa di più resistere.”That aria, the opera’s last, establishes Almaviva, rather than the barber Figaro, as the true hero of the story. Yet “Barbiere” (which received its premiere under the title “Almaviva”) was long performed without it. As recently as 1988, when the American tenor Rockwell Blake reintroduced “Cessa di più resistere” at the Met, its novelty value occasioned a news release.In the latest production Mr. Flórez included it as a matter of course, bringing down the house. “Very early in my career, I got used to singing my parts without cuts,” Mr. Flórez said. “The decision was not only mine. Ernesto Palacio always pushed for that.”A former bel canto tenor and fellow Peruvian, Mr. Palacio has acted as teacher, agent, adviser and confidant to Mr. Flórez throughout his career. He is one of several forerunners Mr. Flórez acknowledges: in the 1950s, Luigi Alva, another Lima native; in the 1970s, apart from Mr. Palacio, Francisco Araiza, a Mexican.“They had wonderful polish and style,” Mr. Flórez said. “Then, at a certain point, the Americans came in: Rockwell Blake, Chris Merritt. They sang with such virtuosity. It was the first time people heard singing with such breath control, rapidity, color. I’m lucky to come after them. I like to listen, to study. I see a span of development, which I am part of. I have learned from what they created.”But unlike his predecessors, who wowed the experts, Mr. Flórez also has mass appeal. In a recent call from Seattle, Bartlett Sher, who directed him in the Met “Barbiere,” described the Flórez effect. “Juan Diego is fun to watch,” Mr. Sher said. “He has a great, very natural confidence and a relaxed nobility, together with what Noël Coward would call a little twinkle: something slightly wicked and playful and fun. He has a delightful sense of entitlement onstage, and he never makes singing seem intimidating or too much. He keeps you with him. You feel you could be his friend.”Thanks to Mr. Flórez, opera houses are flinging their doors open to frisky young tenors with agile technique. The bright ones know better than to copy him.Mr. Brownlee, who won both the Richard Tucker Award and the Marian Anderson Award in 2006, followed Mr. Flórez in the Met “Barbiere” last year, receiving a hero’s welcome.“You won’t find a bigger fan of Juan Diego’s singing than me,” Mr. Brownlee said recently from Toulouse, France, where he was appearing in Rossini’s “Turco in Italia.” “He definitely raises the standard. He’s said that our voices are very similar in certain ways. I think in some ways they are, and in some ways we’re night and day. People are always going to compare me to him, because, one, we sing the exact same repertory, and, two, we perform on the same stages. I couldn’t compete with him, but it’s not about that. I’m so inspired by what he does. He makes me want to go into the practice room and perfect what I do.”Mr. Shrader made his professional debut with Opera Theater of St. Louis in 2006 as Almaviva (without “Cessa di più resistere,” which he did sing last month in a broadcast concert with the Valdosta Symphony Orchestra in Georgia). Early in 2007 he appeared with the Gotham Chamber Opera in Rossini’s “Signor Bruschino.” But his biggest moment to date was on the Met stage as a winner of the Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. There he tossed off stylish, vivid accounts of Mozart’s florid “Il mio tesoro” from “Don Giovanni” and that Flórez specialty, “Ah, mes amis.”After a further season in training as an Adler Fellow at the San Francisco Opera, Mr. Shrader will head for Germany, to take up major roles in Rossini and Mozart at a leading house. “Flórez has done what opera companies all over are trying to do,” he said recently, “namely to get people to notice opera.”Asked about his vocal models, Mr. Shrader gave Pavarotti pride of place. “I listen to Pavarotti a lot, to be as organic and as easy as he was,” Mr. Shrader said. “But it’s important to sing in your own voice. No one will sing like him. What you can do is let the music come out of your body as he did.”When learning new roles, Mr. Shrader avoids listening to recordings until he has formed clear ideas of his own. Then he checks them out selectively. “For my own repertory,” he said, “I go to Flórez. I go to the best.”Last month, in a Juilliard recital, Mr. Shrader sang a love song from “Barbiere” to his own guitar accompaniment, conjuring up Almaviva’s beloved in the balcony so palpably that people turned to see if she was there. To judge by that excerpt, Mr. Shrader is the most romantic Almaviva of these three, the most innocent of heart, for whom the world is new. At the Met, Mr. Brownlee made the sunniest sound, paradoxically coupled with the giddiest temperament, and Mr. Flórez showed the most mercurial personality, the greatest sense of mischief and the fieriest coloratura. Such distinctions make it worthwhile to keep revisiting war horses; by the same token the personalities artists like these reveal can spark life into works long forgotten.“Matilde di Shabran,” for instance, dusted off for the first time in more than a century in 1996 by the Rossini Opera Festival in Pesaro, Italy. Mr. Flórez was on hand, 23 and fresh from the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where he had completed the training begun at the conservatory in Lima and as a private student of Andrés Santamaria.Spreading the lessons out over long hours, Mr. Santamaria and the young Mr. Flórez would take time out for cool drinks of whiskey and Coke, rustle up thick steaks and rice, and listen to the kind of singing Mr. Santamaria had a passion for: Bach, Handel, Vivaldi, Almaviva’s morning song “Ecco ridente,” shot through with the intricate, swift-moving vocal lines that kindled in Mr. Flórez a love for bel canto.His professional debut was to have been as a walk-on in Pesaro. But Bruce Ford, a noted American bel canto specialist, withdrew on short notice from the role of the woman-hating tyrant Corradino, and Mr. Flórez was pressed into service.“It’s a strange opera,” Mr. Flórez said of the experience a few summers later. “There’s no aria for the tenor, but the ensembles are phenomenal.” Just how phenomenal may be heard on a live Decca recording of a Pesaro revival in 2006. On YouTube the astonishing first stab Mr. Flórez took at the role plays on, epitomizing the confidence Mr. Sher speaks of. The stage-hungry dramatic ferocity is as startling as the technical bravura that makes his lean, intensely focused voice blaze like a hero’s.“I don’t like it,” Mr. Flórez said the other day. “The high notes are ugly. There’s no legato. I like myself better now.”His mantra now is lightness. “When I was in my teens, singing pop music, I tried to make my voice heavy, like a man,” Mr. Flórez said, caricaturing the dull, macho sound. “You can hear that on YouTube too. Voices lose agility as they get older. It’s common for tenors to lose their high notes, for their voices to get heavier. Many go into heavier parts. But technique is like an antioxidant. It maintains your high notes, your agility. Maybe you need to make more effort.”Mr. Flórez cited the Spanish tenor Alfredo Kraus, an immaculate technician renowned for the freshness of his voice into his 70s. “I will add roles, but nothing heavier,” Mr. Flórez said. “I am faithful to my repertoire. That’s what I’m known for. That’s what people want to hear me in.”'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Before her the room presented a study in controlled chaos: 12 San Francisco Ballet dancers rehearsing her work in progress; 8 understudies behind; 3 members of her own Margaret Jenkins Dance Company on hand to divide and conquer with corrections; the ballet mistress Betsy Erickson jotting down notes on the music, finished just weeks earlier.“We haven’t worked on this since July,” Ms. Jenkins said. “Thank God the muscle memory is amazing. But you lose the shape.” She held up an arm in two poses. “Is it this or this?”The dancers are happy for the extra coaching. In addition to the sheer volume of new works, they must tackle a spectrum of movement styles, from Ms. Jenkins’s slinky physicality to Stanton Welch’s grand classicism.That variety speaks to Mr. Tomasson’s desire for cross-pollination among styles and genres — the company devotes about a third of its season to contemporary work pushing the limits of classical ballet vocabulary — as well as the breadth of his connections. Some of the choreographers, like Mr. Morris and Mr. Wheeldon, are international stars who favor working with San Francisco Ballet for its versatile, intelligent dancers. Others, like Mr. Welch and James Kudelka, are established talents whom Mr. Tomasson helped catapult through commissions early in their dancemaking careers.Still others, like Yuri Possokhov and Julia Adam, are former San Francisco Ballet dancers he nurtured from their first efforts. Then there are the faces new to San Francisco Ballet’s audience, like the much in-demand Jorma Elo, creating his first work for the company, and Ms. Jenkins, a respected fixture of West Coast postmodern dance for more than 30 years.“In this time of change in the dance world in our whole culture, I’m thinking, ‘Look ahead,’ ” Mr. Tomasson said. “Let’s see how these 10 choreographers approach ballet differently. How can their different ways of working be transported and exchanged? How can they learn from one another?”Each choreographer was granted total artistic freedom, resulting in a grab bag of subjects and sounds, from the modern-dance master Paul Taylor’s hippie-flavored take on songs by the Mamas and the Papas to Val Caniparoli’s anguished impressions of Ibsen plays, set to Dvorak. For Mr. Morris’s “Joyride” the San Francisco Ballet commissioned, with Stanford Lively Arts and Carnegie Hall, a new score by the Minimalist composer John Adams. Ms. Jenkins’s and Mr. Kudelka’s works have new scores too.But with the rush of creativity comes, inevitably, logistical madness. The ballet’s management has worked hard to contain it, having planned the festival since 2005. The choreographers began creating their ballets in June, visiting in pairs; they have three weeks of studio time, rather than the standard four, and a week before the festival. Dancer injuries are a greater hazard than usual. So Mr. Tomasson handed down a new rule: No dancer may appear in more than three ballets.Yet the most careful plans can’t avoid the frenzy inherent in getting 10 works ready for the stage in one blast. And the New Works Festival follows five taxing regular-season programs, with a sixth week given to visiting companies to allow the dancers a breather. Each world premiere will have only one dress rehearsal with full orchestra. “It’s flabbergasting,” Mr. Taylor said.But the adrenaline is part of the point, and so is the danger. “It’s taking a huge chance,” Mr. Tomasson acknowledged calmly. “What if it doesn’t work? Well, it’s better to try than not.”Even the stressed dance makers agree. Mr. Welch, the artistic director of Houston Ballet, said he had enjoyed the exchange of ideas in the choreographers’ lounge, where the artists listen to their scores on headphones and generally try to remain calm. “San Francisco Ballet has become a tremendously creative place, and Helgi built that,” Mr. Welch said.Ms. Jenkins embodied that fearless spirit as she watched the day’s final run of her ballet, “Thread,” describing to rehearsal onlookers how the elaborate set, which she had not yet seen, would fit on the opera house stage, how the complex music by Paul Dresher might sound as played by the orchestra. Damian Smith, an elegant principal dancer, twirled through turns with his face raised to the ceiling as the rest of the cast dashed to avoid crashes, obscenities ringing out with every near miss.“Good,” Ms. Jenkins called, unruffled. “Fast and furious — that’s the way it works around here. It’s a wild ride.”'"
"'08-04-20,'0','It’s a tribute to the richness of the Neuberger Museum of Art’s collection that a random visit to an exhibition focusing on part of its permanent collection yielded splendid results. In fact, “Komar and Melamid: Super Objects — Super Comfort for Super People,” though a relatively small show for this museum, couldn’t be more rewarding.The exhibition returns us to a vital, memorable moment in the early 1970s, when a few brave contemporary Russian artists began to rebel against the tradition of Socialist Realism, a style that promoted Soviet political ideology. These artists often turned to conceptual art in defiance of the authorities, their work exhibited secretly in underground clubs and apartments.Vitaly Komar and Alexander Melamid were two Russian conceptual artists who worked collaboratively between 1972 and 2003 under the name Komar and Melamid. Like their peers, they were both trained as painters in the tradition of Socialist Realism, but became increasingly disenchanted with the direction of Russian society and began to re-evaluate their commitment to making art in the service of the state. They became dissidents.Among the first Soviet experimental artists to receive international art world attention, Komar and Melamid were invited in 1977 to have an exhibition at the Ronald Feldman Gallery in New York. They proposed a conceptual art print portfolio combining photography and text, “Super Objects — Super Comfort for Super People,” but the negatives for the project had to be smuggled out of Russia and the photographs printed in the United States because the Soviet authorities refused the artists permission to attend.Today “Super Objects — Super Comfort for Super People” is widely admired as a seminal art project by these two pioneers of the Moscow conceptual art movement, who migrated to the United States via Israel in 1978, the same year their first museum exhibition opened at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford. Since then they have become famous for a variety of conceptual art stunts, including teaching elephants in Thailand to paint abstract art. In 2000, Christie’s held an auction of 50 paintings by the elephants; all of them sold, one for as much as $2,100.But back in 1977 the artists had larger world issues in their sights. “Super Objects — Super Comfort for Super People” consists of a portfolio of 36 small color photographs and accompanying English-language text panels describing fanciful Soviet consumer products and devices. Laid out as a playful parody of American home shopping catalogs supplied to the artists by friends living in the West, the consumer products were also divided into 10 categories suggesting some type of self-improvement or self-enhancement.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Westerners writing about Japan tend to fall into two camps — those enraptured with its modernity, the idea that frenetic, hypertrophied Tokyo somehow represents the future, or others, like Martha Sherrill, the author of “Dog Man,” who find in Japan’s remote regions an anachronistic respite that harks back to our rustic past. Both are promising settings, yet each, in the wrong hands, can reduce the Japanese to caricatures, either salaryman robots living in their capsule hotels or zen master naturalists who live in perfect wa (harmony) with their picturesque countryside. It is a tribute to Sherrill, author of two novels and a previous nonfiction book called “The Buddha From Brooklyn,” that she depicts her protagonist, Morie Sawataishi, a legendary breeder of prize-winning Akita dogs, as much more than an anime rendering of a mountain man, even if that means leaving the reader to grapple with a mysterious and sometimes dark central character.Morie, an engineer who spent his life building and managing power plants in rural Japan, is an obsessive collector of Akitas, the muscular, stout hunting breed descended from animals domesticated by the Ainu — the aboriginal tribe of the Japanese archipelago. In his compulsive compiling of data about dogs, in his theorizing about which traits (long or short nose, round or triangular eyes, short or long fur) make for a perfect Akita and in his raising of the dogs themselves, he elevated the breeding of Akitas into a kind of Japanese art form, similar, in its rigid doctrine and hierarchy, to the tea ceremony or flower arranging.Morie’s mastery may also have saved the breed from extinction. During World War II, the Japanese Army paid a bounty for Akitas, skinning them and using their fur to line officers’ coats. Impoverished farmers who by 1945 could barely feed themselves turned over their dogs by the thousands. By the end of the war, when Morie was living deep in the mountains of Akita Prefecture, there were fewer than two dozen Akitas left in all of Japan. Life in Japan during the cataclysmic finale of the Greater Co-Prosperity Sphere was rough — my mother, the Japanese writer Foumiko Kometani, has told me stories of her evacuation to the countryside, where she subsisted on soy beans and a kind of wild fern. Yet Morie, even as his family struggled to buy rice, sheltered and raised an Akita puppy of good lineage; one of its ancestors was a famous prewar dog that eventually graced a postage stamp. Much to his wife’s annoyance, the dog was soon consuming six pounds of food a day. As his house filled up with relatives taking refuge from America’s bombing campaign against Tokyo, Morie’s family was soon “speechless with disgust. You weren’t supposed to feed dogs when people were starving.” The Akita breed as we now know it survives in part because Morie did precisely that.I should state that I am not a particular lover of purebred dogs — perhaps because I’m a “mixed breed” myself, half Japanese and half American — and so I do not share some of the passions of those who might read in Morie’s careful breeding and cataloging of Akitas an interesting and thoughtful recent history of a beautiful dog variety. (I am fond of Akitas, however. Back in the ’80s I housesat for a friend who owned a majestic Akita with whom I felt perfectly safe venturing through the remote reaches of Central Park at all hours of the pre-Giuliani night.) Yet I suspect even some fans of purebreds will find in Morie’s genetic fine-tuning — his thoughts about the purity of “snow country” dogs, his listing of desirable traits, the discussion of what breeders were “trying to eliminate in their dogs” — a discomfiting suspicion that Morie stealthily transposed Japan’s prewar eugenic obsession with racial purity to another species. In other words, Morie believed that too many of the Akitas in postwar Japan were impure, having been interbred with foreign dogs. As I read “Dog Man,” I wondered at the connection between Morie’s obsession with purity and his managing a power plant that employed American and English prisoners of war as slave labor. “Their clothes were in shreds. They barely had shoes,” Morie’s wife remembers. “Their beards were long, and their hair was greasy and matted. You’ve never seen people so thin ... and they were forced to work outside in the cold.” In fascist Japan, it must have been too easy to dismiss prisoners of war as lacking positive kisho, the vitality and personality Morie so prized in his purebred dogs. It would have been enlightening if Sherrill had written about his thoughts on using slave labor. That silence is troubling.“Dog Man” is best when it describes Japan’s snow country — those northern prefectures, usually abutting the Sea of Japan, where the drifts can rise to 20 or 30 feet and where prodigious amounts of fine, particulate snow blow through the tiny gaps left by closed windows and doors. Sherrill’s rendering of the region is more vivid even than the one in Edward Seidensticker’s translation of “Snow Country,” the novel by the Nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata. And her description of Morie’s ever patient wife, Kitako, a woman from a well-to-do Tokyo family who moves to Akita after marriage, is also superb, evoking the period before modern telecommunications and Japan’s Shinkansen bullet train.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','While reading the review of Amy Sutherland’s book “What Shamu Taught Me About Life, Love, and Marriage” (March 30), I realized I had heard this idea before. In the 1962 movie with Sandra Dee and Bobby Darin, “If a Man Answers,” Dee, as a new bride, “trains” her husband with the help of a book on dog training. It’s a sad commentary that 46 years later, similar techniques are being recommended to train the “Big Dog.”'"
"'08-04-20,'0','Being a grandmaster is not what it used to be.The title is the highest awarded by the World Chess Federation. The term is about 100 years old and was used to designate players who were better than mere masters.The term was used informally at first, but in 1950, the federation began designating grandmasters based on set criteria.There were 27 grandmasters in that first group. By the early 1970s, there were fewer than 100. Today, there are more than 1,000.For one, there has been an increase in knowledge and ability because of the improvement in computers that people use to train and study and the increased availability of chess information on the Internet. But there has also been title inflation, meaning that some current grandmasters would not have qualified for the title years ago. It is also a lifetime title. One grandmaster, Andor Lilienthal of Hungary, is one of the 27 from 1950.Nigel Short of England, who was once ranked No. 3 in the world, has said jokingly that the term has become so devalued that he would rather be called “Mister” than “grandmaster.”'"
"'08-04-20,'0','But according to the coming book “Death at the Ballpark,” co-written by Robert M. Gorman, a librarian at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C., and David Weeks, more than 75 deaths have been caused by foul balls from the major leagues to the sandlots. So the danger exists, and with box seats in the new stadiums closer to the field, the danger increases.Japan has the solution. When the Red Sox opened the season there, maybe you noticed that protective screens rose along the front-row boxes all the way to the outfield walls.When Commissioner Bud Selig was asked, in a telephone interview from his Milwaukee office, if similar protective screens had ever been discussed by major league owners, he said the sentiment over the years was that the fans’ view of the game would be obstructed. Yet nobody seems to object to the view from behind the screen and netting behind home plate. Many fans prefer to sit there. Families of players and team personnel are usually placed there.In a sampling of about a dozen fans in the unprotected areas and under the screen behind home plate at Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium last week, the breakdown was about half for the status quo and half for more screening or netting.“I got hit by a baseball right in the head in ’03, but I still think it would take away from the game to have the screens up,” said Paul Bastkowski of Salem, N.Y., sitting behind first base at Yankee Stadium with his 9-year-old daughter. “You’ve got to be alert, and you have to understand the risk.”At Shea Stadium, Alan Salen of Oceanside, N.Y., sitting behind third base with his 7-year-old son, said that being hit by a foul ball was “always a fear.”“That’s why I make sure I’m sitting to his right,” he said, referring to his son. “You want to be kid friendly, and I can’t think of any other way to do it except putting the net up.”Hardly anybody protested when the N.H.L. put up netting around the goal areas at each rink in 2002, after 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil became the first fan killed by a puck in the league’s history. She was struck in the head by a deflected puck during a game in Columbus, Ohio, and died two days later.At both New York baseball stadiums, players and coaches in the dugout are protected by screens, installed after Don Zimmer, then a Yankee coach, was struck on the side of his face by a foul ball during a 1999 playoff game against Texas.Rushed to the trainer’s room in the Yankee clubhouse, Zimmer was being comforted when, as he recalled in his book, “Zim,” he heard the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, order a shield for the dugout, saying, “We can’t have guys getting hurt like this.” The next day Zimmer wore an Army helmet in the dugout as Joe Torre’s bench coach. But there is still no shield for all those “guys” sitting behind the dugouts.At next month’s owners meeting, Selig promised to “bring it up and talk about it,” meaning additional screens or netting for the fans. But do not merely talk about it. Do something about it. Baseball does not need another black eye. Or worse, a black hearse.'"
"'08-04-20,'0','With its sometimes cloyingly rustic charms — cobbled streets, orange-tile roofs, streams of bell-ringing bicyclists — Copenhagen can seem like a postcard sketched by a Nordic Norman Rockwell. It’s that rare civic-minded metropolis where everyone lines up for every service, the trains all run on time and no one crosses the street against the light.When the wholesomeness becomes oppressive, a gorgeously debauched side of Copenhagen awaits in its myriad dive bars. Coming to life as midnight rolls around, these booze-soaked and character-rich old watering holes offer a convivial antidote to the Danish capital’s picture-perfect public face.Everything is red inside bordello-like Bo-Bi Bar (Klareboderne 14; 45-33-12-55-43): the faded Baroque-style wallpaper, the threadbare curtains, the smoke-soaked lampshades — and especially the swollen, grinning faces of the numerous regulars. Few bars in Copenhagen draw such a diverse crowd, which on a recent night included 20-something cool kids, 30-something intellectuals and some thin ageless barflies with names like Ole and Jonas. Founded in 1917, this city-center institution remains resolutely old school. Cellphones may not be used inside, digital cameras can be used only with permission, and the marquee attraction on the three-item food menu is hard-boiled eggs. (“They’re a good food when you’re drunk,” says the bartender Nanna Sarauw. “They get people straight.”)Walking into the defiantly charmless interior of another hangout, Café Viking (Aegirsgade 36, 45-35-83-14-93, www.cafeviking.dk), is like entering a Danish basement recreation room circa 1974. Between the wood-paneled walls and the sallow lighting, everything seems chosen to offend the sensibilities of the slick young professionals in the über-hip Norrebro neighborhood. The reward is one of the city’s best beer lists, which includes Brooklyn lager and some 20 Danish microbrews. To make Stone Ale (whose label depicts a drunk-looking Mick Jagger), superheated lava stones are tossed into the beer, which caramelizes into a sweet elixir at a potent 7.7 percent alcohol.Long ago at Funchs Vinstue (Norre Farimagsgade 55, 45-33-11-54-45), a working man could get a hot meal and cabaret show for the equivalent of 15 cents. Those days are gone, but the smoky, wood-lined bar still offers a deal to its mix of middle-aged regulars and young hipsters: a Carlsberg beer and a shot of licorice-flavored Gammel Dansk bitters for 40 kroner, $8.40 at 4.8 Danish kroner to the dollar. Grab a backgammon set, but don’t ring the bell on the wall unless you’re feeling rich.""If you ring it once, it means a round of drinks for the people at the bar,"" explains Paul Kurtzau, a taxi driver and 15-year patron. ""If you ring it twice, it’s a round for the whole place. And if you ring it three times, it’s time to go home.""'"
"'08-04-20,'0','At this time, Mountain Travel Sobek is in the vanguard of American tour companies offering guided outdoor trips to the country, but local tour operators say adventure travel and ecotourism in Bosnia are growing. Though the country is small — it has about 20,000 square miles, just a bit less than West Virginia — it is home to a thrillingly diverse landscape of alpine peaks, old-growth forests, highland villages, deep canyons, emerald rivers and, to the south, drier, low-altitude Mediterranean terrain. Five major mountains surround Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, which was host to the 1984 Winter Olympics. On the official Bosnia and Herzegovina tourism Web site (www.bhtourism.ba/eng), there is a section devoted to “Eco-Adventure,” touting hiking, whitewater rafting, mountain biking and fly-fishing as among the country’s top attractions.Eight years ago, Green Visions (www.greenvisions.ba), a Sarajevo-based tourism and environmental protection company, began leading day trips into the mountains on the outskirts of the city. It proposed a long-term plan for environmentally responsible tourism development in Bosnia, since eco-tourism, its founders say, is one of the best ways to protect natural resources and aid local communities in the process.“We were all aware that tourism and environmentalism often go head to head, and we didn’t want to make the same mistakes that many make in confronting postwar poverty, by selling off resources and degrading the environment, or monopolizing or manipulating the local communities,” said Tim Clancy, a co-founder of Green Visions. “This is a gold mine. I tease people here that if this was in the U.S., the entire country would be a national park.”Mr. Clancy, who hails from Long Island, went to Bosnia in 1992 as a volunteer, intending to stay for just three weeks, but he has been there ever since. In partnership with a pair of Bosnians, a Dutch friend and another American, he began Green Visions to introduce the idea of linking cultural, historical and environmental preservation with economic development.“Even today, eco-tourism is a brand new concept here,” he said. “The general situation in Sarajevo looks pretty good — everywhere you look, you see cafes open, and so on — but people in the mountains need help. As soon as you get outside the city a little bit, people are still quite poor and struggling to get by. If done right, tourism is good because you can employ a lot of people and spread the wealth.”For the first few years of Green Visions’ operation, most of its clientele consisted of diplomatic and aid workers employed by the United Nations or embassies. Now, Mr. Clancy says, at least 90 percent of Green Visions’ customers are tourists, and the company has an established organized-group schedule between May and October, with most tours booking for 10 days.Green Visions partners with British travel companies like Exodus, Explore and Walks Worldwide, and it helped Mountain Travel Sobek develop its current program in Bosnia. For Sobek, which offered trips to Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia, Bosnia was intriguing as an emerging destination unscathed by the masses of tourists flooding into the rest of Europe.John Yost, Sobek’s co-founder, guided the debut departure last year. He said that Bosnia was also vastly different from other states in the former Yugoslavia, particularly Croatia, which has surged back in popularity for its modern, sophisticated coastal scene. “Bosnia and Montenegro are really still starting out,” he said. “They are adventurous destinations in every respect. Of course, when you get there, you can’t avoid the impact of the war, and you can’t avoid that there was incredible trauma very recently, but you get to appreciate the positive things that have happened since then.”Mountain Travel Sobek is offering three 10-day itineraries this summer, with departures on June 25, July 16 and Aug. 13 (the cost is $2,995 per person, excluding international airfare). The trip begins and ends in Sarajevo, visiting major cultural, historical and battle sites, but travelers spend most of their time on moderate hikes, visiting mosques and medieval villages en route, and spending nights at small, locally run hotels. One afternoon is devoted to rafting Class II and III rapids on the pristine Neretva River. The trip employs local guides trained by Green Visions, whose staff has critical knowledge of remote mountain areas that have still not been cleared of land mines.Anne Wood, program director for Mountain Travel Sobek’s Europe trips, said that the chief feedback she received from guests on the inaugural Bosnia adventure was that they loved being pioneers in an up-and-coming place. “Adventure travel doesn’t move big chunks of people,” she said, “but we can set the example in the national parks where our trips take place.” The cooperation with local groups and guides, she added, is essential to helping them formulate effective rules that will protect their natural areas for a long time to come.Mr. Wellenius, the pioneer hiker, agreed. “For me,” he said, “this trip felt like a good opportunity to participate, in however small a way, in the economic recovery of a country.”Mr. Clancy, of Green Visions, is happy to see more Americans coming to Bosnia, especially independent travelers, though he cites a simpler reason for the draw. “They’ve done themselves justice by getting themselves in here,” he said, “because this is a really sexy swath of Mother Nature.”'"

"'08-04-21,'0','Mike Daisey is not an instantly likable performer. He starts his latest monologue, “How Theater Failed America,” at a ranting pitch, a self-described fat guy who in minutes has sweat pouring down his reddened face. But he changes that tone in a flash and becomes so endearingly friendly that there was a moment, deep into his opening-night performance, when the entire room was quietly rapt — not what you would expect at Joe’s Pub, where silverware clangs while waiters circle. It takes a remarkable performer to pull that off.Mr. Daisey, who tells personal stories in the spare, Spalding Gray style, is best known for “21 Dog Years,” an account of his time laboring in the brick-and-mortar of amazon.com. The title of this new piece, like his angry first impression, is misleading. The show is not a tirade but a gentle remembrance of how Mr. Daisey came to love theater, combined with some very funny stories about his professional misadventures (playing a masturbating bishop in a Seattle production of Genet’s “Balcony” was one), and sardonic rebukes to the corporate types who now hold American theater, especially regional theater, hostage.Recalling his college days at what he calls a micro-Ivy in New England, he combines a sense of the ridiculous — an inspiring acting teacher resembled Gollum in “Lord of the Rings” — with an unsappy yet powerful sense of the wonder of theater. As an audience member at the college’s repertory season, he discovered the magic of actors transforming themselves every day into vastly different people.He and five friends tried to reproduce that magic — with the evening’s most hilarious results — by founding Theater on the Pond, a one-summer-long experiment in far western Maine. There’s regional theater, but that spot was ridiculous. Scheduling David Mamet next to Tennessee Williams and Neil Simon, troupe members did everything from act to buy gels for the lights. “We had gels, ’cause what are we, animals?” he asks, sardonically positioning himself as both inside and outside the theater world while never dropping his regular-guy persona.As a professional actor traveling the country, he finds city after city where, he says, “freeze-dried actors from New York” are flown in for single runs, and he mourns the loss of the community that repertory fosters. He can be both understanding of the economic necessities and disingenuous about how simple a let’s-make-some-art project can be, but mostly his observations about the problems facing theater are as obvious as: Art is not a commodity. His most pointed comment quotes an artistic director who worries: What if we lowered prices and audiences still didn’t come? What if no one cares?“It’s a cultural problem, not an economic problem,” Mr. Daisey says. (Not very constructive but worth thinking about.)'"
"'08-04-21,'0','Q. I am wondering if you have any statistics concerning the amount of taxpayer dollars spent on these so-called analysts?A. It is difficult to assess the total amount of tax money spent on this effort. Significant sums were spent taking military analysts on trips to Iraq and Guantanamo. For example, when a group of analysts were taken to Iraq in 2003, they were flown each morning on military transport planes from their hotel in Kuwait to Baghdad, and then back to Kuwait at day’s end. They traveled around Iraq in heavily guarded convoys. In recent years, the Pentagon has paid the commercial airfare of some analysts who participated in trips to Iraq. The Pentagon also paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to a private contractor to monitor their news media appearances.The Networks' Side of the StoryQ. While this is an excellent piece of reporting in covering the relationship between the networks' star military analysts and the Pentagon, the networks themselves essentially get a free pass. To say that the networks simply neglected to investigate conflicts of interest obscures the fact that overall there was a huge gap between the picture of the war presented through news reporting and that presented through so-called expert analysis. That gap must have been as obvious to the networks themselves as it was to anyone else. The editors and executives who made no effort to close that gap have questions to answer. Why did you not dig more deeply into the network side of this story?A. We did dig into the network side of this story. Two networks, CBS and Fox News, declined to answer any questions about their use of military analysts, including what specific steps they took to vet them for business ties that could pose conflicts and what ethical guidelines they established for them. NBC would not allow any executives to be interviewed, but released a short statement saying it had “clear policies in place’’ to avoid even the perception of a conflict of interest. Spokesmen for CNN and ABC said that while their military analysts were expected to keep them informed of outside sources of income, neither network had written ethics policies governing potential conflicts of interest with their analysts. But the question you raise – why didn’t the network news executives try to “close the gap’’ between what journalists were reporting and what some analysts were saying – is a good one. One possible answer: Several analysts said in interviews that network news officials tended to defer to their experience and expertise in military matters.Policies of The New York TimesThe following two questions were directed to Bill Keller, executive editor, and Andrew Rosenthal, editorial page editor.Q. Does the Times have any ""military consultants"" on staff, and do they have any ties to the military-industrial complex? How much do you pay them? Do they profit from this war? Do they have any ties to the White House - or were they supplied by the administration? Perhaps those in glass houses should not throw rocks.A. The Times does not employ military consultants, nor do we pay sources (military-industrial or otherwise) for information. Our reporters who cover military affairs, like all of our journalists, are prohibited by our ethics policy from having any financial holding that would represent a conflict of interest.Q. Which NY Times Op-Ed pieces were written by the Pentagon influenced analysts, and why did the NY Times use them? Have you taken steps to prevent this from happening again?A. According to reporting by The Times, nine of the military analysts who received briefings or trips from the Pentagon as part of an effort to produce more favorable news coverage of the war in Iraq have written articles that were published on our Op-Ed Page. We published those opinion articles because we believed the authors had expertise in the areas about which they were writing, and that their opinions -- which often had nothing to do with the war in Iraq -- were worth our readers' notice.It is important to note that these were presented as opinion articles on our Op-Ed page, not as military analysis or objective reporting, and that in many cases, we asked the authors to write about topics of our choosing. They were not articles that were offered to us. In any case, none of the articles reflected the Pentagon's efforts to paint a falsely rosy view of events in Iraq, nor was there any conflict involving any author's business interests. As a matter of policy, The Times requires its Op-Ed contributors to disclose any business or financial connections they may have with the subject of their articles. The contract Op-Ed contributors are required to sign mandates that they fully and truthfully disclose any conflicts.One of the nine authors was named in The Times's article on the Pentagon program: retired Army Gen. James Marks. General Marks wrote an Op-Ed article entitled ""Rebels, Guns and Money,"" which we published on Nov. 10, 2004. It discussed the tactics, strategies and techniques involved in urban warfare, looking ahead to an impending military assault on the city of Falluja. General Marks did not take a stand on how the war was going in Iraq.Of the other eight authors, who were not named in The Times article on the Pentagon campaign, one was a consistent and prominent critic of the Bush administration's policies in Iraq and four wrote articles that were not about the war in Iraq. None of the remaining three offered assertions about the course of the war in Iraq or based their articles on Pentagon briefings or junkets.It is the policy of The Times's editorial department to do everything we can to tell our readers what our Op-Ed contributors bring to the table -- whether it is a political affiliation, a business interest, or anything else that helps readers evaluate the authors' opinions. We will continue to do so in the future. The article about the Pentagon program gives us valuable information to use in that effort.The Origins of the ""Message Machine""Q. In speaking of Torie Clarke, the former Pentagon public relations executive, the article states: ""...even before Sept. 11, she built a system within the Pentagon to recruit key influentials -- movers and shakers from all walks who with the proper ministrations might be counted on to generate support for Mr. Rumsfeld's priorities."" I'm wondering what Mr. Rumsfeld's priorities were before 9/11, and why was the Pentagon building a network of ""influentials"" to shape public opinion before 9/11?A. Ms. Clarke’s team reached out to so-called “key influentials” before Sept. 11 to generate support for a variety of Mr. Rumsfeld’s priorities, including ballistic missile defense and his plan to transform the military into a leaner and more agile force. In her 2006 memoir, ""Lipstick on a Pig: Winning in the No-Spin Era by Someone Who Knows the Game,"" Ms. Clarke wrote: ""I was obsessed with reaching out to people who were, in turn, reaching out to thousands and millions on a regular basis."" Beyond retired officers, the Pentagon also reached out to a range of leaders -- from religious groups, non-governmental organizations, labor unions and major corporations. But the retired officers received by far the most attention in the years after Sept. 11 because of their impact on the coverage of the war, especially as TV and radio military analysts.Q. Network news is rife with ""hired expert"" analysis, in fields ranging from medicine to finance. Is there any evidence that the conflict of interest standards were bent more severely for generals than others? Isn't this evidence of a much bigger problem, and more reason that real reporters ought to be getting all the air time on news programs, and the so-called ""experts"" either interviewed without pay or relegated to the TV talk shows?A. This is not the first time TV news organizations have confronted questions about undisclosed conflicts involving outside consultants or analysts. The financial news networks, for example, confronted this issue several years ago in connection with hidden financial interests of some stock market commentators. The subsequent outcry led to more disclosure. But with military analysts, the networks have not been as diligent about disclosing to viewers outside ties that could present a conflict of interest. Military analysts are typically introduced to viewers with brief descriptions of their military backgrounds. Viewers are not told whether they do or do not have ties to military contractors with interests in the subjects they are asked to discuss.Q. Your article refers to the fact, on several occasions, the various network ""handlers"" are unaware of the liaison the ""military analysts"" enjoy with Pentagon staff. How can that be? Are they that naive?A. In interviews, many military analysts said the same thing -- that the network officials they deal with the most (the bookers, producers and anchors) had only the vaguest idea of the frequency or subject matter of their interactions with the Pentagon. In part, this is because the sessions were almost always kept ""off the record"" or ""on background,"" and some analysts interpreted this to mean that they could not even disclose these sessions to network news executives. Several analysts said that on the basis of a briefing, they might then pitch an idea for a segment to a producer or booker. Sometimes they would even help write the questions for the anchors to ask during the segment.A. Military analysts have told me that under Secretary Gates, they still get plenty of access, but not in quite the same way. They have not, for example, had the kind of regular meetings with him that they used to have with Mr. Rumsfeld, although they are briefed almost weekly by other senior military officials.'"
"'08-04-21,'0','In addition, a Japanese oil tanker was damaged Monday when it was attacked by a small boat off the coast of Yemen, the tanker’s owner, Nippon Yusen, said. The tanker, the Takayama, was hit by an unspecified projectile.Rising inflation and a falling dollar have also exacerbated the rise in prices. Investors have been buying commodity assets, like oil, to hedge against inflationary pressure and the falling value of the dollar against other currencies. The dollar recently touched a low of 1.59 against the euro.Given some signs of slowing growth around the world, the International Energy Agency, an advisory agency to industrialized nations, reduced its forecast for global demand growth this month by 300,00 barrels a day. But the agency still anticipates oil consumption to grow 1.5 percent this year compared with 2007.Most of that growth is expected to come from developing nations, which have been the main engine behind a rise in energy prices in the last six years. Oil consumption in industrialized countries is expected to drop slightly this year.In the United States, the combination of steadily rising gasoline prices and a sharply slowing economy has cut into gasoline consumption. As a result, demand for gasoline is headed for its first annual drop in 17 years, according to forecasts by the Energy Information Administration.American motorists are expected to consume 9.26 million barrels a day of gasoline this year, compared with 9.29 million barrels a day in 2007. While the decline — 0.3 percent — might not sound like much, gasoline demand typically increases 1 percent to 2 percent a year.In 1991, a year that the United States was in a recession, demand fell 0.6 percent to 7.13 million barrels. Gasoline consumption had risen every year since.Overall oil consumption in the United States, should reach 20.61 million barrels a day this year, down from 20.70 million barrels in 2007.“What we’re seeing is a combination of a recession and some conservation efforts,” said Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of America. “People will do what they can to reduce demand but its hard.”In 2007, spending on petroleum products, including gasoline, accounted for 5.3 percent of America’s gross domestic product. That is still short of the peak reached in 1980, at 8.5 percent, but considerably higher than the low reached in 1998, a period of record low prices, when petroleum spending represented a mere 2.7 percent of G.D.P.There is little relief to expect from oil producers, at least in the short term. In fact, a meeting of producing and consuming nations in Rome showed that the perceptions of the oil market seemed to be widening between industrialized countries, which fear that the continuous run-up in prices might derail the global economy, and oil producers who remain deaf to pleas to bolster production.“Oil prices are at an extraordinary high level today,” said Akira Amari, Japan’s economy trade and industry minister. “I have been repeatedly stating my strong sense of crisis that the global economy would suffer a setback if these conditions are left as they are.”The meeting brought together over 60 energy ministers, including representatives from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. The OPEC cartel accounts for about 40 percent of the world’s oil exports. The cartel has refused to pump more oil, fearing that any hasty move would lead to plummeting oil prices.“When I spoke from the podium I asked the ministers, ‘Do you agree with me that current prices are too high’, ” said Nobuo Tanaka, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. He said the response he received was “totally quiet.”Outside of the meeting, some OPEC ministers were not so shy about expressing their unwillingness to step up production.“OPEC has put the maximum supply in the market — this is not a problem of supply, it’s a problem that is very connected to the financial problems in the U.S. economy,” Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela’s oil minister, was quoted by Reuters as saying.'"
"'08-04-21,'0','“We haven’t seen this in generations,” he said on BBC television. “It’s happening in America, Europe, the Far East. It is affecting countries all over the world. We’re determined to do everything we can to get normality here.”The central bank said the asset swaps would be for one year and could be renewed for up to three years. The swaps are available only for assets existing at the end of 2007 and cannot be used to finance new lending.Analysts seemed skeptical that the move would ease lending conditions significantly, though they agreed that it was a shot in the arm for banks.Many British banks have announced plans to reduce exposure to real estate lending, and with prices falling, few are inclined to rethink those intentions, analysts said. The experience of the United States, where similar measures have failed to initiate much new lending, is also cautionary.“We could well end up with a similar situation as the United States,” said an economist with ING in London, James Knightley. “It’s one way to boost confidence and help banks lend, but the impact on the real economy may be quite minimal.”The Federal Reserve in Washington said last month that it would swap up to $200 billion of government bonds for mortgage-backed securities.Still, an official of the International Monetary Fund said that the British situation was not nearly as dire as that in the United States, where a wave of housing foreclosures has delivered a broad shock to lenders.British home prices are falling, but the extent of the damage is far less than in the United States.“You’re in a different world” in Britain, said Michael Deppler, head of the I.M.F.’s European division.Mr. Deppler made the comment as part of an assessment that painted a pessimistic outlook for economic growth in all of Europe. The mixture of higher oil and food prices, the strong euro, recessionary conditions in the United States and financial market turmoil will bring growth in Western Europe down to 1.4 percent this year from 2.8 percent in 2007, he predicted.The I.M.F. also quantified the losses from financial market chaos — a mix of tighter borrowing costs and falling stock and housing prices — at about 0.75 percent of Europe’s total output.All in all, Europe will enjoy “resiliency but not immunity” from what is going on, Mr. Deppler said.Still, the British economy remains one of the hardest-hit in Europe, and Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s government, facing difficult local elections in May, has been under pressure to shore up the financial system and restart the mortgage lending market. Mr. Brown met Friday in Washington with several financial officials, including Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve.Despite three interest rate cuts that have taken the Bank of England’s benchmark rate to 5 percent, the three-month London interbank sterling rate, a reference rate for loans between banks, was at nearly 5.9 percent Monday, down slightly from Friday, but still a level that indicates banks remain nervous about their peers.Most analysts still expect that weakening growth will lead the Bank of England to cut interest rates further, but even if financial market turbulence tapers off.'"
"'08-04-21,'0','Senator John McCain signaled his new fund-raising strength Sunday when he reported that his presidential campaign ended March with $11.6 million in its bank account after having raised more than $15 million that month.Even though Mr. McCain remains far behind Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton in overall fund-raising and spending, his financial picture is changing from that of a scrappy and poorly financed underdog to a standard bearer whose political success is translating into financial success.In filings with the Federal Election Commission, the McCain campaign reported that it had begun March with $8 million in cash, raised $15.4 million during that month and spent $11.8 million.Still, a large financial gap persists between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama, who has outraised and outspent all other candidates. Mr. Obama reported late Sunday in his federal filings that he had $51 million in cash on hand at the end of March. It is not known exactly how much Mr. Obama now has after spending millions on television advertisements and other campaign costs in the Pennsylvania primary, which will be held Tuesday. At the beginning of March, Mr. Obama had $31 million in cash on hand.As for Mr. McCain, there were two signs in his filings of his improved finances. One was that the $4 million bank loan that he took out late last year to keep his campaign afloat is now paid off, as a result of a final $3 million payment in March from the campaign to Fidelity & Trust Bank. The other was that his spending on big-ticket items like advertising and travel is now tapering off because his primary fight is behind him and he can begin to prepare for the general election.'"
"'08-04-21,'0','A few days and $3 million later, the company owned 75 percent of Big Brown. Now, I.E.A.H. is not only intent on capturing the Kentucky Derby, America’s greatest horse race, but it also wants to remake the economic landscape of a multibillion-dollar industry.“It would show how you can move the blue blood from Kentucky to New York,” Iavarone said, referring to both a Big Brown victory and his horse hedge fund.Neither the racetrack nor Wall Street traffics in sure things, however, and as talented as Big Brown, the undefeated son of Boundary, is, he must defy some compelling historical data.A chestnut colt, Big Brown has raced only three times. The last Derby winner so untested was the filly Regret in 1915. Last year, for example, Curlin, the eventual Horse of the Year, arrived at Churchill Downs similarly undefeated after three starts, but he finished third as the second betting choice. Big Brown ran in only two prep races this year, a lack of seasoning that only two Derby champions in the last 60 years have been able to overcome: Sunny’s Halo in 1983 and Street Sense last year.Then there are Big Brown’s troubled front hooves, which have been responsible for his limited number of starts and his long absences from the racetrack. Shortly after I.E.A.H. purchased him, Big Brown got an abscess in the sole of his left front hoof, which caused a wall separation and kept him idle for 45 days. He had the same injury in his right front hoof in mid-December and did not train in January.“The injury is caused by concussion — his feet hitting a hard surface — and they take time to heal,” said Ian McKinlay, a New York-based hoof specialist who continues to treat Big Brown.When Big Brown finally returned to racing, at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale Beach, Fla., in a mile race on March 5, McKinlay fitted him with special glue-on shoes. The shoes had a thick polyurethane bottom to ensure that nothing hard touched the colt’s sole. Big Brown won effortlessly, by 12 3/4 lengths. Twenty-four days later, in the Florida Derby, Big Brown led every step of the way as his jockey, Kent Desormeaux, sat atop him like a leisure rider during a five-length victory.“His feet are ice-cold now, and we’re not going to have any more problems,” Dutrow said. “I look at everything Big Brown has done and then at every other 3-year-old out there, and there is no comparison. Beat him? I’m not sure any of them can run close to him.”There is little doubt that Big Brown will be the most accomplished horse in the field of 20 that is expected to line up at the gate in Louisville beneath Churchill Downs’s famed twin spires. But is he or any other racehorse a valuable enough commodity to build a lucrative hedge fund around?In 2007, more than $15.4 billion was bet on horses in North America, more than $1.1 billion in purses was distributed and more than $1.2 billion was spent purchasing thoroughbreds, according to the Jockey Club. Iavarone and his co-president, Richard J. Schiavo — both of whom left Wall Street and investment banking — say they have a way of offering more people more opportunity to make money at the racetrack.Since its inception in 2003, I.E.A.H. has raised more than $40 million from more than 80 investors and has formed partnerships to own various horses. The hedge fund model will supplant this arrangement; partners will own a part of all I.E.A.H. assets, from its 80 horses in training to its 15 broodmares and its future stallions, including the 2007 Breeders’ Cup Mile champion, Kip Deville; Benny the Bull, winner of the $2 million Dubai Golden Shaheen; and Big Brown.Each financial quarter, an independent auditor will assess the fund’s value, and investors will be able to decide to buy into the fund or sell their positions. “What we’re offering are liquidity and options that people in the horse business have never had before,” Iavarone said.There is no doubt Big Brown is the component with the greatest upside within the company’s portfolio. If he wins the Derby, he will immediately be worth $30 million as a stallion. As a rookie sire, he is certain to command at least the $100,000 per coupling that the 2004 Derby winner, Smarty Jones, commands, and attract 150 or more mares. If Big Brown becomes the first horse since Affirmed in 1978 to win a Triple Crown, there is no telling how valuable he will become.So just like Dutrow, I.E.A.H. is all in on Big Brown.The colt’s minority owner, Paul Pompa Jr., has already experienced a windfall. In April 2007, he bought Big Brown at a 2-year-old-in-training sale for $190,000, and named him because his family-owned trucking company in Brooklyn had just renewed a contract with a longtime client, U.P.S. When Big Brown’s scintillating debut at Saratoga brought deep-pocketed suitors, Pompa adhered to the golden rule of horse racing: take the money.“I chose I.E.A.H. because they were young, classy, impressive guys,” said Pompa, who has owned horses for 15 years. “And they were going to let me keep a piece of the horse.”He said he wished them well in their mission to change the face of horse partnerships, but that he was not interested in joining them. He said some things remain priceless.“I want to win the greatest race in the world,” he said. “I want to make history.”'"
"'08-04-21,'0','Mr. McCain has steadfastly insisted that he does not give preferential treatment to those lobbying him, even if they happen to be close friends. Although Senator Barack Obama, who could become Mr. McCain’s general election opponent, has made a point of refusing to accept money from federally registered lobbyists, Mr. McCain has continued to collect cash from them and allow them to bundle campaign contributions. His supporters argue in his defense that Mr. McCain has a record of independence and has, in fact, often clashed with corporate interests over the years.But the potential for conflicts of interest are obvious. Several of Mr. McCain’s top fund-raisers, for example, lobby for the telecommunications industry, which regularly does business before the Senate Commerce Committee, where Mr. McCain is a senior member and once served as chairman.Kirk Blalock, of the lobbying firm Fierce, Isakowitz & Blalock, leads Mr. McCain’s young professional group and has raised over $250,000 for him; his clients include Sprint Nextel and Viacom.Kyle McSlarrow, chief of the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the lobbying arm for the cable industry, has raised over $100,000 for Mr. McCain. He and others in the cable industry recently butted heads with Mr. McCain over a proposal that would allow customers to pick and choose which channels they received.In an interview Sunday, Wayne Berman, who is deputy finance chairman of the McCain campaign and a veteran lobbyist whose clients include Verizon and Verizon Wireless, dismissed the notion that some lobbyists might be raising money for Mr. McCain to curry influence.“When it comes to McCain,” Mr. Berman said, “there’s just absolutely no concern whatsoever that he is going to be influenced by lobbyists. He takes on issues as he sees them. It doesn’t matter whether his best friends are on the other side or not.”But the McCain campaign, which struggled over much of the past year in raising money, is now seeking to emulate the record-setting money machine that powered George W. Bush to victories in 2000 and 2004, bestowing special titles upon bundlers who exceed certain financial targets.Instead of “Pioneers” and “Rangers,” as President Bush’s top fund-raisers were called, Mr. McCain is dubbing the 73 people so far who have brought in $100,000 or more “Trailblazers,” while the 33 who brought in $250,000 or more are being called “Innovators.”Campaign finance watchdogs criticized the Pioneer and Ranger system for establishing an elite class of donors, many of whom went on to ambassadorships and other political appointments. But Mr. McCain’s advisers believe the system offers the best chance for the campaign to encourage as many people as possible to raise large amounts of cash for him.Mr. McCain has badly trailed both Mr. Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in fund-raising — in March, for example, he brought in $15 million, compared with Mr. Obama’s $40 million and Mrs. Clinton’s $20 million. While Mr. McCain’s Democratic counterparts, especially Mr. Obama, have enjoyed much success in harvesting small-dollar donations over the Internet, Mr. McCain has not built an effective Internet fund-raising machine, forcing him to depend on a circle of wealthy donors.But in a sign that Mr. McCain is still working on building up his bundler network, fewer than 20 people on the list were former participants in the powerful Bush Pioneer and Ranger system.Most of the people on the list released Friday have been with the campaign for months. Although the campaign has been working to sign up fund-raisers for former candidates like Rudolph W. Giuliani and Mitt Romney, few of them have had the opportunity to raise enough money yet to make the list.But there are at least some new supporters of the campaign. B. C. Clippard, who was national finance chairman of Fred D. Thompson’s presidential campaign, has now raised $100,000 or more for Mr. McCain. Former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato of New York also supported Mr. Thompson but recently helped organize a fund-raiser in New York that netted over $1 million for Mr. McCain. Peter Newman, a former fund-raiser for Mr. Giuliani from Pebble Beach, Calif., has since become a Trailblazer for Mr. McCain.The list also includes something of a who’s who of his national finance team, including Tom Loeffler, a former congressman, and Lewis Eisenberg, a former Goldman Sachs partner and longtime player in Republican fund-raising. Some recent notable additions to Mr. McCain’s finance team are not on the list yet, like Mercer Reynolds, an Ohio businessman who led Mr. Bush’s fund-raising in 2004 and had been seen as an important conduit to others from the Bush Pioneer network for Mr. McCain.It appears that at least some on the list had been hedging their bets earlier in the primary season. About a fifth of the fund-raisers on the list appear to have given to other candidates as well as Mr. McCain, splitting their contributions fairly evenly between other Republican candidates and Democrats.'"

"'08-04-21,'0','The main parties that formed the governing coalition after parliamentary elections in February — the Pakistan Peoples Party of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Mr. Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-N — pledged to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office. Mr. Sharif, who was overthrown in a coup by Mr. Musharraf in 1999, has insisted that the government keep its promise, and he seems to have prevailed over the more pragmatic Asif Ali Zardari, Ms. Bhutto’s widower, who is leading her party.Farooq H. Naik, the law minister, is reviewing a draft of the resolution that will be presented in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, said Babar Awan, a senator and one of Mr. Zardari’s legal advisers.“I cannot announce the exact date of the resolution, but I hope it will be very soon,” Mr. Awan said. Pakistani newspapers reported that it could be as soon as Tuesday or Wednesday.Mr. Asif, the petroleum minister who has represented Mr. Sharif’s party in talks with the Pakistan Peoples Party, confirmed that the constitutional proposals would be made in the next week, if not simultaneously with the resolution on the judges.On Sunday, the state-run news agency quoted Mr. Naik as denying media reports that there was a plan to shorten Mr. Chaudhry’s term, set to end in 2013. Mr. Chaudhry’s maverick nature and immense popularity are seen as a political threat by some leading politicians. Publicly, leaders of the Pakistan Peoples Party have denied plans to change his term.Leaders of the popular lawyers’ movement have condemned any such step and warned of another crisis in the country if Mr. Chaudhry were restored with limited powers.Syed Naveed Qamar, minister for privatization, industries and production and a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party, said his party did not intend to limit the tenure of the chief justice. “It is political kite-flying,” Mr. Qamar said. “The tenure of the chief justice is fixed in the Constitution, and we lack a two-thirds majority in the Parliament to amend the Constitution.”Mr. Sharif, whose consistent hard line against Mr. Musharraf has been regarded warily by American officials, has pressed the Pakistan Peoples Party to restore the judiciary, a step he sees as vital for the eventual removal of Mr. Musharraf.But last week, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, a member of the Pakistan Peoples Party, said that while the nation would soon hear “good news” about the restoration of the dismissed judiciary, the government would not rush to impeach Mr. Musharraf, as it did not have the necessary votes in the Senate, Parliament’s upper house.Political and legal analysts said that the reinstatement of the judges would be a euphoric moment for the public, but that it might not immediately affect Mr. Musharraf.“I don’t see him leaving till he is made to leave,” said Babar Sattar, a lawyer and op-ed columnist based in Islamabad, the capital. “I don’t think that the Peoples Party has a policy of confrontation. It does not want to rock the boat.”Mr. Sattar said he did not believe that the judges would reopen cases regarding Mr. Musharraf’s eligibility to run for president last year. “I think they are going to be counseled to lie low and focus on issues of judiciary itself,” he said.He added that any action to remove the president should come from Parliament in the form of an impeachment, and that the High Court should not be dragged into politics.'"

"'08-04-21,'0','“No one wants to change a system that is completely, according to our analysis, catastrophic,” said Philippe Manière, a former journalist and director of the Institut Montaigne, a research organization that developed proposals to save the press, among them making state subsidies conditional on a three-year period of change involving the modernizing of printing and distribution.Over the years, the French newspaper culture has been relatively weak compared with that in some other countries — 181 of 1,000 people subscribe to newspapers in France compared with 371 in Germany and 274 in the United States, according to figures from the World Association of Newspapers, based in Paris.In that tepid market, Le Monde has reeled from crisis to crisis. It has not made a profit in more than seven years. Daily circulation of 354,000 has fallen almost 9 percent since 2003.The company lost 15.4 million euros in 2007 ($24.3 million) and has run up deficits of more than 180 million euros over the last seven years, Le Monde’s chairman, Éric Fottorino, said in a column published Saturday, warning that “never have Le Monde’s finances been more dire.”Two years ago, Lagardère, the French media and aerospace conglomerate, and Prisa, a Spanish media group that owns the newspaper El País, offered some relief, buying stakes in Le Monde worth a total of 50 million euros.Both companies have signaled that they are prepared to invest more in exchange for increased influence. But for now, their money is unwelcome at Le Monde, a paper with a distinct culture in which the journalists wield considerable power.Created in 1944 on the orders of Gen. Charles de Gaulle to be the “conscience of France,” Le Monde has a complex shareholder structure in which its journalists hold a 60.4 percent stake in the company while Prisa and Lagardère each have stakes of less than 18 percent.Patrick Eveno, a historian at the Sorbonne who has written extensively about newspapers, said Le Monde had embarked on a “reverse strategy” with plans to shed publications it had acquired; it recently sold its regional newspaper group. Mr. Eveno said he considered the job cuts necessary for the paper’s survival, given the high costs of publishing a French newspaper and the falling ad revenue.Mr. Fottorino, himself a longtime Le Monde journalist, is trying to manage the competing forces as chairman of the group.His strategy aims at returning the paper to profitability in the next two years by cutting the staff and trimming paper’s size by decreasing culture and sports coverage while emphasizing what readers consider its essence: politics, international news and debate and opinion.But after Mr. Fottorino’s plans emerged, the staff revolted. Last week, for the first time in decades, Le Monde twice failed to appear on newsstands as employees walked out in two 24-hour strikes.“The necessity for cost-cutting is incontestable,” said Michel Delburghe, a union representative and experienced Le Monde journalist. “What we deeply oppose is the solution of layoffs. Is it really the solution to put our house in order and balance Le Monde by laying off 129 people?”The unions for Le Monde employees offer alternative proposals like consolidating the staff of the newspaper and its Web site employees in one building and reducing the number of managers, something that has already started to happen in the last few days.The unions also lament the reduction of culture and sports coverage and further integration of the print journalists with the Web site, Lemonde.fr. It is the top news site in France with more than 4.5 million unique visitors in March, according to the research company Médiamétrie.Raphaëlle Bacqué, an investigative journalist at Le Monde, said she was not necessarily opposed to careful surgery. “I’m in the minority view,” Ms. Bacqué said. “But I think it’s necessary for the paper to choose who will leave since it’s the better people who often volunteer to go.”'"
"'08-04-21,'0','But which stocks? Steady, if stodgy, companies that sell staple commodities, charge low prices or pay dividends are usually a better bet in a recession than hot-shot growth stocks. Scott Tiras, a senior financial adviser in Houston for the financial planning firm Ameriprise Financial, recommends sugar, coffee, cacao, and oil and gas in the early part of a recession; later, as the economy improves, he said, gold and other metals pick up.TRY TO BE RATIONALThe true bottom line is that you want to sleep at night. If that means moving out of stocks into less volatile but lower-yielding investments like bonds, money market funds, Treasury bills, bank certificates of deposit and guaranteed investment contracts — even as much as 70 percent of your assets — many experts won’t argue with a seriously scared customer.One variation is to use part of your assets to buy laddered bonds, a series of bonds that mature in each of the next few years. The knowledge that they will have a secure income flow for those years, said Michael Goodman, a financial planner and president of Wealthstream Advisors in New York, “gives people the confidence to let their money that’s invested elsewhere continue to ride, so they don’t destroy the integrity of that long-term investment plan.”What if United States bonds and Treasury bills are also falling? In the last six months, “international bonds have been a better hedge” against stocks, said Gino Reina, director of investment research for the New York benefits-consulting firm Segal Company. He says that — at least right now — individuals may want to copy the strategy of big pension funds, which often put 5 to 10 percent of their assets in this category. The major disadvantage is the risk that the dollar will have dropped when you want to cash out.MAKE USE OF YOUR MORTGAGEAs home values are sinking, Alan Glickstein, a senior retirement consultant in the Dallas office of the benefits consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide, suggests a reverse mortgage. In this arrangement, which is available only to people 62 and older, you essentially turn your equity into an annuity. A lender guarantees you regular income payments for a fixed term — which could be the rest of your life — while you continue to live in your home, rent-free. After you die, the lender sells your house to recoup the principal and interest.“If you’ve been in the house for 20 or 30 years, all you’ve seen is your rate of appreciation slowing,” Mr. Glickstein explained. “You’re still sitting on what may be the biggest piece of your retirement wealth.” The reverse mortgage can give you better returns than a C.D., a money market fund or selling the house outright, he said.It’s not much consolation, but if stock losses or pay cuts have bumped you down to a lower income tax bracket, that might be another reason to cash in some stocks, move the money to bonds and take the capital gains bite today.In particular, Mr. Goodman of Wealthstream recommends converting a traditional individual retirement account to a Roth I.R.A. That’s because you pay taxes on the traditional account when you leave and on the Roth when you start, with the net result that you will pay all the taxes on both the accounts now. When you finally cash out the Roth — and, you hope, have moved back up to a higher tax bracket — you will owe zero taxes.GRAB THE CASH AND RETIRE NOWIn tough times, many people feel they have to keep working forever. But because of the strange way accounting rules work, you might be better off retiring early, if your company lets you take your pension as a lump sum, said Randy Cusick, a senior consultant in the Philadelphia office of the benefits consulting firm Towers Perrin. Here’s why:Your company must calculate how much cash you would need today to equal the full value of your pension. In that calculation, it may include future interest earnings, but it must also assume that you will earn interest over your lifetime at the interest rate available today. If interest rates are low, as they are now, you will need a larger lump sum to reach the full value of your pension.If things get really tight, you can always pull money out of your 401(k) via a loan or a hardship withdrawal. Of course, you have to repay the loan with interest, and there are tax penalties on the hardship withdrawal.In that case, why bother putting the money into the 401(k) to begin with? Why not just leave the cash in a bank account?As long as you can squirrel away something in your 401(k), many employers will match part of what you contribute. Experts say it’s foolish to walk away from that “free money.” That is advice that doesn’t change in a recession.'"

"'08-04-22,'0','UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation’s largest health insurers, disappointed investors on Tuesday by announcing lower-than-expected first-quarter earnings and by sharply reducing its profit outlook for 2008. The company, whose stock plunged on the report, put much of the blame on the weakening economy, saying fewer businesses and employees were signing up for its health insurance.“We are clearly being impacted by the declining economic outlook,” the chief executive, Stephen J. Hemlsey, told investors Tuesday morning. While he acknowledged the company’s role in not being able to deliver better results, Mr. Helmsley also said that fewer employers, particularly small businesses, were offering health coverage to their workers, and fewer people were choosing to enroll.UnitedHealth’s was down more than 10 percent shortly before the close of regular trading on Tuesday, to $33.88, near its 52-week low.UnitedHealth said it earned $994 million, or 78 cents a share, on revenues of $20 billion for the first quarter. That was an increase of 5 percent over earnings per share for the same period of 2007. But the company cut its profit outlook for 2008 by 40 cents to between $3.55 and $3.60 a share, pointing to the bad flu season and the struggle in its core commercial insurance business where it estimates it may lose about 700,000 customers this year.With other insurers poised to report their earnings later this week, UnitedHealth’s results are contributing to the growing anxiety among investors about the serious challenges facing health insurers in maintaining the hefty profits of recent years. The heightened competition for customers, amid an economic downturn that is leaving more people unable to afford health insurance, has dampened the outlook for these companies.'"

"'08-04-22,'0','He has been bolstered by his conservative positions, his network of contacts and the more tenuous connection to the district of his Republican opponent, Greg Davis. Mr. Davis is mayor of a Memphis suburb, Southaven, which many here consider barely part of Mississippi.In an appearance in the university town of Oxford, Mr. Childers quoted Franklin D. Roosevelt and, as he often does, told the students that he was forced to support his family, as a teenager, after his father died.“True conservatism was going to work full time when you’re 16,” Mr. Childers said, echoing that theme as he campaigned outside a retirement home in the old brick downtown here.Inside a restaurant, he greeted county courthouse workers with familiarity. They were part of a network he has built up over 16 years as chancery clerk, or county financial manager, in a county to the north of here.For all his connections, a Childers victory would still be an upset — Mr. Davis has outspent him two-to-one to fill what is left of the term, which runs to the end of the year. But it would also be a warning to Republicans about general prospects in the fall.“If Travis Childers wins Tuesday, that will be a siren in the night for Republicans,” said W. Martin Wiseman, a political scientist at Mississippi State University. “If he wins, it’s just absolutely huge.”Even Republicans acknowledge that the race appears to be close. The party has turned to advertisements questioning, among other things, care at a nursing home owned by Mr. Childers, a campaign style that has disconcerted some Republicans more used to the genteel politicking of candidates who have long known one another in a largely rural, close-knit district.“It could go either way,” said Alan Nunnelee, a Republican state senator in Tupelo. “People are frustrated with the aggressive campaign tactics that have been used, particularly on the Republican side. The Republican camp has been much more aggressive than people in northeast Mississippi are used to.” Mr. Nunnelee said he was nonetheless sticking with his party.Not so one of the state’s Republican eminences, Jack Reed Sr., who once ran a credible race for governor and led the Mississippi Economic Council. A businessman in Tupelo, he is supporting Mr. Childers, citing “the personal appeal of the candidate” and “dissatisfaction with the Bush administration.”The Republican Party is hewing to a campaign tactic that has proved successful in defeating other Democrats in the South: tying them to national Democratic figures who are held in deep suspicion here, especially the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.“I think northeast Mississippians understand the implications of voting for Nancy Pelosi for speaker of the House,” said Jim Herring, chairman of the Mississippi Republican Party. “You look at the presidential race — the best they’ve got to offer are extremely left-wing candidates.”Mr. Davis, a former state representative whose town is in the state’s fastest-growing county, echoed those thoughts in an interview, saying he was the “real conservative” in the race. “I won’t be voting for Nancy Pelosi for speaker,” Mr. Davis said, “and I won’t be standing beside Clinton and Obama in the fall.”He has staked out a difference with Mr. Childers on the Iraq war, saying of a timetable for withdrawal, “We need to leave that decision to the experts.”Mr. Childers, who has been quoted as calling for a withdrawal of troops, scoffed. “His message is, stay the course,” he said. “But that cookie cutter message is not working. How long can you put a round peg into a square hole? Those people have been fighting for centuries.”Interviews here offer evidence that Mr. Childers’s approach may be catching on with voters who described themselves as Republicans and independents.“Something just stands out about him,” said Marty Sullivan, manager of a real estate management firm. “It’s his openness. He doesn’t dodge any questions.”Still, most reckon the election is for the Republicans, and Mr. Davis, to lose. “If they lose in this, they better reconnoiter and figure out where they need help,” Professor Wiseman said.'"
"'08-04-22,'0','Many of the top 10 managers on Alpha magazine's mind-blowing 2007 rich list, which was released last week, have put money on Mr. Obama, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. They have each given the maximum donation allowed, $2,300. (Let’s face it, this is pocket lint to these guys.)John Griffin, the founder of Blue Ridge Capital, who made $625 million in 2007, according to Alpha. Mr. Griffin is backing Mr. Obama after initially supporting Mitt Romney.Kenneth C. Griffin (no relation) of the Citadel Investment Group in Chicago, who earned $1.5 billion. He contributed to the Obama campaign after the senator came to his office last year.Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital, who took home $710 million last year.And, of course, George Soros, who earned almost $3 billion last year. It is no surprise that Mr. Soros, a Democratic stalwart, is backing Mr. Obama. Mr. Soros campaigned against President Bush in 2004, and Moveon.org, which the billionaire investor has plied with tens of millions of dollars, endorsed Mr. Obama in February.Of course, not every Richie Rich is backing Mr. Obama.James H. Simons, the mathematician who runs Renaissance Technologies, who made $2.8 billion last year, has donated to Mrs. Clinton.And Steven Cohen of SAC Capital, whose take home pay was $900 million, is splitting his money down the middle: He donated $28,500 to both the Democratic and Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. (He had given money to John E. Sununu and Christopher J. Dodd.)John Paulson of Paulson & Company, the top earner, with $3.7 billion last year, doesn’t appear to have a financial dog left in the hunt: He gave to Mitt Romney and Rudolph Giuliani.Philip Falcone, who founded Harbinger Partners and made $1.7 billion last year, has given to the Republican National Committee, but to no individual candidate. (His firm may have bought itself influence in another way: It recently won agreement from The New York Times Company to add two members to its board.)Timothy Barakett of Atticus Capital, who made $750 million, and O. Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors, who earned $520 million, don’t appear to have given money to either side.By the way, just so we don’t forget: these guys are not like you and me. The median American family earned $60,500 last year.So why is Mr. Obama such a popular choice among the hedge fund crowd?In a word, access. Unlike Mr. McCain and Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Obama is relatively new to national politics and is therefore open to bringing new people — and new money — into the tent. For money types who want a table, or at least to look involved and get an invitation to the right parties, Mr. Obama is the candidate.As one of the hedge fund managers on the Alpha list said, “To be in Hillary’s inner circle, you had to be giving a decade ago, when Bill was president.” The same goes for Mr. McCain.The Clintons’ Wall Street sanctum is filled with old pals from the worlds of banking and private equity. These people have been with the Clintons since the beginning. They include Roger Altman, chairman of Evercore Partners and former deputy treasury secretary under President Clinton; and Steven Rattner, co-founder of Quadrangle Partners (Mr. Rattner’s wife, Maureen White, is a co-chairwoman of finance for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign). And it’s not as if Mrs. Clinton has no hedge fund support. Avenue Capital’s co-founder, Marc Lasry, has been a longtime Clinton supporter — so much so that he hired her daughter, Chelsea.And then there is what some Wall Streeters describe as the “iconoclast thing.” Hedge fund managers like to think of themselves as outsiders with fresh perspectives. The Obama campaign is trying to project a similar image. Mr. Obama might be struggling with the blue-collar vote in Pennsylvania, but he has nailed the hedge fund vote.Then again, politics, like the markets, can change fast. As one hedge fund manager who is backing Mr. Obama said, “It is very possible I may change my mind.” They don’t call them hedges for nothing.'"

"'08-04-22,'0','PARIS — The Bank of England said on Monday that it would allow banks to swap mortgage-backed securities valued at approximately $100 billion for government bonds in an effort to restore calm to the British financial markets.Under the plan, banks will deposit the securities, which have become difficult to sell since the credit markets began to tighten in August, in the central bank as collateral, but at a discount. In return, they will receive easily tradable government bonds, which the Bank of England hopes will be used to expand lending, in particular among banks themselves.The banks themselves will have to bear the loss if the securities on deposit decline in value, the central bank said. But its governor, Mervyn King, also said there was no “arbitrary limit” on how much could be lent under the plan, though discussions with banks suggested they would need about £50 billion ($99 billion). “It may well go higher,” he said.Alistair Darling, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said earlier that such a plan was necessary because the freezing up of credit markets represented “an unprecedented shock to the system.”“We haven’t seen this in generations,” he said on BBC television. “It’s happening in America, Europe, the Far East. It is affecting countries all over the world. We’re determined to do everything we can to get normality here.”'"
"'08-04-22,'0','Mr. McCain’s advisers devised the weeklong trip as an effort to show that a Republican can appeal to some traditional Democratic voters, or at least to get Mr. McCain credit for trying. The trip is also an attempt to attract a fraction of attention to Mr. McCain’s campaign during a week when the political center of the world is Pennsylvania’s Democratic primary showdown between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.Democrats dismissed Mr. McCain’s trip as a deluded belief that a Republican could appeal to poor people hard hit by seven years of Republican policies. “It’s like an arsonist turning up at the scene of the fire,” said Paula Begala, a former Clinton White House adviser and a Democrat commentator.But some Republicans said that Mr. McCain, who has often bucked his own party and is seeking to attract independents and some moderate Democrats in the fall, had a rationale for the trip. “I don’t know if I would have picked the same locations, but it is not crazy for McCain to think that he can get Democratic votes that were unavailable to Bush in 2000 and 2004,” said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster and strategist.At the very least, the trip is providing footage for Mr. McCain’s future campaign commercials, as occurred later in the day when the candidate was serenaded with old Negro spirituals by the quilters of Gee’s Bend, Ala., during a slow-moving ferry ride across a part of the Alabama River.While a campaign camera crew recorded the scene from an accompanying pontoon boat, Mr. McCain stood on the ferry surrounded by a dozen African-American quilters who sang “Old Ship of Zion” to the vaguely embarrassed candidate. Mr. McCain had just come from a visit to their quilting center.At least one of the quilters, Mary Lee Bendolph, said she was learning toward supporting Mr. Obama, but she praised Mr. McCain for turning up in Wilcox County, which locals say has never before been visited by a presidential candidate.“He came here and he did something, and you know what, nobody else did,” Mrs. Bendolph said.The vibrant Gee’s Bends quilts became famous after they were exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2002 and 2003. Mr. McCain bought three of them on Monday, all large in size. His campaign would not say what he paid, but quilts of similar size in the Gee’s Bend center were priced at $2,500 each.Monday’s trip was the first time that Secret Service agents joined Mr. McCain’s campaign. It was unclear how many agents were assigned to Mr. McCain but it appeared to be a handful. “We do have an agent presence there now,” said Malcolm Wiley, a Secret Service spokesman, who declined to provide more details. The number of agents is expected to increase as the election draws closer.Last year, Mr. McCain said he would reject Secret Service protection as an inconvenience and a waste of taxpayers’ money if he won the Republican nomination, but earlier this month he changed his mind and said he had to “recognize the inevitable.”'"
"'08-04-22,'0','Those wild swings in expected prices are damaging the mechanisms — like futures contracts and options — that in the past have cushioned the jolts of farming, turning already-busy farmers into reluctant day traders and part-time lobbyists.One measure of the farming industry’s frustration is the overflow crowd expected at a public forum on Tuesday at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in Washington. Interest is so high that the commission, for the first time ever, will provide a Webcast of the forum, which it says is being held to gather information about whether crucial markets for hedging the price of crops “are properly performing their risk management and price discovery roles.” The Webcast link is available on the commission’s Web site, www.cftc.gov.The additional costs that stem from volatility in grain prices — higher crop insurance premiums, for example — are not just a problem for farmers. “Eventually, those costs are going to come out of the pockets of the American consumer,” said William P. Jackson, general manager of AGRIServices, a grain-elevator complex on the Missouri River.Prices of broad commodity indexes have climbed as much as 40 percent in the last year and grain prices have gained even more — about 65 percent for corn, 91 percent for soybeans and more than 100 percent for some types of wheat. This price boom has attracted a torrent of new investment from Wall Street, estimated to be as much as $300 billion.Whether new investors are causing the market’s problems or keeping them from getting worse is in dispute. But there is no question that the grain markets are now experiencing levels of volatility that are running well above the average levels over the last quarter-century.Mr. Grieder’s crop insurance premiums rise with the volatility. So does the cost of trading in options, which is the financial tool he has used to hedge against falling prices. Some grain elevators are coping with the volatility and hedging problems by refusing to buy crops in advance, foreclosing the most common way farmers lock in prices.“The system is really beginning to break down,” Mr. Grieder said. “When you see elevators start pulling their bids for your crop, that tells me we’ve got a real problem.”Until recently, that system had worked well for generations. Since 1877, grain producers have been able to hedge the price of their wheat and corn crops on the Chicago Board of Trade through the use of futures contracts, which are agreements to buy or sell a specific amount of a commodity for a fixed price on some future date. Soybean futures contracts were introduced in 1936.More recently, the exchange has offered another tool: options on those futures contracts, which allow option holders to carry out the futures trade, but do not require that they do so. Trading in options is not as effective a hedge, farmers say, but it does not require them to put up as much cash as is required to trade futures.These tools have long provided a way to lock in the price of a crop as it is planted, eliminating the risk that prices will drop before it is harvested. With these hedging tools, grain elevators could afford to buy crops from farmers in advance, sometimes a year or more before the harvest.But that was yesterday. It simply is not working that way today.Futures, for example, are less reliable. They work as a hedge only if they fall due at a price that roughly matches prices in the cash market, where the grain is actually sold. Increasingly — for disputed reasons — grain futures are expiring at prices well above the cash-market price.When that happens, farmers or elevator owners wind up owing more on their futures hedge than the crops are worth in the cash market. Such anomalies create uncertainty about which price accurately reflects supply and demand — a critical issue, since the C.B.O.T. futures price is the benchmark for grain prices around the world.“I can’t honestly sit here and tell you who is determining the price of grain,” said Christopher Hausman, a farmer in Pesotum, Ill. “I’ve lost confidence in the Chicago Board of Trade.”David D. Lehman, director of commodity research and product development for the C.B.O.T.’s owner, the CME Group, said: “We know that the current global environment is creating challenges for many of the traditional users of our markets, and we are very concerned. But there are a lot of things that are changing and there is no silver bullet, in terms of a solution.”Many farmers and people in related businesses blame the tidal wave of investment pouring in from hedge funds, pension funds and index funds for the faulty futures contracts and rising volatility. But those institutional investors’ money actually adds liquidity to the market, which in theory should reduce price volatility, Mr. Lehman noted.In any case, at current levels of volatility, options trading becomes riskier, and therefore more expensive — too expensive for many farmers like Mr. Grieder, who now has to hedge with the recently less reliable futures contracts.That exposes him to the risk of having to put up more cash — to maintain his price protection — whenever a weather threat, shipping disruption or a fresh surge of money from Wall Street suddenly pushes up grain prices.“If you’ve got 50,000 bushels hedged and the market moves up 20 cents, that would be a $10,000 day,” he said. “If you only had $10,000 in your margin account, you’d have to sit down and write a check. You can see $10,000 disappear overnight.”On an unusual day, he said, he might get four phone calls a day from his broker seeking additional margin. “But usually, the margin calls come in the mail, in a little blue envelope,” he said. “You don’t have to open it to know what it is.”When it arrives, he sometimes has to rely on his bank to advance him the margin he needs to keep those hedges in place — a worrisome requirement even for a successful farmer in an economy already struggling with a credit squeeze.“The nightmare scenario is when you have to make margin and you’re looking out your back door and seeing, maybe, a crop problem,” he said. “Everybody has a story about a guy they know getting blown out of his hedge” by unmet margin calls.Farmers used to leave the market-watching to traders who work for big grain elevator companies. But with some of those companies now refusing to buy crops in advance because hedging has become so expensive and uncertain, farmers have to follow and trade in those markets themselves.“This is something the farmer didn’t have to worry about before,” said Curt Kimmel, a commodity broker at Bates Commodities, the advisory service Mr. Grieder uses. “It’s a cruel and unforgiving market.”John Fletcher, a grain elevator operator in Marshall, Mo., started pressing the C.B.O.T. to address the flaws of futures contracts almost two years ago — even before his futures hedge on a million bushels of soybeans failed to fully protect him last September, hitting him with a cash loss of $940,000.Mr. Fletcher does not blame the big institutional investors stampeding into the market. “But they have contributed to the problem by making these markets so much larger — so large that they have outgrown their delivery system,” he said. “And that has detached the futures market from the cash market.”Frustrated over the flawed futures contract, Mr. Fletcher is voting with his feet. Last year, he entered into a contract with A.I.G. Financial Products, a leading sponsor of commodity index funds, which allows him and the index fund to hedge their risks without using the C.B.O.T.Instead of using futures or options, A.I.G. simply buys the commodity directly from Mr. Fletcher, who stores it for a fee and buys it back six months later. His storage fee is lower than the one built into the C.B.O.T. contract, so A.I.G. pays less for its stake in the market. And he has a hedge he can rely on.“I did a deal with them for corn a year ago, and this year I’m doing a deal on soybeans,” he said.But private deals like these do not provide pricing data to other farmers and to the rest of the food industry, which has long relied on the Chicago Board of Trade as the best measure of supply and demand. If such bilateral contracts become more common, it will be harder for everyone in the industry to anticipate costs and potential profits — which could also push prices up.This growing uncertainty about prices and hedging “just makes the market less efficient,” said Jeffrey Hainline, president of Advance Trading, an agricultural advisory and brokerage service in Bloomington, Ill. “And anything that makes these markets less efficient increases the cost of food.”Robert E. Young II, chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation, has held meetings on this topic around the Farm Belt over the last month and has gotten an earful from distressed food producers and elevator owners, he said.“I tell people, ‘You are not going to market the 2009 crop the way you marketed the 2007 crop. You may never market grain that way again.’ ”'"
"'08-04-22,'0','With its breathtaking, panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline, the Cantor Roof Garden at the Metropolitan Museum of Art may strike you as an excellent place to mount a seasonal outdoor sculpture show, which it does every year. In truth, it is an inhospitable site for sculpture, as demonstrated by the 2008 display that opens on Tuesday: three wonderful, previously unexhibited works by the celebrated Pop artist Jeff Koons. Each of these sculptures is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a chocolate valentine heart wrapped in red foil, standing en pointe; and a silhouette of Piglet from a “Winnie the Pooh” coloring book, randomly colored as if by a small child.They are mischievously meaningful works. With its pneumatic, sausagelike parts, “Balloon Dog (Yellow)” is a sly Trojan Horse: it seems innocent but is loaded with aesthetic and erotic perversity. “Sacred Heart (Red/Gold)” acidly comments on the commercial debasement of emotional and religious experience. “Coloring Book” reflects the youth-obsessed infantilism of modern culture and society.But placed on the architecturally nondescript patio, where there are also shaded areas for patrons of the Roof Garden Cafe, the sculptures too easily turn into benign, decorative accessories.The biggest problem is scale. Seen in an indoor gallery, the elephantine, shiny metallic “Balloon Dog (Yellow),” which rises to 10 feet at its highest point, would have a weirdly imposing, slightly menacing presence. On the roof it appears dwarfed by the vast sky and by the open expanses of space to the south and west of the museum.The intimacy of Mr. Koons’s sculpture is also diminished. Perfectionist attention to detail is one of his work’s most compelling aspects: note the exactingly formed knot that serves as the balloon dog’s nose, or the folds, pleats and stretch marks in the heart’s wrapper. The distracting outdoor environment, though, discourages careful, contemplative looking.Because it is both the biggest and the simplest, the 18 ½-foot-tall “Coloring Book” is the least undermined by its environment. But it is also the least interesting formally, being little more than a flat, irregularly contoured slab whose colors are thin and watery.Their setting aside, Mr. Koons’s sculptures remain intellectually and sensuously exciting objects — “Balloon Dog” is a masterpiece — and they are worth visiting under any circumstances.'"
"'08-04-22,'0','People who are on a path to develop Alzheimer’s disease may hasten its arrival if they drink or smoke too much, researchers say.The researchers looked at the most common form of the illness, late-onset Alzheimer’s, which doctors believe may be touched off by a variety of factors, separately or together.For this study, presented at a recent conference of the American Academy of Neurology, the researchers looked at three possible contributors: alcohol, tobacco and a gene called APOE. The researchers examined over 900 people considered to have possible or probable Alzheimer’s disease, asking family members about their smoking and drinking histories and testing them for the gene.They found that people reported to have had more than two drinks a day developed the disease almost five years earlier than lighter drinkers, on average. Heavy smokers got it 2.3 years earlier. The APOE gene was associated with an onset about three years earlier. Many smokers, of course, like to drink. When this happened, the risk was even higher, the researchers said.There are a number of explanations for what may be happening, said one of the researchers, Dr. Ranjan Duara of the Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla. Dr. Duara said smoking on its own had two effects that could contribute to Alzheimer’s. One is its role in cardiovascular disease. The other is a link with oxidative stress, an increase in damaging free radicals in the body.'"
"'08-04-22,'0','On Monday, Mr. Carter called the agreement on a Palestinian state, obtained from Hamas in writing, important because it appeared to mean that Hamas, which seized control of the Gaza Strip last June, would not disrupt negotiations or implementation of any accord if the Palestinian people supported it in a free vote.“If the agreement calls for a two-state solution and the recognition of Israel and Palestine, Hamas will, in effect, recognize Israel, if the people agree on the plan,” Mr. Carter told the Israel Council on Foreign Relations in a speech here.In a subsequent interview, Mr. Carter struck a more cautious note, saying, “I’m not claiming it’s a breakthrough.” He added, “I don’t have any control over whether or not Hamas does what they tell me.”Hamas’s charter calls for Israel’s destruction, and it has consistently refused to recognize Israel. But Mr. Carter says that Hamas is coming around to the idea of a two-state solution.Israeli officials opposed Mr. Carter’s meetings with Hamas leaders, saying the meetings gave Hamas legitimacy. But Mr. Carter said at the speech on Monday: “The problem is not that I met with Hamas in Syria. The problem is that Israel and the United States refuse to meet these people.”The White House press secretary, Dana M. Perino, said of whatever promise came out of the discussions with Mr. Carter, “We take it with a grain of salt,” and added, “Actions speak louder than words.”How a referendum would work is not clear. Mr. Carter said in the interview that he understood that only Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza Strip would participate and that the voting would be monitored by international observers.But Khaled Meshal, the Hamas leader with whom Mr. Carter met in Damascus, gave a televised news conference late Monday in which he seemed to contradict Mr. Carter’s statements. “Hamas accepts the establishment of an independent Palestinian state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital and with full and real sovereignty and full application of the right of the Palestinian refugees to return, but Hamas will not recognize the state of Israel,” Mr. Meshal said.He also said that Hamas wanted all Palestinians, including those living abroad, to vote. Palestinians in refugee camps in Lebanon, Syria and Jordan would probably insist on a right of return to original homes in what is now Israel, something Israel has said it could never accept.In addition, Mr. Meshal emphasized that no referendum could take place before Hamas and Fatah, which now leads the Palestinian government from the West Bank, had reconciled their bitter dispute and the Palestine Liberation Organization, from which Hamas is excluded, were “reformed” to include it.Mr. Carter had made several other requests to Hamas but was turned down. Those included a prisoner exchange and the declaration of a 30-day unilateral cease-fire with Israel.Mr. Meshal said at his news conference that through Egypt, he and Israel were working on a possible mutual cease-fire or period of calm; therefore, he said, there is no reason for a unilateral cease-fire.Mr. Carter said in the interview that he found the Hamas leadership, including Mr. Meshal, to be clear-thinking, educated people who gave no sign of fanaticism, although he did condemn in harsh terms their use of violence. During his meetings, he said, they did not break for prayer or talk of holy land or God. “It was secular talk,” he said.Mr. Carter also said that what he learned about Syrian intentions toward Israel might prove more significant than the Hamas agreement.He asserted that Mr. Assad had said that there were only a few details left to work out on a full peace treaty but that the Bush administration was discouraging Israel from proceeding because of the Americans’ other concerns about Syria, especially related to Iraq.“All of our group were surprisingly impressed with his strength and knowledge of the details in contrast to what we had heard from propaganda,” Mr. Carter said of the Syrian president. He emphasized that for Syria, a deal with Israel had to be brokered by the United States.While Mr. Assad has an alliance with Iran, Mr. Carter contends that the relationship is an alternative to ties with the United States and the West rather than Mr. Assad’s first choice. He said he expected that Mr. Assad would be willing to separate from that alliance because he wants full peace with Israel.'"

We're determined to do everything we can to get normality here.""The central bank said the asset swaps would be for a period of one year and could be renewed for a total of up to three years, and that banks would remain responsible for the risk of losses on their loans. The swaps are available only for assets existing at the end of 2007 and cannot be used to finance new lending, it said.Because the government bonds are almost risk-free, they are easy to trade, and banks will presumably be more willing to lend to one another. The central bank will hold the illiquid mortgage assets as collateral.The pound slipped against the dollar and euro after the announcement, while British stocks were little changed.Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics in London, said the move was a positive step, but that ""it probably isn't the silver bullet.""The Fed has been doing something similar for a while in the United States,"" he said, ""and that hasn't solved all the problems there.""The United States Federal Reserve said last month that it would undertake swaps of up to $200 billion of American government bonds for mortgage-backed securities.""This is not going to take the place of what we believe will be further necessary and quite significant cuts in interest rates,"" Mr. Loynes said.Mr. Darling was preparing to for a session later Monday of the House of Commons where he was to further explain the plan.Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government, facing difficult local elections in May, has been under pressure to shore up the financial system and restart the mortgage market as British home price increases stall. Mr. Brown met Friday in Washington with the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, and other officials.Despite three interest rate cuts that have taken the Bank of England's benchmark rate to 5 percent, the three-month London interbank sterling rate, a reference rate for loans between banks, was at nearly 5.9 percent Friday, a spread that indicates that banks remain nervous about their peers.Mr. Loynes said that a year from now the Bank of England's main interest rate could be as low as 3.5 percent, while the fed funds rate might be as low as 1 percent.Global banks have had losses and write-downs totaling $200 billion since the collapse last summer of the market in securities based on subprime United States mortgages. The International Monetary Fund has estimated that the total cost of the credit crisis could reach $1 trillion.'"
"'08-04-22,'0','A longtime political patron, Mr. Diamond is one of the elite fund-raisers Mr. McCain’s current presidential campaign calls Innovators, having raised more than $250,000 so far. At home, Mr. Diamond is sometimes referred to as “The Donald,” Arizona’s answer to Donald Trump — an outsized personality who invites public officials aboard his flotilla of yachts (the Ace, King, Jack and Queen of Diamonds), specializes in deals with the government, and unabashedly solicits support for his business interests from the recipients of his campaign contributions.Mr. McCain has occasionally rebuffed Mr. Diamond’s entreaties as inappropriate, but he has also taken steps that benefited his friend’s real estate empire. Their 26-year relationship illuminates how Mr. McCain weighs requests from a benefactor against his vows, adopted after a brush with scandal two decades ago, not to intercede with government authorities on behalf of a donor or take other official action that serves no clear public interest.In California, the McCain aide’s assistance with the Army helped Mr. Diamond complete a purchase in 1999 that he soon turned over for a $20 million profit. And Mr. McCain’s letter of recommendation reinforced Mr. Diamond’s selling point about his McCain connections as he pursued — and won in 2005 — a potentially much more lucrative deal to develop a resort hotel and luxury housing.In Arizona, Mr. McCain has helped Mr. Diamond with matters as small as forwarding a complaint in a regulatory skirmish over the endangered pygmy owl, and as large as introducing legislation remapping public lands. In 1991 and 1994, Mr. McCain sponsored two laws sought by Mr. Diamond that resulted in providing him millions of dollars and thousands of acres in exchange for adding some of his properties to national parks. The Arizona senator co-sponsored a third similar bill now before the Senate.A spokeswoman for Mr. McCain, Jill Hazelbaker, said the senator, now the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, “had done nothing for Mr. Diamond that he would not do for any other Arizona citizen.”The campaign said in a statement that the Arizona land exchanges had broad support from local governments and environmentalists seeking to expand a federal park.For the California projects, the campaign said the McCain aide arranged the introduction to an Army official for Mr. Diamond’s team as “a constituent matter.” The campaign said it had no knowledge of the aide helping to expedite the sale.In Mr. Diamond’s other project at Fort Ord, the campaign initially said that the senator “would not have issued” the letter vouching for Mr. Diamond “if he knew at the time it would be used to favor any particular party in the course of a pending competition.” Later, the campaign described the letter as “a character reference” and said it was included only at a “pre-competition” stage in the selection process. The campaign also noted that two other members of the Arizona Congressional delegation provided similar letters.Mr. Diamond, for his part, said Mr. McCain had only done his job. “I think that is what Congress people are supposed to do for constituents,” he said. “When you have a big, significant businessman like myself, why wouldn’t you want to help move things along? What else would they do? They waste so much time with legislation.”He said he often complained to Mr. McCain that he was “too straight” about refusing to provide federal help for Arizona businessmen. “I tell him, ‘You are an Arizona senator besides being the world senator. Loosen up, kid!’ ”Mr. Diamond, 80, met Mr. McCain when he was a former prisoner of war running for Congress in 1982. “I liked him right away because I respected what he went through in Vietnam,” Mr. Diamond recalled. When he got to know Mr. McCain and his wife, Cindy, Mr. Diamond said, “it became a love fest.”Mr. Diamond was already a major player in Arizona real estate and Republican politics. A tenacious dealmaker who once visited a Mexican jail to close a sale with an inmate, Mr. Diamond had made a first fortune on Wall Street before turning his trader’s eye to the Arizona desert in 1965. He eventually became one of the state’s biggest landowners, picking up trophies that included the 12,000-acre Howard Hughes estate, stakes in two of Arizona’s professional sports teams, the Diamondbacks and the Suns, and, for a time, a Tucson television station.Over the years, Mr. Diamond and his wife, Joan, visited the McCains at their ranch in Sedona, Ariz., and entertained them in their Tucson home and in the Bahamas, where Mr. Diamond sometimes keeps his 134-foot yacht, the Queen of Diamonds. In 2001, the two men attended a Yankees-Diamondback World Series game together. “He is just very, very good company,” Mr. Diamond said of Mr. McCain. “I knew all his people and the staff.”Mr. Diamond and his family have given more than $55,000 to Mr. McCain’s campaigns (and more than $600,000 to other federal candidates). More significantly, the developer has collected (or “bundled”) hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions from others, and is now serving as a national co-chairman of the finance committee for Mr. McCain’s current presidential run. In the spring of 2000, when Mr. Diamond was in the thick of the negotiations for his California deals, he traveled with Mr. McCain through the early Republican primaries. Mr. Diamond was on the campaign trail again this year.In building his empire, Mr. Diamond said he had struggled with local elected officials over land use and zoning issues just like any other developer. “They are a pain in the ‘you-know-what,’ ” he said.But associates say he revels in his ability to “work the system,” as his friend and sometimes partner, Stanley Abrams, put it: “Nobody is as connected as Donald.”Mr. Diamond is close to most of Arizona’s Congressional delegation and is candid about his expectations as a fund-raiser. “I want my money back, for Christ’s sake. Do you know how many cocktail parties I have to go to?”To raise money for Mr. McCain, Mr. Diamond invites local Republicans to make fund-raising calls from his Tucson office. Ray Carroll, a member of the council that controls zoning in Pima County, Ariz., said Mr. Diamond followed up on one fund-raising session with a thank-you note “on behalf of Mr. McCain,” sending a copy to the senator.“To reciprocate, if you need any zoning in the county, let me know,” Mr. Diamond wrote. (Mr. Diamond said it was the kind of joke he often made.)Mr. McCain has campaigned as a critic of the corrupting influence of money and politics, saying he had learned a lesson from a late 1980s scandal over his part in an intervention with banking regulators examining a savings and loan controlled by a patron, Charles Keating. Since then, Mr. McCain vowed to embrace ethics standards that set him apart from many colleagues.“I have carefully avoided situations that might even tangentially be construed as a less than proper use of my office,” he wrote in his memoir, “Worth the Fighting For” (Random House, 2002).Mr. McCain once publicly criticized Mr. Diamond as lobbying too hard for his own financial interests. In 1995, Mr. McCain called it “unheard of” that Mr. Diamond had hired a Washington lobbyist to try to block construction of a federal building in Tucson that threatened to take away some of his rental income. “I didn’t talk to him for one year,” Mr. Diamond said of Mr. McCain. “I was annoyed.”Mr. McCain has been willing, though, to help sponsor bills authorizing federal land exchanges that Mr. Diamond sought. Former Representative Jim Kolbe, another Arizona Republican close to Mr. Diamond, said Mr. Diamond often proposed such deals and impressed lawmakers with his frankness about the potential sensitivities, Mr. Kolbe said.“He would tell you, ‘I don’t think you should get on this one, this one is too close to where you live, let another member of the delegation work on this one,’ ” Mr. Kolbe said. “He never tried to flim-flam you.”Such exchanges can serve a public interest by expanding parks or wilderness areas. But many environmentalists and other analysts have also concluded that such trades almost invariably give private developers a profitable bargain at public expense. Although federal rules stipulate that public land can be traded for private land only of “equal value,” appraisals of unusual property or in fast-growing areas are highly variable and developers often apply political pressure to get favorable terms.A study in 2000 by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office cited “inherent difficulties” and “fundamental inefficiencies” in such exchanges and urged Congress to discontinue them.The first two swaps involving Mr. Diamond that Mr. McCain helped sponsor were initially supported by local governments and conservationists, and Mr. Diamond argues the land would be worth far more today. But many Arizona conservationists later protested that the federal deals gave away too much.“Don Diamond has done very well through these land exchanges,” said Sandy Bahr, director of the Arizona chapter of the Sierra Club. “It is the public that got shortchanged.”The McCain campaign noted that the bills left the terms of any acquisitions to the Interior Department, but environmentalists argued that the legislation set the parameters.“It’s not like there is some market mechanism at work,” Ms. Bahr said.The laws expanded what is now the Saguaro National Park just outside Tucson to insulate it from proposed Diamond projects, including one to build 10,000 houses and four resorts on the 4,400-acre Rocking K Ranch nearby. Mr. Diamond had bought the ranch for less than $10 million in 1979.In the first deal, Mr. McCain was the sole Senate sponsor of a 1991 law authorizing the Department of the Interior to acquire about 2,000 acres of the ranch, which local environmentalists valued at about $5 million but Mr. Diamond and parks appraisers put at around $30 million.Over the next five years, the government paid him more than $23 million for the land and traded him two parcels of about 50 acres in upscale Scottsdale, Ariz. And the expanded Saguaro also added to the value of the remaining Rocking K land, where Mr. Diamond is still planning to build 3,000 houses along with resorts and golf courses.When The Arizona Republic linked Mr. McCain’s support for the bill to Mr. Diamond’s fund-raising, Mr. McCain called the implication “outrageous and disgusting.”In 1994, Mr. McCain sponsored, along with a Senate colleague at the time, Dennis DeConcini, Democrat of Arizona, another law expanding the park by again acquiring land from Mr. Diamond. To carry out the expansion, the Interior Department has so far taken over about 630 acres from Mr. Diamond in exchange for about 4,300 acres near Phoenix.Last year, Mr. McCain co-sponsored another bill with Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, that would grant Mr. Diamond about 1,250 acres south of Tucson in exchange for requiring him to contribute about 2,500 acres to other conservation areas — a scaled-back version of a 2003 proposal that collapsed under protests that it was too generous to Mr. Diamond. A Senate committee passed it to the floor this month.In the mid-1990s, Mr. Diamond set his sights on Monterey County, Calif., where the Army was closing Fort Ord. It was a dream property — hundreds of undeveloped acres and two golf courses in the ocean-misted hills overlooking Monterey Bay, one of California’s great tourist destinations.Tipped off by a fellow Tucson developer, Mr. Diamond had snapped up a housing complex there that had been built on land leased from the Army, giving him the inside track to buying the land when the base shut down.After the Army did so in 1994, Mr. Diamond asked Mr. McCain, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for an introduction with an Army official who could work out a sale. Mr. McCain’s legislative aide, Ann Sauer, arranged a meeting with Paul W. Johnson, a deputy assistant secretary, a Diamond executive involved in the deal said.When the talks stalled over price and water supply, Ms. Sauer interceded with the Army, according to Mr. Diamond’s deposition and others involved. “She showed up and got the thing resolved,” Mr. Diamond said.Mr. McCain’s campaign aides said in a statement they did not believe Ms. Sauer’s involvement went beyond setting up the Pentagon meeting. Ms. Sauer, who no longer works for Mr. McCain, said she could not recall details of her role. A spokesman for the Army declined to comment.Mr. Diamond finally bought the land for $250,000 in 1999. He obtained an unusual guarantee from the Army that provided a generous water allowance outside the standard allocation process — a bonus that continues to rankle municipal officials on the dry Monterey Peninsula.“Those guys got a sweetheart deal,” said Michael Keenan, whose family bought the housing complex from Mr. Diamond for nearly $30 million two years later. Mr. Diamond acknowledged turning a profit of $20 million.Even before he completed his negotiations with the Army, Mr. Diamond had begun turning his attention to an even bigger prize: the two Fort Ord golf courses, which had been sold to the city of Seaside.Mr. Diamond and his partners imagined building high-end condominiums and a luxury hotel by the links, a project they described in an internal memorandum as a “World Series, final game, out of the park, grand slam home run.”When Seaside solicited submissions in 1998 from bidders competing to develop a world-class resort, Mr. Diamond sought to exploit his Washington connections. His package included the laudatory letters from Mr. McCain, Mr. Kyl and Mr. Kolbe.“The folks that were there at the time were sort of, like, star struck: ‘God, these people really know some high-up people,’ ” said a former senior Seaside official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.Mr. Diamond acknowledged that, as court papers show, he tried more than once to enlist Mr. McCain in assisting the city on other matters as the selection process continued. “I don’t mind trying,” he said. For instance, in 2002, Mr. Diamond forwarded to Mr. McCain an article from The Monterey Herald about Seaside’s problems in a water dispute. “As per our conversation today,” he wrote, “I would appreciate it if you would follow up and drop a line to the city manager of Seaside.”He added in a postscript, “Sorry you can’t make it to the Yankees series,”Daniel E. Keen, the former Seaside city manager, recalled: “Diamond had a relationship with McCain. He was offering to help.”Mr. McCain rejected that request as “inappropriate at that time” because he was poised to regain the chairmanship of the Senate Commerce Committee, Mr. Diamond said in the deposition. “John said that he would rather not get involved. He didn’t think that it was right.”Mr. Diamond’s courtship of Seaside almost unraveled the next year when a rival developer, Danny Bakewell Sr., a civil rights activist, filed a lawsuit charging that Mr. Diamond had conspired to rig the selection process. The company running the former Army golf courses, BSL Golf, was acting as the city’s agent to pick a developer, and Mr. Bakewell’s lawyers presented documents showing that Mr. Diamond offered to give BSL a stake in the resort in exchange for helping him win the project. Mr. Diamond and BSL denied any wrongdoing and settled the suit for an undisclosed sum in 2004.Though Mr. McCain helped with the Fort Ord deals, Mr. Diamond said, he still thinks that Mr. McCain is too worried about avoiding any appearance of a favor. “He doesn’t bring home enough for the state,” Mr. Diamond said. “It is a sore subject between us.”'"
"'08-04-22,'0','Yada, yada. Airlines, we feel your pain. But we are on the receiving end of the new cash-generating schemes, which, said Joe Brancatelli, the publisher of the subscription business travel site Joesentme.com, are “aimed directly at the business traveler.”Air travel now becomes “a game of strategies and tactics,” he said, both for the customers and the airlines.Saturday night stay requirements are tiny poison pills that the major airlines once slipped into cheap advance-purchase fares to make them unattractive to business travelers, who hate having to stay on the road unnecessarily over a weekend.The rule began disappearing in 2000 and 2001 when low-cost airlines, which do not have such restrictions, began taking more market share from the network carriers. But, as reported here two weeks ago, the Saturday night stay rule has been creeping back. And with its new policy, United has now moved the issue back into the main airfare pricing channel.Credit cards? You may have noticed that airlines have been encouraging customers lately to pay for tickets using various means beyond credit cards. They are doing this partly to reduce their high credit card processing costs.This move happens to come as Americans are more often using debit cards and other direct-withdrawal payment methods.But don’t use these other methods for airplane tickets. Under the federal Fair Credit Billing Act, a credit card company is required to return your money for a service not supplied, like an airplane trip. Debit payment agencies are not.In recent weeks, some travelers on airlines like Skybus, ATA, Aloha and others have had to scramble for refunds when those airlines abruptly stopped flying. In general, it is a bad idea to pay for an airline ticket with anything but a credit card, Mr. Brancatelli said, because resolving disputes is easier with a credit card company in your corner.But worse, he said, “If your airline goes belly up and you paid with a debit card, you go to the back of the bankruptcy line with all the other unsecured creditors.”Meanwhile, assuming you have planned ahead, grin and bear it.“Airline lounges have gotten better, even though it’s amazing how much more crowded they are,” said Laura Davidson, a public relations executive from New York who travels frequently on business and now plans work to do if — and when — her flight is delayed.“I have this three-section Tumi carry-on bag, and one section is just for use during delays,” she said. Among its contents are work folders and magazines like Vanity Fair — “which is a two-hour read that I never otherwise have time for,” she said.“I try to time-manage instead of being frustrated,” she added. “I prepare for the worst. It’s all about diminished expectations. And sometimes you’re surprised. I flew out to Chicago on a flight that arrived on time, and I was so happy that I thanked the pilot.”'"
"'08-04-22,'0','Mr. McCain’s advisers devised the weeklong trip as an effort to show that a Republican could appeal to some traditional Democratic voters, or at least to get Mr. McCain credit for trying. The trip is also trying to attract a fraction of attention to Mr. McCain’s campaign in a week when the political center of the world is the Democratic primary showdown in Pennsylvania between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.Democrats dismissed Mr. McCain’s trip as a deluded belief that a Republican could appeal to poor people hard hit by seven years of Republican policies. “It’s like an arsonist turning up at the scene of the fire,” said Paul Begala, a former Clinton White House adviser and a Democratic commentator.But some Republicans said that Mr. McCain, who has often bucked his own party and is seeking to attract independents and some moderate Democrats in the fall, had a rationale for the trip. “I don’t know if I would have picked the same locations,” said Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster and strategist, “but it is not crazy for McCain to think that he can get Democratic votes that were unavailable to Bush in 2000 and 2004.”At the least, the trip is providing video for Mr. McCain’s campaign commercials. Later in the day, for example, he was serenaded with old spirituals by the quilters of Gee’s Bend, Ala., in a slow-moving ferry ride on the Alabama River.While a campaign camera crew recorded the scene from a pontoon boat, Mr. McCain stood on the ferry surrounded by a dozen black quilters who sang “The Old Ship of Zion” to the vaguely embarrassed candidate. He had just come from visiting their quilting center.One quilter, Mary Lee Bendolph, said she was leaning toward supporting Mr. Obama, but she praised Mr. McCain for turning up in Wilcox County, which locals say a presidential candidate has never visited. “He came here and he did something, and you know what, nobody else did,” Mrs. Bendolph said.The vibrant Gee’s Bend quilts became famous after they were exhibited at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 2002 and 2003. Mr. McCain bought three on Monday.His campaign would not say what he paid, but quilts of the similar large size in the Gee’s Bend center were $2,500 each.Monday was the first time Secret Service agents joined Mr. McCain’s campaign. It was unclear how many agents were assigned to Mr. McCain, but there appeared to be a handful. The number is likely to increase as the election nears.'"

"'08-04-23,'1','At least in part, Mr. Childers was able to deflect Republican efforts to tie him to national Democratic figures held in deep suspicion here, like Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. A nursing home owner as well as the chancery clerk, or county financial administrator, Mr. Childers, 50, styled himself a Mississippi Democrat, marking a distinction with the national party, which he said he disagreed with on some issues.Mr. Davis, 42, as the mayor of a town in Mississippi’s fastest-growing county, DeSoto, was able to draw on the district’s most dynamic population center, scoring the biggest county vote total.“Liberals are on the march,” the narrator warned in one Davis advertisement, which described the Republican as a “pro-life conservative” and urged voters to “send a message to Washington liberals.” That message resonated with some voters, at least, in the staunchly conservative city of Tupelo, the district’s unofficial capital and home of the American Family Association, a group led by the fundamentalist minister Donald E. Wildmon.“I want to be sure we elect somebody who holds biblical values,” said Julia Bethay, an office manager who said she had, as usual, voted Republican. “Basically, in this day and age, they hold more to the biblical values.”Allen Justice, a sales manager who voted for Mr. Davis, said, “It was more the values than anything.”Mr. Childers, on the other hand, appealed to what he called “struggling families” and attacked what he said were the “billions” made by oil companies.“I like that Childers was for working people,” said Garry Jordan, a communications technician, emerging from a Republican-leaning precinct here.“I’m a blue-collar person,” Mr. Jordan said, noting that he had voted twice for Ronald Reagan and once for President Bush, but that he punched the button on Tuesday for Mr. Childers.These voters did not mention the one issue on which the Democrat clearly distinguished himself from his Republican opponent, though not loudly: Iraq war strategy. Mr. Childers said the strategy was “not working,” while Mr. Davis insisted he would defer to “experts” like Gen. David E. Petraeus on the question.The November rematch is thus likely to be fought on the narrow band of turf that Mr. Davis, in interviews and advertisements, repeatedly sought to claim as his own: which candidate is the more conservative.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','A federal appeals court dismissed a lawsuit against Christie Whitman on Tuesday, ruling that Mrs. Whitman, the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, could not be held liable for telling residents, students and office workers that the air was safe to breathe after the terrorist attack in 2001.The Second Circuit Court of Appeals said that Mrs. Whitman, a former governor of New Jersey, was forced to balance competing interests after the attack. The court found that complying with instructions from the White House to hasten the return of financial workers to Wall Street as soon as possible after the World Trade Center was destroyed conflicted with Mrs. Whitman’s obligation to highlight the health risks facing people who lived, worked or went to school in Lower Manhattan.“Whether or not Whitman’s resolution of such competing considerations was wise,” the court said, “she has not engaged in conduct that ‘shocks the conscience’ in the sense necessary to create constitutional liability for damages to thousands of people.”In February 2006, Judge Deborah A. Batts of Federal District Court in Manhattan refused to dismiss a range of charges brought by residents against Mrs. Whitman in 2004. Judge Batts found that Mrs. Whitman made statements about safety that were so misleading that they were “conscience-shocking.”The plaintiffs alleged that Mrs. Whitman and the environmental agency she led had deliberately misrepresented the health risks of the dust from the collapsed trade towers that clouded the air in Lower Manhattan.In their lawsuit, they argued that Mrs. Whitman should have been obligated to pay for the cleanup of homes, schools and offices in Lower Manhattan.'"

"'08-04-23,'1','EBay, based in San Jose, Calif., filed a lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery on Tuesday against Craigslist, the online classified advertising company in which it owns a minority stake.In a statement, eBay said that in January, Craigslist executives took actions that “unfairly diluted eBay’s economic interest” in the company. EBay did not specify what those actions were but said they diluted its 28.4 percent share in the company by more than 10 percent. EBay bought an interest in Craigslist in 2004 for an undisclosed sum.“The recent actions by the Craigslist directors have disadvantaged eBay and its investment in Craigslist,” Michael Jacobson, eBay’s senior vice president and general counsel, said in a written statement.“Since negotiating our investment with Craigslist’s board in 2004, we have acted openly and in good faith as a minority shareholder, so we were surprised by these recent unilateral actions,” Mr. Jacobson said. “We are asking the Delaware court to rescind these recent actions in order to protect eBay’s stockholders and preserve our investment.”EBay said the complaint was filed under seal because confidentiality restrictions cover some information in it about Craigslist.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','“I can’t tell you that these jobs are ever going to come back to this magnificent part of the country,” Mr. McCain told another questioner, Sam Carbon, a student at Youngstown State, who asked Mr. McCain about how he planned to save American jobs. “But I will commit to giving these workers a second chance. They need it, they deserve it. I know that’s small comfort to you, but I can’t look you in the eye and tell you those steel mills are coming back.”Mr. McCain, who was on the second day of a weeklong tour to the country’s “forgotten places” while his two Democratic competitors battled for the nomination in Pennsylvania, sought to strike an empathetic note in the midst of his sober message.“I’ve been left recently in the unfamiliar position of facing no opposition within my own party,” Mr. McCain said in remarks before he took questions at the public forum, which was held at the university. “And as you might recall, it was a different story last year, when I could claim the unqualified support of Cindy and my mother — and my mom was starting to keep her options open.” (Cindy is Mr. McCain’s wife.)“Back then,” Mr. McCain continued, “there were some very impressive front-runners, there was a very formidable second tier of contenders, and then there was me.”Despite being written off as “a hopeless cause,” Mr. McCain said, “a person learns along the way that if you hold on, if you don’t quit no matter what the odds, sometimes life will surprise you. Sometimes you get a second chance, and opportunity turns back your way. And when it does, we are stronger and readier because of all that we had to overcome.”Mr. McCain added: “I bring up all this today, my friends, because the men and women of Youngstown know what it feels like to be counted out. You’ve been written off a few times yourselves, in the competition of the market. You know how it feels to hear that good things are happening in the American economy — they’re just not happening to you.”Afterward, Mr. Carbon, a Republican, said that Mr. McCain’s answer had partly satisfied him, and that he would vote for him in November. He said he understood that manufacturing jobs would not return, but “I was looking for more about his views on tariffs and taxes on imported things.”Mr. McCain is to continue his tour on Wednesday with a public forum in Inez, Ky., the place where President Lyndon B. Johnson made his 1964 speech declaring a national war on poverty.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','“This is a pretty significant public statement that the battle is really a cloud battle,” said Mark Stahlman, a research vice president at Gartner, an industry consulting group. “It’s not an ad search battle or a desktop operating system battle. Those are fought and won already. This is the one that’s wide open.”Marc Benioff, chief executive of Salesforce, a company that began by offering software that managed customer relations through a Web browser, said Microsoft’s entry “means that the Internet is the center of the world.” Salesforce has more recently begun broadening its product line to a wide range of computing services, also available through a browser. “Consumer services have shown us the way to the next generation of computing,” Mr. Benioff said.Microsoft refers to its strategy as “software plus services.” However, the new vision is built on Web-based software that will help deliver entertainment as well as business software to devices like Microsoft’s Xbox game console, to Zune music player, to cellphones running Windows Mobile software, even to Apple’s Mac computers and other consumer devices in the home.The company now believes that no single device will dominate the Web-oriented consumer electronic world of the future. Underscoring that belief, Live Mesh’s logo is a Tolkienesque graphical ring intended to give the user a visual sense that all the devices are interconnected.Displayed within a Web browser, the Live Desktop page will not be so much a Web-based operating system, said Jeff Hansen, general manager of Microsoft’s Live Services group, but a control mechanism that blurs the location of documents ranging from MP3 and video files to spreadsheets and text documents.“We’re adopting a wider and wider diversity of increasingly powerful devices,” Mr. Hansen said.The Live Mesh system, however, is viewed by the company as a software platform in the data center for an evolving array of services, ranging from remote control of computers and electronic devices to data storage. Microsoft also hopes that software and service developers will create applications based on the service.In the plan outlined by Mr. Ozzie, he refers to the power of choice for customers and acknowledges that software development will be based on “small pieces loosely coupled.” Both of those concepts echo industry buzzwords in the open-source Web development community that has grown outside of Microsoft during the last half decade.In a telephone interview this week, Mr. Hansen said that the current version of Live Mesh was a “technology preview” that would be available only to a group of about 10,000 test users and software developers. “We want to engage the Web community and software developers,” he said.On Tuesday evening Microsoft described 15 components of the new Live Mesh service, including a notification feature, a news feature and an information window displayed by the service, but only two user-oriented applications. One synchronizes files on multiple computers. The other, Live Mesh Remote Desktop, is a free software service that will permit users to control computers and other devices over the Internet.Mr. Hansen, who has been using Live Mesh in a private Microsoft test, said he was able to surprise his wife using the Live Mesh Remote Desktop. From work, he was able to start a song playing on his Xbox at home.Microsoft said it would begin a public test later this year. The basic service, which will be available initially on devices running Windows XP and Mobile, will later support Mac computers and other mobile devices. Five gigabytes of free data storage will be included, but the company declined to speculate about charges for additional features and services.'"

"'08-04-23,'1','Mr. Moffett calculated that the rate of lines being disconnected was at a record high. The economic slowdown, he wrote, is encouraging people to cancel their landline service and use only cellphones. But he said those customers would not get their traditional phone service reconnected when the economy improved.“Wireless substitution appears to have accelerated, likely due in part to a weakening economy,” he wrote. “But to call even this trend ‘cyclical’ would be a misnomer, in our view; it seems improbable, at best, to assume that consumer who cut the cord now might return when the economy strengthens.”In a statement, AT&T’s chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, expressed optimism about efforts to cut costs and shift more business to wireless and data service.“Revenue growth continues to ramp, we have good momentum across key growth areas, major cost initiatives are on track, and our operational results reinforce the confidence we have in our outlook,” Mr. Stephenson said.The company reported net income of $3.5 billion, or 57 cents a share, up 22 percent from the $2.85 billion, or 45 cents a share, reported in the year-ago quarter.AT&T’s income was reduced by $1.2 billion in noncash charges related to various mergers and $374 million in costs related to recent layoffs. On Friday, AT&T said it would eliminate 4,650 jobs, or 1.5 percent of its work force.After deducting these nonrecurring charges, AT&T earned 74 cents a share, exactly what analysts had estimated.Company shares rose 22 cents, closing at $37.81 on the New York Stock Exchange.Almost all of AT&T’s growth in profit came from its wireless unit, which had operating earnings of $2.9 billion, an increase of 96 percent. Wireline profit fell 2 percent, to $2.8 billion.AT&T continues to generate a significant amount of cash, although its capital expenses are growing even faster. In the first quarter, cash flow from operations was $5 billion, up 7 percent. But it invested $4.3 billion in facilities and equipment, up 27 percent.Wireless data was particularly strong, the company said, with revenue increasing 57 percent to $2.3 billion. That now represents 22 percent of the total wireless revenue, up from 16 percent a year ago. The average monthly revenue for each subscriber, a measure watched closely, increased 2 percent, to $50.18.In the first quarter, AT&T customers sent 44 billion text messages, twice the number a year ago.The company also added 148,000 customers for its U-verse television service, giving it 379,000 total subscribers. AT&T said it hoped to have one million subscribers by the end of the year.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','The chemicals company DuPont said Tuesday that profits increased 26 percent in the first quarter as strong sales of farming chemicals and seeds and brisk business overseas offset a slowdown in the American economy.DuPont, which is based in Wilmington, Del., reported earnings of $1.19 billion, or $1.31 a share, up from $945 million, or $1.01, a year earlier. Excluding a charge in the previous year’s quarter, earnings per share increased 22 percent, the company said.Sales in the latest period grew 9 percent, to $8.6 billion, thanks largely to higher local selling prices and the weak dollar, which raises the value of overseas sales when converted back to American currency. The favorable currency exchange offset a 1 percent decline in overall volume. Revenue totaled $8.77 billion, up from $8.16 billion.The results exceeded analysts’ expectations. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expected earnings of $1.28 a share on revenue of $8.61 billion.Sales outside the United States increased 16 percent, and by 25 percent in emerging markets, led by Brazil, China, India and Eastern Europe.Local selling prices increased 6 percent over all, more than offsetting higher ingredient costs.DuPont officials noted that they expected raw material and energy costs to grow about 9 percent this year, about double the pace of last year.'"

Analysts, on average, had expected 40 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.Worldwide sales at stores open at least one year were up 4 percent, including 12 percent growth from Yum’s China division.Yum raised its forecast for 2008 earnings to $1.85 to $1.87 a share, excluding special items.Shares rose 3.8 percent to $39.95 in extended trading, after closing down 1.5 percent to $38.49 on the New York Stock Exchange.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','LOS ANGELES — Hidden deep in the recesses of armoires and tucked inside the velvet-lined drawers of jewelry boxes everywhere are the flotsam and jetsam of relationships past, the usually well-intended gifts of watches, rings and bracelets.How to get rid of these items that tend to linger for years? Melt them down? Take a solitary walk to the pier and chuck them into the sea?The founders of the Web site ExBoyfriendJewelry.com think a mix of cash and catharsis would be most satisfying. The site, created in February by two women here, allows users to sell, auction, trade or simply give away the refuse of their amorous misadventures. But they must tell the stories behind every gift. Prices on the site Tuesday ranged from free to $4,800.“You went through this hell, through that relationship to get this piece of jewelry, so you deserve something for it,” said Megahn Perry, 30, an actress and a writer who said she came up with the idea for the site last fall while eating a pork chop and thinking of her former husband. Her engagement ring and vintage wedding band are offered on the site.Ms. Perry’s stepmother, Marie Perry, a co-founder of the site, said it was intended to be more personal than other e-commerce sites. “If you just want to move stuff out of your life, then yes, go to eBay,” she said. “But this is more than that. It’s about what’s attached to it.”A seller who called herself Hootchiemama described how she felt when she opened the diamond butterfly pendant that marked the beginning of the end of one relationship. “Butterflies in my stomach,” she wrote. “That’s what I had when he gave me this.”'"
"'08-04-23,'1','They were free, ending a gritty and macabre Hell’s Kitchen tale of three longtime friends who relied on each other in many ways to get out of fixes and to survive the streets.Mr. Daloia and Mr. O’Hare returned to the apartment at 436 West 52nd Street where they had last cared for Mr. Cintron. They said again that they thought their friend had been alive. “If the medical examiner couldn’t tell his time of death, and they are the professionals, then how could we?” Mr. Daloia asked, standing on the stoop of his building.He said he picked up Mr. Cintron off the couch a few weeks before his death and carried him to the same check-cashing store, where he was able to wave at the attendant. But he hadn’t been taking his medication, and his condition was getting worse.“What did we do? We didn’t do anything, except what we normally do,” Mr. Daloia said.Mr. O’Hare, who had lived with Mr. Cintron for seven years and said he was his primary caregiver, said he felt particularly bad. He said the landlord of Mr. Cintron’s building was trying to have him evicted. “Maybe I feel like I should have done more,” he said. “I could have done more to help him with the medication. I loved the guy. I miss him.”Mr. O’Hare’s lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb, said, “We have said from the beginning that James and David did not know that their very good friend was dead when they went to the check-cashing facility.”“All charges were dismissed, the record has been sealed and it is the end of a very sad story,” he said.On Jan. 8, Mr. O’Hare and Mr. Daloia dressed Mr. Cintron in his apartment, carried him downstairs and propped him up in a computer chair on wheels. Then they pulled and dragged the chair east to the Pay-O-Matic at 763 Ninth Avenue near 52nd.The spectacle drew a crowd. A detective at a nearby restaurant looked up from lunch and noticed Mr. Cintron’s feet bouncing off the edge of the sidewalk.“Well, this is a dead guy,” the detective, Travis Rapp, recalled thinking to himself. He confronted them.“Oh my God, my friend is gone?” they said, Detective Rapp recalled later that day. Mr. O’Hare and Mr. Daloia have said there was nothing unusual about what they did.For a long time before Mr. Cintron died, the three of them depended on one another, they and their lawyers have said. They pooled money, nursed one another through sickness and shared food and the shelter of the small apartment where Mr. Cintron had grown up and where he and Mr. O’Hare lived.The friends said Mr. Cintron had been ill for some time from Parkinson’s disease, weak, at times unresponsive and unable to care for himself. That Tuesday morning was no different, they said.“They have grown old together,” Mr. Daloia’s lawyer, Allan P. Haber, said of the three, adding, “The friendship doesn’t end if one of them is needy.”Mr. O’Hare and Mr. Daloia were arrested on charges of criminal possession of a forged instrument, second-degree forgery and attempted petty larceny. They were also accused of violating a section of public health law that requires that a body be buried or incinerated “within a reasonable time after death.”'"

But DuPont said a United States slowdown would offset growth abroad, and McDonald’s said an important metric of its sales showed a decline for March. All three companies are among the 30 stocks that make up the Dow.With hundreds of companies still to report results, investors are anxious over what the figures might say about the prospects for the economy.Investors appeared little moved by news of continued weakness in the housing sector. The National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell 2 percent in March and the median sales price dropped for a seventh consecutive month.But oil’s seemingly relentless march higher — light crude for May delivery settled at $119.37, up $1.89 — raised the possibility of higher inflation that would lead consumers to cut back their discretionary spending. It would also make the Federal Reserve less likely to keep lowering interest rates.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','With the world premiere of the Michael McCullers comedy “Baby Mama,” starring Tina Fey, at the Ziegfeld Theater, the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival opens on Wednesday night. Before it ends on May 3 with a screening of the family adventure “Speed Racer,” written and directed by the brothers Andy and Larry Wachowski, the festival will present 120 feature films, as well as documentaries and shorts from around the world. Among the films are the Madonna documentary, “I Am Because We Are,” about Malawi children orphaned by AIDS; “Tennessee,” with Mariah Carey portraying an abused woman on the run; and John Cusack’s “War, Inc.,” about a hit man sent to a fictional war-torn country in the Middle East.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','Jon Coifman, the Defense Council’s director of media relations, wrote in an e-mail message: “Snow White, Robin Hood, Bambi. The forest is where they captured our imagination.”And in a comment that the folks over at the newly formed Disneynature might want to take note of, he added, “All those wildlife documentaries, on the other hand, were highly staged and never managed to rise above a 1950s sensibility about man’s dominion over nature.”Of course it doesn’t take a Ph.D. to see the nature-loving themes in Disney movies: hunters kill Bambi’s mother and burn down a forest; Pocahontas sings “The rainstorm and the river are my brothers/The heron and the otter are my friends/And we are all connected to each other.”But many scholars have taken Disney to task on this very issue, citing the company for environmentally unfriendly policies and the films for candy-coated sentimentalism and distorted views of nature and animals.Ralph H. Lutts, the author of “The Nature Fakers: Wildlife, Science & Sentiment,” wrote that Disney’s version of the original Bambi story by Felix Salten, first published in English in 1928, was “a ‘Sunday school’ vision of nature as a place without stress, conflict or death,” and that compared with the original story on which it is based, the Disney version was a much less “ecologically and philosophically complex vision of nature.” And while the Oxford scholar Marina Warner declares, “It is simply unthinking and lazy to denounce all the works of Disney and his legacy,” she too has been critical of the black-and-white viewpoint of the films.Rod M. Fujita, the director of Oceans Programs at the Environmental Defense Fund, acknowledged the dangers of such simplification. “Movies and nature documentaries that tug at one’s heartstrings and offer simplified ways of understanding complex environmental problems can provide a bump up in awareness of nature and threats to nature, and can also motivate action to address those threats,” he wrote in an e-mail message. “But unfortunately these effects seem to be quite transitory.” They “won’t result in behavior and attitudinal changes by themselves — they need to be reinforced by deeper learning experiences.”But to Mr. Whitley the very sentimentalism and simplification that are criticized is what gives these animated features the emotional power that makes them effective environmental messengers. For instance, “the way the landscape is shot” in “Bambi,” he said, “angles the film’s attachment to ideas of conservation in particular ways.” The emotionally wrenching scene of Bambi’s mother being shot (off screen) underscores the impact of the natural scenes.Mr. Whitley steers clear of other activities by Disney, which has tangled with environmentalists before, for example, over plans to build a ski resort in the unspoiled Mineral King Valley in the Sierra Nevada. Rather, he is interested in a close viewing of the cartoons themselves.Through the decades the films have embraced different classic conceptions of nature, Mr. Whitley argues. “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs” presents the pastoral vision where nature is seen as a place for self-discovery in the tradition of Thoreau. The animal helpers are a crucial part of this 1937 landmark film, the first of Disney’s animated features. “Bambi” adopts the view of American naturalists like John Muir and artists like Ansel Adams who exalt in the virgin wilderness, while “Finding Nemo” and “Tarzan” depict a more complex world where humans and animals can exist harmoniously.Are they escapist? Sure, Mr. Whitley concedes. But such films “also have the potential for putting us in touch with issues, in playful forms,” that can allow “audiences to think as well as feel.”'"
"'08-04-23,'1','In his past comments about protecting animals and nature, Pope Benedict XVI is building upon the Roman Catholic Church’s tradition of promoting faithful stewardship of all creatures (“A Cat Lover in the Vatican Strikes a Chord With Cat Lovers Around the World,” news article, April 20).The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops and the Catholic catechism affirm that compassion for animals is a matter of human dignity. The Catholic Church is not alone among major religions on this issue.The Episcopal Church embraces a resolution that specifically addresses puppy mills and factory farms. The United Methodist Church supports the humane treatment of farm animals and calls for the protection of endangered species. The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America asserts that “God’s command to have dominion and subdue the earth is not a license to dominate and exploit.”The Assemblies of God position on stewardship reflects that of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. The Central Conference of American Rabbis “advocates the strengthening of humane legislation,” and the list goes on.Christine GutlebenWashington, April 21, 2008The writer is the director of animals and religion at the Humane Society of the United States.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','The Youth America Grand Prix, now in its ninth year, is a ballet and contemporary-dance competition of epic proportions. Its culminating gala, “Stars of Today Meet the Stars of Tomorrow,” at City Center on Monday, featured 20 finalists, along with an array of established stars, notably the dazzling Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev of the Bolshoi Ballet. Their airy splendor in the “Flames of Paris” pas de deux stopped the show partway through; much of the audience rose to its feet.And with the actor Alan Cumming as its witty host, the gala was more irreverent than usual. “I hear the Youth America Grand Prix has done for dance what the Internet has done for the world of computers: it’s made us all obsessed with porn,” he said, eyeing the balcony of youngsters. “That was an adult joke. I’m sorry.”In the first half, dancers, many still growing, performed variations with impressive focus, though the male contingent (notably Esteban E. Hernandez, Zhang Zhi Yao, Derek Dunn and Vadim Muntagirov) tended to dominate. At least in the contemporary category, choreography for the young women added up to little more than high kicks, rolls on the floor and hair tossing.The second half turned the boys into men — one of whom was the breathtaking Roberto Bolle, who appeared opposite Greta Hodgkinson in Jiri Kylian’s “Petit Mort.” He also performed with Polina Semionova, a striking ballerina from the Berlin State Opera Ballet, making her New York debut in Roland Petit’s “Carmen.” The ballet was an unfortunate choice to highlight her prodigious talent. (It didn’t help that the lights darkened prematurely, obscuring the ballet’s final signature lift.)There were other New York debuts, including those of Jin Yao and Huang Zhen from Hong Kong Ballet, and Mizuka Ueno of Tokyo Ballet, as well as a pair of new dances. Adam Hougland’s “Alloy” amounted to yet another rehashing of William Forsythe’s experimental distortions of ballet, while Marcelo Gomes presented “Tacacá,” in which Sarawanee Tanatanit and Blaine Hoven harmlessly tested their physical limits with combative playfulness.As usual, David Hallberg of American Ballet Theater, in the pas de trois from “Le Corsaire,” was the epitome of classical bearing. Another reliably welcome sight was Moses Pendleton’s “Millennium Skiva,” a beaming example of choreographic ingenuity for Nicole Loizides and Steven Marshall. As Mr. Cumming pointed out, Mr. Marshall was once a competitor in the Youth America Grand Prix. On Monday night he showed himself to be a star of today, right before our eyes.'"

"'08-04-23,'1','As Mr. Holtz-Eakin told Congress in 2003, a dynamic analysis of the White House’s tax and spending proposals made essentially no difference. The impact of such analysis, he later said, had been “overblown.” When he left the budget office in 2005, Senator Conrad told The Hill newspaper that Mr. Holtz-Eakin had been “an exemplary leader.”Today, Mr. Holtz-Eakin again finds himself in a firestorm. He is the top economic adviser to John McCain’s presidential campaign, and some fiscal conservatives have begun wondering what happened to the Douglas Holtz-Eakin who was a teller of unpleasant truths. For that matter, they’re wondering what happened to the John McCain who was a fiscal conservative himself, the man who not only railed against profligate spending but also voted against Mr. Bush’s deficit-creating tax cuts.Last week, Senator McCain laid out his economic vision in a speech in Pittsburgh. He talked about wasteful spending, but the newest, most detailed part of the speech dealt with a package of tax cuts that would cost about $300 billion a year. They would come on top of $350 billion a year in Bush tax cuts that Mr. McCain wants to make permanent. To put these numbers in perspective, the Iraq war has been costing roughly $200 billion a year.So on Tuesday I visited Mr. Holtz-Eakin at the McCain campaign headquarters, on the top floor of an office building in suburban Virginia. We talked for more than an hour (in the empty office of the campaign’s strategist Charlie Black, because Mr. Holtz-Eakin doesn’t have his own office).But I really had only one question that mattered: Are there any fiscal conservatives anymore?One of the first things that people notice about Mr. Holtz-Eakin is his laugh. It’s hearty, it bursts out every few minutes, and it sometimes follows a joke that Mr. Holtz-Eakin has made at his own expense.Now 50, he is about a decade older than the typical economic ringleader in a presidential campaign. “I’m too old for this,” he said to Mr. McCain at one point. “You can’t say that,” replied the 71-year-old Mr. McCain.Mr. Holtz-Eakin grew up near Pittsburgh, where his father was a Navy veteran who had risen through the ranks to become the manager of a Jones & Laughlin steel plant. In the 1980s, his father oversaw the closing of that plant, which Mr. Holtz-Eakin calls “the most horrific thing I’ve ever seen” and which influenced his own decision to become an economist focusing on public policy.As a graduate student and junior professor at Princeton, he worked with Harvey Rosen and, eventually, John Taylor, two top-tier Republican economists. Mr. Holtz-Eakin’s own academic work often examined the effect of taxes — a favorite Republican subject — but it was still relatively apolitical. “It’s very empirical; it’s very data-based,” Mr. Rosen said. “He doesn’t theorize. He goes to the data to find out how things actually work.”Mr. Holtz-Eakin came into Mr. McCain’s orbit during the 2000 presidential campaign, and the two men were a good match. Both of them are economic conservatives who focus more on the need to restrain government spending than on the social good it may accomplish. And they’re absolutely right that spending is the main long-term problem.In all, federal taxes now equal about 19 percent of the nation’s economic output, which is in line with the historical average. But the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, on their current path, would require that number to rise to an unmanageable 30 percent, and beyond, in coming decades.“We as a nation cannot tax our way out of this problem,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin says. “It’s just not an option.”To deal with the deficit, Mr. McCain has said that he will get tough on year-to-year spending, both in military programs and domestic ones. Then he will try to remake Medicare and Medicaid so that, as Mr. Holtz-Eakin puts it, they no longer pay doctors “based on what they do to people, instead of what they do to make people well.” It’s a fine idea.The problem is that the campaign has been far, far more detailed about its tax cuts, which would worsen the deficit, than its spending cuts, which would reduce it. Mr. McCain has proposed the elimination of the alternative minimum tax (at a cost of $60 billion a year), new child tax deductions ($65 billion), a corporate tax cut ($100 billion) and faster write-offs for corporate investments in new equipment ($50 billion to $75 billion).On the spending side, the senator talks broadly about cracking down on pork barrel projects and holding agencies accountable for their budgets. These steps, Mr. Holtz-Eakin told me, could eventually bring $150 billion a year in savings. He added that given Mr. McCain’s history of fighting against wasteful spending, he deserved the benefit of the doubt.It would be easier to give him that benefit, though, if he weren’t so vague. For decades presidential candidates have been promising to cut waste, fraud and abuse, and no one has yet made a noticeable dent in the federal budget.As Mr. McCain’s plan currently stands, The Economist magazine concluded that it “will not come anywhere close to paying for the tax cuts.” Most telling, I spoke over the past week with several other economists who admire Mr. McCain and have advised him over the years. None would defend his current fiscal package (or be quoted).Mr. Holtz-Eakin says the mistake that people are making is treating the McCain platform as if it were a finished piece of work. “It’s April,” he said. “We have until November.” The campaign will later unveil “base broadeners” in the corporate tax code — that is, loopholes it will eliminate — that will pay for the faster investment write-offs, for example.It’s easy to imagine how Mr. McCain could be laying the groundwork to run as a true fiscal conservative, now that he has locked up the Republican nomination. He could present himself as the one candidate who believes that the nation can afford neither Mr. Bush’s endless tax cuts nor the Democrats’ big new government programs. He has the perfect adviser to help him make that case.But it’s not the case he’s making, at least not yet. Instead, when you add up the numbers that have been released so far, you’re left wondering if he is the least fiscally conservative candidate still in the race.'"

"'08-04-23,'1','Apple said it shipped 2.3 million Mac computers in the quarter, 51 percent more than in the year-ago quarter. Revenue on those computers increased 54 percent. But it also said it sold 10.6 million iPods during the quarter, flat with year ago quarter. It sold 1.7 million iPhones.The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., also forecast strong sales in the coming months. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, said the company expected third-quarter revenue of about $7.2 billion and earnings per share of about $1. .Analysts have noted that as the March quarter has progressed demand for Apple’s iPhone has actually increased and the computer maker has been unable to keep up with demand. The supply issue could have been affected by the limited availability of 16 gigabyte flash memory chips, said Charles Wolf, a securities analyst at Needham & Company.Mr. Wolf said that the more interesting story for the quarter may be Apple’s increasing share of the market for PCs because of the popularity of its laptops. International Data Corporation’s survey this month showed Apple with a 6 percent share of the American market in the first quarter, compared with 4.9 percent a year ago. Industry executives and financial analysts expect the company to release a major redesign of its Macbook and Macbook Pro portable models before the back-to-school and year-end holiday shopping seasons.Apple’s stock has declined 17.9 percent since the beginning of January when it peaked near $200 per share. After drifting below $120 per share, the stock has recovered since March.Analysts and the industry are expecting Apple to introduce a higher performing version of the iPhone within the next two months, designed for faster 3G data-oriented cellular networks. Although the iPhone has been wildly popular in the United States, it has lagged in some European countries and the company’s chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, is under pressure to meet his 10 million iPhone sales forecast by the end of 2008. To meet that goal Mr. Jobs needs a popular new iPhone 2.0. In addition, he may need to push the price of the existing $399 iPhone down significantly or introduce a stripped down model to expand his market.On Wednesday, Apple confirmed a that it had acquired PA Semi, a Silicon Valley chip company with expertise in low power microprocessors, an essential technology for future iPhones. The chip maker had originally hoped to supply Apple with chips designed for a microprocessor used in earlier Macintosh computers and by I.B.M., known as the Power Architecture. However when Apple switched alliances and began using Intel microprocessors for the Macintosh, PA Semi was left without a major buyer.The explosive success of the iPhone, which is now based on a chip design licensed from ARM Ltd., a British chip designer that was co-founded by Apple, has given the Apple an incentive to design its own versions of the ARM chip for mobile computing applications. The decision to buy PA Semi is likely to be a blow to Intel, which recently introduced a new low-power chip called Atom. While Atom is too power-hungry for the cell phone market, Intel, the world’s largest chip maker, has been betting that a future generation of low power Intel microprocessors would allow it to compete in that market.Analysts have been watching closely for the first indications of the strength of its ultralight Macintosh Air. The computer was introduced with great fanfare by Mr. Jobs in January. However there have been concerns about its performance and storage capacity and recently there have been user concerns about a persistent overheating problem.Apple has also made some progress with its Apple TV set-top box. The system has attracted more positive reviews than the first generation system, but the movie library, which Mr. Jobs had promised would reach 5,000 to 10,000 titles is still lagging because of difficulties the company has faced in striking rental agreements with Hollywood studios.'"
"'08-04-23,'1','Advisers to Mr. Obama believe his efforts were damaged by the sharp back-and-forth between him and Mrs. Clinton. They believe that her campaign defined him in a negative way, reinforcing questions about potential weaknesses in his candidacy.“If Senator Clinton thinks she has a legitimate chance to win the nomination, she has every reason to stay,” Mr. Axelrod said aboard the campaign plane here Tuesday evening. “But if her only strategy is to try and tear down Senator Obama, I think that’s going to make a lot of Democrats uncomfortable.”For at least two months, Mr. Obama has struggled to close the deal on the nomination. Attempts to defeat Mrs. Clinton at the ballot box have repeatedly proved to be unsuccessful — especially, as she has pointed out, in the larger states — so his campaign is now employing a two-front strategy: trying to ignore Mrs. Clinton while working to overwhelm her campaign by using its financial advantage to advertise more and build larger organizations in each of the remaining nine contests.In Indiana, the next major battleground, Mr. Obama is strengthening an already robust television advertising campaign and sending an army of fresh workers there in the coming days. In North Carolina, which also holds a primary on May 6, he will try to run up the margin of victory to maintain his lead in the overall popular vote.“Our attitude is that as long as Senator Clinton wants to stay in the race and as long as she’s got support and her name’s on the ballot, then there’s no reason why we can’t continue to campaign,” Mr. Obama said in a radio program. “I do want to make sure that during the course of our campaigning that we keep an eye on John McCain.”But his argument was weakened — perhaps significantly — by his showing in Pennsylvania. Campaign officials began reaching out to uncommitted superdelegates and other party elders to prevent an erosion of support, hoping to get ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s efforts to persuade leading Democrats to take a second look at Mr. Obama’s candidacy.Seeking to blunt any political damage from losing in Pennsylvania, the Obama campaign distributed a memo to supporters late Tuesday titled, “A Fundamentally Unchanged Race.” His strategists noted that he had narrowed the gap from a few weeks ago and improved his showing among white voters and voters over 60 since the Ohio primary.His advisers said they would not call for Mrs. Clinton to end her campaign and would urge supporters to do the same. Not only could it backfire, they said, but it could also alienate her supporters, which the Obama campaign hopes to ultimately attract.Even in defeat, the spirits were high among Mr. Obama’s aides. A leading reason was that Pennsylvania was in the rear-view mirror — for now, anyway.On the campaign plane, Mr. Axelrod and Robert Gibbs, the communications director, wore T-shirts with the message: “Stop the drama, vote Obama.”'"

"'08-04-24,'1','Those new products were not ready in time for the 2006 year-end holiday season in the consumer market. To encourage holiday sales of personal computers, Microsoft offered free or low-cost upgrades to the delayed software, resulting in revenue being deferred in the December quarter, and then recognized in the March quarter of 2007.Microsoft’s sales rose slightly in the quarter to $14.45 billion, compared with $14.40 billion in the year-earlier quarter. In 2007, the March quarter included $1.67 billion of deferred revenue.The company’s profits were above the Wall Street consensus estimate of 44 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Financial. And its revenue was a bit below the analysts’ estimate of $14.50 billion.For its 2008 fiscal year, ending in June, Microsoft lifted its forecasts for revenue and profits. The company said it now anticipated revenue of $66.9 billion to $68 billion, and earnings of $2.13 to $2.19 a share.Microsoft’s efforts to build an online business to compete with Google — and the progress of its bid for Yahoo — have understandably been the focus of the industry and Wall Street recently. On Wednesday, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, suggested that the company did not plan to raise its original bid of $44.6 billion for Yahoo, and held out the possibility that Microsoft might drop its bid, if Yahoo’s management continues to spurn its offer.“We are prepared to go forward without a merger.” Mr. Ballmer said at a conference in Milan. His comment, most analysts say, is probably a gesture intended to put more pressure on Yahoo’s board. Microsoft did walk away from one high-profile takeover bid in the past, a $2-billion offer for Intuit, the personal finance software maker. But that was 13 years ago, and Microsoft folded only after the Justice Department challenged the planned purchase.A proxy battle for control of Yahoo, analysts say, is a more likely alternative. On April 5, Mr. Ballmer sent a letter to Yahoo’s directors, threatening to oust the board and lower Microsoft’s $31 a share cash-and-stock offer, unless Yahoo started negotiations within three weeks. That deadline is Saturday.Building an Internet services and advertising business is vital to Microsoft’s future. But the quarterly results underline once again how much the main engines of the company’s financial performance are its desktop PC products, Windows and Office and those two big, lucrative businesses are healthy and growing.The two product groups reported total sales of $8.77 billion, accounting for 61 percent of Microsoft’s revenue, and operating profits of $6.24 billion, or more than 80 percent of profits from the business divisions.The division making server software that runs data centers has become another large and profitable business for Microsoft in recent years. The server unit generated revenue of $3.26 billion, up 17 percent from the year-earlier quarter, and operating profits of $1.09 billion.The Xbox video game division, which also includes computer hardware like keyboards and mice, generated solid growth, up 68 percent to $1.58 billion. And after years of investment, the game unit is now profitable, reporting operating profits of $89 million.The online business remains a weak spot, and a strategic necessity, for Microsoft as software shifts away from the PC desktop to be delivered as service over the Internet. With this model of cloud computing, Google and others are starting to offer online word processing and spreadsheet software that poses a long-term challenge to Microsoft’s desktop programs.The online business lost $228 million on revenue of $843 million, up 40 percent from the year-ago quarter. The revenue got a one-time lift from including the contribution this year from aQuantive, an online ad agency Microsoft bought last May for $6 billion.'"
"'08-04-24,'1','Ryanair, the Dublin-based low-cost airline, said Thursday that it would file a complaint with the European Union, arguing that the proposed loan “makes a mockery of E.U. state aid rules.”Within Europe, subsidies offered by national governments are covered by strict rules to ensure fair competition. Most large-scale state aid must be reported to the commission and, to be approved, must be time-limited and used as part of a restructuring process.Whatever the eventual outcome, Alitalia is likely to gain a breathing space because of the time-lag involved in such proceedings.Mr. Berlusconi has said that he wants to put in place a consortium of private investors to buy the struggling airline after the withdrawal of Air France-KLM from the bidding. New owners could be in place by the time a ruling is made.“We need a clear picture,” the European Commission spokesman for transport, Michele Cercone, said. There were “a number of doubts” and the Italian authorities needed to provide “more clarification.”In addition, even if a loan is on commercial terms, it could constitute illegal aid if it was granted in circumstances where normal banks would decline to lend, he said.From 1997 to 2001 the European Commission approved 1.4 billion euros in government aid to Alitalia during earlier restructuring efforts.For years Ryanair has been pressing the commission to enforce its ban on illegal government support to national flag carriers. Last year it filed a lawsuit at the European Court of First Instance in Luxembourg in an effort to force Europe to crack down.Ryanair submitted complaints to the European Commission in 2005 against aid to Alitalia, Air France, Lufthansa of Germany and Olympic Airways of Greece, but so far no action has been taken against the respective governments.“The European Commission, as always in the case of flag carriers, turns a blind eye and does nothing,” said Jim Callaghan, Ryanair’s head of regulatory affairs.Beyond the question of the loan’s legality, analysts said it was not at all clear that the financing would ultimately change the fate of Alitalia.“It’s not clear whether this doesn’t just prolong the bedside agony,” said Dan Solon, an aviation analyst in Barcelona. ‘”It is hard to see what set of domestic Italian players could come in with anything better than what Air France-KLM put on the table.”A German government official expressed doubt that Alitalia would be able to survive as an independent airline and suggested that a takeover by a foreign carrier would be not be the worst possible outcome.“It is important that we have competitive, powerful aviation companies in Europe,” said Matthias von Randow, state secretary in the transport ministry, said in a statement.Alitalia’s board stressed on April 8 that it was in “urgent” need of “substantial financial support” in order to continue operating. As of the end of March, the carrier had 170 million euros in cash on hand, down from 282 million euros at the end of January, meaning it is consuming reserves at an average rate of about 1.9 million euros a day. The company said this month that it had received a government tax credit of 69 million euros, a sum equivalent to about a month of operating expenses.Should Italy fail in its bid to bail out Alitalia, analysts said the airline would probably soon be faced with liquidation. But even then, the carrier has very few assets of value to sell. Its fleet of mostly decades-old, fuel-guzzling aircraft would probably not draw much interest from other airlines, while its landing rights in Rome, Milan and other foreign airports would be unlikely to sell for much in the event of a forced sale.Alitalia has been in a slow death spiral for more than a decade, posting a profit only four times in the last 15 years. Its share of the Italian air travel market has fallen to around 30 percent from more than 80 percent in the late 1990s amid competition from discount carriers.Ryanair — which began flying to Venice, Pisa and Rimini in 1998 and established a base in Rome in 2004 — now provides 10 percent of the available airplane seats in Italy, both on domestic and international routes.“Given that the whole ship is actually sinking, the only thing that money can do is pump a bit of air into the hold for a while,” said Peter Morris, chief economist at Ascend, a London-based aviation consultancy.

"'08-04-24,'1','The Credit Suisse chief executive, Brady Dougan, told investors in a conference call that the results were “clearly unsatisfactory,” but he said Credit Suisse’s capital position remained strong.Markets deteriorated markedly in the first quarter, he said, and the operating environment “continued to be extremely challenging for the entire industry.”Nonetheless, he said, Credit Suisse reduced its risk exposure in the period and is well-positioned to take advantage of “opportunities arising out of the current market disruptions.”The investment banking business posted a first-quarter loss before taxes of about 3.5 billion francs, compared with a profit of nearly 2 billion francs a year earlier, as it wrote down assets valued at 5.28 billion francs — or about $5.3 billion. It said most of the loss resulted from “mortgage and credit market dislocations on the fixed-income businesses.”Banks around the world have written down nearly $300 billion on assets since the credit crisis began last summer with the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.Credit Suisse has written off about $10 billion of bad investments since the start of last year, well below that of its larger Swiss rival, UBS, which has reduced its assets by $38 billion.UBS said Wednesday that it would shrink its investment banking unit and reorganize its management structure, and the Swiss banks are expected to cut several thousand jobs.Credit Suisse, one of the world’s biggest managers of funds for wealthy clients, noted that its private banking business attracted net new assets of 17.1 billion francs in the first quarter, including 13.5 billion francs in wealth management.“The wealth management business seems to be holding up well,” the Helvea analyst, Mr. Thorne said. “They seem to be benefiting from the problems at UBS.”Credit Suisse said it had no plans to seek new funds from investors, as its Tier-1 capital ratio, a measure of financial strength, stood at 9.8 percent at the end of the first quarter.“We think that is very sufficient capital,” Mr. Dougan, the chief executive, said.Credit Suisse shares rose about 5 percent in trading Thursday in Zurich.'"
"'08-04-24,'1','And then late Wednesday, the government reduced the stamp duty on trades from 0.3 percent to 0.1 percent.Analysts said it was a strong sign that Beijing intends to step in, as it often does, to lift prices.“The stamp tax cut is a political signal that the government is taking actions to save the stock market,” Qian Qimin, an analyst in Shanghai for Shenyin & Wanguo Securities, said. “This lowers trading costs and stimulates trading activity. And what is more important is the political meaning, that the government is paying attention to the capital market and won’t stand by and let it sink.”The Shanghai Composite Index, which had recorded its worst quarter ever at the end of March, rose 9.3 percent Thursday to close at 3,583.03.The Shenzhen Composite Index, the country’s other major index, also soared, climbing 8.7 percent to close at 1,043.80.In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index also rallied 1.5 percent, though Hong Kong’s market is not subject to Beijing’s rules.Few analysts believe share prices will reach a new high this year, but many investors and analysts are hoping the worst is over.Since October, when the Shanghai Composite Index peaked at 6,092.06, share prices have fallen dramatically and also turned incredibly volatile, sometime rising sharply, and then falling sharply.Many experts had warned of a sharp downturn this year because prices had risen so sharply in 2006 and 2007, breaking records, producing incredibly high stock values and resulting in a stock-buying frenzy that swept the country and turned many people into day traders.For the most part, initial public offerings have dried up this year in Hong Kong and Shanghai, which were home to some of the world’s biggest initial public offerings in 2006 and 2007.Also, corporate profits are supposed to be hit sharply this year, partly because many companies listed in Shanghai had been booking profits that they had earned outside their regular business, often by trading stocks or playing the market.But China’s markets are used to these boom and bust cycles, which seem more closely tied to investor psychology than to corporate profits.From 2001 to 2005, stock prices fell sharply in China, even though the economy was soaring and profits were relatively strong.Then, China’s market got red hot again, as Beijing pushed the development of the country’s financial markets, and big Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs moved in. A mutual fund bonanza ensued.Once stock prices began soaring in 2006 and 2007, many investors were betting that Beijing would not allow a calamitous fall until after the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, which open in August, fearing such a downturn could produce social unrest.Few, however, expected a sharp selloff to begin in late 2007, when problems began surfacing in the American economy.In lowering the stamp duty on stock trades this week, Beijing essentially reversed a decision last May to increase the stock duty. At that time, the duty had been increased in the hopes of cooling to down a sizzling hot market that the government feared could produce a bubble.'"

Shares jumped across the board and some, including China Life Insurance, the biggest life insurer, rose their 10 percent daily limits.The Shenzhen composite index was up more than 8 percent, and the Hang Sent index was up more than 2 percent.Analysts and fund managers said the reduction in the stamp tax, to 0.1 percent from 0.3 percent, was likely to end a six-month bear market and could bolster stocks by more than 20 percent in coming weeks.The tax cut will make little difference to the investment costs of all but the most active traders. But investors see it as a signal that authorities want to put a floor under the market at about 3,000 points, to prevent a further slide from damaging the economy or possibly even causing social unrest.The index plunged 51 percent from last October’s record peak to Tuesday’s 13-month low of 2,990.788 points, dragged down by high inflation, the possibility of an economic slowdown this year, and heavy supplies of fresh equity.'"

"'08-04-24,'1','Resisting every inch of the way, the powerful National Association of Manufacturers has finally agreed to follow Congress’s new ethics law and disclose which of its members have been funding its lobbying operations on Capitol Hill.Welcome to the sunshine club. Like other lobbying groups, the trade association must disclose to Congress and the taxpayers which of its 11,000 members have been essential to developing lobbying strategies or contributed payments of $5,000 or more each quarter to the effort. Until this week, N.A.M. has refused to do so, arguing that such disclosure somehow violates its privacy rights and its rights to free speech.Tracking the quid pro quo money flow in Washington is an urgent priority and long overdue. Last year, Congress tightened disclosure requirements for lobbyists’ war chests — but only after a raft of scandals. It is encouraging that the courts have so far rejected N.A.M.’s arguments. The law was plainly written to smoke out stealth lobbying organizations, not to protect Washington insiders.Unfortunately, sunshine remains only a sometimes thing in the capital. One of the biggest problems in the midst of this year’s billion-dollar campaign is the failure of the Federal Election Commission to write the rules for what was supposed to be another breakthrough reform: full disclosure of the multiple donations bundled by lobbyists to court candidates.That has been stymied by the tooth-and-claw standoff in the Senate that has left the F.E.C. short four of its six members and without the quorum it needs to do its work. Senate Republicans demand that the F.E.C. vacancies be filled as a package, the better to protect a particularly unqualified party wheelhorse. That means there is no official referee for any of this year’s campaign mayhem. Let the voters beware.'"

Johnson on Wednesday as he stood near the now-abandoned Appalachian front porch where Johnson declared a war on poverty. Forty-four years later, Mr. McCain said, “We have a lot to do.”Mr. McCain, who was on the third day of a weeklong tour of America’s “forgotten places,” held out the promise of better Internet service and job training in community colleges to this economically depressed coal-mining town of less than 650 people.While he offered few other poverty-fighting specifics in a speech that was largely focused on trying to connect to voters in one of the poorest parts of the United States, he sought to project himself to independents and moderate Democrats across the country as a different kind of Republican.His camera crew recorded much of the day for future campaign commercials.“I cannot claim that the circumstances of our lives are similar in every respect,” Mr. McCain told an exuberant crowd packed into an upstairs room of the Martin County Courthouse, which had been painted and freshened up with flowers for the occasion. “I’m not the son of a coal miner.

"'08-04-24,'1','From the United States Football League to the XFL, alternatives to the N.F.L. have traditionally fizzled not long after the first kickoff.But Marvin Tomlin, the founder and chief executive of the prospective United National Football League, says he can beat the odds with a league designed to complement the N.F.L., not compete with it.“I tell everyone that there’s one professional football league, and that’s the National Football League,” Tomlin said. “But in the same place, the N.F.L. does not have a developmental system.”The league, which plans to play its first game in January 2009, would serve as a “minor league” to the N.F.L., Tomlin said, offering a second chance to college players who show promise but are not selected by a team in the N.F.L. or the Canadian Football League. The new league’s season would run from January to April and would serve as a showcase for N.F.L. recruiters, said Tomlin, an entrepreneur based in New Haven. Games would be played in college stadiums, he said.Tomlin said that the league had solidified deals with three owners and that he expected eight teams to be in place by the end of next month. He would not disclose which cities have teams. Buying a franchise costs $1.5 million, which includes salaries for 60 players. The league is expected to announce Thursday the selection of the retired N.F.L. player Joe Cribbs as its commissioner.

"'08-04-24,'1','Ms. Lancaster, the first woman to hold the post, was credited with modernizing the department and developing a new building code, but was facing growing criticism not only for the fatalities but also for embarrassing mistakes on construction permits and inspection oversights.In light of the accidents, the City Council held a hearing last week about construction safety, and plans another on May 6. In addition, two state assemblymen, James F. Brennan and Vito J. Lopez, are holding a hearing Thursday at 250 Broadway.After the city announced the $4 million safety program, Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn praised the mayor for “a much needed investment in the long-term future” of the Buildings Department. But, she added, “The best way to restore the public’s trust in the agency and ensure that all who live and work around construction sites are as safe as possible is to hire an adequate force of well-trained, professional inspectors.”“You can always look at every agency and think that they could do more and that they could use more people,” he said on Wednesday. “The reality of the world is that every agency is probably understaffed, and the taxpayer is probably overtaxed.”The mayor offered a different approach, suggesting that inspectors could “show up at different times, unexpectedly. You change your methods of inspection, of permitting, and there are ways to statistically do an awful lot with a relatively few number of people. The Buildings Department actually does have an awful lot of inspectors.”The department temporarily shut down 8 of the 29 tower cranes in use at construction sites in the city during an inspection sweep that began shortly after the March 15 collapse of a crane on 51st Street at Second Avenue that left seven people dead. Inspectors are now checking the 220 mobile cranes in use in the city.The results of those checks, the city said, “made clear that a thorough review of crane operations and oversight is needed.”The job of running the department, which has stubbornly resisted fixing for more than a century, seems particularly unappealing at the moment, those in development and government circles say, given the string of deaths, accidents and mistakes, and the fact that Mr. Bloomberg is approaching the end of his term.Administration officials are seeking to end the requirement that the commissioner be an architect or engineer in the hope of broadening the applicant pool; the change would also make the acting commissioner, Mr. LiMandri, eligible to continue in the post.Mr. Bloomberg acknowledged the challenge of finding a successor for Ms. Lancaster in his remarks on Wednesday.“Being a commissioner in the city of New York is a really challenging job,” the mayor said, and there are people who enjoy taking on what may seem like “an insurmountable problem,” he said. “Those are the people who take it to the next level.”'"
"'08-04-24,'1','The city’s Department of Investigation hired a law firm, Stier Anderson L.L.C., last year to monitor the progress of the construction. The law firm is now affiliated with Thacher Associates, a fraud detection company. Keith Schwam, a spokesman for the department, said the firm was keeping track “of various contractors, subcontractors and personnel” at the Bronx site.While the plant’s opponents concede that it is too late to stop the work in Van Cortlandt Park, they say that shining more light on the project’s financing will reveal whether there was any wrongdoing in the site selection process.“We were blindsided by the whole thing,” said Karen Argenti, a resident of the Bronx and a longtime opponent of the project. She, like many other residents, says that city officials deliberately underestimated costs to make it seem that building the plant underground in the Bronx would be cheaper than building it above ground on land the city owns in Westchester.“Intuitively, no one ever believed that it could be cheaper to dig a huge hole and build it here,” said Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz of the Bronx, who for more than a decade has fought against putting the plant in the borough. “When we look back at this project years from now, it will rank up there with the Tweed Courthouse as a monument to municipal incompetence and worse.”City officials say the original figure of $660 million was the “roughest of estimates” and should not be used in any evaluation of true costs. They say the starting point should be the $992 million that was included in the project’s final environmental impact statement in 2003.“I can understand how this comes as almost a surprise,” said Steven W. Lawitts, first deputy commissioner of environmental protection.“Unless you spend a good part of your time tracking this market, tracking the trends,” he continued, “it comes across as, and often is portrayed as, the D.E.P. underestimated the project.”Mr. Lawitts said the $992 million estimate was in 2003 dollars, not adjusted for inflation, and was labeled as such in the document.But in several places, the final environmental report, available on the department’s Web site, clearly states that the $992 million estimated cost of building the filtration plant in the park was “based on a 2.75 percent annual inflation rate.” Community residents have accused city officials of deliberately misleading the public with contradictory explanations.Mr. Lawitts said the $992 million construction cost was, in fact, not adjusted for inflation. The annual inflation rate of 2.75 percent was applied to the cost of operating the plant over 30 years. He did concede that charts in the 2003 statement were confusing and that the footnote about the inflation rate was misplaced.But the inflation factor does not fully explain the cost increases. The city’s explanation, outlined in several meetings with Bronx residents in the past year, is that the cost of concrete, steel and other raw materials, and the cost of labor, have gone up by as much as 14 percent since the environmental statement was completed.Mr. Lawitts said that the city has continually updated its estimates, but that no one anticipated the building boom for big projects in the metropolitan region, like the sports stadiums under construction, which has driven up the prices of materials. With four more years of construction ahead, the costs may well continue to rise above even the best estimates now.On the nine-acre construction site, a vast amphitheater has been blasted out of an ancient stone called Fordham gneiss (pronounced nice), which now forms the pit’s 10-story-high walls. Trucks carrying concrete — behemoths when they rumble through city streets — look like toys inside the pit. The pipe that will bring in untreated water from the Croton reservoir system is 12 feet in diameter. The two outflow pipes have 9-foot diameters. The water will be purified in a “stacked dissolved air flotation system”; that, said the project manager, Bernard J. Daly, is standard technology and uses several layers of filters to remove impurities, but is being done here on a gigantic scale.The city was forced to build the plant because water from the Croton watershed did not meet federal standards for safety and purity. Although the Croton system can supply nearly 30 percent of the city’s 1.1 billion gallons a day of drinking water, generally it supplies just 10 percent, mostly in the Bronx and northern Manhattan. The rest of the city’s water comes from the Catskill Mountains and the Delaware River, and is so clean that the city last year won a 10-year exemption from federal regulations requiring that all surface drinking water be filtered.Opponents of the Bronx plant have also expressed concern about the federal indictment in February of a key manager for the Schiavone Construction Company, which was the principal contractor responsible for digging the pit and putting in the water tunnels. The company’s offices were raided by federal agents, who seized files, and the manager, Anthony Delvescovo, was charged with having committed extortion beginning in February 2005 — around the time that work was beginning on the Croton project.Mr. Delvescovo’s lawyer, Avi Moskowitz, said he would fight the charges. “The government has produced hundreds and hundreds of hours of consensually recorded conversation, none of which involve him, and we expect that at the end of the day, when he has his day in court, he will be completely exonerated,” Mr. Moskowitz said.Officials say the indictment of Mr. Delvescovo has not had any effect on the project, and the Schiavone company continues to work on the tunnels.Mr. Dinowitz has called for an independent investigation by the Bronx district attorney and others into every aspect of the filtration plant, saying the cost of the project has a direct impact on water rates. Officials announced this month that they would ask for a rate increase of 14.5 percent, higher than expected, to take effect July 1.“There may be nothing here, but it smells,” the assemblyman said. “And the people who in the end are going to have to pay the price are the ratepayers.”'"

Analysts said iPod sales were within their expectations and that it was a sign that the product category was maturing,“The big question was, would Apple really feel the pinch from a weakening U.S. consumer? And the somewhat unequivocal answer was, no, not yet,” said A. M. Saggonaghi Jr., a senior analyst at Bernstein ResearchApple said that net income in its second quarter rose 36 percent from the year-ago quarter, to $1.05 billion or $1.16 a share, on revenue of $7.51 billion.The results far exceeded the expectations of Wall Street analysts. They had expected $1.07 cents a share and revenue of $6.96 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg.The company, based in Cupertino, Calif., also forecast strong sales in the coming months. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, said the company expected third-quarter revenue of about $7.2 billion and earnings of about $1 a share.Apple’s stock has declined 17.9 percent since the beginning of January when it peaked near $200 a share. After drifting below $120 a share, the stock has begun to recover since March. Shares on Wednesday closed up, rising $2.69 to $162.89, but then declined 26 cents, to $162.63 in after-hours trading over concerns that Apple’s profit margins were weaker than analysts expected.If there is a weak spot in the company’s battle plan, it may be the iPhone smartphone, which has had stellar sales in the United States, but has showed weakness in Europe. Apple said it sold 1.7 million iPhones for the quarter. “In my mind iPhone sales were soft,” said Charles Wolf, a financial analyst at Needham & Company. “It’s a question of the distribution model and of the price. The price clearly has to come down.”Apple’s executives said the sales of iPhones exceeded internal company projections during the quarter.Analysts and the industry are expecting Apple to introduce a higher performing version of the iPhone within the next two months, made for faster 3G data-oriented cellular networks. Mr. Jobs is under pressure to meet his 10 million iPhone sales forecast by the end of 2008. To meet that goal the company needs a second-generation iPhone, and it may also need to push the price of the existing $399 iPhone down significantly or introduce a stripped-down model.Analysts have said that as the second quarter progressed, demand for Apple’s iPhone increased and that the computer maker was unable to keep up with demand. The supply issue could have been affected by the limited availability of 16-gigabyte flash memory chips, Mr. Wolf speculated.He said that the more interesting story for the quarter may be the gains that Apple is making in PC market share, predominantly in the laptop computer segment.International Data Corporation’s survey this month showed Apple with a 6 percent share of the American market in the first quarter, compared with 4.9 percent a year ago. Apple’s strong Macintosh growth comes as Microsoft struggles with its Windows Vista operating system, which was released last year to largely critical reviews. “I think people are really noticing the difference between Mac OS X and Windows to a greater degree than ever before,” Mr. Jobs said. “The more people understand that there is an alternative, the more people are choosing a Mac.”On Wednesday, Apple confirmed that it had acquired PA Semi, a Silicon Valley chip company with expertise in low-power microprocessors, an essential technology for future iPhones. Forbes.com first reported the acquisition, which it said was for $278 million in cash. Neither company disclosed the amount of the deal.The chip maker had originally hoped to supply Apple with chips intended for a microprocessor used in earlier Macintosh computers and by I.B.M. However, when Apple began using Intel microprocessors for the Macintosh, PA Semi was left without a major customer.The decision to buy PA Semi is likely to be a blow to Intel, which recently introduced a new low-power chip called Atom.'"

"'08-04-25,'1','How to show children the hell that awaits them? The nerd-versus-mean-girl dualism that is a staple of adolescent television, film, fiction and life gets a new workout in “The Mighty B!” This smart and amusing animated series, which will be shown on Nickelodeon on Saturdays, features a lisping 9-year-old heroine named Bessie Higgenbottom (Amy Poehler), and her nemesis, a Paris-Hilton-in-training named Portia (Grey DeLisle). But because “B” skews younger, Bessie doesn’t actually know that Portia is her nemesis.Bessie’s passion is her Honeybee troop, and merit badges are the coin of her realm. She is such a dedicated Honeybee that she wears her uniform every day and aims to earn enough merit badges to become a superhero: hence the title. That’s 4,584 badges, but Bessie shows no sign of flagging.In the first of two episodes that compose the half-hour show, Bessie talks — and talks — her weary mother into letting her get a dog so she can enter the troop dog show. An animal-appreciation badge is at stake. This introduces not only Bessie’s younger brother, Ben (Andy Richter), and Happy, the flea-bitten mutt Bessie finds on a street corner, but also, and more important, Bessie’s character. She’s the kind of girl who, even when she loses, makes a heartfelt speech about how much she loves her dog.The second episode involves Bessie’s fervent attempt to grow tall enough to ride a roller coaster. She struts and stretches and performs a rapping pep talk. (Like Ellen DeGeneres, Bessie is an endearingly goofy dancer.) Still she falls short, 1/16th of an inch short, to be exact. The permutations she endures to gain that precious fraction make up some of the show’s most inventive visuals.Nothing comes naturally to Bessie except enthusiasm. She works at things others do intuitively. She practices roller-coaster behavior, complete with bucket, “in the highly unlikely event I have a vomiting episode.” In line for the ride, she anticipates, with Happy, “the moment we’ve been training for.” She continues, “Now we’re probably going to be screaming a lot, so let’s do some vocal warm-ups.”Portia, on the other hand, rarely expends the energy required to smile, and barely notices Bessie. Portia has her own demons, including a striving mother, but she’s the kind of girl most other girls fear and despise.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','ConocoPhillips said on Thursday that its first-quarter earnings rose 17 percent as soaring oil and natural gas prices outweighed weak profits from gasoline production.Oil prices have increased nearly sixfold since 2002 on surging demand from emerging economies, supply concerns and the weak dollar.Net income in the quarter rose to $4.14 billion, or $2.62 a share, from $3.55 billion, or $2.12 a share, in the same period a year ago.Revenue in the quarter rose 33 percent, to $54.88 billion.Excluding one-time items, the company earned about $2.56 a share. Analysts, on average, had expected it to bring in about $2.41 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.Gene Pisasale, who helps manage $12 billion at PNC Capital Advisors, said the company’s exploration and production results were a “blowout,” and made up the difference between the reported results and analyst estimates.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','The diversified manufacturer 3M reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, but its shares fell on investor concern that the weak dollar accounted for too much of the company’s growth.3M, whose products include cellphone circuits and Post-it notes, said foreign currency conversion accounted for 6.1 percentage points of its 8.9 percent rise in quarterly sales.Also, the company backed away from a previous goal of 5 to 8 percent volume growth this year excluding the effect of the weak dollar. It said the goal was unrealistic in “today’s economic world.”Investors scrutinize results from big manufacturers like 3M, which makes products for both industry and consumers, to gain insight into the health of the American economy.The company’s first-quarter net income was $988 million, or $1.38 a share, beating analysts’ average forecast of $1.35 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.

"'08-04-25,'1','American Express, the credit card company, said Thursday that profit declined 6 percent in the first quarter as more cardholders failed to make payments.Like other lenders, American Express has been writing off more loans as unpaid as borrowers in the United States struggle with rising costs, slumping home prices and a less certain job market.However, cardholder spending continues to climb, and strong business abroad has been helping to offset much of the credit problems at home.Net income fell to $991 million, or 85 cents a share, from $1.06 billion, or 87 cents a share, in the year-earlier period, exceeding analysts’ estimates.The company’s total provisions for credit losses were $1.27 billion, a 48 percent increase from the first quarter of 2007.Quarterly revenue climbed 11 percent to $7.2 billion, in line with analysts’ estimates.Profit from United States card services fell 19 percent to $523 million in the first quarter, from $644 million a year earlier.

"'08-04-25,'1','“The strongest argument I have heard for increasing our bid — simply that we can afford to — is not one that I favor,” Mr. Liddell said.Speaking in Milan on Wednesday, Mr. Ballmer held out the possibility that Microsoft might drop its efforts to take over Yahoo if its management continued to spurn the offer.“We are prepared to go forward without a merger,” Mr. Ballmer said.His comment, most analysts say, was probably a gesture intended to put more pressure on Yahoo’s board.A proxy battle for control of Yahoo, analysts say, is a more likely alternative. On April 5, Mr. Ballmer sent a letter to Yahoo’s directors, threatening to oust the board and lower the cash-and-stock offer unless Yahoo started negotiations within three weeks. That deadline is Saturday. Mr. Liddell said the company would decide how to proceed next week.Microsoft had some weak spots in its quarterly performance. Revenue from its Windows personal-computer operating system was somewhat lower than most analysts’ estimates. But Mr. Liddell attributed that to higher demand in developing nations, which are less likely to buy higher-priced versions than developed markets. He also said that piracy has picked up in some Asian markets.Microsoft’s mainstay desktop software, data center software and video game businesses all delivered strong performances. “It was a little weak in the Windows client business, but it was a solid performance overall and the guidance for 2009 was strong,” said Charles di Bona, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.But Microsoft’s shares fell in after-hours trading. Mr. Di Bona said one reason might have been that some investors were expecting that Microsoft would make clear whether it was going to proceed with its Yahoo bid.The stock fell 5 percent in after-hours trading, to $30.20. In the regular session it rose 35 cents to $31.80.Microsoft reported net income for the quarter of $4.4 billion, or 47 cents a share. Profit, as expected, declined from the year-earlier quarter, when the company earned 50 cents a share.A year ago, Microsoft’s net profit was inflated by $1.14 billion because of a one-time surge in revenue, related to coupon programs to cope with delays in the shipment of Windows Vista and Office 2007.Microsoft’s sales rose slightly in the most recent quarter to $14.45 billion, compared with $14.40 billion in the year-earlier quarter.The company’s profits were above the Wall Street consensus estimate of 44 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Financial. Its revenue was a bit below analysts’ estimate of $14.5 billion.For its 2009 fiscal year, starting in July, Microsoft said it expected revenue of $66.9 billion to $68 billion, and earnings of $2.13 to $2.19 a share.The quarterly results underline once again how much the main engines of the company’s performance are its desktop PC products, Windows and Office. Those two big, lucrative businesses are healthy and growing.The two product groups reported total sales of $8.77 billion, accounting for 61 percent of revenue, and operating profits of $6.24 billion, or 86 percent of profits from the business units.The division making server software that runs data centers has become another large and profitable business for Microsoft. It generated revenue of $3.26 billion and operating profits of $1.09 billion.The Xbox video game division, which also includes computer hardware like keyboards and mice, generated solid growth, up 68 percent to $1.58 billion. After years of investment, the game unit is now profitable, reporting operating profits of $89 million.The online business remains a weak spot and a strategic necessity for Microsoft as software shifts away from the PC desktop to be delivered as a service over the Internet. Google and others are offering online software that poses a long-term challenge to Microsoft’s desktop programs.The online business lost $228 million on revenue of $843 million. The revenue got a one-time lift from the inclusion of results from aQuantive, an online ad agency that Microsoft bought last May for $6 billion.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','The Dodgers played it that way Wednesday night in an 8-3 win over Arizona, but games like that have been rare this season.The Dodgers, who entered Thursday night’s game at 9-12 and 6 games behind the National League West-leading Diamondbacks, were off to their worst start through 20 games since 1996.The good news, though, is that this is Los Angeles and the Lakers appear ready for a deep run in the N.B.A. playoffs. Despite the key early-season series against the Diamondbacks, Dodger Stadium was slightly more than half full and one of the night’s loudest cheers came when the halftime score of the Lakers’ game against Denver was flashed on the scoreboard.This should make for a more pleasant honeymoon for Torre, who was cheered lustily when he popped out of the dugout to argue a call.“In New York, you know how it is,” said Dodgers reliever Scott Proctor, a former Yankee. “Everything is blown up 100 times over. If we had a start like this in New York, it wouldn’t be fun. It’s not fun now, but it would be a lot worse.”Here is how bad it has been:The All-Star catcher Russell Martin only this week raised his batting average above .200, first baseman James Loney went through a 2-for-23 slump. And third baseman Garciaparra, who returned from the disabled list last week, was batting .182 going into Thursday night’s game. Jones, the former Braves center fielder who was signed to a two-year, $36.2 million contract, was batting .159 with a team-leading 25 strikeouts.The Dodgers were 13th in the league in runs scored and 12th in home runs. Their leadoff hitter, Rafael Furcal, shared the team lead with three homers.If they win, it will have to be with performances like Wednesday night’s, when they worked deep in counts against Dan Haren and delivered four two-out, two-strike hits — two by Loney and one each by Garciaparra and second baseman Chin-lung Hu, who was filling in for Jeff Kent.Matt Kemp hustled his way into second base for a two-out, run-scoring double, and Torre was aggressive calling for a hit-and-run with two runners aboard. The attempt was foiled when the pitch was fouled off.The Dodgers’ performance came after a 30-minute pregame meeting in which Torre spoke briefly, then let the players talk.“It was just to tell us this is not over,” Loney said. “Just let the main focus be on winning games.” Torre said it would take two months before he had a handle on the club. In the meantime, the players are getting to know him, and what he expects of them. In recent years, the Yankees found themselves in early-season holes against the Red Sox, whom they trailed by 14 ½ games last May 29 before rallying to make the playoffs.“I bite my tongue because I get chewed out when I say wild card because that means you’re not thinking of winning the division,” Torre said. “If you concentrate on your record, you’ll be where you’re supposed to be.”Torre acknowledged that the message was easier to deliver in a veteran clubhouse like the Yankees’. With the Dodgers having so many young regulars — left fielder Andre Ethier, Kemp, Loney and Martin are each 26 or younger — it takes work.Also, if the problems were not solved internally with the Yankees, it was easy to trade prospects and pick up high salaries. Need a left-handed bat? Get Bobby Abreu.If Jones continues to flounder, if Garciaparra or the injured prospect Andy LaRoche cannot stay healthy, or if the Dodgers need more pitching to keep up with the Diamondbacks, how enthusiastically will the Dodgers owner Frank McCourt be to expand his $118 million payroll?And will General Manager Ned Colletti — who has not distinguished himself on the free-agent market with Jason Schmidt, Juan Pierre and Jones — be willing to ship prospects to win now?“Certainly not every ball club has the resources the Yankees have,” Torre said. “The revenue they generate and George has always been that guy who would get you what you needed. I’m convinced that the McCourts certainly have winning in mind. They didn’t bring me out here without trying to win.”That carries two meanings — one in the Bronx and one everywhere else. Now, in this new marriage, Torre is finding out how the other half lives. For better or worse.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','HOUSTON — An aggrieved family in Alice, Tex., got its pet Shih Tzu back on Thursday after a judge ruled that the town’s mayor — now former mayor — had wrongly taken the dog, named Puddles, passing it off as her own Panchito while claiming Puddles had died.“I think a lot of this is just plain ridiculous,” said the judge, Richard C. Terrell of District Court, faulting both the former mayor, Grace Saenz-Lopez, and her neighbors, the original owners, Rudy Gutierrez and Shelly Cavasos, for not resolving the dispute out of court.But Judge Terrell found that Ms. Saenz-Lopez had no business agreeing to take care of the ailing Puddles while the Gutierrez-Cavasos family went on vacation last July, only to tell them that Puddles was dead and buried while she hid the renamed dog with her twin sister, Gracy Garcia.The sisters still face criminal charges, and a hearing is scheduled before Judge Terrell next Tuesday.On the witness stand in a two-hour civil bench trial on Thursday, Ms. Saenz-Lopez acknowledged that she had lied but said it was only to save the pet, which she said she could care for better than its owners and their four young children.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','DETROIT (AP) — Dow Chemical reported a 3 percent drop in first-quarter profit on Thursday because of higher prices for raw materials and energy, but still managed to top Wall Street’s expectations.Net income at Dow Chemical was $941 million, or 99 cents a share, compared with $973 million, or $1 a share, in the period a year earlier.Officials said a $2.2 billion increase in the cost of energy and materials was the largest in the company’s history and equal to the increase it experienced during all of last year.Dow Chemical, based in Midland, Mich., said revenue increased 19 percent, to $14.82 billion, from $12.43 billion. The company said it had 6 percent volume growth in emerging markets and higher growth in China, India, Russia and the Middle East.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial had forecast a profit of 94 cents a share on sales of $13.6 billion.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','PARIS — The Credit Suisse Group, the Swiss banking giant, on Thursday reported a first-quarter loss nearly three times worse than analysts had expected as it wrote down $5.3 billion in soured investments.The bank, based in Zurich, reported a loss of 2.15 billion Swiss francs, or $2.1 billion, in the first quarter, compared with net income of 2.8 billion francs a year earlier.“On balance, I was quite pleased” with the results, said Peter Thorne, an analyst with Helvea in London. “In this market, if an investment bank doesn’t report $20 billion of write-downs, you tend to be quite relieved.”Credit Suisse shares, which have fallen about 30 percent over the last 12 months, rose 2.2 francs, to 54.75 francs, in Zurich.Analysts surveyed by Reuters had expected a loss of about 857 million francs. But predicting bank earnings has become difficult in an environment where many financial institutions have found themselves with risky, hard-to-trade securities on their books.Credit Suisse’s chief executive, Brady W. Dougan, told investors in a conference call the results were “clearly unsatisfactory,” but he said Credit Suisse’s capital position remained strong.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','Ms. Tillion emerged as an important public intellectual in the 1950s and ’60s, when thinkers like Raymond Aron and Jean-Paul Sartre passionately debated the issue of Algeria. She argued that the French had a responsibility not to allow Algerians to sink into poverty, and that they therefore should retain some kind of ties with what was then their colony.But she delved into her past to recall “specters of the Gestapo” in becoming one of the first and loudest voices to protest French torture of Algerian prisoners.As quoted in The New York Times in 1958, Albert Camus, a native Algerian, wrote of Ms. Tillion: “No one, either in Algeria or throughout the world, can henceforth discuss the Algerian problem without having read what an understanding and cultivated woman has written about my misunderstood, desperate native land, now stirred by a heart-rending hope.”Ms. Tillion mined her experiences to write two books on Algeria, three versions of her book on Ravensbrück and an influential study of the condition of women in the Mediterranean world, among many other works. At her death, she was honorary director of the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences in Paris.In recent years, as France still wrestles with ghosts from past wars, she has been the subject of biographies, exhibitions, conferences and films. Her moral authority and clarity of intellect eventually gave her “the status of a sage,” wrote Tzvetan Todorov, a philosopher and student of 20th-century totalitarianism.In an interview with French Politics, Culture and Society in 2004, Mr. Todorov said that whenever he faced a thorny question, he asked himself, “What would Germaine do?”Ms. Tillion was one of France’s most decorated people. Her awards included the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor, which only four other women have received. On her 100th birthday, President Nicolas Sarkozy wrote her a letter expressing “the affection of the entire nation.”Germaine Marie Rosine Tillion was born in Allègre, France, on May 30, 1907. Her father was a judge and her mother was a writer. She studied anthropology at the University of Paris and other schools, and in the 1930s conducted four research missions to study Berbers and other groups in northeastern Algeria.She returned to Paris after Germany invaded France in 1940. She quickly fell in with intellectuals at the Museum of Man who were forming one of the first underground groups to resist the Nazis. Of the four leaders, she was the only one who was not killed.Denounced by a priest, she was deported to Ravensbrück. During short breaks from building a road, she taught other prisoners a course on the history of man. She also painstakingly figured out the precise economics of how the SS profited from slave labor. “Paltry shopkeepers of death,” she called the SS.At night, she scratched into the wall her plan to reform primary education in France after liberation, David Schoenbrun wrote in “Soldiers of the Night: The Story of the French Resistance” (1980).Among Ms. Tillion’s great sorrows was the Nazis’ confiscation of a suitcase with years of anthropological research notes when they arrested her, according to published reports.A greater sorrow was seeing mothers being made to watch the drowning of their babies in buckets, she wrote. When liberated by Russian soldiers in April 1945, she carried undeveloped photos made with a smuggled camera, which she had hidden for years, showing women’s legs scarred by Nazi medical experiments.After the war, Ms. Tillion became a strong spokeswoman for the heroism of Resistance fighters in the face of evidence that many French had collaborated with the occupiers. Two groups of former Ravensbrück prisoners chose her to be their representative at trials of camp administrators.In an interview with the journal History and Memory in 2003, she said criminal trials could not address the acts of those living in a society in which crimes were not an aberration. She said she saw “the deepening of the abyss being dug between what really happened and the uncertain re-presentation we call history.”Ms. Tillion’s biographer, Jean Lacouture, called her a “major witness of our century,” but she was more than a witness. She appealed to François Mitterrand when he was minister of the interior to send her back to Algeria to be an advocate for the people she had studied in remote areas.Her political role grew after unnamed people asked to speak with her about a brochure she had written. Their leader turned out to be Mr. Yacef of Algeria’s National Liberation Front. After they met a second time, the violence stopped, as he had promised, and did not resume until he was arrested.Ms. Tillion, who did not marry or have children, wrote an operetta, “A Camp Worker Goes to Hell,” while in the concentration camp. It was first performed in Paris last year by a professional troupe. She had kept it in a drawer for 60 years because she worried that “people would get the wrong idea and think we were enjoying ourselves.”The sheer darkness of the humor makes that unlikely. A character joked that the camp offers “all the creature comforts — water, gas, electricity — especially gas.”'"
"'08-04-25,'1','Iris Burton, a chorus girl in the 1940s and ’50s who later started a talent agency that represented many of the top juvenile actors in Hollywood, including River and Joaquin Phoenix and Henry Thomas, the wide-eyed little boy in “E.T.: The Extraterrestrial,” died on April 5 in Los Angeles. She was 77.She died of pneumonia at the Motion Picture and Television Country House, a retirement home, said David Permut, a movie producer and longtime friend.“I hate to say it, but kids are pieces of meat,” Ms. Burton said in a 1984 People magazine article about child stars. “I’ve never had anything but filet mignon. I’ve never had hamburger. My kids are the choice meat.”The tough tone was a put-on. In the estimation of Heart Phoenix, the mother of River, Joaquin, Rain and Summer Phoenix, all of whom Ms. Burton represented, “She was like a mother bear when it came to protecting these kids — not just my kids, but all the talent she represented.”Among the other clients (when they were children) of the Iris Burton Agency were Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen; Tori Spelling; Corey Feldman; Kirk Cameron; Candace Cameron; Hilary and Haylie Duff; Kirsten Dunst; Jaleel White, better known as Steve Urkel of “Family Matters”; and Fred Savage of “The Wonder Years.”'"
"'08-04-25,'1','The rapper Snoop Dogg has come up a winner in the latest round of his battle with Britain, The Guardian of London reported. Last year the entertainer, whose real name is Calvin Broadus, was refused a visa for a tour after he and five members of his entourage were arrested during a reported melee at Heathrow Airport in 2006. In January an immigration judge, Nehar Bird, said he had found no evidence that Snoop Dogg was responsible for any public disorder. A video recording of the incident showed that at one point he was entertaining young children; he was twice pushed by a police officer and did not retaliate; he complied with an instruction to lie face down; and he did not resist when handcuffed. The Home Office appealed. On Wednesday a senior immigration judge, George Warr, upheld the January decision. The Home Office has until Wednesday to decide if it will appeal again. Snoop Dogg’s lawyer, Phillip Trott, said, “It has been an appalling waste of public money to pursue this man.”'"
"'08-04-25,'1','An Iraqi-American businessman who was ensnared in — and eventually cooperated with — the sprawling investigation into improprieties in the United Nations’ oil-for-food program was sentenced on Thursday in Manhattan to three years of probation.The businessman, Samir A. Vincent, a naturalized citizen who has long been involved in Iraqi-American affairs, pleaded guilty in 2005 to working secretly on behalf of the Iraqi government to lobby American and United Nations officials about the oil-for-food program. In exchange, he received millions of dollars in concessions to sell Iraqi oil.The oil-for-food program was established in 1996 to help ease the effects on civilians of sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.Although he once faced a maximum sentence of 28 years in prison on the charges, Mr. Vincent avoided prison time, largely because of the substantial cooperation he provided to federal prosecutors investigating the case. He was the chief government witness in the criminal trials of Tongsun Park, a South Korean businessman who was sentenced to three years in prison on charges of trying illegally to influence United Nations officials, and of Oscar S. Wyatt Jr., a Texas oil tycoon, who was sentenced to a year and a day in the case.Standing before Judge Denny Chin, of Federal District Court in Manhattan, Mr. Vincent, 67, said he was “very ashamed” of his actions. He said that his original intention was to help the Iraqi people but that he was “overwhelmed” by the vast sums of money passing through the program.Under the oil-for-food program, Iraq was permitted to sell its oil under the condition that the proceeds be put into a special account the government could use to buy relief supplies for its own population.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','The buyout was a combined stock-and-cash offer. Rusal paid Mr. Prokhorov an unspecified amount of cash and 14 percent of its shares. The closely held Rusal is unlisted.Mining analysts in Moscow said the 25 percent stake was a first step in Mr. Deripaska’s attempt to acquire control of Norilsk. “We assume that Rusal is likely to acquire the 30 percent stake from Potanin,” Dmitri V. Smolin, a metals and mining analyst at the UralSib bank, said in a telephone interview. “Rusal will be the mining champion in Russia with a market capital of more $100 billion.”A combined company, he said, would have projected annual earnings before taxes, interest and amortization of $17 billion. It would become the world’s largest producer of nickel, aluminum and palladium, and be a top 10 producer of copper and platinum.The exact value of the buyout was not disclosed. Based on Norilsk Nickel’s market capitalization, Mr. Prokhorov’s 25 percent stake was worth more than $13 billion.In one sign of the scale of the buyout, a syndicate of Western investment banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, provided a loan supporting the bid, Rusal said in a statement, without revealing its size. The Interfax news agency said that Rusal had borrowed $4.5 billion.In a sign that Mr. Deripaska intends to play an active role in Norilsk’s management and oversight, Rusal announced Thursday that it had nominated four new board members, including Mr. Deripaska.A former nuclear physicist turned post-Soviet corporate raider, Mr. Deripaska has strong ties to the Kremlin and is a grandson of the late President Boris N. Yeltsin by marriage.Mr. Potanin also has ties to power, and has resisted Mr. Deripaska’s efforts to buy the company, in a clash of business titans reminiscent of the struggles for control of privatized assets in the mid-1990s.Metalloinvest, a coal and iron ore mining company owned by Alisher B. Usmanov, an executive allied with Gazprom, the Russian natural gas monopoly, released a statement Thursday saying it would continue negotiations with Mr. Potanin in a rival merger offer.Also on Thursday, Mr. Potanin met with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, though few details were released.Indeed, the struggle may become a first test on economic policy for Mr. Putin’s successor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who will be inaugurated on May 7. Mr. Medvedev, now a first deputy prime minister, has broadly endorsed Mr. Putin’s business policies.This industrial strategy has resulted in the formation of vast monopolies on a nearly Soviet scale. Some 40 state-controlled holding companies have arisen in autos, aircraft manufacturing, oil and natural gas. Mr. Medvedev, in a rare and apparent breach with his boss, has said that Russia would be best served by eventually breaking up such monopolies.In Moscow trading on Thursday, Norilsk shares closed down less than 0.5 percent at 6,763 rubles, or $286.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','The ingredients are many and complex in “bahok,” presented by the Akram Khan Company on Wednesday night at City Center. One of two premieres by Mr. Khan being performed during the troupe’s week at City Center, the piece features dancers from six countries, among them members of the National Ballet of China, who play passengers stranded in the limbo of an airport or train station where all communication has broken down. A timely topic indeed.The 75-minute piece weaves together text, a score by Nitin Sawhney that incorporates Chinese and Indian musical themes, and a chill waiting room designed by Fabiana Piccioli, Sander Loonen and Mr. Khan, dominated by an electronic departures sign whose letters spin out mostly gibberish.But what Mr. Khan himself brings to “bahok,” whose title means carrier in Bengali, is the most important element. Born in London of immigrant parents from Bangladesh, Mr. Khan grew up in a divided world where neither country was home to him. And his influences are not just the traditional Indian Kathak dance but also English modern dance, hip-hop and theatrical work with Peter Brook.“Bahok” represents a shift for Mr. Khan, who has become internationally acclaimed over the last decade or so as a sinuous, meditative solo dancer and more recently as a choreographer of duets and group pieces. He does not appear in the piece, uncharacteristically, but will perform with Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui in “zero degrees” at City Center on Friday and Sunday nights.“Zero degrees” covers some of the same territory as “bahok,” but the duet, which I saw in Barcelona, Spain, last year, is a much more haunting and penetrating work. Mr. Khan has probably never been accused of being unoriginal, but in “bahok” he is, despite the vivid individuality of the performers. Each character has a distinctive personality, among them a lost and confused young woman searching for home, a charming young Chinese woman who tries to befriend her and a perpetually angry young man whose nationality is unclear.The problem is that Mr. Khan and his collaborators do very little that is new or imaginative with an old, old metaphor for anomie. And the decipherable messages that do appear on the board are embarrassingly superficial, among them “air,” “fire,” “water” and “earth” and even a “phone home.” But none of the passengers’ cellphones seem to work, though the disturbed woman does use hers as a remote at one point, to fine effect.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','Whether the most anxious consumers can spring for a relaxing massage is another matter, but a growing number of spas are offering deals to attract customers during tighter times, a trend that may have as much to do with technology as with the economy.“I think the Internet has been kind of a win-win for both spas and consumers,” said Susie Ellis, president of SpaFinder, a Web site that publishes spa reviews and deals.“A lot of spas are just sending certain specials to people who are on their e-mail list,” Ms. Ellis said, adding that many spas use these lists to promote deals that aren’t advertised on their Web sites. Twice a month, SpaFinder also sends out an e-mail newsletter listing specials at various spas.Following the example of airlines and hotels, which have long relied on technology to adjust their prices based on changing supply and demand (a practice called “revenue management”), more spas are using this strategy to beef up their bookings during slow times. For the most part, these deals involve midweek and off-season discounts, last-minute specials and packages that are cheaper than booking several services à la carte.While destination spas have traditionally offered lower room rates Sunday through Thursday or during their low seasons, like summer in a hot climate, these types of discounts are now spreading to treatment prices as well.For instance, the Oasis Day Spa in New York City has been running a Two for Tuesday special for the past two years. Customers who book two 60-minute treatments on a Tuesday, usually a slow day, get the second one for half price. This year, the spa is also doing a Wednesday promotion with selected massages and facials priced at 1998 levels.“We’ve always run specials, but more so now,” said Niki Tortoreti, Oasis Day Spa’s marketing director, noting that Tuesday and Wednesday are now just as busy as Saturday.That’s not marketing hype. I recently took advantage of the Wednesday special to get a 60-minute Swedish massage for just $70. It was a great deal (the regular price is $110) and a great massage, but the relaxation area felt like the waiting room at a crowded doctor’s office, with a dozen people in bathrobes listening for a therapist to pop in and call their name.Sometimes, these midweek discounts are small, like the $15 you can save on a 50-minute massage at the spa at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York City ($195 Monday through Thursday).But when these deals include lodging, the savings can be substantial. Summer rates at the Miraval resort in Tucson, Ariz., are about $200 less than during peak season (about $600 a night, including meals, programs and a $125 spa credit). And when customers bring a friend between June 16 and Sept. 22, they both can save an additional 20 percent off that rate.One of the best current midweek deals is at the Equinox Resort in Manchester Village, Vt. Through May 22, their Cloud 999 special costs $999 and includes three nights of lodging for two people, plus a $999 credit toward spa treatments. (This package is only valid for Sunday through Tuesday arrivals.)There are some tradeoffs with these off-peak specials, like less appealing weather outside the temperature-controlled treatment rooms, or sometimes eerily empty grounds.For instance, I stayed at the Ojai Valley Inn and Resort on the Thursday after Labor Day last September and did not encounter another soul while using the steam room, Jacuzzi and lounge before my massage. At first I felt giddy having the whole place to myself, but by the next morning at the pool, my friend and I were a bit bored by the sparse selection of people to watch. (Yet we only paid $274 for the night, versus the typical weekend rate starting at $400.)Rather than letting rooms remain empty and appointment calendars half-full, some spas are running last-minute specials, usually promoted online or via e-mail newsletters. For instance, the Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah, publishes Last Minute Hot Deals on its Web site, highlighting dates these deals are available during the coming month.A recent offer included lodging, meals, guided hikes, fitness and nutrition classes and use of the resort facilities for $269 a person per night (with a two-night minimum). Most of the March and April dates that qualified for this offer were weekdays, but Easter weekend was also an option.Susie Ellis, SpaFinder’s president, said some spas were even posting deals on-site to fill empty time slots, rather than letting staff they are already paying for the day sit idle.“At the Norwich Inn in Connecticut, they have what they call ‘blackboard specials,’ ” she said, “and I think we’re going to see a lot more of those.”As it turns out, these deals are actually printed on a sheet of paper that is displayed at the spa’s reception desk, not written on a blackboard, and they’re usually only available Tuesday through Thursday, since the spa is typically booked on weekends.The goal is to entice guests who have already booked one treatment to add an extra service for a discounted price, 10 to 35 percent off the regular rate.“It helps us be able to book our therapists when it’s quiet, and secondly, it allows the guests themselves to try something they may not have normally tried,” said Betty Loiacono, the spa’s director. “And that turns into a win-win situation for everyone.”Although Ms. Loiacono mentioned the industry’s traditional aversion to the word “discount,” she described herself as a big believer in revenue management, and is even looking into buying software that would allow the spa to charge different prices for treatments based on the time of day.“With any business, you’re going to have peak times and slower times,” she said. “And if it’s tied to the economy, you need to recognize that as well.”IF your tastes run toward pampering spa surroundings, but your budget doesn’t, there are other ways to economize besides taking time off midweek to snare an off-peak discount.One option is to visit a hotel or resort’s fancy spa just for the day.“At most resort and hotel spas, even with just the cost of one treatment you can stay in the spa and relaxation area pretty much the whole day,” said Julie Sinclair, editor in chief of Spa magazine. “You book the treatment for 2 o’clock and you show up at 10.”I used that strategy to visit the spa at the Breakers Hotel and Resort in Palm Beach, Fla., in March. If you book at least a 50-minute treatment, you can also use the outdoor lap pool and Jacuzzi (both of which overlook the beach), join a yoga class in the courtyard, and use the steam room and sauna.The indoor facilities were disappointing: a steam room that resembled the one at my gym and a surprisingly grim relaxation area with curtains that blocked the ocean view. I also had to ask to use the outdoor pool area, which was the only justification for paying $195 for a 50-minute massage (itself rather mediocre). But that price also included valet parking, normally $30, and the chance to wander the grounds of the historic hotel.At the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass Resort & Spa in Chandler, Ariz., you do not even have to book a treatment to use the spa’s pools, Jacuzzis, steam rooms, saunas and fitness center; hotel guests can buy a day pass for $20 ($35 for nonguests).Another tip is to ask for a discount if you are traveling with a group, even if it is just a few friends.“Almost every spa will do a discount for a group, and the group doesn’t have to be that large,” said Susie Ellis, the president of the Web site SpaFinder.Many other deals are designed for just two people, like the package offered by the Cal-a-Vie spa in Vista, Calif., where the second person gets half off the normal weekly rate of $7,395 during certain weeks. (O.K., so that’s not exactly cheap, but even wealthy spa-goers like to save.)There are also a handful of spas that frequently show up on lists of affordable retreats, like the Oaks at Ojai in Ojai, Calif.; the Red Mountain Spa in St. George, Utah; the New Age Health Spa in Neversink, N.Y.; Ten Thousand Waves in Santa Fe, N.M.; and Rancho La Puerta in Tecate, Mexico, which claims it was “the world’s first destination spa.”SpaFinder lists more than 50 spas in its “affordable” category, which means they typically cost less than $300 a night, and some less than $200.For that price, you generally get a lower staff-to-guest ratio and less luxurious accommodations, which aren’t necessarily as important for this type of vacation.As Ms. Ellis pointed out, “You’re there to exercise and have spa treatments, so you’re not spending a lot of time in your room.”'"
"'08-04-25,'1','NEW ORLEANS — Senator John McCain took direct aim at the Bush administration on Thursday as he stood in the lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, the area hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and declared that “never again will a disaster of this nature be handled in the terrible and disgraceful way that it was handled.”Mr. McCain, who was on the fourth day of a tour of America’s “forgotten places” to try to prove that he is a compassionate Republican, ticked off a long list of mistakes: “There was unqualified people in charge, there was a total misreading of the dimensions of the disaster, there was a failure of communications.”Asked at an outdoor news conference if he traced the failure of leadership straight to the top, Mr. McCain, who has vowed to campaign with President Bush, said, emphatically, “yes.”Before his news conference, Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee, spent about half an hour on a walking tour of rubble and still-dilapidated houses in the Lower Ninth Ward, all recorded by two packed, slow-moving flatbed trucks of reporters and camera crews who rumbled just ahead of the candidate and his wife, Cindy.At least one resident was disturbed by all the media attention, particularly by the lack of seats for local residents at Mr. McCain’s 20-minute news conference. “We need to have an opportunity to have a meaningful dialogue,” said Mary Fontenot, who is with All Congregations Together, a church group working to rebuilding New Orleans. “Twenty minutes out on the lawn does not suffice, with a designated seating for traveling journalists.”Later, at the beginning of a town-hall-style meeting in Xavier University, the nation’s only predominately black Roman Catholic university, Mr. McCain repeated his vow that his White House would not repeat the Bush administration’s performance in Katrina. “I promise you, never again,” he said.'"
"'08-04-25,'1','Mr. McCain has condemned the government’s handling of the hurricane in the past, including the actions of Congress, which he did again Thursday. But he has not used such sharp language, and not in the Lower Ninth Ward during a presidential campaign with a phalanx of reporters and camera crews in tow.Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, made his remarks toward the end of his tour of “America’s forgotten places.” Through the week, he has gone to regions rarely visited by Republican candidates, including Appalachia and the Black Belt of Alabama, and has sought to project himself to moderates, independents and swing voters as a different kind of Republican from the one who now occupies the White House.Before his news conference, Mr. McCain, of Arizona, spent about a half hour on a walking tour of rubble and still-dilapidated houses in the Lower Ninth Ward, all recorded by two packed slow-moving flatbed trucks of reporters and camera crews who rumbled just ahead of the candidate and his wife, Cindy.Democrats immediately criticized Mr. McCain as grandstanding and portraying himself as a hero of the Gulf Coast.“Touring the Ninth Ward with reporters can’t hide the fact that John McCain voted against billions of dollars in Katrina recovery efforts,” Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement.In May 2006, Mr. McCain was among 21 Republicans to vote against a bill that included $29 billion for Gulf Coast hurricane recovery; it passed the Senate with 71 votes in favor. His campaign responded that he opposed the bill because of unnecessary spending in it and that he was committed to the recovery of New Orleans.Mr. McCain made his first trip to New Orleans after the hurricane in March 2006 and called for more federal money for Louisiana’s housing recovery than the $4.2 billion that had already been supported by Mr. Bush.“I am for doing what is necessary — $4.2 billion, $10.5 billion, $50.5 billion,” Mr. McCain said at the time. “The $4.2 billion is not the end of the requirement.”Mr. McCain made his first comments about the hurricane as a presidential candidate last April, when he announced in Portsmouth, N.H., that he was running for office.“When Americans confront a catastrophe, natural or man-made, they have a right to expect basic competence from their government,” Mr. McCain said in New Hampshire, adding that “they won’t accept government’s failure to deliver bottled water to dehydrated babies or rescue the infirm from a hospital with no electricity.”In his much more pointed remarks on Thursday, Mr. McCain offered no specific programs or dollar figures for rebuilding New Orleans, although he repeated a theme of his campaign that often-incompetent and unwieldy government agencies would do better to work with private enterprise in recovery efforts like the one on the Gulf Coast.“At both the state and federal level, government has been known to act in an arbitrary, inflexible, and irresponsible manner, indifferent to the wishes of the people it is supposed to serve,” Mr. McCain said Thursday at a dinner in Baton Rouge, La. “Too often, too often, government has its own peculiar way of doing things, following practices that in the private sector would invite financial ruin or worse.”Mr. McCain then proposed that companies should be called in to work with the Federal Emergency Management Agency at times of crisis. “At any given moment, UPS, FedEx and Wal-Mart can tell you in real time where a package is anywhere in the world,” he said. “But FEMA, when it mattered most, often couldn’t even locate its own assets or its own people.”In the Lower Ninth Ward, Mr. McCain toured about a dozen blocks with Gov. Bobby Jindal, a Republican, as well as community pastors and a large crowd of local residents in his wake. Reporters were transported a few paces ahead of Mr. McCain.At least one citizen was disturbed by all the news media attention, particularly by the absence of seats for local citizens at Mr. McCain’s 20-minute news conference. “We need to have an opportunity to have a meaningful dialogue,” said Mary Fontenot of All Congregations Together, a church group working to rebuild New Orleans. “Twenty minutes out on the lawn does not suffice, with a designated seating for traveling journalists.”Later, at the beginning of a town-hall-style meeting in Xavier University, the nation’s only predominately black Roman Catholic university, Mr. McCain repeated his pledge that his White House would not repeat the Bush administration’s performance after Hurricane Katrina.'"

"'08-04-26,'0','“Sorry that things are going the way they are,” he said. “I never mean to hurt nobody’s feelings.”Howard apologized “to my organization and to my fans,” and said the issue was behind him. “Take care of it when time permits,” he added. When reporters pressed him about the timing of his disclosure, a team official motioned for Howard to stop taking questions on the issue.“It’s over with now,” Howard said. “Let’s try and talk about basketball.”For the first time in a week, basketball was a pleasant subject for the Mavericks. Dirk Nowitzki had a huge night, with 32 points, 19 rebounds and 6 assists. Jason Terry, making his first start of the series, scored 22 points and led a renewed defensive effort against Chris Paul, the Hornets’ wunderkind point guard.After dominating the first two games, Paul and forward David West combined to go 10 for 28 from the field Friday. Paul finished with 16 points and 10 assists — a solid line, but not as good as his previous efforts.“We didn’t shut down Chris Paul,” Dallas Coach Avery Johnson said. “He missed a few shots.”Johnson was similarly reserved in assessing his team’s victory. “We weren’t as much out of kilter as we were in Game 2,” he said.Dallas won the rebounding battle, scored 23 fast-break points and — indicative of a newfound aggression — enjoyed a huge advantage in free-throw attempts (38 to 13). Still, the Hornets cut a 17-point deficit to 7 with just over two minutes to play. Terry hit a 3-pointer, and Nowitzki and Howard followed with midrange jumpers to secure the victory.“They came out with a Game 7-type mentality,” Scott said. “I thought our guys came out with just a Game 3 mentality.”The Hornets’ best player on Friday was the backup guard Jannero Pargo, who scored 30 points to keep them in the game.After the week they endured, the Mavericks seemed fortunate just to be in the series.Howard’s admission of drug use came Friday afternoon, during an interview with Michael Irvin, the former Dallas Cowboys receiver. Irvin hosts a program on the local ESPN radio affiliate.“Most of the players in the league use marijuana, and I have and do partake in smoking weed in the off-season sometimes,” Howard said. “That’s my personal choice and my personal opinion, but I don’t think that’s stopping me from doing my job.”Howard was merely repeating comments attributed to him that were published in The Dallas Morning News last weekend. That article drew little notice. But the radio interview became a national story and threatened to undermine the Mavericks’ already-shaky prospects.Johnson withheld judgment on the substance of Howard’s remarks, but his displeasure in their timing was clear. “It’s what I call poor timing and poor judgment,” he said before the game.It is unclear how N.B.A. officials will treat the matter. Marijuana is on the league’s list of banned substances, and all players are randomly tested four times a season. League policy prohibits officials from commenting on the drug program — even, apparently, when a player admits his use publicly.“We don’t comment on specifics of our anti-drug program,” the N.B.A. spokesman Tim Frank said.Before Howard made his comments, it was Stackhouse who had caused a ruckus.“I don’t think Byron Scott is the best coach,” Stackhouse said during a Wednesday night program, according to The Fort Worth Star-Telegram. “I don’t think he’s the best guy to deal with — you know what I’m saying — from some things that I’ve heard from other players and just some dealings that I had with him earlier in the season.”Stackhouse described a testy exchange he had with Scott during a game this week and called him “a sucker in my book.”“You see me laughing about it, right?” he said. “It’s no big deal.”Game 4 is here Sunday night. Presumably, everyone will refrain from radio interviews in the meantime.'"
"'08-04-26,'0','LOS ANGELES (AP) — Joy Page, the stepdaughter of Jack L. Warner, a president of the Warner Brothers studio, who made her film debut as a Bulgarian newlywed in “Casablanca,” died on April 18 in Los Angeles. She was 83.The cause was complications of a stroke and pneumonia, said her son, Gregory Orr.Born on Nov. 9, 1924, in Los Angeles, Ms. Page was the daughter of the silent-film star Don Alvarado (also known as Don Page) and Ann Boyar, who married Mr. Warner after she and Mr. Alvarado divorced.A dark-haired beauty, Ms. Page was 17 and a high school senior when she got the role of Annina Brandel in the 1942 Warner Brothers classic “Casablanca,” starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.Mr. Warner had taken home a draft of the film script. Ms. Page’s acting coach suggested she read for the part of the bride, who faces having to sleep with the corrupt police captain played by Claude Rains to obtain exit visas to escape from Casablanca to America. Bogart, as the owner of Rick’s Café Américain, lets her husband win at roulette so he can buy the visas.Mr. Orr said that while Mr. Warner liked Ms. Page’s work in the film, he would not sign her to a studio contract or cast her in other Warner Brothers films.Her other films include “Kismet” (1944) and “Man-Eater of Kumaon” (1948).In 1945, she married the actor William T. Orr, who later headed the Warner Brothers television department. She retired from acting in 1962. The couple divorced in 1970.'"
"'08-04-26,'0','But Mr. McCain’s campaign camera crew savored the pictures — scenes of Mr. McCain with the quilters of Gee’s Bend, Ala., were on his campaign Web site within 24 hours — and he himself clearly savored his journey to the Democratic base when the base seems so fractured.Still, Mr. McCain was reluctant to say that he had won an inch of his opponents’ ground, or that he was the benefactor in the fight between Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois that went another round in the Pennsylvania primary on Tuesday.“I saw several pundits again saying this keeps the Democratic Party engaged and involved and registering voters, etc. etc.,” Mr. McCain told reporters on his campaign bus on Wednesday morning, en route to Inez.“I am the least objective observer of this process of the people that you interview, so it’s hard for me to know.”Johnson was in Inez in 1964 to make his anti-poverty speech, and more recently, former President Bill Clinton and John Edwards, then a Democratic presidential candidate, visited the region. Many residents resent Washington politicians racing through on poverty tours, and so Mr. McCain was asked as his bus rumbled through the Appalachian hills if he worried that there might be a perception of condescension to his trip.“Well, let me say that of course I didn’t grow up in rural Kentucky,” Mr. McCain responded, with the beginning of an edge in his voice. “But anybody that alleges that the family members of junior naval officers have some kind of privileged existence, that’s abysmal ignorance. My family moved all over this country, was dislocated time after time. My father was gone all during World War II, during a good part of Korea, during a good part of his career, where he was serving this nation. So to somehow in all due respect, to say that I led some kind of a privileged existence— —”Mr. McCain kept going. “I’ve traveled all over this country, I’ve traveled all over this world, I’ve seen poverty, I’ve seen deprivation, I’ve seen death,” he said. Then he seemed to catch himself. “I’m not sure I really responded,” he said.When the question was asked again, Mr. McCain changed his tone. He said he did not want to be “just another politician that parachutes in, and then leaves.” And so, he said, “I promise to come back as president of the United States.”Mr. McCain’s growing news media contingent was loaded onto two Army flatbed trucks and driven in front of the candidate on Thursday morning as he went on a walking tour of the Lower Ninth Ward of New Orleans, the area hardest hit by Hurricane Katrina. The spectacle was perhaps not the man-of-the-people image that the campaign had in mind, but one aide was pleased.“You guys look like refugees,” said Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s longtime adviser, surveying the crammed reporters and camera crews lurching along under the New Orleans sun. “Excellent.”Later, at the town-hall-style meeting at Xavier, Mr. McCain was asked by an audience member about the Rev. John C. Hagee, who has also been criticized by Roman Catholics for comments about their church and by some Jews for his views on Israel.“When someone endorses me, that does not mean that I embrace their views,” Mr. McCain responded.He was more emphatic to reporters on his bus the same day about the idea that Hurricane Katrina was punishment for the sins of New Orleans. “It’s nonsense, it’s nonsense, it’s nonsense, it’s nonsense, it’s nonsense,” Mr. McCain said.And He Shall Receive?One lesson of Mr. McCain’s tour, however it may help or not politically, may simply be that 90 percent of life is showing up.On Monday, as the Gee’s Bend quilters serenaded Mr. McCain, who seemed both touched and a little embarrassed, on a ferry ride across the Alabama River, Ralph W. Ervin, the circuit clerk of Wilcox County, a delegate pledged to Mr. Obama, stood near the prow and told a reporter he was pleased to see the presidential candidate of the Republican Party.“The reason that people of color don’t vote for Republicans is that they don’t ask,” Mr. Ervin said.'"
"'08-04-26,'0','The right-hander Jonathan Albaladejo was recalled to replace Bruney, who was 1-0 with a 1.59 earned run average in nine games. Another reliever, Chris Britton, was also added to the roster, but he may head back to Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on Saturday when the Yankees promote Shelley Duncan.Duncan, who did not start for Scranton on Friday, will round out the Yankees’ bench, which was down to three players. Duncan, who may start this weekend against the Indians’ left-handers, hit .309 with 6 homers and 17 runs batted in for Scranton.The veteran catcher Chad Moeller was designated for assignment Friday to make room for Britton. Moeller said that if another major league team did not claim him, he would accept an assignment to Scranton.RODRIGUEZ BACK AT THIRD Alex Rodriguez returned to the lineup at third base after missing three games with a strained right quadriceps muscle. Rodriguez ran football passing routes in the outfield before batting practice — a standard part of his pregame routine — and Joe Girardi inserted him in the cleanup spot, telling Rodriguez to be smart when running the bases.KENNEDY’S PUZZLING OUTING In Ian Kennedy’s first start, he nibbled at the edges of the strike zone and threw more balls than strikes.He vowed to change his approach in his next start, when almost two of every three pitches were strikes.But Kennedy regressed badly last week in Baltimore, again throwing more balls than strikes as he failed to trust his stuff and attack the strike zone.The effort was puzzling to Kennedy, who starts Saturday and is 0-2 with a 9.64 E.R.A.“You kind of think, I just did it, why did I go back to where I was in my first start?” Kennedy said. “It’s something I’ve thought about — attacking the zone — and I’ve done it in my bullpens. It’s just a matter of not trying to be so perfect.”Kennedy got six days to rest after his last start, plenty of time for well-meaning people to offer advice.The advice that mattered most came from Joe Girardi, who has not pulled Kennedy aside but has made it clear he expects a more aggressive approach against the Indians.“He knows what I expect,” Girardi said. “Ian’s a bright kid.”FARNSWORTH’S NEW GAME Kyle Farnsworth, an avid hunter, was in his element in the clubhouse Friday. The Indians have installed two stand-up arcade games — one for golf, which did not interest Farnsworth, and one called “Big Buck Hunter Pro,” which he played with delight.Teammates and reporters came by to watch Farnsworth skillfully wield a green plastic rifle at unsuspecting deer and possum.

"'08-04-26,'0','Speechless, I went to the riverbank and looked at the horizon to see if I could spot the helicopters. The sky was blue and cloudless. I saw nothing. Years later, I learned that I had been looking in the wrong direction. The helicopters had flown westward toward the Gulf of Thailand. And I was looking east.I was 30 minutes late. My life was going to change forever.Everyone in the city was in a very somber mood. We prayed that our beloved country would return to the peaceful and stable life of the 1960s. What would happen to us now that the United States had closed its embassy? Two days earlier, President Gerald Ford had announced: “The situation in South Vietnam and Cambodia has reached a critical phase requiring immediate and positive decisions by this government. The options before us are few, and the time is very short.”Five days later, on April 17, I stopped at a street-side restaurant to have a bowl of Phnom Penh noodles. A waiter took my order in Khmer and shouted in Cantonese loudly enough to be heard all the way to the kitchen: “One bowl of Kuytiev Phnom Penh, no MSG, no fat, blanched bean sprouts, hot tea for the skinny guy with glasses, white shirt, dark pants, table 13!” A different waiter brought my noodles in less than three minutes. Not once had they got the order wrong. It was going to be my last proper breakfast in Cambodia.I had read gruesome descriptions of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge against enemies of their revolution: babies thrown into the air and caught with a bayonet, children smashed into trees, villagers having their throats cut with the thorns of palm branches, merchants clubbed to death with the back of a hoe. I did not believe them.The street was lined with city residents, a few still wearing the kramas and sarongs they had slept in. One was brushing his teeth. But all were looking north, waiting for something. They looked fearful.I spent all day in a temporary emergency room in the Hotel Le Royal doing what I could to help. I came out for fresh air and saw the Khmer Rouge being welcomed. People seemed genuinely happy that the war had ended.Later that day, the first day of “peace,” I and 15 of my family members left our home after the Khmer Rouge had ordered all cities immediately emptied, and walked to Pochentong, the village where my siblings and I were born. Our house was occupied by strangers, so we went to the temple. The monks were already gone and there were bodies lying around. Mother was sobbing. The women and girls in our family were choking back tears. The boys and men were all silent.Shortly thereafter, I was separated from my family by the Khmer Rouge. After a year in slave labor camps, where I survived two death sentences, I escaped to Thailand. Following a few months in a Thai jail, in a Buddhist temple and in a refugee camp, I arrived in Wallingford, Conn., with $2 in my pocket. I later learned I was the only survivor in my close family. The Khmer Rouge had killed everyone else.Cambodia today is not unlike the Cambodia of my youth — there is deep poverty and enormous wealth, side-by-side. There is unrest beneath the surface, the unrest that helped to make the horrors of the last century possible. And so, as I walk from one memory-filled place to another, I pray for a new year in which Cambodia’s leaders will find a way to bring about peace and stability. And, of course, I pray for my family.'"
"'08-04-26,'0','Russell Thomas Jr., a professor and director of jazz ensembles at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss., said, “It gave the students a chance to hone their skill and see outstanding musicians that they wouldn’t see otherwise.” After meeting musicians like Donald Byrd, Jimmy Heath and Jackie McLean, he said, he found it easier to recruit them for clinics and concerts.Not all the conventions have been well attended. Despite a poor turnout in Toronto in 2003, the group’s annual event returned there in January, and attendance was down by 40 percent from the previous year, according to last week’s e-mail message. Not long after that, Bill McFarlin, the organization’s executive director for 24 years, left for another job.As word of the organization’s bankruptcy, a Chapter 7 liquidation, traveled throughout the jazz world, the reaction was mixed. Some had heard reports of overspending and had long felt that the organization’s ambitions were too big for its means. Still, many people seemed stunned by the speed and finality of its implosion.In early April, Chuck Owen, the president of the organization’s board, sent an e-mail message to the organization’s members, asking them each to pay $25 to help cover debts. That fund drive produced $12,000, according to the group’s recent message, but the debt was “in the million-dollar range,” said Alan Bergman, its legal counsel.The organization’s most recent available financial records, from 2005-6, show a deficit of $90,000, although two years earlier its revenues were in the black. The group also published a bimonthly magazine, Jazz Education Journal, but it depended almost solely on the conventions to cover its operating costs.Last year’s convention, held in Manhattan, attracted nearly 8,000 attendees and vendors, many of them paying a $250 registration fee. But the event moved back to Toronto this year, Mr. McFarlin said in an interview last week, because the hotels and convention center that housed it could write off the penalties owed from the poor performance of the convention there in 2003. This year, he said, the combination of the weak American dollar and expensive air fares dissuaded attendance and brought down the association.People within the group also point to its failed fund-raising efforts as a major reason for its implosion. It had sought to create an endowment — “a war chest for jazz,” Mr. McFarlin called it — with the Campaign for Jazz, a drive begun in 2006 whose costs, Mr. Owen said, “greatly exceeded the cash that was received.” It sought to raise $8 million to $13 million, but far less than that was pledged, and some of the money — including $1 million promised by a Los Angeles entrepreneur — never materialized.There has been speculation since the April 18 announcement, on Web sites and blogs, that Mr. McFarlin had stepped down because he knew that the association was on the verge of collapse. He denied this, saying that he left because he “needed a break” after more than 20 years of service.“If I had known,” he said, “I would have tried to stay and work fervently to try and sustain the organization. It was our life’s work.”The cause of the crisis, said Laura Johnson, a board member and treasurer for the last two years, was “the accumulation of the debt incurred by the campaign” and the last conference. “We hadn’t realized early enough just how striking that amount was. We knew that there was a hole there, but we had no idea it was the size that it was.”Ricky Schultz, a former record executive, current jazz industry consultant and longtime member, said, “It was absolutely shocking to see this well-established organization that had a lot of support just pull the plug.” He added, “A million dollars in red ink is not a crazy, insurmountable amount of money.”The group’s board filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Mr. Bergman said, “because we have outstanding obligations which we do not have money to pay, and we’ll probably be sued by creditors.” He added that “if someone were to come along and give money, it might still be possible to convert to Chapter 11.”The prominent jazz composer Maria Schneider said, “The old jazz culture doesn’t exist anymore,” adding that jazz is dependent on “educational institutions, for better or worse.” In her own case, Ms. Schneider’s career was given a major boost when she won a prize commission from the group in the early 1990s and played the work at the conference. That performance resulted in residencies and clinics at schools, as well as greater industry and critical recognition.“The saddest part about this,” Ms. Schneider said, “is that for a lot of young musicians, the I.A.J.E. conference is a place where they perform to professionals in the audience. You hear some kid get up and take a solo, and you say, ‘Oh, my God, who’s that?’ ”'"

"'08-04-26,'0','Lilly Ledbetter was a supervisor at a Goodyear Tire plant in Gadsden, Ala., for almost 20 years — the only woman who ever managed to stick it out in what was not exactly a female-friendly environment. When she was near retirement, she got an anonymous letter listing the salaries of the men who held the same job. While she was making $3,727 a month, the lowest paid man, with far less seniority, was getting $4,286.“I was just emotionally let down when I saw the difference,” she said on Friday.The company declined Ledbetter’s offer to settle for the difference between her earnings and that lowest-paid man’s — about $60,000. A jury awarded her $223,776 in back pay and more than $3 million in punitive damages.Goodyear appealed, and the case arrived at the Supreme Court just as President Bush’s new appointees were settling in. The court ruled 5-to-4 against Ledbetter, saying that she should have filed her suit within 180 days of receiving her first paycheck in which Goodyear discriminated against her.The fact that workers generally have no idea what other people are making when they start a job did not concern the court nearly as much as what Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, called “the burden of defending claims arising from employment decisions that are long past.” In other words, pay discrimination is illegal unless it goes on for more than six months.Ledbetter did not even get her back pay. And Goodyear billed her $3,165 for court-related costs.The bill being voted on this week would have made it clear that every time a woman like Ledbetter got a check that was lower than those of the men doing the same job, it triggered a new 180-day deadline. That was the status quo before Alito and John Roberts arrived on the scene. But the sponsors needed 60 votes, and they only got 56. “I would never have believed this in the United States of America,” said Ledbetter, 70, who watched from the Senate gallery.McCain’s vote wouldn’t have made any difference. But his reaction does suggest that on his list of presidential priorities, the problems of working women come in somewhere behind the rising price of after-dinner mints.Having delivered his objections to the Ledbetter bill this week, McCain went on to tell reporters that what women really need is “education and training, particularly since more and more women are heads of their households, as much or more than anybody else. And it’s hard for them to leave their families when they don’t have somebody to take care of them.”Maybe George Bush isn’t all that incoherent after all.Was McCain saying that it’s less important to give working women the right to sue for equal pay than to give them help taking care of their families? There have been many attempts to expand the Family and Medical Leave Act to protect more workers who need to stay home to take care of a sick kid or an ailing parent. “We’ve never gotten his support on any of that agenda,” said Debra Ness, the president of the National Partnership for Women and Families.We also have yet to hear a McCain policy address on how working mothers are supposed to find quality child care. If it comes, I suspect the women trying to support their kids on $20,000 a year are going to learn they’re in line for some whopping big income-tax deductions.'"

But Bob Kinnear, president of the Amalgamated Transit Workers Union local that represents the Toronto employees, said “threats and abuse” from passengers had prompted an immediate strike.“We have assessed the situation and decided that we will not expose our members to the dangers of assaults from angry and irrational members of the public,” he said in a statement.Dalton McGuinty, the premier of Ontario, has scheduled an unusual Sunday session of the provincial legislature to introduce back-to-work legislation.

"'08-04-27,'0','Fiscal monitors say it is harder to compute the effect of the Democratic candidates’ measures because they are more intricate. They estimate that, even taking into account that there are some differences between the proposals by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, the impact of either on the deficit would be less than one-third that of the McCain plan.The centerpiece of Mr. McCain’s economic plan is a series of tax cuts that would largely benefit corporations and the wealthy. He is calling for cutting corporate taxes by $100 billion a year. Eliminating the alternative minimum tax, which was created to apply to wealthy taxpayers but now also affects some in the middle class, would reduce revenues by $60 billion annually. He also would double the exemption that can be claimed for dependents, which would cost the government $65 billion.“High tax rates are driving many businesses and jobs overseas — and, of course, our foreign competitors wouldn’t mind if we kept it that way,” Mr. McCain said, laying out his economic plan this month in Pittsburgh. “We’re going to get rid of that drag on growth and job creation.”On the expenditure side, Mr. McCain has called not only for continuing an open-ended deployment of troops in Iraq, but also for spending $15 billion annually to expand the Army and the Marine Corps and to improve health care for veterans, among other programs.Mr. McCain’s advisers have said the new tax cuts would be paid for by eliminating earmarks and making large spending cuts, but they have not identified specifics. And they have spoken vaguely about making entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare less costly for the government. Mr. McCain’s chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said the campaign had simply presented its vision of what the tax code should look like and noted that some of the proposals would be phased in.“I think what they ought to do is remember that the proposals are going to engender economic growth, which is the best thing you can do for near-term budget improvement,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin said, adding that Mr. McCain believed spending restraint was possible.That vision for the tax code includes making permanent the Bush tax cuts, set to expire in 2010, which Mr. McCain once opposed in part because they were not accompanied by sufficient spending cuts.“I voted against the tax cuts because of the disproportionate amount that went to the wealthiest Americans,” Mr. McCain said in 2004. “I would clearly support not extending these tax cuts in order to help address the deficit.”In 2001 and 2003, Mr. Bush pushed through Congress tax cuts totaling nearly $2 trillion. The first set lowered income and estate taxes, and the second focused mostly on capital gains and dividends.The McCain campaign does not figure the costs of extending the tax cuts into its deficit projections, although the Congressional Budget Office estimates that it would cost an extra $2.2 trillion over the next decade.When Mr. McCain outlined his tax cut plan, he backed away from his pledge to balance the budget during his first term, but said that he would do so by the end of his second term. And in an interview last Sunday on “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on ABC, Mr. McCain said he would push ahead with his tax cuts even if Congress did not approve his spending cuts.Some conservative economists say that increased deficits in the short run are an acceptable tradeoff for tax cuts that they say will promote economic growth in the long run. And many liberal economists say that some of the Democratic spending proposals, like addressing the affordability of health care or improving education, are long-overdue investments that pay off handsomely even if they entail more red ink.Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton have acknowledged that their various new programs would be costly but have outlined how to pay for them. But some fiscal monitors say they may be relying on overly rosy projections of how much savings their proposals would actually yield.Mrs. Clinton has calculated that her universal health care plan would cost about $110 billion a year, while Mr. Obama’s somewhat more modest proposal would cost up to $65 billion annually, his advisers say. Both candidates have also talked of new government incentives and investment to encourage the development of alternative sources of energy, which would cost about $15 billion a year.The Democratic candidates have suggested that they could finance these and other programs by allowing parts of the Bush tax cuts to expire. That, however, ignores projections of the Congressional Budget Office, which has already assigned those savings to deficit reduction.In other words, unlike Mr. McCain, both Democrats say they would revoke the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. “At a time of war and economic hardship, the last thing we need is a permanent tax cut for Americans who don’t need them and weren’t even asking for them,” Mr. Obama said.But they would retain those reductions meant to benefit poor and “middle-class” families, which they defined as the 97 percent or so of the population that lives on less than $250,000 a year, and they would count the estimated $50 billion generated by higher taxes on the wealthy as new revenue.“Remember, you can only use this money once,” said Mr. Bixby of the Concord Coalition, “and with all the Bush tax cuts scheduled to expire, that money is already scheduled to come into the Treasury. But on the campaign trail, this has become a source of new spending.”Mrs. Clinton’s aides have been perhaps the most specific in explaining how they would offset the costs of their proposals, and her campaign speaks of moving toward balanced budgets. “We’re not going into debt for the war in Iraq and tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans,” Mrs. Clinton has said, “but instead we are taking care of the needs of our people at home.”Regarding gas taxes, Mr. McCain has proposed a one-time “tax holiday” for the summer. Mrs. Clinton also calls for suspending it in a new advertisement in Indiana, while Mr. Obama says that is a “bad idea” but opposes any increase in the tax.On the spending side, Mr. Obama has argued that ending the Iraq war is one way to pay for some of the new programs, including creating a national infrastructure investment bank and increasing the foreign aid budget. But such savings, which Mrs. Clinton does not count on, would not immediately make their way into the Treasury, and some experts say it is not clear whether they would be sufficient to finance all the programs Mr. Obama has enumerated.Mr. Obama has talked of spending that money on a variety of initiatives whose costs amount to about one-third of the war’s estimated annual cost of $150 billion. “It is clear that there ought to be some distinction between a candidate who says a withdrawal should start immediately and a candidate who says let’s maintain the war at the highest level,” said Austan Goolsbee, Mr. Obama’s senior economic adviser.The fiscal outlook has been made even murkier by the explicit “no new taxes for the middle class” pledge that both Democratic candidates made at their debate in Philadelphia this month, exempting taxpayers making $250,000 a year or less from new levies.Hearing such a promise “makes you very sad,” said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Center. “First of all, we don’t have enough revenue coming in to pay our bills.” In addition, he said, the notion that all the revenue that would be lost in a middle-class tax freeze can be made up by higher taxes on the wealthy “is not tenable.”'"
"'08-04-27,'0','The price of household necessities has surged, with milk topping $4 a gallon in many stores and regular gasoline closing in on $3.60 a gallon nationwide.Home prices are sliding, wages are stagnant, job losses are growing and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, a broad measure of stock performance, is down 6 percent in the last year. So consumers are going on a recession diet.Burt Flickinger, a longtime retail consultant, said the last time he saw such significant changes in consumer buying patterns was the late 1970s, when runaway inflation prompted Americans to “switch from red meat to pork to poultry to pasta — then to peanut butter and jelly.”“It hasn’t gotten to human food mixed with pet food yet,” he said, “but it is certainly headed in that direction.”Retail sales figures and consumer surveys confirm that Americans are strategically cutting corners, whether it is at the coffee house or the airport. (In: brewing coffee at home and flying coach. Out: Starbucks and first class.)In March, Americans spent less on women’s clothing (down 4.9 percent), furniture (3.1 percent), luxury goods (1.3 percent) and airline tickets (1.1 percent) compared with a year ago, according to MasterCard SpendingPulse, a service of the credit card company that measures spending on 300 million of its cards and estimates purchases with other cards, cash and checks.Wal-Mart Stores reports stronger-than-usual sales of peanut butter and spaghetti, while restaurants like Domino’s Pizza and Ruby Tuesday have suffered a falloff in orders, suggesting that many Americans are sticking to low-cost home-cooked meals.Over the last year, purchases of brand name cookies and crackers have fallen, according to Information Resources, which tracks retail sales.Sales of Nabisco graham crackers have dropped 7.5 percent, and Keebler Fudge Shoppe cookies have slipped by 12.3 percent. Not even beer is immune. Sales of inexpensive domestic beers, like Keystone Light, are up; sales of higher-price imports, like Corona Extra, are down, the firm said.Some are skipping drinks altogether. The number of people ordering an alcoholic drink fell to 31 percent last month from 42 percent last summer, according to a survey of 2,500 people conducted by Technomic, a restaurant industry consulting firm.“People have started to shift spending as if we were in a recession,” said Michael McNamara, vice president for research and analysis at MasterCard.Such trade-offs were on vivid display last week in Ohio, where layoffs have been rampant. At Save-A-Lot, a discount grocery store in Cleveland, Teresa Rutherford, 51, chided her sister-in-law, Donna Dunaway, 44, for picking up a package of Sara Lee honey ham (eight ounces for $2.49).“We can’t afford that!” she said. “Get the cheap stuff.” They settled on a 16-ounce package of Deli Pleasures ham for $3.29, or 34 percent less an ounce.The women said that soaring prices for food and fuel had changed what they buy and where they buy it. “We used to eat out at Bob Evans or Denny’s once a month,” said Ms. Rutherford, who works in an auto-parts factory. “Now we don’t go out at all. We eat in all the time.”Ms. Dunaway, a homemaker, used to splurge on the ingredients for homemade lasagna, her husband’s favorite, before food prices began to surge this year.“Now he’s lucky to get a 99-cent lasagna TV dinner, or maybe some Manwich out of a can,” she said. “I just can’t afford to be buying all that good meat and cheese like I used to.”By no means has the economic downturn been bad for all product categories. For instance, sales of big-ticket electronics, like $1,000 flat-panel televisions and $300 video game systems, are on the rise, according to retailers and research firms.Falling prices for such devices and a looming government deadline to convert to digital television have helped. So has the view, sensible or not, that the technology is a good investment. At a Best Buy in Southfield, Mich., James Szekely, 28, a mechanical engineer, was shopping for a big high-definition TV that he expected would cost at least $2,000, an expense he rationalized because “at least we can watch movies at home.”At Home Depot, sinks and faucets are selling briskly. Managers at the chain suspect that consumers, loath to spend money on a splashy kitchen renovation or new roof, are settling for a cheaper bathroom “refresh.”Another top seller at home improvement stores: programmable thermostats and insulation, which can cut fuel bills.Many retailers are struggling to adjust to the new needs. Clothing sales have started to sink at department stores like Macy’s, Kohl’s and J. C. Penney. So have furniture sales at companies like Bombay and Domain, both of which have filed for bankruptcy protection.Consumers are spurning small indulgences. Starbucks is warning of a drop-off in purchases, and sales have dipped at higher-end restaurant chains, including the steakhouses Ruth’s Chris and Morton’s.To drum up business, Domino’s is offering a new deal: three 10-inch pizzas for $4 each. “We are not recession-proof,” said the chain’s president, J. Patrick Doyle.But chains that emphasize low prices, like TJ Maxx and Wal-Mart, are thriving. And cut-rate supermarkets, like Save-A-Lot, are swamped.“People are not not spending, but they are changing how they spend,” said Marshal Cohen, chief analyst at the NPD Group.And they are often willing to sacrifice convenience or swallow their pride.George Goulet, 52, the business traveler switching from the Hilton to the Hampton Inn, now books flights that depart in the afternoon rather than the early morning. “It’s a lot cheaper,” he said. “I can really see the difference.”Mary Gregory, 55, a telephone company operator in Cleveland, used to eat red meat at least once a week. Now it is hardly ever on her menu. “I usually buy turkey instead,” she said. “Any recipe that calls for meat, like chili or spaghetti, I try to substitute turkey.”Carl Hall, a retired construction worker in Detroit, wants to buy a fence for his backyard. But he decided not to buy a finished product at Lowe’s, the home improvement chain where he was shopping recently. With money tight, “I am looking to put it together myself,” he said, adding that he hoped to save $200.As the compromises mount, people are even coming up with clever schemes to hide their cost-cutting.Holly Levitsky, a 56-year-old supermarket cashier in Cleveland, buys a brand of steak sauce called Briargate for 85 cents and surreptitiously pours it into an A1 steak sauce bottle she keeps at home.“My husband can’t even tell the difference,” she said.'"
"'08-04-27,'0','Chelsea was without midfielder Frank Lampard, whose mother died two days ago. Manager Avram Grant dedicated the win to him.“We thought about him in the game and it’s for him,” Grant told Sky Sports.United Manager Alex Ferguson elected to start the game with the leading scorer Cristiano Ronaldo and Carlos Tévez on the bench. Ronaldo came on in the second half in place of an injured Rooney. United’s Nemanja Vidic also left the game with a facial injury in the ninth minute and was replaced by Owen Hargreaves.Chelsea’s Joe Cole hit the crossbar in the 21st minute and also had another effort from an angle go wide. Terry then headed a free kick over the top of the goal in the 32nd minute.After dominating the first half, Chelsea finally took the lead as Didier Drogba lifted a pass from the right to the far post which Ballack headed past Edwin Van der Sar.In celebration, the Chelsea players held up a jersey with Lampard’s No. 8 and the message “Pat Lampard R.I.P.” in tribute.Rooney tied the game 11 minutes into the second half when he intercepted a back pass from Carvalho and beat Petr Cech. After the goal, Rooney held his thigh and was replaced by Ronaldo seven minutes later.Ballack and Drogba squabbled over who would take a free kick in the 73rd minute. Drogba won out and his effort forced van der Sar to a diving stop.“This can happen during the game,” Ballack said. “Everyone after the game is fine. Him, me, everyone.”The referee then awarded the penalty after his assistant on the near sideline spotted the hand ball by Carrick. Ballack fired a shot to his left as van der Sar dove the opposite way.United came close to tying the game as Ashley Cole and Andriy Shevchenko both cleared balls off the goal line.HARD FEELINGS Manchester United players were involved in a clash with stewards after their defeat at Chelsea. Patrice Evra, Paul Scholes, John O’Shea, Gerard Pique and Gary Neville were taking part in the warm-down on the pitch when they were asked to move by the Chelsea grounds crew.The United players refused to leave, and a dispute broke out between the players and Chelsea stewards and groundstaff before the incident was resolved.Chelsea said it would examine CCTV footage of the incident. A spokesman for the club said, “We will be studying the relevant CCTV and camera footage in a bid to establish the best and most appropriate course of action.”'"
"'08-04-27,'0','As diplomatic efforts to resolve Zimbabwe’s crisis continued, evidence of the rising use of violence and torture against opposition supporters there mounted. Reports from the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights show that its members have treated 385 victims since the disputed March 29 election. But the group said the number of people its members have treated was probably a small fraction of the total because it has no access to the wounded in remote areas.The victims included an 84-year-old woman whose face was badly fractured when she opened her door to people who attacked her with stones, and a baby who became severely dehydrated while living in the bush with his mother after their home was burned down. Other injuries the latest report mentioned included multiple reports of falanga, or beatings on the soles of the feet that can make walking painful for life.Human Rights Watch said in a new report that it had gathered testimonies about the increasing violence by militias of the ruling ZANU-PF party and the military. And for the first time since the election, the group said it had also documented instances of retaliatory violence by supporters of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, though they still are far fewer in number than attacks instigated by the state.“The emergence of tit-for-tat retaliatory attacks between ZANU-PF and M.D.C. supporters could further escalate the violence putting the general population at greater risk,” the human rights group said.It has now been four weeks since the election. The opposition won the most seats in the lower house of Parliament, and a recount of 23 of those seats — still not fully announced — has not yet changed the outcome.But the authorities have yet to release the result of the presidential race, though independent monitors said the opposition candidate Morgan Tsvangirai led and may have won outright.On Friday, the police raided the offices of that same monitoring group and rounded up more than 200 opposition supporters — some of them wounded refugees — at the opposition headquarters in Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare.Along with the unrelentingly grim news coming out of Zimbabwe, the region’s newspapers have avidly tracked the Chinese ship bearing arms for Zimbabwe.Nelson Chamisa, a spokesman for the opposition, welcomed the news that Angola had refused the Zimbabwe shipment, saying, “Mugabe is finally being routed by his own set.”The announcement about the ship, which was posted Saturday on Angola’s official news Web site, was displayed in a way sure to enrage Mr. Mugabe. The article was placed immediately beside a photograph of Angola’s president, José Eduardo dos Santos, warmly shaking hands with Jendayi E. Frazer, America’s top diplomat for Africa.On Thursday, Ms. Frazer declared that Mr. Tsvangirai had beaten Mr. Mugabe, perhaps by an outright majority. Her statement was denounced by Zimbabwe’s Justice Minister as proof of “the Western axis” behind what he called illegal efforts to topple Mr. Mugabe, according to Zimbabwe’s state-owned newspaper, The Herald.Indeed, ZANU-PF showed its fury on Saturday over the fact that its fellow nations in the region — which form the backbone of S.A.D.C., the Southern African Development Community — have blocked the Chinese ship, which is bearing millions of rounds of bullets and dozens of rockets and mortar shells for Zimbabwe’s military.In an editorial in The Herald, S.A.D.C. was depicted as a tool for Britain and the United States — “the great Satanists.”“S.A.D.C. has lots of soul-searching to do,” the editorial said. “Far from validating its credentials, it now carries the dishonor of fighting a borrowed war, a British war. It now carries the shameful badge of a quiescent community, radically different from its founding principles and spirit.”'"
"'08-04-27,'0','“This amounts to a subsidy for his campaign, which is notable given how badly they were struggling last year,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that collects and analyzes campaign data.Mr. McCain was not available to be interviewed, a campaign spokeswoman said. In response to written questions, the spokeswoman, Jill Hazelbaker, said his campaign had acted legally and ethically in paying first-class airfares for Mrs. McCain’s corporate aircraft.“The campaign carefully followed all the relevant laws and F.E.C. regulations on air travel at all times, and paid for travel exactly as required by those rules,” Ms. Hazelbaker said.Last summer, just before starting to use his wife’s plane, Mr. McCain was quoted in a newspaper report as saying that he did not plan to tap her substantial wealth to keep his bid for the Republican presidential nomination going.“I have never thought about it,” Mr. McCain was quoted by The Arizona Republic as saying at a July appearance. “I would never do such a thing, so I wouldn’t know what the legalities are.”The McCain campaign turned to using the jet last August, a time when it faced mounting debts and the possibility of financial collapse. It stopped doing so in March, those records indicate.During the first half of 2007, a time when Mr. McCain’s campaign did not use his wife’s jet, it paid out over $1.04 million for travel on noncommercial planes, F.E.C. records indicate. Over the second half of the year, when that jet was used almost constantly for campaign-related purposes, his campaign’s total spending for noncommercial flying was about one-half that much, or $542,160, those records suggest.To determine how often the use of the jet was campaign-related, The New York Times reviewed commercially available flight records for the plane and compared them with campaign appearances made by Mr. McCain, his wife and others on his behalf.The plane is a Cessna Citation Excel, a midsize corporate jet that typically seats eight and can fly four hours at a time. It is owned by Hensley & Company, through a holding company, King Aviation. Mrs. McCain is the chairwoman of Hensley, which is one of the country’s biggest distributors of Anheuser-Busch products. Hensley was founded by Mrs. McCain’s father, James Hensley, and her uncle.It was her late father’s fortune, which also includes real estate, that helped start Mr. McCain’s political career. King Aviation is listed on Mr. McCain’s Senate disclosure forms as one of his wife’s assets.The F.E.C. rules that were never finalized would have required candidates using family-owned planes to pay the aircraft’s operational costs. A Citation Excel costs about $2,000 per flight hour to operate, taking into account expenses for fuel, its crew, maintenance and other costs, according to industry experts.For the same plane, a commercial charter company would charge about $3,000 per flight hour with a two-hour daily minimum.The McCain campaign declined to release a detailed accounting of which trips had been made on the plane, the identities of the campaign officials who took those flights and how much the campaign had paid for each one. But it is unlikely that the campaign reimbursed King Aviation for the plane’s operating costs.Over the seven-month period, the King Aviation jet took more than 100 flights to places on days when campaign rallies, fund-raisers or presidential debates involving Mr. McCain occurred in or near those locations, that analysis found.That tally included repeated flights during critical primary months to states including Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. On some days, the plane made three or four campaign-related flights, the records indicate.Separately, the plane took an additional 20 flights back and forth from Phoenix to points along the campaign trail, the analysis indicates. Based on the plane’s $2,000 hourly operating cost, the estimated cost of just those 20 flights, which took over 70 flight hours, exceeded $140,000.The McCain campaign, however, did not pay Mrs. McCain’s company anything for those flights on which Mr. McCain or other campaign travelers were not aboard the plane, such as any empty flights to or from Phoenix.Ms. Hazelbaker, the campaign spokeswoman, said that F.E.C. rules did not require campaigns to pay for so-called deadhead flights and that the campaign did not make such payments to King Aviation.She said Mr. McCain’s use of his wife’s plane did not represent a shift in his position on campaign finance-related issues.“Senator McCain’s paid use of Mrs. McCain’s family plane is explicitly permitted under the new law and does not represent any change of position on corporate jets and lobbyists,” she said.Jan Baran, a Republican lawyer in Washington who specializes in election law, said Mrs. McCain or her company would be likely to face substantial tax consequences for the plane’s campaign-related use because such campaign-related business costs were not tax deductible.Ms. Hazelbaker referred all questions about Mrs. McCain to officials of Hensley, who did not return repeated calls.Last summer, Ms. Hazelbaker said that Mr. McCain appeared to be the only Republican candidate who was complying with the intent of the new admonitions against discounted rates for flights on corporate planes.To perform its analysis, The Times obtained Federal Aviation Administration flight data for the King Aviation plane through a commercial vendor and then matched up its flights during the five months of its most intensive use with reports of campaign appearances of Mr. McCain or others on his behalf.Ms. Hazelbaker turned down repeated requests to meet with a Times reporter to discuss the newspaper’s analysis and declined to release a detailed accounting of how much the McCain campaign paid for its use of the corporate jet.In September, for example, the Times analysis indicated that Mr. McCain’s campaign used the King Aviation plane on at least 15 days to travel to campaign-related locations.Over the last three months of 2007, the plane was used on at least 39 days to fly to locations throughout the country when such events were taking place. In January, the plane was flown on 17 days for such purposes.The Times analysis may be inexact for a variety of reasons. For one, flight records do not show how many, if any, campaign travelers were aboard a plane on a given flight. Also, the companies that collect flight information may not capture all flights.'"
"'08-04-27,'0','John H. McConnell, a self-made steel magnate and sports enthusiast who borrowed $600 against his car to establish what became a multibillion-dollar company and later brought professional hockey to Columbus, Ohio, died Friday in Columbus. He was 84.He died at Riverside Methodist Hospital of complications from cancer, said Cathy M. Lyttle, a spokeswoman for Worthington Industries, the steel company he founded in 1955.Mr. McConnell ran Worthington Industries for four decades until he retired in 1996.A son of a steel worker, Mr. McConnell, who was known as Mr. Mac, championed the idea that workers should partake in their company’s success and set up an employee profit-sharing plan in 1966.His views were recognized by Mother Jones, a magazine for progressive causes, which in 1986 named Worthington Industries one of the best companies to work for in the United States. Fortune magazine also gave the company that distinction four times.John Henderson McConnell was born May 10, 1923, in New Manchester, W.Va., then known as Pughtown. He grew up during the Great Depression, and that experience helped define his business philosophy.“It just came natural,” Mr. McConnell told The Columbus Dispatch in an interview in 1996. “You don’t cheat. You don’t lie. You help your neighbor.”'"
"'08-04-27,'0','For such a bitterly divided party, the Democrats hardly show signs of clinical . The last debate, however dumb, had the most viewers of any so far. The rise in turnout and new voters is all on the Democratic side. Even before its deathbed transfusion of new donations, the Clinton campaign trounced the McCain campaign in fund-raising by 2.5 to 1. (The Obama-McCain ratio is 3 to 1.)On Tuesday, a Democrat won the first round of a special Congressional election in , even though the national G.O.P. outspent the Democrats by more than double and President Bush carried this previously safe Republican district by 25 percentage points in 2004. A poll last week found Mr. Bush’s national disapproval rating the worst (69 percent) for any president in Gallup’s entire 70-year history. For all his (and Mr. McCain’s) persistent sightings of “victory” in , the percentage of Americans calling the war a mistake (63) also set a new record.“I’m thrilled to be anywhere with high ratings,” Mr. Bush joked on Monday night, when he popped up like Waldo on the NBC game show “Deal or No Deal” to root for an Army captain who was a contestant. But it turns out that not even cash giveaways to veterans can induce Americans to set eyes on this president. “Deal or No Deal” drew an audience 19 percent below its season average. The best deal for Mr. McCain would be for Mr. Bush to disappear into the witness protection program.But surely, it could be argued, the mud in the Democratic race will be as much a drag on that party’s eventual nominee as the incumbent president is on the G.O.P. ticket. The counterargument, advanced by Mrs. Clinton in justifying her “kitchen sink” attacks on Mr. Obama, is that the Democrats are better off being tested now by raising all the issues the Republicans will. It’s a fair point. The Wright, Rezko, Ayers, “bittergate” and flag-pin firestorms will all be revived by the opposition come fall. Voters should indeed see how Mr. Obama deals with them, just as Democrats also need to gauge how the flash points of race and gender will play out in the crunch.The flaw in Mrs. Clinton’s refrain is her claim that she, unlike her challenger, has already been so fully vetted that her candidacy can offer no more unpleasant surprises. “I have a lot of baggage, and everybody has rummaged through it for years,” she says. Perhaps the delusion that she has a get-out-of-scandal-free card comes from her unexpected endorsement from , the nutty newspaper publisher who once spent a fortune trying to implicate the Clintons in the “murder” of Vince Foster. Or perhaps she thinks Fox News will call off the dogs now that her campaign chairman, , is appearing in network promos endorsing its “fair and balanced” shtick.But the incessant praise for Mrs. Clinton’s resilience as a candidate by , Pat Buchanan and William Bennett reveals just how eager they are to take her on. The dealings of the post-presidency, barely alluded to by Mr. Obama in his own halting bouts of negative campaigning, have simply been put on hold while the Democrats slug it out. Close observers of The , The New York Post and Fox News can already read ’s tea leaves, and not just those from . “Clinton Foundation Secrets” was the title of The Journal’s lead editorial on Friday profiling a rogues’ gallery of shady donors.Mrs. Clinton’s supporters would argue that she’s so battle-tested she could fend it all off. She’s unlikely to get the chance. For all the nail-biting suspense being ginned up, the probable denouement remains unchanged. When the primary juggernaut finally ends — following picturesque day trips to and — the superdelegates will likely succumb to the math of Mr. Obama’s virtually insurmountable pledged-delegate total.There’s also a way that two super-superdelegates, the duo on the Democrats’ last winning ticket, could trigger a faster finale. Bill Clinton could do so by undermining his wife once more with another ill-timed, red-faced eruption. could possibly do so with a well-timed endorsement before his party gets mired in yet another recount.There’s only one way this can end badly, no matter how long it lasts. That would be if the loser, whoever it is, turns sore and fails to rally his or her troops around the winner. It’s all about “the way the loser loses,” as the Congressman , who is neutral in the race, likes to say. While the Clintons are capable of such kamikaze narcissism, their selfish desire to preserve their own political future, if not the party’s, may be a powerful check on those impulses.On the way to the finish line, the prolonged primary race, far from destroying the Democratic candidates, may do more insidious damage to the Republican nominee, lulling his campaign into an unjustified complacency. The Democrats should “take their time — don’t rush,” the McCain aide Mark Salter joked last week. Yet his candidate, as the conservative blogger Ross Douthat pointed out, keeps bumping up against a 45 percent ceiling in the polls even now, when the Democrats are ostensibly in ruins.Mr. McCain is not only burdened with the most despised president in his own 71-year lifetime, but he’s getting none of the seasoning that he, no less than the Democrats, needs to compete in the fall. Age is as much an issue as race and gender in this campaign. Mr. McCain will have to prove not merely that he can keep to the physical rigors of his schedule and fend off investigations of his ties to lobbyists and developers. He also must show he can think and speak fluently about the domestic issues that are gripping the country. Picture him debating either Democrat about health care, the mortgage crisis, stagnant middle-class wages, rice rationing at Costco. It’s not pretty.Last week found Mr. McCain visiting economically stricken and “forgotten” communities (forgotten by Republicans, that is) in what his campaign bills as the “It’s Time for Action Tour.” It kicked off in Selma, , a predominantly black town where he confirmed his maverick image by drawing an almost exclusively white audience.The “action” the candidate outlined in the text of his speeches may strike many voters as running the gamut from inaction to inertia. Mr. McCain vowed that he would not “roll out a long list of policy initiatives.” (He can’t, given his long list of tax cuts.) He said he would not bring back lost jobs, lost wages or lost houses. But, as The Birmingham News reported, this stand against government bailouts for struggling Americans didn’t prevent his campaign from helping itself to free labor underwritten by taxpayers: inmates from a local jail were recruited to set up tables and chairs for a private fund-raiser.The Democrats’ unending brawl may be supplying prime time with a goodly share of melodrama right now, but there will be laughter aplenty once the Republican campaign that’s not ready for prime time emerges from the wings.'"
"'08-04-27,'0','But this year, stock-based pay — and the piles of company shares that many employees have accumulated as a result — are looking a lot less appealing. Through Friday, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 4.8 percent for the year.Employees “value these awards a whole lot less than they did,” said Steven Gross, head of compensation consulting at Mercer, the human resources firm. He said he knew of one employee who had told his boss that he no longer put any value in stock options, because with prices bouncing up and down, there was no way to know whether the options would be worth anything at any given time.But making changes to stock-based compensation is not simple. If a company sticks to an existing formula and lets employee pay fluctuate with the stock price, there is a risk that people will leave for jobs with more stable compensation. If employers adjust their system, though, they may damage — or even sever — the link between employee pay and performance.“There’s always this tension if companies aren’t doing well and bonuses are going down. If managers are afraid you’re going to leave, do they have to give you something?” Mr. Gross said. “But the plans are designed to go down when the company stock goes down. If you change it, you’re not really paying for performance.“Boards are struggling with this issue,” he added.The fact remains that stock-based compensation is a highly efficient way to motivate and retain employees. If employees feel that they can do well by working hard — and not just earn a pat on the back — they are more likely to do their best.Moreover, for many rank-and-file employees, stock-based compensation represents their biggest chance at a real increase in wealth, even after inflation. Real, or inflation-adjusted, wages actually fell slightly from 2000 to 2007, according to Census Bureau data. But over the long term, if employees also receive some pay tied to their company’s stock, combined with their low single-digit raises, they may well fare better.“If you didn’t give stock-based compensation to a broad group of the population, you’d be cutting off their opportunity to increase their compensation,” Professor Blasi said. “The alternative to stock-based compensation is 1 to 2 percent pay increases and 1 to 3 percent inflation.”It is crucial, however, for employers to provide education along with stock-based pay — and, luckily, many have been doing just that, said Patrick Goepel, president of human resources services at Fidelity Investments. Employers are “providing a lot more information to employees to help them make informed choices,” he said.Managers also need to make sure that employees understand they are better off diversifying rather than holding a stockpile of the employer’s stock. (See Bear Stearns.) And they need to make clear that employees should work for the company’s long-term success so that they do not take undue risks for short-term gains.At many companies, employees now have more choices about how they are paid. At Netflix, for example, employees decide at the beginning of each year how much of their pay they want in cash, in 10-year stock options or in the employee stock purchase plan.Patty McCord, the company’s chief talent officer, said employees’ choices closely reflect their lifestyles and risk tolerance. Employees with young families and new houses tend to take more cash, while single 20-somethings are generally more likely to allocate more to stock options. Employees generally opted for more cash at the beginning of this year, she said, but the shift was not significant.As a result, Netflix has some employees who watch the share price closely, but others who do not.“If prices go down, there’s not this huge morale hit across the company,” Ms. McCord said.'"

The basic service of posting documents and linked profiles is free to these contributors; the site charges $240 a year if contributors want to add links in their profiles to their e-mail addresses, Web sites and blogs. The site will also carry advertisements.JD Supra is typical of a group of fledgling online legal research services that promise to open a field that was once closed, said David Curle, an analyst at Outsell Inc., a market research firm in Burlingame, Calif., for the professional publishing industry. “There’s a real opportunity here in these latent markets as services go beyond lawyer-finding tools” like online lists of attorneys, he said, “particularly in the consumer market, which is wide open.”Services like JD Supra can provide background information for consumers before they engage a lawyer, he said, “and possibly provide them one day with the tools to bypass the lawyers altogether.”While JD Supra poses no threat to giants like LexisNexis with their extensive libraries of documents, the service may be useful to lawyers as well as consumers, said Marc S. Stern, a lawyer in Seattle.“Attorneys draft many documents that they use once, and then file away, and many are prime examples of a lawyer’s craft,” he said.Instead, a brief that took days to write and has an excellent argument could be uploaded to JD Supra and indexed, for instance, by area of law. “Then other attorneys could get the benefit of this analysis when they approach similar cases,” he said.Mitchell J. Matorin, a lawyer in Needham, Mass., who started his own practice last summer after stints at the Justice Department and two large firms, is contributing to JD Supra.“The site puts solo practitioners like me on an equal footing with huge law firms, providing exposure that would otherwise be nearly impossible to get,” he said. People don’t have to rely on a firm’s name recognition or its size in selecting a lawyer, he said. “Instead,” he added, “they can read samples of actual work, and then make an informed judgment.”But the success of JD Supra will ultimately depend on the range of documents it accumulates in coming months, said Elena Garella, a lawyer in private practice in Seattle. “For the service to be useful, many lawyers will need to upload their documents,” she said. “It only takes 10 or 20 minutes, but for a lot of lawyers, 10 or 20 minutes is hard to come by.”OTHER innovations in virtual law libraries are concerned with new search technology for legal information on the Web. Thomas Smith, a law professor at the University of San Diego, is the co-creator of a search engine called PreCYdent, now in the beta, or testing, stage, that uses legal citations to find related information (www.precydent.com).Carl Malamud, an Internet radio pioneer in Sebastopol, Calif., and a proponent of free legal information on the Web, said that dozens of Web sites publishing court and other legal information for public use are either in the works or rapidly expanding their offerings.“It’s about time legal information is free and open online to the public,” he said. “Information on medicine on the Web has changed the doctor-patient relationship — but it’s still hard to do your homework before you go to see a lawyer. Law is the last bastion.”'"

In a recent survey of M.B.A. students at 15 major business schools, respondents listed the factors most important to them in choosing a job. The No. 1 factor was “challenging and diverse job responsibilities.” Compensation came in second, followed by work-life balance.In keeping with not making money the be-all and end-all, the fourth-most-important factor in a job was “potential to make a contribution to society.” About a quarter of the respondents named this as a priority in 2007, compared with just 15 percent in 2002, the last time the survey was conducted.Apparently, many of these soon-to-be-minted business people have embraced a future of uncertainty. In the survey, by the Aspen Institute’s Center for Business Education, “job security” came in a very distant 10th on the students’ list of priorities.'"
"'08-04-27,'0','For them, salary information is now fair game, at least among friends. Many consider it crucial to prosper in an increasingly transient, winner-take-all workplace — regardless of the envy that full disclosure can raise. Besides, when the Internet already offers a cornucopia of personal information, it almost seems coy to keep personal income private.As Ilana Arazie, 32, an online video producer for a media company in Manhattan, said, “If we can talk about how many orgasms we have with our mate, why can’t we discuss how much we make?”While salaries may be disclosed casually among friends, that doesn’t mean most young professionals brag about their incomes at a cocktail party. There is still an etiquette to sharing the information — a proper way to divulge.For instance, most young people don’t tell their cubicle mates, according to a 2007 study for Money magazine by the sociologist Jeanne Fleming and the writer Leonard Schwarz.Still, young workers seem somewhat less likely to adhere to this convention than older ones. The study found that 90 percent of those over 35 who were surveyed agreed with the statement “you should never let your co-workers know how much you make,” while 84 percent of subjects under 35 agreed.But between friends almost anything is fair game. Beth Kobliner, the author of the best-selling “Get a Financial Life: Personal Finance in Your Twenties and Thirties,” said she had noticed that many young people now “have no idea what their boomer parents earn, but know every intimate detail about their close friends’ salaries, 401(k)s and debt loads.”She attributes the increase in openness in part to a shared sense of struggle by people in their 20s, who have come of age in a turbulent economic time, gyrating from the dot-com boom to the post-Sept. 11 gloom, to the housing bubble to the credit crunch.“There is a bunker mentality,” Ms. Kobliner said. “They’ve had it rough, jobs are precarious and debts are outrageous.” Bill Coleman, the chief compensation officer of Salary.com, which tracks income figures for numerous occupations by ZIP code, said that he had noticed more candor about income among those who live by social networking than among those who don’t — what he calls the “MySpace/Facebook rift.”And, he said, the new openness on salaries is reflective of a deeper acceptance of networking, offline as well as online.“This is a generation that is much more attuned to teamwork, collaboration and sharing information,” he said. “Everything they do is a kind of group event. How do you know, when you get your first job offer, if $45,000 is a good offer, a bad offer or an O.K. offer? You go to your friends.”Such was the case with Jim Wang, 27, until recently a software developer living in Columbia, Md., who blogs about his personal finances. Two years ago, he said, several of his friends who worked in the same industry started to get restless. As they started to scout around, they also started to dish.“People started leaving firms to go to other companies, and they were getting 15, 20, 25 percent raises,” recalled Mr. Wang, who can name what his 30 or so closest friends earn “within a bandwidth of $5,000.”“I thought, why not go out and see what my true market rate is? I found out that there were two companies both willing to pay 18 percent more, so I left.”Several workers under 35 said that greater salary transparency among friends only makes sense in an age when there is so much information freely available online. Young professionals, in fact, have all sorts of ways to find out how much their friends make, even without asking. Associates at law firms anonymously report their own salaries to Web sites like www.greedyassociates.com. Every bonus season, Wall Street analysts send one another Excel spreadsheets, based on published reports and word-of-mouth, that detail which banks are paying what.Related taboos already started to crumble over the last decade, as housing prices exploded, particularly in cities like New York and San Francisco, and people suddenly started to consider it innocent dinner-party banter to ask someone, to the dollar, what they paid for their two-bedroom condo.Rebecca Geller, who works in media relations for green technology companies in San Francisco, recalled a recent brunch with two friends. One, a school administrator, was hoping to find a new job that paid at least $40,000 a year. He wanted to know if the other two people at the table — Ms. Geller, 29, and a first-year lawyer — thought he was lowballing himself, asking, “Why, what do you guys make?”The truth hurt. The lawyer, a bit sheepishly, admitted that he made $130,000.“There was definitely an awkward silence,” Ms. Geller said. Many professionals interviewed said that they believe salary talk is best confined to friends within the same tax bracket, to spare feelings. Others, however, insisted that a little generosity by the haves could help stave off jealousy by their have-not friends.Some young Wall Street professionals said that since everyone knows everyone else’s bonus, it is common for friends with the biggest paydays to celebrate by picking up the check at a restaurant or nightclub.Still, there are good reasons that generations of parents have instructed their children to keep quiet about money, social scientists say. In a meritocratic country, money has always been the great divider, the primary way Americans connote status.Thus it is impossible to engage in a conversation about income that is entirely innocent, said Herb Goldberg, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles who has written about financial issues.“When people talk about money,” he said, most people traditionally have presumed that there is “a motive behind it, and the motive is what makes it seem impolite.” People bombarded with unwelcome salary information, or pressed to disclose it, assume someone is raising the topic to subtly brag, or put someone else down, he said.But social scientists say that some young people have generation-specific motives for broaching this touchy subject.Robert H. Frank, an economics professor at Cornell, said that an open flow of information is deemed crucial by young professionals who think of themselves as free agents, not company men.“People move between jobs a lot more now than they used to,” Dr. Frank said. This mobility alone increases the instances that salary might come up among friends.“If you change jobs, that’s news,” he said. “If you get a better salary, that’s the explanation of the news: ‘They’re paying me 80 grand, the last place only paying me 65.’ ”Barbara W. Keats, an associate professor of management at Arizona State University who studies money attitudes among the young, said that their relative lack of manners regarding salary can be traced to the self-esteem movement embraced by baby boomer parents.“As they moved through primary and secondary school, the focus was always to avoid anything that might stifle their creativity or hem them in,” she said, which has bled into their sense of etiquette. “They’re special, and however they say things is very cute.”Elders who equate openness with rudeness are missing the point, said Kate Hubin, a 28-year-old publicity director for a film studio in Los Angeles.“For my generation, salary is one piece of the job satisfaction and self-worth puzzle, but not the only metric we use,” she wrote in an e-mail message. “Status is not just about money any more. Everyone knows you generally have to suffer to make a big income, so high-earners talk about their salary in the course of complaining — is all this worth $180,000? — while low-earners see their paltry salaries as a token of lifestyle freedom.”In recent years, even some people over 35 have started to call for more candor on the topic. In a much-discussed appearance on “The View” last year, the personal-finance author Suze Orman, a proponent of people sharing salary figures as a means of fighting income disparity, challenged her fellow hosts and other guests to disclose their salary on the show (none did).Some young professionals seem more receptive to Ms. Orman’s logic. Janet Polli, 32, who lives in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, works in sales and marketing for a nonprofit organization. A few years ago, she and a colleague were both selected for a promotion at a nonprofit, and Ms. Polli suggested they share salary information as a negotiating tool.“I wanted to be open, like a union,” she recalled. “We would get more if we were together.”But the other woman “was very secretive in her negotiations,” she said. “In the end, neither of us did very well.”'"
"'08-04-27,'0','Students need to understand not only their own financial styles, Dr. Feinberg said, but also those of their potential spouses.“You might be a saver who gets together with a spender — how do you deal with that?” she asked.During a class in March, Dr. Feinberg covered investments, starting with 401ks.“What’s so awesome about this is that you are investing this money pretax,” she told the students. “This is a really good chance for you to save on your tax bill and start investing.”One student asked whether 401ks ever lose money. Dr. Feinberg answered yes, in the short run, noting that her own fund had declined in recent weeks.“But see, that’s something you need to understand about yourself — that you don’t like risk,” she said. “You are all young enough to have a long-term view in investing.”Students took the risk-tolerance quiz in class by using clickers that wirelessly fed their answers back to a computer, tallied the results instantly and projected them on a screen. Most students said friends would describe them as “willing to take risks after completing adequate research.” But when a fair number of students indicated they would invest a windfall in commodities like gold, Dr. Feinberg said, “I hope I can talk you out of that — it’s really risky.”Another of the guest speakers in the course was Dr. Judy Kuriansky, a clinical psychologist and probably the first person to lecture at the business school who has also written a book called “Complete Idiot’s Guide to Tantric Sex.”There are no two topics more intertwined than sex and money, said Dr. Kuriansky, an adjunct professor at Columbia University’s Teachers College. “Even though people have a very taboo sense in talking about sex they are even more inhibited in talking about their money.”A person’s attitude toward money — say, as a risk-taker or a tightwad — may also be reflected in how they dole out emotion in relationships, said Dr. Kuriansky.And Dr. Feinberg said the relationship aspects of the course were as important as the financial ones.“Developing healthy relationships is like developing healthy money habits,” she said. “People tend to get into trouble because they put it off.”One of the students in the course, Shaniqua Harrell, a junior majoring in finance, said that before taking the class, she hadn’t thought about how couples had to merge their financial styles.“You have to know these things about your spouse,” she said. “Money is one of the most important parts of family life and success.”Travia Smith, a sophomore majoring in marketing, was stunned after the lesson on budgeting to realize how much money she spent on eating out.“I never kept track of it before,” she said. “It will really help me better manage my money.”She said she also loved learning more about stocks.“I’ve always asked my dad how stocks work and he said he didn’t know,” Ms. Smith said. “Now I get to tell him.”'"
"'08-04-27,'0','There are lots of lines in David Wiltse’s World War I drama that are so topical they could have been written about the current war in Iraq. That’s both the pleasure and the problem with “Sedition,” at the Playwrights Theater in Madison. It’s basically a two-act polemic about Constitutional rights and Congressional wrongs, and what, if anything, an individual living in our democracy can do in response. Luckily, many of those lines are both well-written and well-delivered, but the play, directed by James Glossman, still comes across as didactic: a lecture posing as a drama.Ably acted by its cast, “Sedition,” in a production with Shadowland Theater in Ellenville, N.Y., is about choices, both personal and political, and the havoc they wreak, especially with those who have the courage of their convictions. Based on the experience of Mr. Wiltse’s grandfather, the play centers on Andrew Schrag (John Pietrowski, artistic director of Playwrights Theater). The head of the German department at the University of Nebraska circa 1917, he wants to act according to his principles, but is damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t.Schrag is German-American, and proud of it. As the play begins, despite the fact that he is completely against America’s joining the war, he is equally adamant about not wanting to become involved in any antiwar protests. His colleague, Cassidy, played by Sean Marrinan, tries to coax him, especially after hearing his discussion with a young student he is trying to dissuade from enlisting. But Schrag remains firm — until that student, Tellig (Merritt Reid), is killed in action.Schrag’s first instinct is to speak out, but he is muzzled by the two people most important in his life — his attractive, young new wife, and his boss, the chancellor of the university. Still, he cannot keep from speaking his mind at the young soldier’s campus memorial, thus making himself the prime target of Megrim, a feral agent unleashed by the United States government (which has just passed the Sedition Act of 1918) to sniff out incipient disloyalties.Mr. Pietrowski is touching as a man who wants to do the right thing — even if it is ultimately at the expense of his own happiness. Megrim is as despicable as Schrag is honorable, and Walker Jones has great fun making him a nasty piece of work, simultaneously snide and sleazy. The chancellor, performed with pomp and circumstance by Paul Murphy, manages to play both sides with equal finesse, never forgetting where his own loyalties lie — keeping the university, and his own job, afloat. As Harriet Schrag, Marianna McClellan has much less to do, and her several short speeches don’t have the same resonance.But in a play that is constructed almost entirely of speeches, there are enough good ones to go around. Anyone who is in favor of our Bill of Rights would have to agree with Schrag’s rousing words to Megrim: “The struggle to remain free is the war that all of us are engaged in every day. I support that war, Mr. Megrim. I support that never-ending war.”'"
"'08-04-27,'0','While Americans live with E.M.F.’s all around — produced by everything from cellphones to electric blankets — there is no broad agreement over what level of exposure constitutes a health hazard, and there is no federal standard that sets allowable exposure levels. Government safety tests do not measure the strength of the fields in vehicles — though Honda and Toyota, the dominant hybrid makers, say their internal checks assure that their cars pose no added risk to occupants.Researchers with expertise in hybrid-car issues say that while there may not be cause for alarm, neither should the potential health effects be ignored.“It would be a mistake to jump to conclusions about hybrid E.M.F. dangers, as well as a mistake to outright dismiss the concern,” said Jim Kliesch, a senior engineer for the clean vehicles program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “Additional research would improve our understanding of the issue.”Charges that automobiles expose occupants to strong electromagnetic fields were made even before hybrids became popular. In 2002, a Swedish magazine claimed its tests found that three gasoline-powered Volvo models produced high E.M.F. levels. Volvo countered that the magazine had compared the measurements with stringent standards advanced by a Swedish labor organization, not the more widely accepted criteria established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection, a group of independent scientific experts based near Munich.Much of the discussion over high E.M.F. levels has sprung from hybrid drivers making their own readings. Field-strength detectors are widely available; a common model, the TriField meter, costs about $145 online. But experts and automakers contend that it is not simple for a hybrid owner to make reliable, meaningful E.M.F. measurements.The concern over high E.M.F. levels in hybrids has come not just from worrisome instrument readings, but also from drivers who say that their hybrids make them ill.Neysa Linzer, 58, of Bulls Head in Staten Island, bought a new Honda Civic Hybrid in 2007 for the 200 miles a week she drove to visit grocery stores in her merchandising job for a supermarket chain. She said that the car reduced her gasoline use, but there were problems — her blood pressure rose and she fell asleep at the wheel three times, narrowly averting accidents.“I never had a sleepiness problem before,” Ms. Linzer said, adding that it was her own conclusion, not a doctor’s, that the car was causing the symptoms.Ms. Linzer asked Honda to provide her with shielding material for protection from the low-frequency fields, but the company declined her request last August, saying that its hybrid cars are “thoroughly evaluated” for E.M.F.’s before going into production. Ms. Linzer’s response was to have the car tested by a person she called her wellness consultant, using a TriField meter.The TriField meter is made by AlphaLab in Salt Lake City. The company’s president, Bill Lee, defends its use for automotive testing even though the meter is set up to test alternating current fields, whereas the power moving to and from a hybrid vehicle’s battery is direct current. “Generally, an A.C. meter is accurate in detecting large electromagnetic fields or microwaves,” he said.Testing with a TriField meter led Brian Collins of Encinitas, Calif., to sell his 2001 Honda Insight just six months after he bought it — at a loss of $7,000. He said the driver was receiving “dangerously high” E.M.F. levels of up to 135 milligauss at the hip and up to 100 milligauss at the upper torso. These figures contrasted sharply with results from his Volkswagen van, which measured one to two milligauss.Mr. Collins said he tried to interest Honda in the problem in 2001, but was assured that his car was safe. He purchased shielding made of a nickel-iron alloy, but because of high installation costs decided to sell the car instead.A spokesman for Honda, Chris Martin, points to the lack of a federally mandated standard for E.M.F.’s in cars. Despite this, he said, Honda takes the matter seriously. “All our tests had results that were well below the commission’s standard,” Mr. Martin said, referring to the European guidelines. And he cautions about the use of hand-held test equipment. “People have a valid concern, but they’re measuring radiation using the wrong devices,” he said.Kent Shadwick, controller of purchasing services for the York Catholic District School Board in York, Ontario, evaluated the Toyota Prius for fleet use. Mr. Shadwick said it was tested at various speeds, and under hard braking and rapid acceleration, using a professional-quality gauss meter.“The results that we saw were quite concerning,” he said. “We saw high levels in the vehicle for both the driver and left rear passenger, which has prompted us to explore shielding options and to consider advocating testing of different makes and models of hybrid vehicles.”In a statement, Toyota said: “The measured electromagnetic fields inside and outside of Toyota hybrid vehicles in the 50 to 60 hertz range are at the same low levels as conventional gasoline vehicles. Therefore there are no additional health risks to drivers, passengers or bystanders.”The statement adds that the measured E.M.F. in a Prius is 1/300th of the European guideline.The tests conducted by hybrid owners rarely approach the level of thoroughness of those run by automakers.Donald B. Karner, president of Electric Transportation Applications in Phoenix, who tested E.M.F. levels in battery-electric cars for the Energy Department in the 1990s, said it was hard to evaluate readings without knowing how the testing was done. He also said it was a problem to determine a danger level for low-frequency radiation, in part because dosage is determined not only by proximity to the source, but by duration of exposure. “We’re exposed to radio waves from the time we’re born, but there’s a general belief that there’s so little energy in them that they’re not dangerous,” he said.Mr. Karner has developed a procedure for testing hybrids, but he said that the cost — about $5,000 a vehicle — had prevented its use.Lawrence Gust of Ventura, Calif., a consultant with a specialty in E.M.F.’s and electrical sensitivity, was one of the electrical engineers who tested Mr. Collins’s Insight in 2001. He agreed that the readings were high but did not want to speculate on whether they were harmful. “There are big blocks of high-amp power being moved around in a hybrid, the equivalent of horsepower,” he said. “I get a lot of clients who ask if they should buy hybrid electric cars, and I say the jury is still out.”'"

"'08-04-28,'0','Countries that are not members of OPEC have been the main source of production growth in the last three decades, as new fields were discovered in Alaska, the North Sea or West Africa. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, new opportunities emerged in Russia and the Caspian Sea.Analysts at Barclays Capital said last week that non-OPEC supplies were “seemingly dead in the water.” Goldman Sachs raised similar concerns last month, saying that growth in non-OPEC supplies “can no longer be taken for granted.”At the same time, oil consumption keeps expanding at a faster clip than production. Demand is forecast to increase this year by 1.2 million barrels a day, to 87.2 million barrels a day. In the United States, the world’s most oil-thirsty nation, consumption has actually fallen a bit because of the economic slowdown.But that drop is being offset by growth in other countries. World consumption is projected to rise 35 percent, to around 115 million barrels a day, in the next two decades. Most of the growth will come from China, India and oil-producing countries in the Middle East, where retail fuel prices are subsidized, encouraging wasteful consumption.“What is disturbing here is that things seem to get worse, not better,” an analyst at Goldman Sachs, David Greely, said. “These high prices are not attracting meaningful new supplies.”Oil rose 23 cents Monday to $118.75 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Longer-term oil futures, dated for 2013, now trade at $108 a barrel, a strong indication that investors see little cause for prices to drop in the next five years — partly because of low expectations about production growth.The outlook for oil supplies “signals a period of unprecedented scarcity,” an analyst at CIBC World Markets, Jeff Rubin, said last week.Oil prices might reach more than $200 by 2012, he said, a level that would probably mean $7-a-gallon gasoline in the United States.Some regions are simply running out of reserves. Norway’s production has slumped by 25 percent since its peak in 2001. In Britain, oil production has plummeted 43 percent in eight years. The North Sea is now considered a dying oil basin. Alaska’s giant field at Prudhoe Bay has declined 65 percent since its peak 20 years ago.In many other places, the problems are not located below ground, as energy executives like to put it, but above ground. Higher petroleum taxes and more costly licensing agreements, scarce manpower and swelling costs, as well as political wrangling and violence, are making it much harder to raise production.“It’s a crunch,” said J. Robinson West, chairman of PFC Energy, an energy consulting firm in Washington. “The world is not running out of oil, but rather it’s running out of oil production capacity.”Recently, the case that has attracted the most attention is Mexico, the second-biggest exporter to the United States, which seems increasingly helpless to stem the collapse of its largest oil field, Cantarell. Last week, the country’s state-owned oil company, Pemex, said that production had fallen 300,000 barrels a day so far this year to 2.9 million barrels a day, a stunning drop from its peak production of 3.4 million in 2004.A combination of falling production and rising domestic consumption could wipe out Mexico’s exports within five years, including the 1.5 million barrels it sends to the United States each day.Another country, Russia, is also clouding analysts’ forecasts. The country is not exactly running out of places to look for oil — a huge chunk of Eastern Siberia remains unexplored — and Russia has been the biggest contributor to the growth in energy supplies in the last decade.But earlier this month, Russian energy officials warned that the days of stunning growth that followed the demise of the Soviet Union were over, as the country would focus on stabilizing its output. Russia today produces about 10 million barrels of oil a day, up from a low point of 6 million barrels in 1996.About 75 percent of the world’s oil reserves are in OPEC countries, where governments voluntarily restrict their output to push up prices. As countries like Russia slow output, analysts say OPEC will have to pick up the slack. The oil cartel currently accounts for 40 percent of the world’s oil exports.Further clouding the picture, Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, signaled last week that it might have trouble increasing its production.Saudi Arabia, the de facto leader of OPEC, signaled it would freeze any further expansion after next year. That dims the long-range outlook for OPEC supplies, though in the near term, Saudi Arabia is expected to loom larger in the market as it completes a $50 billion plan to increase its capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day. Yet that leaves it well short of the 15 million barrels that most experts expected the kingdom to produce in the long run.The cartel’s 13 members say they plan to spend $150 billion to expand capacity by 5 million barrels a day by 2012, according to estimates by OPEC. But that falls short of most projections, which say OPEC will need to pump 60 million barrels a day by 2030, up from around 36 million barrels a day today, to meet the expected growth in demand.Reaching that level is going to be impossible unless the violence and tensions in both Iran and Iraq are resolved, analysts said. Because of sanctions for the last 30 years, both countries have been producing much less than their huge oil reserves would permit.Not everyone has a pessimistic outlook. The Energy Department forecasts sustained growth in non-OPEC supplies this year and next. A study by the National Petroleum Council, an industry group that provides advice to the secretary of energy, outlined a variety of possibilities for oil expansion, and concluded that the world still had plenty of petroleum resources that could be tapped.In fact, high prices have sparked a global dash for oil. Companies are trawling deep oceans or seeking to drill in the Arctic Ocean. In some cases, the hunt has been successful. Brazil, for example, has struck large offshore discoveries that could turn the country into one of the world’s top 10 producers in the coming decade. Yet it takes years to bring such remote fields into production, and the market needs oil now.To make up the shortfall, the world is increasingly turning to fuels made from unconventional sources, like biofuels or heavy oil. Canadian tar sands, for example, have attracted large investments, and biofuels have accounted for much of the growth in fuel supplies in the last two years.The International Energy Agency estimates that current investments will be insufficient to replace declining oil production, let alone increase overall output. The energy agency said it would take $5.4 trillion by 2030 to increase global output, a level of investment that is unlikely to be met. It said a crisis “involving an abrupt run-up in prices” could not be ruled out before 2015.'"
"'08-04-28,'0','With a 6 percent increase in food prices since Jan. 1 and some economists warning that year-end inflation could reach 13 percent, concern among government officials is warranted, analysts say.The issue has exposed a rare split in the government between the nation’s top two economic heavyweights. The Kremlin is trying to forge an economic policy that would prolong Russia’s strong economic performance while avoiding the pitfalls of high economic growth that drew the United States into the subprime mortgage crisis.Aleksei L. Kudrin, the finance minister who is known for his fiscally conservative policies, has called for sharp cuts in federal spending to prevent economic overheating. Such a policy could be unpopular and could harm domestic producers in the short term, but it would, Mr. Kudrin said, help bring inflation under control.Lowered spending would also tone down Russia’s impressive economic growth, something Elvira S. Nabiullina, the economic development and trade minister, has said that Russia would do well to avoid. The economy grew by around 8 percent last year — the fastest of Mr. Putin’s tenure.Ms. Nabiullina has called for increased spending on transportation, energy and other infrastructure projects to ensure that the economy keeps humming, a policy echoed by President Putin, who will become prime minister shortly after Mr. Medvedev’s inauguration on May 7.Though many analysts have questioned the sustainability of such spending, few consider Russia’s current economic predicament a major calamity.“Relative to the other crises Russia has had over the years, this is a pretty minor situation,” said Roland Nash, the chief strategist at Renaissance Capital, an investment bank based in Moscow.Higher commodity prices on average are good for Russia because of the country’s large export-based economy, Mr. Nash said, especially since wages for all but the poorest have kept abreast of the rising costs.“I don’t expect there to be queues for bread in the shops,” he said. “Russia learned that lesson a long time ago.”Russians’ real income has increased 25 percent over the last two years, and the number of people living below the poverty line declined by 23 percent, Tatyana Golikova, Russia’s health minister, said in a news conference on Friday. However, if incomes and rising fixed costs, such as utilities, are adjusted for inflation, about half of this gain is lost. Real disposable income adjusted for inflation was up 10.6 percent in February compared with the previous year, according to the government statistics agency.Still, neither Ms. Nikolskaya nor many others bustling around the market on Friday seemed particularly concerned about rising costs, even as some of the Russian news media had warned of food shortages, ration cards and bread lines reminiscent of the Soviet days.“For now, everything is fine,” Ms. Nikolskaya, an elderly Muscovite, said. “I’ve already bought the kulichi, and the eggs are already painted,” she said, referring to traditional Easter cakes, which one popular Moscow bakery said had gone up in price by 10 and 20 percent this year.Consumer confidence is high, and a sense of panic is lacking at present. Yet two-thirds of the population considered rising prices the main issue that Mr. Medvedev should tackle upon taking office, according to a recent poll.Many Muscovites can afford to splurge every once in a while on a fancy Easter cake and perhaps a new car. Outside the capital, the mood appears different. Average monthly wages in Moscow had reached about $1,300 by January, according to the government statistics agency. Out of view of Moscow’s shimmering new skyscrapers, however, average earnings can be as low as $250 a month, though prices of staple goods generally tend to be less than those in the capital.Retired people, as usual, have had the most difficulties.“Earlier, I could afford to buy many things and went to the market frequently,” said Tatyana N. Ivanova, a retiree with wispy purple hair shopping at the Enthusiasts market.“It is difficult for pensioners,” she said, “because we have barely enough to live on.”While there have been no reports of food-related protests, the Kremlin must take measures to contain inflation quickly lest Mr. Medvedev lose the support of Russians accustomed to the steady wage increases and economic growth that made Mr. Putin so popular, said Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Moscow Center.“While there is little, if any, interest to rally around human rights,” she said, “people do not hesitate to act when it comes to their economic well-being.”'"
"'08-04-28,'0','Demands for a property tax cap have been growing on Long Island, in other New York City suburbs and upstate as property taxes have become more of a burden.But the union’s opposition is no small matter. The group is so influential that last month it successfully lobbied to have language excised from state law that linked teacher tenure decisions to the performance of students on standardized tests. Senate Republicans had resisted the move initially but were muscled by the union, whose political support is seen as critical to helping Republicans keep the closely divided State Senate in the November elections.While a cap would be a districtwide measure, another proposal that is likely to emerge from the commission is a so-called circuit breaker that will limit people’s property tax bills based on their income.More-controversial ideas that the commission may turn into proposals include a scaled-back pension plan for new teachers and making changes in the Taylor Law, which bars public-sector unions from going on strike but also guarantees pay increases. Specifically, the commission has discussed repealing the Taylor Law’s so-called Triborough Amendment, which locks in incremental pay increases after a public contract expires and before a new one is agreed upon.“Some of the things being discussed are an attack on teachers, when you talk about the Triborough and a new tier in the retirement system,” Mr. Iannuzzi said. “Those are not going to be acceptable.”Dan Cantor, executive director of the Working Families Party, which is supported by organized labor, said there was “no chance for a cap,” though he supported the idea of a circuit breaker, “which provides more property tax relief to individuals who need it.”As for the commission itself, Mr. Cantor said, “some of their broader, more high-profile recommendations are likely to go unremembered.”Mr. Suozzi, who has clashed with unions in Nassau, is trying to strike a conciliatory tone in his role as chairman, and Mr. Iannuzzi said that Mr. Suozzi had been “respectful and polite.”Political support for a cap has been growing, and Mr. Suozzi said, “I’ve spoken with Governor Paterson and his staff, I’ve spoken with Shelly Silver and his staff and Joe Bruno and his staff.“The thing that’s different from the past is that everybody agreed there’s a problem,” he added.Whether they can agree on a solution remains to be seen.Gov. David A. Paterson, left, was part of Gov. Eliot Spitzer’s administration, but he wasted little time in replacing much of his predecessor’s senior staff — from cabinet officials to the executive director at the Port Authority — when he unexpectedly took over last month.“I was hoping that everyone would give me the same opportunity as the previous governor to pick my staff,” Mr. Paterson said in an interview last week. “I did not want to be thought of in any respect as the technician who was coming in to make everything that was set in place just work,” he added. “I wanted to make clear that, although the previous governor and I agreed on a number of issues, we don’t have the same management style and don’t do things the same way.“I wanted it to be clear that I’m going to have to be measured by the performance of my commissioners and my senior staff, so I wanted the option, like every other governor, to pick them.”State Senator Martin J. Golden, below, a Brooklyn Republican, has introduced legislation that would give the State Board of Elections the ability to review and overrule decisions by the city’s Campaign Finance Board.“We want some second recourse,” said Mr. Golden, a former councilman, “because of the way it’s arbitrary and capricious.”The idea is controversial, to put it mildly, because of the sagging reputation of the state board, which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg assailed in his State of the City address last year, saying, among other things, that political appointees controlled it.“It takes the essentially nonpartisan, nationally acclaimed campaign finance law of the City of New York and puts in an appeals process through the partisan New York State Board of Elections, which didn’t write and doesn’t administer New York City’s campaign finance law,” he said.Eric Friedman, a spokesman for the city board, said that changes had recently been made to allow for appeals to administrative law judges.“An administrative law judge is a much more impartial and appropriate final arbiter than the State Board of Elections,” he said.'"
"'08-04-28,'0','“My mechanics felt the best they’ve felt since I got back,” said Chamberlain, who had spent five days at home tending to his father, who was released from a Lincoln, Neb., hospital Thursday.Chamberlain said the mild hamstring problem, which was caused by a wet mound in Chicago on Thursday, would remind him not to extend too far with his landing leg. “I guess it can be a blessing in disguise,” he said.Rivera’s inning was just as overpowering, ending with two called strikeouts. Rivera has converted all seven save chances this season, with 10 strikeouts and no walks in 10 scoreless innings. He and Wang have been the Yankees’ best players in an uneven month (the Yankees are 13-13), and Cabrera, of all players, has led the offense.Cabrera, who was nearly dealt to Minnesota in a proposed trade for Johan Santana, is hitting .291 with 5 home runs and 11 runs batted in. He is tied for first on the team in homers, ranks second in runs (14), and has a better on-base percentage than Alex Rodriguez.“Melky’s in a zone right now; he’s in a very good place,” Rodriguez said. “But what I know is he’s just in phenomenal shape. He’s probably 10 pounds lighter now than he was at this time last year. I think that’s a big part of his start, and he’s got a big energy level. He’s our battery on this team.”In the pitching sense, the battery of Wang and Molina tamed the Indians, whose only extra-base hit was a bloop double to shallow right field. Wang said he used his slider to right-handers and his changeup and splitter to lefties, and he finished one strikeout short of his career high.“He was throwing more sliders today than usual,” Molina said. “I don’t think he threw that many before. That was the reason he had more strikeouts — people were looking more for his sinker than his slider.”Rodriguez joked that he would love to have both Wang and Sabathia — a possibility next season if the Yankees sign Sabathia as a free agent — because they are aces.“When he’s on, he’s phenomenal,” Rodriguez said of Wang. “It seems like he and Molina have a good thing going.”That is fortunate for the Yankees, because with Posada’s immediate future so murky, Molina and Wang will keep working together for a while.Manager Joe Girardi said that Ian Kennedy would make his next start Thursday. Kennedy is 0-2 with an 8.53 earned run average but showed improvement in his last three innings Saturday.'"
"'08-04-28,'0','CORAL GABLES, Fla. — Senator John McCain delved on Sunday into remarks made by Senator Barack Obama’s former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., saying it was “beyond belief” that Mr. Wright had likened the Romans at the time of Jesus’ crucifixion to the Marines and had suggested that the United States was acting like Al Qaeda under a different color flag.Up to now, Mr. McCain had largely avoided talking about the incendiary views of Mr. Wright, saying he wanted to run a “respectful” campaign. He has even called on the North Carolina Republican Party to pull an advertisement that focuses on Mr. Wright.But Mr. McCain took a different approach at a news conference here when he criticized Mr. Wright for, as the senator paraphrased him, “comparing the United States Marine Corps with Roman legionnaires who were responsible for the death of our Savior, I mean being involved in that” and for “saying that Al Qaeda and the American flag were the same flags.”“So I can understand, I can understand why people are upset about this,” said Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president. “I can understand why Americans, when viewing these kinds of comments, are angry and upset.”Mr. McCain said that he did not believe that Mr. Obama, Democrat of Illinois, shared those views and that he was still against the advertisement in North Carolina. But he suggested that Mr. Obama had made the subject fair play by declaring in an interview shown over the weekend on “Fox News Sunday” that questions about Mr. Wright were “a legitimate political issue.”“If he believes that,” Mr. McCain said, “then it will probably be a political issue.”The Obama campaign accused Mr. McCain of breaking his promise to run a respectful campaign.'"
"'08-04-28,'0','John H. McConnell, a self-made steel magnate and sports enthusiast who borrowed $600 against his car to establish what became a multibillion-dollar company and later brought professional hockey to Columbus, Ohio, died Friday in Columbus. He was 84.He died at Riverside Methodist Hospital of complications from cancer, said Cathy M. Lyttle, a spokeswoman for Worthington Industries, the steel company he founded in 1955.Mr. McConnell ran Worthington Industries for four decades until he retired in 1996.A son of a steel worker, Mr. McConnell, who was known as Mr. Mac, championed the idea that workers should partake in their company’s success and set up an employee profit-sharing plan in 1966.His views were recognized by Mother Jones, a magazine for progressive causes, which in 1986 named Worthington Industries one of the best companies to work for in the United States. Fortune magazine also gave the company that distinction four times.John Henderson McConnell was born May 10, 1923, in New Manchester, W.Va., then known as Pughtown. He grew up during the Great Depression, and that experience helped define his business philosophy.“It just came natural,” Mr. McConnell told The Columbus Dispatch in an interview in 1996. “You don’t cheat. You don’t lie. You help your neighbor.”'"
"'08-04-28,'0','The situation has worsened enough that the New York City Independent Budget Office, which said a month ago that it expected a brief and mild recession, is preparing a forecast that is likely to be significantly bleaker, said Ronnie Lowenstein, the director.The local economy, she said, “will be considerably worse than it is now.”Still, predicting downturns is risky work. Every recession has its own personality, and the city’s sprawling economy has reacted differently to each one. More dependent on Wall Street and more closely linked to the global economy than the rest of America, the city has been battered harder by recessions that started in the financial markets than by those that began in manufacturing.Looking to history for clues about how New York might fare in a new recession, economists note that the city suffered more and for a longer period than the nation as a whole during the last two downturns — at the start of the 1990s and in the early years of this decade.So far, however, no one is forecasting a recession that would rival the financial disaster that the city endured in the 1970s, when it teetered on the brink of bankruptcy. That crisis was the most severe downturn in the city’s fortunes since World War II.In 1973, the national inflation rate already was rising when the supply of foreign oil was disrupted. High interest rates, combined with falling productivity and rising unemployment, led to a condition known as stagflation.New York City fared much worse than the rest of the country. Unemployment and the crime rate soared as 600,000 jobs were lost. Several large corporations, including General Electric, packed up their headquarters and decamped to the suburbs, or farther away.By the spring of 1975, the city was on the verge of defaulting on its debts. The State Legislature created the Municipal Assistance Corporation, which borrowed billions of dollars to keep the city afloat. (Experts widely believe the city’s finances, even in a weakening economy, are much better today, with projections of a surplus of more than $4 billion this fiscal year.)When the next national recession struck in early 1980, followed by another in mid-1981, New York City was still rebounding. Nationally, that downturn spurred thousands of business failures, many of them manufacturers. But the city’s manufacturing sector had already shrunk markedly, leaving it with less to lose, economists said.As a result, those recessions were considered relatively mild in New York. In 1982, when the national unemployment rate had risen to 10.8 percent, it was 9.8 percent in the city.The next two recessions, however, were largely about Wall Street and what it financed — and so New York felt the pain.In the mid-1980s, the city and its growing financial sector were on a tear. The stock market was rising steadily, and big investment banks like Morgan Stanley and Salomon Brothers were growing from tightly held partnerships into big public companies. A building boom took root. Office buildings and condominiums sprouted across the metropolitan area, many of them financed by the aggressive lending of savings and loan associations.By mid-1987, the city had added back about 300,000 jobs, and its unemployment rate had fallen below 6 percent. Personal incomes were rising along with the stock market. The city’s median family income increased by more than 15 percent during the ’80s.Then the stock market crashed in mid-October 1987, wiping out all of the year’s gains in a single day. But its dire effects were not immediately felt.The city’s economy continued to expand, along with the nation’s, for two more years. But the growth masked the cutbacks that had begun on Wall Street, where the banks had been eliminating jobs throughout 1988.With Wall Street in a tailspin, a downturn was well under way in New York when the national recession officially began in July 1990. Two years later, the city’s unemployment rate had risen to more than 11 percent.That national recession officially ended in 1991, but the downturn lingered in New York, for another year and a half by Mr. Parrott’s estimate. Corporations continued eliminating layers of management in what came to be known as the first “white-collar recession.” Before it was over, one of every 10 jobs in the city — about 360,000 in all — were lost.The city did not begin to recover until 1994, when another financial boom began, this one culminating in the mania for dot-com stocks. The dot-com party came to an abrupt end in March 2000. This time, the job cuts started not on Wall Street, but in computer services. Employment in data processing and other business services fell fast, but overall employment in the city continued growing until the end of 2000.Then came the devastating terrorist attack on Sept. 11. About 80,000 jobs were lost in the 15 weeks after the attack, turning what had been a mild downturn into a deep recession. Travel and tourism-related businesses suffered even more than financial services.Officially, the national economy pulled out of that recession at the end of 2001. But the city kept shedding jobs until 2003, eventually losing more than 225,000.What lessons, then, do those downturns hold for economists parsing the current economic troubles?Economists say the post-9/11 recession is less instructive because of the anomaly of the attack and its localized impact on the economy.But some economists see parallels in the current situation to the recession of 1990, as both were preceded by easy and abundant credit.Although the current national slowdown began with the bursting of a housing bubble in Sun Belt states, the city could again remain in recession after the national economy recovers because Wall Street firms financed much of that lending, economists said.Mr. Parrott described the borrowing of recent years as “excessive,” saying that aggressive mortgage lending and the leveraged trading of mortgage-related securities inflated the bubble.Ms. Lowenstein said: “Even if it didn’t start on Wall Street, Wall Street is very much involved. Given the difficulties we’re seeing in the financial sector, it’s hard to imagine that we’re not going to see some fairly significant losses that could well exceed what’s happening in other areas of the country.”Though job losses on Wall Street this time around may not rise as high as during the last two recessions, she said, the damage could be equally severe.“There may be fewer financial-sector jobs lost, but each job is very much more valuable,” Ms. Lowenstein said. “The loss of those jobs has a much greater impact on the economy because they are so well-paid.”'"

"'08-04-29,'0','The slump in home prices was more severe than the worst point of the recession of the 1990s, the last time values fell so far, so quickly.As foreclosures rise and mortgage lenders tighten their standards, the market is expected to continue to feel the pressure of large inventories and a dearth of qualified buyers, economists said.“This is not, alas, a fluke,” Ian Shepherdson, a London-based economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients. “The monthly declines have been accelerating steadily over the past year and this just marks another step on the way.”The slump has hurt manufacturers, construction firms and other businesses that depend on strength in the housing industry, forcing some companies to lay off workers. It also lies at the root of the current credit crisis on Wall Street, where banks were left holding investments linked to mortgages that defaulted or were downgraded.The problems are likely to weigh heavily on the nation’s overall economic growth in the first three months of 2008. Many economists think the economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter; some predict a contraction. The government will release its first-quarter growth estimate on Wednesday; the technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.The fall in home prices has also cut into Americans’ home equity and forced many to grapple with mortgages now worth more than the house itself. The problems have contributed to a deepening gloom, which was reinforced on Tuesday by a grim confidence survey released by the Conference Board.The private report, which surveys up to 5,000 American households, dropped to its lowest point since March 2003, at the start of the invasion of Iraq. Americans feel worse about the economy’s prospects than any time since the mid-1970s, and many are bracing for job losses.The index fell in April to 62.3 from a revised 65.9 in March and 76.4 in February, the Conference Board said.“With house prices falling, wages failing to keep pace with inflation and job worries growing, we suspect that both confidence and spending will remain under downward pressure,” wrote James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank, in a note.The effects of the housing slump are spread more or less evenly across the country. All 20 regions included in the Case-Shiller index recorded price declines in February, with Western cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego among the worst performers. Only the Charlotte, N.C., area has seen prices increase to February 2008 from February 2007.Single-family homes in Las Vegas, Miami and Phoenix have lost more than a fifth of their value over that period, according to the report, which is released by the ratings firm Standard & Poor’s.Home values in the New York City area fell 1.2 percent in February and were down 6.6 percent compared to February 2007. Chicago’s homes lost 8.5 percent of their value in the last year, and Washington suffered a 13 percent year-over-year decline. Boston and Atlanta homes lost about 5 percent in 12 months.“There is no sign of a bottom in the numbers,” said David M. Blitzer, who oversees the index, in a statement.'"

"'08-04-29,'0','Democracy was the big loser in the on Monday. The court upheld ’s voter identification law, which solves a nearly nonexistent problem by putting major barriers between voters — particularly minorities — and the ballot box. Worse, the court set out a standard that clears the way for other states to adopt rules that discourage disadvantaged groups from voting. It is a sad reversal for a court that once saw itself as a champion of voting rights.In 2005, Indiana passed one of the nation’s toughest voter ID laws. It requires voters to present government-issued photo ID at the polls. Private college IDs, employee ID cards and utility bills are unacceptable. For people without a driver’s license — who are disproportionately poor and minority — the burden is considerable. To get acceptable ID, many people would be forced to pay fees for underlying documents, such as birth certificates.This should not have been a hard case. The court has long recognized that the right to vote is so fundamental that a state cannot restrict it unless it can show that the harm it is seeking to prevent outweighs the harm it imposes on voters.The Indiana law does not meet this test. The harm it imposes on voters, some of whom will no doubt be discouraged from casting ballots, is considerable. The state’s interest in the law, on the other hand, is minimal. It was supposedly passed to prevent people from impersonating others at the polls, but there is no evidence that this has ever happened in Indiana. It seems far more likely that the goal of the law’s Republican sponsors was to disenfranchise groups that lean Democratic.Unfortunately, only three justices voted to hold the law unconstitutional. The other six fell into two groups. Three — Justices and Anthony Kennedy and — signed a lead opinion that set a disturbingly low bar for what sort of interference with voting the Constitution permits. A second opinion, signed by Justices , and , was worse. It argued for upholding all but the most severe and unjustified burdens on voting. Richard Hasen, a Loyola Law School professor, notes that if the court had taken this opinion’s approach in 1966, it is not clear it would have overturned the poll tax.Hovering over Monday’s decision was a case that was not mentioned: Bush v. Gore. In 2000, the Supreme Court took seriously the claims of one individual — — that his equal protection rights were being denied by a state election system, and the court had no hestitation about telling the state what to do.'"
"'08-04-29,'0','“According to normal economic theory, and the history of oil, rising prices have two major effects,” said Fatih Birol, the chief economist at the International Energy Agency in Paris. “They reduce demand and they induce oil supplies. Not this time.”With global supplies tight, geopolitics continue to play a big role in pushing up oil prices. Oil futures closed at $118.75 a barrel, up 23 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange, after strikes by oil workers in Scotland and Nigeria that shut down nearly 1.7 percent of the world’s daily production.Countries outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries have been the main source of production growth in the past three decades, as new fields were discovered in Alaska, the North Sea and the Caspian region.But analysts at Barclays Capital said last week that non-OPEC supplies were “seemingly dead in the water.” Goldman Sachs raised similar concerns last month, saying that growth in non-OPEC supplies “can no longer be taken for granted.”At the same time, oil consumption keeps expanding. Global consumption is forecast to increase by 1.2 million barrels a day this year, to 87.2 million barrels a day, with much of the growth in demand coming from China, India and the Middle East, according to the International Energy Agency, a group that advises industrialized countries.In the United States and through much of the developed world, the higher fuel prices have led drivers to reduce their consumption, and gasoline demand is expected to drop this year. But that drop will be more than offset by the rise in energy demand from developing countries. In the next two decades, demand is projected to jump by 35 percent, and developing countries will consume more oil than industrialized countries.Higher oil prices mean record profits for oil companies that have, to some extent, masked the supply problems. Exxon Mobil and Chevron are both expected to deliver knockout performances when reporting quarterly earnings this week, even as they struggle to increase production.“What is disturbing here is that things seem to get worse, not better,” said David Greely, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. “These high prices are not attracting meaningful new supplies.”The outlook for oil supplies “signals a period of unprecedented scarcity,” Jeff Rubin, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said last week. Oil prices might exceed $200 a barrel by 2012, he said, a level that would very likely mean $7-a-gallon gasoline in the United States.Some regions are simply running out of reserves. Norway’s production has slumped by 25 percent since its peak in 2001, and in Britain, output has dropped 43 percent in eight years. Production from the giant Prudhoe Bay field in Alaska has dropped by 65 percent from its peak two decades ago.In many other places, the problems are not below ground, as energy executives like to put it, but above ground. Higher petroleum taxes and more costly licensing agreements, a scarcity of workers and swelling costs, as well as political wrangling and violence, are making it harder to raise production.“It’s a crunch,” said J. Robinson West, chairman of PFC Energy, an energy consulting firm in Washington. “The world is not running out of oil, but rather it’s running out of oil production capacity.”Mexico, the second-biggest exporter to the United States, seems increasingly helpless to find new supplies to offset the collapse of its largest oil field, Cantarell. A combination of falling production and rising domestic consumption could wipe out Mexico’s exports within five years.Foreign investment could help Mexico produce oil from deeper waters, but that is a controversial proposition in a country where oil has long been seen as part of the national patrimony.Another country, Russia, is also a focus of analysts’ worries. Russia is not exactly running out of places to look for oil — a huge chunk of eastern Siberia remains unexplored — and the country has been the biggest contributor to the growth in energy supplies in the last decade.But Russian energy officials warned recently that the days of stunning growth that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union were over, as the country focuses on stabilizing its output. Russia today produces about 10 million barrels of oil a day, up from a low of 6 million barrels in 1996.The Russian government has been muscling Western companies to gain more control over its energy resources. That rise in energy nationalism could freeze new investment and slow any meaningful growth in supplies there for years.As countries like Russia slow output, analysts say OPEC will have to pick up the slack. The oil cartel accounts for 40 percent of the world’s oil exports and owns more than 75 percent of global reserves. But there are serious concerns that OPEC will also find it tough to increase production.Saudi Arabia, the world’s top oil exporter, is completing a $50 billion plan to increase capacity to 12.5 million barrels a day, but it signaled recently that it would not go beyond that. That means Saudi Arabia could fall short of the 15 million barrels a day that most experts had expected it to produce in the long run.OPEC’s 13 members plan to spend $150 billion to expand their capacity by five million barrels a day by 2012. But OPEC will need to pump 60 million barrels a day by 2030, up from around 36 million barrels a day today, to meet the projected growth in demand. Analysts say that without Iran and Iraq — where nearly 30 years of wars and sanctions have crippled oil production — reaching that level will be impossible.Not everyone is pessimistic about energy supplies. A study by the National Petroleum Council, an industry group that provides advice to the secretary of energy, concluded that the world still had plenty of petroleum resources that could be tapped.In fact, high prices have set off a global dash for oil. Brazil, for example, has struck large offshore fields that could turn the country into one of the world’s top 10 producers. But developing new fields can take many years.To make up the shortfall, the world is also increasingly turning to fuels from unconventional sources, like biofuels or heavy oil. Canadian tar sands, for example, have attracted large investments.But the International Energy Agency estimates that current investments will be insufficient to replace declining oil production. The energy agency said it would take $5.4 trillion by 2030 to raise global output. Otherwise, it warned that a crisis before 2015 involving “an abrupt run-up in prices” could not be ruled out.'"

Cooperman’s verdict on Friday was a starting point for the six officers who remain on modified duty because of the case: Detectives Isnora, Oliver and Cooper; Detective Paul Headley; Officer Carey; and Lt. Gary Napoli. All but Lieutenant Napoli, their commanding officer, fired their guns that night.Besides the nitty-gritty review of the shooting, elected officials and the public are examining the officers’ behavior in the wider context of police tactics, training and strategies.As Justice Cooperman wrote in clearing the three detectives of criminal charges: “Questions of carelessness and incompetence must be left to other forums.”On Monday, Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the Justice Department, arrived in the city to meet with those close to Mr. Bell.Mr. Conyers went to the office of Gregory W. Meeks, a member of Congress from Queens, where he met with seven other United States representatives, members of Mr. Bell’s family and Joseph Guzman and Trent Benefield, two of Mr. Bell’s friends who were wounded in the shooting. They met for about an hour.Afterward, Mr. Conyers said he had spoken to the United States attorney general, Michael B. Mukasey, about the case.“I’m going back to work with our committee,” Mr. Conyers said. “We’re going to be putting together the federal strategy.”He said the attorney general’s office announced it would be beginning its own investigation, but he declined to elaborate.After making statements to reporters, many of those who attended the meeting drove to the Club Kalua, a few blocks from Congressman Meeks’s office.Mr. Guzman, Mr. Benefield and Mr. Bell’s family stood in front of the club, on 94th Avenue, where Mr. Bell celebrated his bachelor party in November 2006.Mr. Conyers emerged into a steady rain. After briefly gazing at the club, he walked around a corner onto Liverpool Street, surrounded by photographers and television camera operators. He paused at a spot where a memorial for Mr. Bell included flowers and candles.As he walked back to his car, he was approached by Ken Frydman, a consultant to the Detectives’ Endowment Association, who asked the congressman to meet with representatives from that group.Mr. Frydman told reporters afterward that Mr. Conyers seemed amenable to the idea. “We’d like equal time,” he said. “We’d like to be heard.”The officers involved will stand by, in the department’s vernacular, on so-called desk duty. This can mean anything from fixing cars at a departmental tow garage to doling out new uniform shirts to rookies at the equipment section or shuffling paper files in a detective bureau’s back office.According to Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman, Detective Cooper is working in the detective bureau in the Bronx, Detective Isnora is working in the patrol bureau in northern Brooklyn, and Detective Oliver is working in Manhattan’s detective bureau.Also, Mr. Browne said, Detective Headley is working on Staten Island; Officer Carey is working in the patrol bureau in southern Manhattan; and Lieutenant Napoli is working in the 17th Precinct in Manhattan.All six have been on modified duty since shortly after the shooting, Mr. Browne said, though Detectives Oliver, Isnora and Cooper were suspended without pay for 30 days from the time they were indicted in March 2007 until April 18, 2007, when they reverted to modified assignment.One thing seems clear: Even if at the end of the process the officers involved in the shooting of Mr. Bell are cleared of all liability — criminal, civil and departmental — their careers as they knew them are likely over. None of them can reasonably be expected to ever carry a gun as a police officer in New York City, officials said.For Detective Headley, going without his weapon would be particularly ironic because he was a captain in the Army’s military police who saw active duty in Kuwait in 2004 and 2005.John Arlia, a lawyer for Detective Headley, said his client “is cautiously optimistic that he and his fellow officers will be cleared after any additional scrutiny.”'"
"'08-04-29,'0','“We don’t have a nominee, we might not have one for awhile, and the D.N.C.’s job is to not let John McCain run free and unchallenged,” said Steve McMahon, a strategist for the party whose company is producing the anti-McCain spots. “McCain isn’t still very well defined — we don’t want to let him set the frame for himself while our nominee isn’t settled.”Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton between them are raising and spending record sums of money. But the party is limited in how much it can do because fund-raising at the committee level has been anemic by comparison with that of the Republicans.The Democratic Party had only $5.3 million in the bank at the end of March — when the Republican National Committee had $31 million — and its new campaign is limited, costing about a million dollars for three weeks on the cable networks.The liberal group MoveOn is planning to begin running an advertisement against Mr. McCain on Thursday, the fifth anniversary of President Bush’s declaration that major combat operations in Iraq were over.Another group called Progressive Media USA has run advertisements linking Mr. McCain to Mr. Bush on cable and some broadcast stations. It is vowing to spend tens of millions of dollars against Mr. McCain.The independent groups — operating outside the fund-raising restrictions imposed on the parties and candidates — have this year been the envy of Republicans, who say they are scrambling to match what they expect will be several major efforts against them in the coming months financed by wealthy liberals like George Soros.But Democratic officials said the fund-raising efforts by the groups had been slower than expected, as most donors are splitting their giving between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama.And, so far, none of the independent efforts against Mr. McCain has come close to matching the cost of the television campaigns that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have been running in their ever-more-heated competition against each other.According to the Campaign Media Analysis Group, a private firm known as CMAG that monitors political advertising, their intramural television advertising battle has surpassed $100 million, easily a record for a party nominating contest.The candidates are unleashing advertising barrages in Indiana and North Carolina and beyond, putting them on a pace to triple what the Democratic presidential candidates spent on commercials in the entire 2004 nominating season.The expense, combined with the sharpness of some of the back-and-forth, is adding to anxiety in the party that a protracted fight that has produced unparalleled voter excitement and turnout is now taking up substantial sums that would have been otherwise devoted to fighting Mr. McCain.“The great danger, of course, is they will end up spending so much money trying to knock out each other that when it comes time to knock John McCain out we might be too exhausted,” said Donna Brazile, a Democratic superdelegate who is unaligned. “We might deplete this well of fortune that we’ve somehow or another found.”With his own money challenges, Mr. McCain has yet to run a substantial national advertising campaign against either of his potential Democratic opponents — something Mr. Bush had already been doing against his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, for weeks at this point four years ago.But Democrats have openly worried that at times Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have done the work for Mr. McCain while going through the geyser of cash they are finding on the Internet.Though the Democratic candidates’ advertisements have been primarily focused on their biographies, as well as economic and domestic concerns, their exchanges have grown increasingly confrontational.So far the advertisements Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton are running before the next votes, in Indiana and North Carolina next Tuesday, have yet to include attacks. But Mr. Obama’s campaign was girding for new advertisements from an outside group that supports Mrs. Clinton, the American Leadership Project.Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Clinton supporter and head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said the roughhousing would ultimately lead to a stronger, more battle-tested nominee in the fall. “It’s sort of like having an extended practice round,” Mr. Schumer said.Still, he added, “It’s not fun to watch.”Speaking with reporters on Monday, the Democratic National Committee chairman, Howard Dean, expressed urgency when he described deciding to run a party-sponsored advertisement against Mr. McCain. “I said look, it is time for us to get this done,” he said.Republicans charged that Mr. Dean had produced the advertisement illegally, in coordination with the campaigns, which he strenuously denied. And they said television outlets should not run it, arguing that it misleadingly implied that Mr. McCain supported a prolonged war footing in Iraq when in fact he said he could foresee a sustained troop presence there along the lines of the one in South Korea, “as long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed.”'"
"'08-04-29,'0','Visa, the world’s largest credit and debit card processor, said Monday that its profit rose 28 percent in the first three months of the year as customers around the world charged more to their cards.Cardholder spending outside the United States grew particularly quickly, as more people in developing markets adopted plastic over cash, Visa said.Spending in the United States increased as well, a trend other major card companies also reported for early 2008, suggesting that while consumer spending on the whole is slowing down because of the weak economy, people are still using credit.After the markets closed Monday, Visa posted fiscal second-quarter profit of $314 million, or 39 cents a share, up from $246 million in the comparable period last year.Net operating revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was $1.45 billion, up from $1.19 billion.“At some point, the softening economy will likely impact our business in the U.S.,” the chief financial officer, Byron Pollitt, said on a conference call with analysts.In its three-year outlook, Visa forecast annual net revenue growth of 11 percent to 15 percent, an annual adjusted operating margin of 40 percent or a bit better, annual adjusted growth of 20 percent a share or greater and annual free cash flow above $1 billion.'"

Shares of Ford rose 71 cents, or 9.5 percent, to $8.21.Continental Airlines shares declined 26 cents, to $16.96, after the airline announced it was not interested in completing a deal. The decision stunned United’s parent, the UAL Corporation, which had expected to complete a deal by early May. Shares of UAL fell 40 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $14.81.Some observers saw the deal-making as an encouraging sign that companies were still willing to make mergers and acquisitions happen, and that many might do so while valuations still looked cheap.In other corporate news, the health insurer Humana said that increased Medicare Advantage membership helped its first-quarter profit rise above Wall Street’s expectations. The company also increased its forecast for the year. Shares of Humana rose $1.50, or 3.3 percent, to $46.38.Visa, the credit and debit card processor, said after the closing bell that its earnings increased 28 percent in the first quarter as customers charged more. Investors appeared disappointed that the results were not stronger. The stock fell in after-hours trading, after rising 53 cents, to $75.63, in the regular session.Bond prices edged higher after suffering big losses last week.

"'08-04-29,'0','THE downfall of , the release of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson’s sweeping blueprint for the overhaul of our financial regulatory structure, and the worsening health of the stock market and our economy has raised serious questions for the future of the Securities and Exchange Commission. As the capital-markets regulator and investor’s advocate, the S.E.C. is a natural recipient of finger-pointing during a market crisis.Each of us led the S.E.C. during challenging times — the stock market crash of 1987, the price-fixing scandal at Nasdaq in the 1990s, and the accounting and governance failures and mutual fund scandals of this decade. We are in agreement with Secretary Paulson that the world of finance is changing rapidly, having eclipsed in many areas the regulatory structure put in place, piece by piece, over the past century. Yet we fear that the current conversation about the future of the S.E.C. is getting ahead of itself. Secretary Paulson’s proposals to change the structure and function of the S.E.C., if adopted, risk inflicting serious damage to investors and our capital markets.The current housing and credit troubles do not present a sufficient basis for reforming the entire financial regulatory system. Instead of moving hastily, policymakers need to examine what went wrong, why it went wrong and what the best approaches are for re-establishing the unequaled reputation and performance of the American capital markets.There is precedent for such an exercise. In 1987, a presidential task force was established to investigate the Black Monday crash. Today, we need a similar exhaustive, bipartisan and impartial examination to explore a series of possible business and regulatory failures.This investigation should include apparent conflicts of interest on the part of the credit ratings agencies; the failure of banks and other lenders to adopt sound lending practices; the failure of investment banks to disclose that they had significant portfolios of securities backed by subprime mortgages; the sale of high-risk securities to investors for whom they were unsuited; the breakdown (or absence) of adequate risk management systems among the top financial services firms; and the failure of regulators to recognize and take early action to deal with the problems that have grown to today’s magnitude.Any reforms undertaken after the commission completes its study should not undermine the S.E.C.’s central roles as an investor’s advocate and a law enforcement agency. But the Treasury Department proposal envisions an S.E.C. that would no longer regulate through hard-and-fast rules enforced swiftly and justly, but rather would practice “prudential” regulation, offering up principles and conceptual guidelines and working collaboratively behind closed doors with regulated entities and their self-regulatory organizations when they have violated the law.'"

"'08-04-29,'0','As a group, the Neustadt family also received more than $693,000 in federal farm subsidies from 1995 through 2006, according to Agriculture Department records compiled by the Environmental Working Group, a Washington nonprofit research organization. That includes more than $78,000 paid to Mr. Neustadt himself since 1998, in the form of disaster subsidies and commodity payments.Which is not to imply that he has not earned those payments. With the family farm nestled on a two-mile-wide spit of land between the two rivers some 25 miles north of St. Louis, the Neustadt family has seen more than its share of flooding. In the great Midwest flood of 1993, “we basically lost everything we had on the farm,” Mr. Neustadt recalled, with 10 of the family’s 13 grain bins being destroyed, and all of the family’s farmhouses under several feet of water.That provenance notwithstanding, Mr. Neustadt otherwise looks more like a man of the gym than a man of the earth. Instead of a traditional farmer’s tan — red neck and forearms — he sports a comprehensive bronze that would not look out of place on a surfer. Whereas some of the other residents of Portage Des Sioux, Mo., who appear on screen as they help Mr. Neustadt wrangle his brood of potential brides from farmhouse to chicken coop, show ample, corn-fed bellies, Mr. Neustadt displays rippling washboard abs.“I know that I don’t look like what most people think of when you say ‘farmer,’ ” he said. When meeting women, he added, “it’s very hard to sell the fact that I am one.”“A lot of times they seem to think that I am a player,” he added, meaning that they assume that he is trying out a line instead of honestly and earnestly just trying to find a companion.Apparently it is a worldwide problem. Cousins of the “Farmer Wants a Wife” concept have been grabbing viewers throughout Europe since 2001. In the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway, the show is one of the highest-rated on television.The concept was developed by Fremantle Media, the same production company that is behind “American Idol” and other reality and game shows. Cecile Frot-Coutaz, chief executive for production of Fremantle North America, accounts for its popularity by explaining that many city women have grown tired of the urban singles scene.“They have a desire to go back to a more authentic life,” she said. “These women are tired of the dating life in the city. But it’s hard to find someone who is willing to commit.”The 10 women who are competing for Mr. Neustadt’s hand include several aspiring actors or entertainers, members of professions that might be hard to nurture in Portage Des Sioux. But most profess to be more interested in finding a soul mate than in being on television — which is why, of course, they signed up for a reality dating program.Mr. Neustadt would not say if he was still courting the woman who won the competition, which was taped a year ago. Though some of the women from the show will participate in local publicity events in the next week, the women riding down Hollywood Boulevard on Mr. Neustadt’s tractor will be models, according to Paul McGuire, a CW spokesman.The chickens, he vowed, will be real.'"

"'08-04-29,'0','A history of depression is associated with an increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease, a new study has found, especially when the depression develops before age 60.Researchers began the study with 486 men and women who did not have dementia, following them for an average of six years. A total of 134 reported a history of depression. During the study period 44 developed dementia; of those, 33 developed Alzheimer’s.People who had reported incidents of depression before age 60 were almost four times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as those who reported no depressive symptoms. Those who reported depression after 60 were more than twice as likely to develop Alzheimer’s as those who did not.“The better we understand the link between depression and Alzheimer’s, the more insight we will have into the cause of Alzheimer’s,” said Dr. Monique M. B. Breteler, the senior author. “This can allow us to develop more rational therapies.”Dr. Breteler is a professor of neuroepidemiology at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.The authors acknowledge that they depended on self-reports of depression, and that some people who had suffered mild depression may have been misclassified as having no history of it. Still, the large sample size, prospective design and complete follow-up give considerable strength to the study, published April 8 in Neurology.'"
"'08-04-29,'0','Inside the Clinton campaign, the general view is that Mr. Clinton’s more provocative statements are not calculated as Mr. Clyburn and others have suggested. But campaign aides acknowledge that they do not really know what Mr. and Mrs. Clinton discuss privately, either, nor are they certain what advice Mr. Clinton gets from advisers like Mark Penn, who lost his post as the campaign’s chief strategist last month but has not entirely departed.What is clear, among insiders, is that Mr. Clinton is playing a big — and some say expanding — role within the operation, one that might be sacrificing part of the accumulated prestige of his long public career for the cause of returning his wife (and himself) to the White House.In the early stages of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, Mr. Clinton often felt left out, according to friends. But after a series of staff changes, he has become a more visible and influential presence, associates said, and an advocate of aggressively confronting Mr. Obama. He is especially close to Cheryl Mills, a former aide to him in the White House who has taken on an increasingly influential position in Mrs. Clinton’s campaign headquarters and provides him with a much more direct line into daily campaign deliberations and strategy decisions.Likewise, Mr. Clinton has settled into something of a “bad cop” role for Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. It is not unlike that of a presidential running mate in a general election, the chief surrogate more safely positioned to attack the opposition while the candidate travels a higher road.While this is an unusual pursuit for a former president, and for a spouse, it is one that Mr. Clinton has taken to, and seems comfortable in. Not only has he been an advocate for tough and sustained attacks against Mr. Obama, he has also been the face of many of them.His purple-faced, squinty-eyed, finger-shaking tirades have been a recurring feature of the 2008 campaign, usually generating unwelcome attention, but sometimes conveying a message — that Mr. Obama’s antiwar credentials are not quite what he claims, for example — that other supporters of Mrs. Clinton might be reluctant to transmit.Within Mrs. Clinton’s campaign, the former president is the source of both great frustration and also reverence. “He is unpredictable and almost impossible to control,” said one campaign adviser, who like most people inside the Clinton campaign would discuss Mr. Clinton only on the promise of anonymity.By the same token, the adviser said, Mr. Clinton has given voice to some resentment within the campaign and among many supporters of Mrs. Clinton. It is directed at the news media, the Obama campaign and what they believe to be a double standard of scrutiny given to Mrs. Clinton relative to her chief rival.Mr. Clinton is saying what many are thinking, said Don Fowler, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a supporter of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign. “This is the most irresponsible display of prejudice I’ve ever seen on the media’s part against Hillary,” Mr. Fowler said.Still, even among some of Mrs. Clinton’s most visible supporters, feelings about the former president’s performance have been mixed at best.“He is the best surrogate any candidate could ever have,” said former Senator Bob Kerrey, who is supporting Mrs. Clinton’s campaign despite his up-and-down relationship over the years with Mr. Clinton, “and he is the worst surrogate any candidate could ever have.”While Mr. Clinton retains much of the popularity that he left office with eight years ago, there are indications that he has lost some of it, too — not to mention some of the good will he accrued in his postpresidential role as philanthropic statesman. In an ABC News survey this month, Mr. Clinton’s unfavorable rating was 51 percent; the only time that number was higher was in August 1998 — the height of the Monica Lewinsky scandal — when it was 57 percent. (The ABC survey was taken from April 10-13, before the “race card” interview of last week.)Mr. Clinton’s relationships with many of his old friends have also suffered. One of his staunchest allies during his presidency, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, was especially furious with Mr. Clinton over what he and many others believed to be a divisive performance in the approach to the South Carolina primary. He told Mr. Clinton as much in a heated phone conversation before eventually endorsing Mr. Obama. The two men have not spoken since.It was assumed, 16 months ago, that Mr. Clinton would be an unvarnished asset to his wife’s presidential enterprise. He is renowned as a champion speaker, campaigner and unifying force in a party that has not had a commanding leader since he left office. But that assumption also ignored several factors that have, to different degrees, played out in this campaign.Friends say Mr. Clinton has been ill prepared for, and somewhat stunned by, the changing media landscape he has confronted. It is a world of YouTube, blogs, cellphone cameras and blanket political coverage that did not exist during his successful presidential campaigns of the 1990s. They also mention that Mr. Clinton is eight years older, has endured major bypass surgery and has become accustomed to the more free-form and improvisational style that his globe-trotting postpresidency has allowed for.Mr. Clinton’s aides complain that he has been held to an impossible standard by a national news media that covers him only when he gets angry, trips up or goes “off message.” He is doing seven campaign events every day on behalf of his wife, said Mr. Clinton’s spokesman, Jay Carson.Yet, Mr. Carson said, “He is nonexistent as far as the press corps is concerned, except when he makes a perceived gaffe. That’s an impossible scenario for anyone.”Like many Bill Clinton loyalists, Mr. Carson is quick to posit that Mr. Clinton’s popularity on the stump far outweighs whatever harm he has done to his image.Last week, Mr. Clinton campaigned at a middle school in Oregon, chatted on a radio program in Guam, packed a high school gymnasium in North Carolina, hit several venues a day and drew hearty applause and positive local coverage.“Folks who say Bill Clinton shouldn’t be out there aren’t with him every day,” said Paul Begala, a longtime aide and friend.Mr. Begala said that most Americans still received most of their news from local television, which is considerably more generous in covering the former president than the national news media is.“If the media elite have to take him and slap him around a little bit,” he said, “that’s a small price to pay for all the good he does.”'"
"'08-04-29,'0','Lufthansa plans to expand its own all-business-class service with new flights between Munich and Dubai starting May 1, and between Frankfurt and Pune, a rapidly growing international business center in western India, starting July 1. The routes will be flown using Airbus A319 aircraft. The planes, which typically hold 124 seats in a two-class configuration, are going to be fitted with just 48 flat-bed seats.The flights will be operated for Lufthansa by PrivatAir, the Swiss business jet specialist. (PrivatAir is the company that has ordered two new long-haul Boeing 787 Dreamliners that it plans to convert into luxury business jets for charter flights.)Lufthansa plans its all-premium routes for “business centers where you wouldn’t necessarily make the commitment to a large aircraft” outfitted with two or three cabin classes, said Don Bunkenburg, director of corporate sales in North America.“We’re constantly looking for destinations that could fit this hybrid model,” he added.Lufthansa already runs all-business-class service, using 737s fitted with 44 seats between Newark and Frankfurt. The airline formerly flew all-business-class routes between Düsseldorf and New York and Chicago. But those routes have been converted to full three-class service on big Airbus A330 jets, as the market expanded from high-end business demand to a combination of business and leisure.The service between Newark and Frankfurt draws heavily from the banking and pharmaceutical businesses, Mr. Bunkenburg said.“They tend to want to fly on the long-haul flights on a larger aircraft on an established airline” and sometimes connect onward using shorter-haul business jets after reaching either Frankfurt or Newark, he said.Major established airlines play hardball in the premium markets where they make most of their money, especially on the trans-Atlantic routes.This partly explains what happened to Eos Airlines, which found itself reeling after major airlines reduced business-class fares across the Atlantic. American Airlines, for example, dropped right into Eos’s market when it started flying between New York and London Stansted last October. American recently added a second flight — and offered discounted round-trip business-class fares that competed aggressively with Eos’s in the $3,500 to $4,000 range.British Airways, meanwhile, recently extended through mid-May a sale on its trans-Atlantic Club World business-class service, with advance-purchase fares as low as $2,500 between New York and London.With major airline competitors reducing business-class fares over the Atlantic, “Eos no longer had a price advantage,” said Lawrence Hunt, the chief executive of Silverjet.'"
"'08-04-29,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — The deadline that Microsoft imposed on Yahoo to reach a negotiated merger agreement passed three days ago, and the two companies are still not talking.At a conference at Microsoft’s headquarters in Redmond, Wash., its general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, said no meetings had been scheduled between the two companies.Now all eyes are focused on Microsoft’s next move. The company warned this month that if its April 26 deadline was not met, it would seek to oust Yahoo’s board and take its offer directly to shareholders, perhaps at a lower price. The deadline passed Saturday with no sign that the two sides were negotiating.Last Wednesday, Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, raised the possibility that his company would walk away from its offer. A day later, Christopher P. Liddell, the chief financial officer, said Microsoft was not inclined to increase its offer for Yahoo and would decide this week how to proceed. A Microsoft spokesman said Monday evening that no decision had been made.If Microsoft abandons its pursuit of Yahoo, that company’s shares would probably fall. This would not preclude Microsoft from trying to reach a negotiated deal at a later date.'"
"'08-04-29,'0','Verizon Communications said on Monday that sales of more expensive wireless contracts helped drive earnings up nearly 10 percent during the first quarter, offsetting declines in traditional phone service.The carrier said it also benefited from strong demand for wireless data plans and sales of its new fiber optic television service.“Results for the first quarter were strong and demonstrate that we weathered the economic uncertainty,” Doreen A. Toben, Verizon’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts on Monday.But while the wireless business showed growth over all, the company signed on fewer new customers during the first quarter than it did during the period last year. Verizon signed up 1.5 million new wireless customers during the first quarter, beating AT&T’s 1.3 million during the period, but fewer than the 1.7 million new subscribers Verizon added a year ago.Based in New York, Verizon ended the quarter with 67.2 million wireless subscribers, behind AT&T with 71.4 million. Verizon’s churn rate — the proportion of customers who cancel their service — was 1.2 percent, the industry’s lowest rate, while AT&T’s churn rate was 1.7 percent.'"

"'08-04-30,'0','The Hornets will play the winner of the Phoenix-San Antonio series in the Western Conference semifinals. As the No. 2 seed in the playoffs, the Hornets will have home-court advantage — and may still be regarded as an underdog.It is a role they are used to, even if they do not exactly embrace it.“We came into the postseason expecting to win,” West said. “A lot of people may be surprised at how this thing turned out, but we’re not too surprised at where we’re sitting now.”West and Paul overwhelmed their more veteran counterparts on the Mavericks throughout the series. Paul was too quick and too clever for Jason Kidd; West consistently beat Dirk Nowitzki, Erick Dampier and whoever else stood in his path.On Tuesday, with their season and perhaps their coach’s job on the line, the Mavericks came up short. They never held a lead and trailed by as many as 17 points in the fourth quarter before closing within 3 with 33.2 seconds left. Had the Mavericks grabbed a missed shot by Paul, they would have had a chance to tie the score. But Tyson Chandler tipped the ball back out to Jannero Pargo, sealing the outcome.Afterward, Mavericks Coach Avery Johnson lavishly praised Paul and Hornets Coach Byron Scott — and in doing so seemed to take a slight dig at his own point guard, Kidd. Johnson called Paul “a young Nate Archibald.”“He’s relentless, he’s strong, he’s intelligent, he has a bright future,” Johnson said of Paul. “He and his coach have great chemistry. And he seems like he’s very coachable and he pretty much dominated us this series.”Paul averaged 24.6 points and 12.6 assists in the series. Kidd, who was supposed to be the missing piece to a championship team when Dallas acquired him in February, never made a major impact.Nowitzki led Dallas with 22 points and 13 rebounds Tuesday. Kidd had 14 points and 9 assists — his best game of the week. The Mavericks were eliminated in the first round for the second straight year, which could cost Johnson his job.“Um, I would hope not,” Johnson said earlier in the day. “I love what I’m doing, and I love the team.”The Mavericks spent much of the series embarrassing themselves with ill-advised comments, poor play and moments of stupefying behavior. Tuesday was no different. After Dallas cut the deficit to 8 points, Jerry Stackhouse was ejected with 1 minute 47 seconds left for smacking Paul in the ribs.Last week, Stackhouse insulted Scott during a radio program, and Josh Howard admitted to marijuana use in a separate radio interview. After Tuesday’s loss, Nowitzki acknowledged that those incidents had been a distraction. It did not help that Howard and Stackhouse played poorly in the series.“Obviously, it’s very disappointing, what happened here in the playoffs with everything,” Nowitzki said.The Mavericks fell behind by 15 in the second quarter, but pulled within 5 points in the third. The Hornets met every rally with a big shot or a big stop. Paul hit a runner and a 3-pointer late in the third, and West converted a 3-point play. And as the final seconds of the third quarter ticked away, Chandler rejected consecutive shots by Stackhouse.It was a day of contrasts and simmering conflict. Scott was given the coach of the year trophy while Kidd — who was blamed for getting Scott fired in New Jersey — politely clapped 50 feet away.“He’s well deserved for that award,” Kidd had said earlier. “He probably should have got it when he was in New Jersey.”The Hornets had their first double-digit lead late in the first quarter. Halftime arrived with the Hornets holding a 15-point lead, with Nowitzki laying on his back after losing a tussle for the ball, and with Mark Cuban, the Mavericks’ owner, shouting at the officiating crew.'"
"'08-04-30,'0','“I’ll work tirelessly to address the problem,” Mr. McCain said in a speech here at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute. “But I won’t create another entitlement program that Washington will let get out of control. I won’t do it. Nor will I saddle states with another unfunded mandate.”For people who currently get health insurance through their jobs, Mr. McCain’s plan would give them a tax credit that they could put toward buying a different, and potentially less expensive, health insurance plan tailored to their needs — and allow them to keep that health plan, and their doctors, even if they switch or lose their jobs.But Democrats and some experts said the proposal might lead some employers to stop offering health insurance, and questioned whether the tax credit would cover the cost of private insurance.Unlike Mr. McCain, of Arizona, Senators Barack Obama of Illinois and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York would make it illegal for health insurance companies to deny an applicant because of health status. They argue that such regulation is needed to end discrimination against those with pre-existing medical conditions.Mr. McCain’s speech here implicitly acknowledged some of the shortcomings of his free-market approach. But rather than force insurers to stop cherry-picking the healthiest — and least expensive — patients, Mr. McCain proposed that the federal government work with states to cover those who cannot find insurance on the open market. With federal financial assistance, his plan would encourage states to create high-risk pools that would contract with insurers to cover consumers who have been rejected on the open market.Mr. McCain was vague Tuesday about just how his safety net would be structured, and did not specify how much it might cost, leaving the details to negotiations with Congress and the states. But his top domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said in an interview that the federal share could cost between $7 billion and $10 billion — money he said could be redirected from existing federal programs that pay for uncompensated medical care, mainly in hospitals.Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that sum, when combined with contributions expected from the states and insurers, could provide coverage for the five million to seven million uninsured people that he estimates cannot obtain it because of their health or age. There are 47 million uninsured people in the United States, or 16 percent of the population.The McCain campaign said that its plan to give tax credits to encourage more people to buy insurance on the open market, instead of getting it through their employers, would not cost the government any more than the current system does. The plan calls for giving $2,500 tax credits to individuals and $5,000 credits to families to buy insurance. Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that the government would save $3.6 trillion over the next decade by eliminating the tax break that currently goes to encourage employer-based health coverage, and redirecting that money toward the individual tax credits.Those tax credits would be refundable, meaning that low-income people who do not pay income taxes would still be eligible to receive it.Mr. McCain said that his plan would foster increased competition that would in turn lead to lower costs. “Insurance companies could no longer take your business for granted, offering narrow plans with escalating costs,” he said.Some health care experts question whether those tax credits would offer enough money to pay for new health insurance plans. The average cost of an employer-funded insurance plan is $12,106 for a family, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health policy group. Paul B. Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research organization financed by foundations and government agencies, said, “For a lot of people, the tax credits he’s talking about would not be enough to afford coverage.”Mr. Holtz-Eakin said he believed that many employers would still offer health insurance to try to attract the best workers, and that other companies would use the money they save on health insurance to offer people better wages, which have stagnated as many businesses have struggled to keep up with skyrocketing healthcare costs. And he said the plan would transform the current health insurance market, and make it cheaper.Mr. McCain also wants to let people buy insurance from companies in other states, so they could shop for cheaper plans. That could lead some insurers to relocate from highly regulated states to states that would allow them to cover fewer services.Both Democratic presidential candidates sharply criticized Mr. McCain’s proposal, with Mrs. Clinton calling it “a radical plan that would mean millions of Americans would lose their job-based coverage.” And Hari Sevugan, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, described Mr. McCain’s plan as “a tax break that won’t guarantee coverage and doesn’t ensure that health care is affordable for the working families who need it most.”Jonathan B. Oberlander, an authority on health policy and politics at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said the differences between the two parties could not be starker. “You have one party saying we have to transform the health care system by regulating the insurance industry,” he said, “and the other party saying we have to transform the health care system by deregulating the insurance industry.”'"

Two other Persian Gulf nations, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have also given.Sheik Hamad said he was particularly touched by what happened here, as he explained in halting but resourceful English, in an interview at his hotel. Besides, his country hosts a big American military base that has been critical in the Iraq war, as well as to satellites of a number of American universities, and the emir cultivates tight relations with this country. Former President George Bush met him at the airport in Houston on Monday.“We saw what happened to Orleans,” the emir said in the interview. “We were watching on television. We are part of this society. It is good for everyone to help out. I really felt sorry for the people.”As he spoke, his daughter Sheikha Hind, a recent graduate of Duke, kept a watchful eye.The emir has focused his money on education here, as he has at home. “The day oil and gas will finish, we will not go back to our camels,” he said. For now though, his desert country holds the world’s third-largest proven reserves of natural gas.Sheik Hamad, not used to the attention, submitted patiently to questions while aides swirled about him. Lt. Gen. Robert Van Antwerp, commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, came to visit. Then it was off, police sirens blaring, through the streets of New Orleans.Later, at Xavier, students assembled to thank him, the university’s president, Norman C. Francis, greeted him, and the emir beamed. He had insisted on seeing the fruits of his money personally, said an American in the entourage.The emptiness of the streets had affected him, the emir said, as it does many visitors. “I really wish to see some people come back to their homes,” he said, with a bit of sadness. Brightening, he added, “I was happy to see some homes being built.”'"
"'08-04-30,'0','The McCain campaign and House Republicans, in an effort coordinated by Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the party leader, are engaging in a bit of therapy to strengthen their political marriage. Top McCain officials gathered recently with chiefs of staff to House Republicans to emphasize the idea that it is to their mutual advantage to pull together as the election unfolds.Mr. McCain has reached out more to the House leadership. Republican officials say that Mr. Boehner sought and received assurances from Mr. McCain in a private meeting in February that he would not ignore the interests of his backers in the House when pushing his policy ideas.Mr. Boehner would not comment on those discussions. But he noted that, on major topics like the Iraq war and federal spending, most House Republicans and Mr. McCain are now in sync.“Will there be an issue or two where we are going to be out of step? Sure. But we were with the Bush administration,” Mr. Boehner said. “The fact is that McCain is in a very solid position to win the White House, and Republicans are united around him.”But it was not always that way. There was no love lost between the former speaker, J. Dennis Hastert; the majority leader, Tom DeLay; and Mr. McCain. Much of it was because of the senator’s push for campaign finance changes, a crusade that Mr. Hastert considered a betrayal and led him to question publicly whether Mr. McCain was in fact a Republican.Mr. McCain also liked to ridicule Congressional earmarks, the pet projects on which Republicans were feasting. And he led a Senate investigation into the bilking of Indian tribes by the lobbyist Jack Abramoff, a source of great embarrassment and trouble for Mr. DeLay and other Republicans.“They just hated McCain’s style of politics,” said Charles Bass, a former House member from New Hampshire who now leads a moderate Republican group.Mr. McCain also complicated life for Republican leaders when, in the bungled aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, they raced to recover with a sizable emergency aid plan. He instead joined a bloc of conservatives who cautioned about adding too much of the aid directly to the deficit. Last Thursday, on a trip to New Orleans, he revisited the issue, saying Congress had been too busy putting money into home-state projects to spend enough to protect New Orleans.Republicans acknowledge that Mr. McCain often annoyed them in the past and that he sometimes seemed to take contrary views just to be contrary. But they also note that Mr. Hastert and Mr. DeLay are gone and that Republicans are trying to regain their credibility on spending restraint. Opposition to earmarks has gone from being a fringe Republican position to one the party is promoting.“His grandstanding turned out to be right on a lot of things,” said Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia. “More troops in Iraq, earmarks, cutting out some of the spending.”Many Republicans have now concluded that it is only Mr. McCain’s willingness to challenge recent Republican orthodoxy that has left him in a position to credibly contend for the White House, given public dissatisfaction with Republican leadership.“If he hadn’t disagreed with us, he wouldn’t have a chance of being president,” said Representative Zach Wamp, Republican of Tennessee. “He is the one guy who can be the candidate for us this cycle.”Mr. Wamp and others say the potential for intramural clashes with Mr. McCain is easily outweighed by the desire for a Republican president to preside over crucial matters like Supreme Court appointments and national security.But the potential for disharmony certainly exists, given the likelihood that Democrats will retain control of Congress no matter who wins the presidency, combined with Mr. McCain’s demonstrated capacity for engineering compromises, whether it be campaign finance law, immigration or the environment.“If you are a single-issue person or a really ideological person on a cluster of issues, in John McCain your ship has not come in,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina and a close McCain ally. “He will be conservative, but this hard-edge ideology that is embraced by the hard left and the hard right, John has made a career of not giving in to that.”In fact, some see a potentially divided government, with Mr. McCain on one side and a Democratic Congress on the other, as an opportunity to make major agreements. And that is a prospect that could leave some Republicans now in the McCain campaign camp out of the final picture.'"
"'08-04-30,'0','Under the new rules, a sizable number of jumbo loan would be treated by the mortgage industry in the same way as smaller conventional loans. This change — raising the ceiling for loans backed by government-sponsored housing finance agencies to nearly $730,000 in the nation’s costliest locations — was intended to bring rates down for more borrowers and stimulate the lending that is needed to get the economy moving again.The goal of making most of these jumbo loans accessible was aimed not at helping subprime borrowers, those people with spotty credit histories. Rather, it was meant for borrowers with good credit and ample down payments, but who wanted to buy a house or refinance a home loan in the costliest housing markets, like New York, San Francisco, Anchorage, Baltimore, Edwards, Colo., and Jackson, Wyo.In such markets, a two-bedroom home can easily cost more than $1 million.But the real concern over this program’s failure goes beyond people seeking million-dollar homes. The danger, economists say, is in how a wave of foreclosures and rising inventory of homes for sale will deepen and prolong the economic downturn started by the subprime mortgage crisis.In 2007, around 14 percent of new loans were jumbos, compared with 8 percent for subprime and 48 percent for traditional conforming loans, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a newsletter that tracks mortgage activity.Robert Edelstein, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said that it is essential to a healthy economy that jumbo borrowers in these upper-tier markets are able to get financing. “There could be a contagion,” he said, as the subprime woes “move up the chain.”“The housing market has to stabilize,” he said. “And in these markets large loans are needed because the values are big.”Members of Congress and people in the mortgage-backed securities industry remain optimistic about the new rules. They say it is too soon to declare success or failure. Relief, they insist, remains around the corner. They argue that the credit market that fuels home ownership must be given time to adapt to rule changes that affect billions in potential loans.This month, Freddie Mac, one of the two main government-chartered companies (along with Fannie Mae) that helps the housing market by purchasing loans in bulk from lenders, said that over the next year, it would buy up to $15 billion of the jumbo loans. That change and others that may follow, optimists argue, could lead to more loans and bring down interest rates.“We’re getting some benefit but not as much as I’d hoped,” said Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. “That will change shortly,” he said an interview. “I am confident that within a month or less, it will be fully operational.”Freddie Mac estimates the new rules could encourage $40 billion or more in loans by year’s end, which it estimates could finance new mortgages or mortgage refinancings for 50,000 or more borrowers.Despite an eager consumer base, it appears few such loans have been made, according to John Bancroft, executive editor of Inside Mortgage Finance. He expects activity to pick up as the market adjusts to the rules. “It’s going to take some time,” he said.But time may run out at the end of the year, when the system is supposed to revert to the old rules. Not surprisingly, lenders and their secondary investors are hesitant about changing their business for a short time.And rates have not dropped — at least not to the degree that many borrowers and mortgage brokers had expected. In some cases, “conforming” loans, so designated because they conform to the government-sponsored rules, are a full percentage point below the newly conforming jumbo loans intended to be covered by the new law.“It’s a complete joke,” said Jose Lemus, president of Brymus Capital, a mortgage brokerage firm in Santa Ana, Calif. He said a buyer in Southern California looking to borrow $417,000 would pay an interest rate of 5.75 percent, while someone borrowing slightly more for a conforming jumbo loan would pay an interest rate of 6.99 percent.For a jumbo loan that is not conforming, the rate could be as low as 7.35 percent for someone with excellent credit, Mr. Lemus said, but the rate for someone with average credit could be as high as 9 percent. “It’s getting harder by the day,” Mr. Lemus said.Because the rates have not fallen as Mr. Lemus and his customers had hoped, he has not processed a single loan under the new rules.Some prospective borrowers, like Nathan Menaged, 29, are skeptical that things will change. Mr. Menaged, a marketing consultant, owes about $574,000 on his Brooklyn home. He makes monthly payments of $4,000.“I thought I had some good possibilities for getting into something more comfortable,” Mr. Menaged said of the new rules, which he has been tracking with great hope since January. But the interest rates on them remain prohibitively high. If rates had fallen as he expected, he hoped to lower his monthly payments by $1,000 — money he wanted to pay for his daughter’s tuition.“It’s frustrating and it could become desperate if I don’t find an alternative in the near future,” he said. Members of the financial services community, including executives of major banks, investors and mortgage lenders, have said there are good reasons that rates are not dropping and more new-style jumbo loans are not being written. They say that jumbo rates — even “conforming” ones — are unlikely to fall completely in line with conforming rates.The reason has to do with the way loans are sold and securitized. Conforming loans carry a lower interest rate in part because lenders can package and sell those loans as mortgage-backed securities directly to either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or to private investors who know that the housing finance agencies can buy them later. And some of those loans can be sold even before they are finalized because they qualify for the “to be announced” market that allows fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities to be traded freely as interchangeable commodities.An influential trade group of the nation’s largest financial institutions, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, recently made a key decision that some critics say has kept those rates from dropping. The association decided that loans above $417,000 — even those jumbo loans now considered by law as conforming — would not be eligible to participate in the “to be announced” market.Sean Davy, a managing director at the trade association, said that lumping the new loans in with the smaller conforming ones could have created enough uncertainty and instability to drive up rates on the conventional loans.But critics in Congress counter that lenders and the mortgage-backed securities industry have dragged their feet.“I’ve been a little disappointed by the securitization people,” Representative Frank said. “What I’m told when I complain is that they have to iron out some wrinkles. It’s taken them longer to take advantage of this than I expected.”'"

"'08-04-30,'0','Footloose has been running advertisements on television as well as on YouTube warning dog owners about the hazards of traps. The group, formed last year in response to the dog trappings, is in the early stages of planning a voter initiative that would ban trapping on public lands.Trappers say the proposed restrictions, as well as those imposed in the other states, are supported by people who do not appreciate the role that trapping plays in regulating populations of fur-bearing animals, including beaver, coyotes and wolverines.They also complain the restrictions are an attack on a Western way of life. Montana issued more than 4,000 trapping licenses last year, and estimated that 47,600 animals were trapped for their pelts in 2006.“Trapping is an important part of wildlife management,” said Dave Miller, director of national and international affairs for the National Trappers Association, which claims 10,000 members. “It is very efficient and humane method of managing wildlife when properly done.”There is no way to know how many animals are caught unintentionally in traps because the episodes are often not reported and some of the animals disappear. So far this year, Footloose Montana has collected the stories of 12 dogs in western Montana caught in traps; three of them died.“The very nature of trapping is that of a land mine,” said Wayne Pacelle, president of the Humane Society of the United States, which has led campaigns in several states against trapping. “It’s indiscriminate. They catch whatever animal is unfortunate enough to trigger a device.”Trappers place some of the blame for the dog deaths on the dog owners.“Very often these are dogs that are supposed to be on a leash and are not,” said Mr. Miller of the trappers association. “Dog owners bear some responsibility.”Most of the debate has focused on three types of traps, collectively called body-gripping traps. One of them, the foothold or leghold trap, catches the paw and holds the animal until the trapper arrives and kills it. Another trap, the snare, is made from aircraft cable. It catches the animal, often by the neck, and either holds it or strangles it. The third trap, the conibear, is designed to snap onto the animal’s neck and kill it instantly.It was the killing of Cupcake, a border collie mix, in a conibear trap last winter that first spurred the anti-trapping campaign here. The dog’s owner, Filip Panusz, was hiking near Missoula on a popular trail in a national forest when the dog wandered over an embankment. Mr. Panusz said he heard a loud snap; he found the dog dying in a conibear trap that had been set in a creek.Brian Giddings, a trapper who is the furbearer coordinator for the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said such accidents are unfortunate, but not the norm. The conibear traps (named for the inventor, a Canadian trapper named Frank Conibear) are required to be set in enclosures that are supposed to block entry by dogs. The traps without such protections, he said, have been set illegally.“There are a few people who are renegades,” Mr. Giddings said. “And the illegal sets are the ones that catch the dogs. There’s always going to be a few who break the law.”There have been other episodes recently. One woman in Missoula, whose dog was caught in a conibear during a walk, struggled to free the animal but could not. She said she laid down next to her dog as it died. An emergency room doctor from Missoula had both of his bird dogs caught in traps while he was hunting. They survived. In January, a golden eagle was caught in a trap and its leg broken. It had to be destroyed.Dogs are generally easy to free from leghold traps, Mr. Giddings said, and those traps do not usually cause severe injuries. But because trappers in Montana are not required to check their traps at certain intervals, critics say a dog or other animal can spend hours or days in a trap and can break their teeth, dislocate a shoulder or tear ligaments trying to free themselves.“Many of the injured have huge vet bills,” said Jerry Black, a member of the board of Footloose Montana. “People don’t get reimbursed for this.”The stepped-up debate over trapping has also touched upon the long-standing disagreement about whether trapping is the best way to kill animals.“It’s at odds with the hunter ethic of a clean and quick kill,” said Mr. Pacelle of the Humane Society. “It’s the most inhumane form of hunting.”Trappers says traps are humane if used responsibly.“They are designed to hold the animal until the trapper can come and dispatch it,” Mr. Giddings said. “If you use the right size they will hold the animal until the trapper can come.”In particular, the conibear trap, Mr. Giddings said, “is very humane because the animal is dead in less than a minute.”The American Veterinary Medical Association recently issued an opinion on leghold traps, determining that versions with padded jaws or offset jaws — meaning the two jaws do not close tightly — are considered humane.“They can certainly cause damage, but the possibility of damage is reduced,” said Dr. Gail Golob, the group’s director of animal welfare. Unmodified leghold traps were not deemed humane; the group’s review did not address snares and conibear traps.'"
"'08-04-30,'0','“Today’s numbers were disappointing,” said David Williams, banking research chief in London for the investment bank Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller. “Deutsche’s core business, their day-to-day bread-and-butter operations, have been affected.”With the likelihood of further write-downs and the possibility that its trading business may not recover soon, some analysts have concluded that Deutsche Bank did not avoid the subprime crisis after all but is merely suffering its effects six months later than Merrill Lynch, UBS and Citigroup did.“Deutsche Bank did much better than its peers because it was less exposed to the subprime areas,” said Simon Adamson, an analyst at CreditSights, a research firm in London. “But now the focus of the write-downs has shifted, and Deutsche has a large leveraged loan book.”The bank said it had 33 billion euros ($51 billion) of exposure to leveraged finance. Mr. Di Iorio said the bank had sold 1.4 billion euros of such loans in April.Deutsche Bank, analysts said, might be forced to write down some of the remaining loans, though not as steeply as mortgage-backed securities, which essentially stopped trading as the subprime-lending crisis gathered force.Shares of Deutsche Bank, which have declined 29 percent in the last year, closed down 0.35 percent in Frankfurt trading on Tuesday.Analysts noted that the bank’s quarterly loss was smaller than those of Credit Suisse and UBS. It has written down 5 billion euros ($7.7 billion) since the start of the financial crisis, far less than UBS and Citigroup.Still, the crisis has rippled through its corporate and investment bank, which had been its profit engine. The unit had revenue of 1.5 billion euros in the first quarter, compared with 6.7 billion euros in the period a year earlier. Revenue for sales and trading of debt and equities plunged. Foreign exchange trading, which grew, was one of the few bright spots.“They are the world leader in structured credit products, and that’s a market that in the first quarter did absolutely no business,” Mr. Williams said. “What’s it going to do in the next quarters?”Some bankers have spoken of an improving atmosphere in financial markets in recent weeks. But Deutsche Bank’s chief executive, Josef Ackermann, who has been outspoken about the magnitude of the crisis, offered little solace in a statement issued with the earnings.“In the month of March, pressure on the banking sector was more intense than at any time since the current credit downturn began,” he said. “Inevitably, this left its mark on Deutsche Bank’s results.”Mr. Ackermann reaffirmed the bank’s strategy, a balance between volatile trading businesses and more stable operations, like asset and wealth management and retail banking.It may soon have an opportunity to bolster its presence in these more stable areas. Citigroup, as part of a review of its operations, is considering a plan to sell its German consumer bank, according to executives there. Deutsche Bank has expressed interest.“Citibank has a fairly good-quality operation in Germany,” Mr. Adamson of CreditSights said. “Deutsche might be able to get a favorable valuation because Citigroup has problems of its own.”'"
"'08-04-30,'0','A federal judge has dismissed a closely watched challenge to President Bush’s signature education law, ruling that the State of Connecticut failed to prove that federal officials had forced it to spend its own money to comply with the law’s requirements.The law, known as No Child Left Behind, requires states and local schools receiving federal money to demonstrate with test scores that students are making academic progress. It includes a paragraph, known as the unfunded mandates provision, that says no state or school district can be forced to spend its money on expenses the federal government has not covered.The case began in 2005, when Connecticut accused Education Secretary Margaret Spellings of violating that prohibition in directives governing the testing of students with limited English proficiency or disabilities. In a ruling issued late Monday, Judge Mark R. Kravitz of Federal District Court in New Haven wrote that although the state had provided estimates of what it would cost to comply with those testing guidelines, “nowhere did it state that the federal funding was insufficient to cover those costs.”Judge Kravitz added, “The court wishes to be clear that it has not ruled on the merits of the state’s unfunded mandates provision claim because the argument was never made.”The Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, filed the state’s challenge in 2005, when discontent with the law was bubbling up among educators and state legislators nationwide.'"

"'08-04-30,'0','Unlike Mr. McCain, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, both Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton would both make it illegal for health insurance companies to deny an applicant because of age or health status. The two Democratic rivals argue that such regulation is needed to end discrimination against those with pre-existing medical conditions.Mr. McCain’s speech here implicitly acknowledged some of the shortcomings in his free-market approach. But rather than force insurers to abandon cherry-picking the healthiest patients, Mr. McCain proposed that the federal government work with the states to cover those who cannot find insurance on the open market. With federal financial assistance, states would be encouraged to create high-risk pools that would contract with insurers to cover consumers who have been rejected on the open market.Mr. McCain was vague on Tuesday about how his safety net would be structured, and he did not specify how much it might cost, leaving the details to negotiations with Congress and the states. But his top domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said in an interview that the federal share could cost $7 billion to $10 billion — money he said could be redirected from existing federal programs that pay for uncompensated medical care, primarily in hospitals.Mr. Holtz-Eakin said that sum, when combined with contributions expected from the states, could provide coverage for the five million to seven million uninsured people who he estimates cannot obtain coverage because of their health or age. There are 47 million uninsured people in the United States, or 16 percent of the population.Mr. Holtz-Eakin said Mr. McCain had emphasized the high-risk pools in Tuesday’s speech to defend himself against recent assertions that his plan offered little hope for the most persistently uninsured people. “It’s to take on the criticism that’s been launched that he simply doesn’t care to make sure that people can get insurance when they have pre-existing conditions,” he said.The central component of Mr. McCain’s plan — the use of $5,000 tax credits to encourage people to buy their own insurance on the open market — would not cost any more money than the current system, Mr. Holtz-Eakin asserted. The plan calls for taking away the tax breaks that currently go for employer-based coverage — a move that he said would save $3.6 trillion over the next decade — and redirecting the money toward the individual tax credits. The tax credits would be refundable, meaning that low-income people who do not pay income taxes would still be eligible to receive it.Mrs. Clinton called Mr. McCain’s proposal “a radical plan that would mean millions of Americans would lose their job-based coverage.”“The McCain plan eliminates the policies that hold the employer-based health insurance system together, so while people might have a choice of getting such coverage , employers would have no incentive to provide it,” she said in a statement. “This means 158 million Americans with job-based coverage today could be at risk of losing the insurance they have come to depend upon.”'"

"'08-04-30,'0','LONDON, April 29 (Reuters) - British researchers have identified two common genetic mutations that increase the risk of osteoporosis and related bone fractures, according to a study released on Tuesday.These changes were present in 20 percent of the people studied and highlight the potential role of screening for the bone-thinning disease that mainly affects women after menopause, they said in the journal Lancet.”Eventually, a panel of genetic markers could be used in addition to environmental risk factors to identify individuals who are most at risk for osteoporotic fractures,” Tim Spector and Brent Richards, researchers at King’s College London wrote.Osteoporosis is a condition where bone density thins as more bone cells are lost than replaced when people age. It affects about one in three women and one in five men around the world, according to the International Osteoporosis Foundation.Drugs called bisphosphonates are used primarily to increase bone mass and cut the risk of fractures in patients with osteoporosis.'"
"'08-04-30,'0','Verizon’s application still needs the approval of at least five of the six members of the city’s Franchise and Concession Review Committee, which includes the mayor; the comptroller; the corporation counsel; the director of the Office of Management and Budget, a mayoral designee; and all five borough presidents. A public hearing is scheduled for May 20.Final approval from the Public Service Commission would be needed after that. If all goes well, the company expects to start selling television signals in the city by the end of the year.But that does not mean everyone will be able to buy it then. Verizon’s fiber network passes only 20 percent of the city’s 3.1 million households, Ms. Azare said. Verizon has promised to pass every home in the city with its network by June 30, 2014.But only Staten Island has near-complete coverage now. In Queens, only 15 percent of homes and apartments are within reach of Verizon’s fiber-optic lines. In Brooklyn, the rate is 12 percent. According to the company’s application, Verizon will not pass more than half the homes in all five boroughs until 2011.And Verizon is installing its fiber network in neighborhoods based not only on potential demand, but also on whether older, copper networks need to be replaced and how close those lines are to the new fiber network.Verizon and the Department of Information, Technology and Telecommunications have developed benchmarks that ensure that neighborhoods are not left behind.“We wanted to make sure they didn’t cherry-pick the wealthy areas of the city, so we set up some milestones so service gets distributed in an even way,” said Paul J. Cosgrave, the commissioner of the information department.The deadlines are fungible, though. Verizon can get a 12-month extension if certain benchmarks for signing up television customers are not met. And Verizon still must reach agreements with landlords to wire their buildings. Then Verizon’s technicians must get inside to install their fiber lines.Still, Verizon has made “a historic concession” by agreeing to pass every home in the city, said Dave Burstein, editor of DSL Prime, a newsletter about all things broadband.“What Verizon is building for New York is one of the very best networks in the world,” Mr. Burstein said. “The questions become time and price.”But Mr. Burstein raised questions about what is not in the agreement, including a promise by Verizon not to discriminate against heavy users of its network or against certain Web sites.“Verizon was going to settle for whatever the city asked because there is no way they would risk losing access to three million customers,” he said. “So there is no reason why the city couldn’t have demanded a neutral network, minimum service guarantees and lifeline prices,” or discounted prices for the most basic services.The city’s Department of Information said it had the authority only to review Verizon’s application to sell television, not to regulate its broadband network or phone service.Consumers will probably be pecked with fees and service charges, too.Verizon said it would penalize customers who have bundles of services for canceling their contracts early, as wireless companies do.Councilwoman Gail A. Brewer, a Democrat from Manhattan who is chairwoman of the Council’s Technology in Government Committee, said she worried that if Verizon failed to its meet targets for introducing service, the penalties would not be stiff enough to hurt a company with more than $90 billion in annual revenue.The Department of Information, Technology and Telecommunications is developing a formula for assessing penalties, and says Verizon has agreed to put up a $1 million security fund, a $20 million letter of credit, a $50 million performance bond and an unlimited guarantee.But Ms. Brewer is hopeful that Verizon will also contribute to a fund that will provide computers and broadband connections to low-income families, older people and others who need assistance. The fund, other city officials said, is likely to receive $4 million from Verizon.“You want to make sure you build out so the poor and rich are included,” she said.'"
"'08-04-30,'0','The suspension of the breakfast program illustrates one of the many ways that the global food crisis, in which the price of grain has soared in recent months, is hurting the world’s poorest and most vulnerable people. Only destitute schools were selected to take part in the program. Pray Viev is one of the poorest villages in Cambodia’s most impoverished province, Kampong Speu.When the free breakfast was introduced here eight years ago by the World Food Program, it was an instant hit.“Students brought their brothers and sisters, 2, 3 and 4 years old,” said Yim Soeurn, the principal at Sun Sun. “It was very hard to control.”Breakfast has been a magnet for students ever since, as well as the teachers’ best friend. Well-fed students are more attentive, tardiness is no longer a problem (breakfast is served at 6:30 a.m., before classes begin) and attendance by girls, who for years had been kept home by their parents, has increased sharply.Mr. Yim said he knew what would happen when the free food disappeared: “Poor students will not come to school.”When the breakfast program was interrupted in January 2007 because of budget problems, attendance fell by 10 percent, Mr. Yim said.Menh Veasal, a 14-year-old at the top of his class, skipped school to collect frogs and crabs from a nearby river, his contribution to meals with his parents and seven siblings. Sim Sreywat, 12, was ordered by her mother to trek to nearby mountains where she harvested tamarind buds and bamboo shoots.The imminent depletion of rice supplies is particularly paradoxical for children who each day walk or ride their bicycles to school through miles of neatly delineated rice paddies. Rice is plentiful in Cambodia, and the country has been a net exporter for the past decade.But it is becoming less and less affordable for the people who grow it. A 2006 survey, well before the spike in food prices, found that 22 percent of Cambodians in rural areas could not meet their own basic food needs.The most productive agricultural land in Cambodia is near the borders with Thailand and Vietnam, and much of what is harvested there is exported at world-market prices.But the soil in Kampong Speu Province is sandy and parched, yielding less than one ton per hectare, or 2.5 acres, half the national average. Local farmers typically have plots that are too small to feed their families.Thomas Keusters, the World Food Program’s director in Cambodia, said he did not know whether the school feeding program would restart. “Not before the next school year, October 2008, at best,” he said.Worldwide, the agency has begun an appeal for an additional $500 million to cover the increase in food prices. In Cambodia, the price of rice is now above $700 a ton, more than double the $295 per ton the agency budgeted for this year.BERN, Switzerland (AP) — The United Nations will set up a top-level task force to tackle the global food crisis and avert “social unrest on an unprecedented scale,” Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Tuesday.Mr. Ban, who will lead the task force, said its first priority would be to meet the $755 million shortfall in financing for the World Food Program.“Without full funding of these emergency requirements, we risk again the specter of widespread hunger, malnutrition and social unrest on an unprecedented scale,” he told reporters.'"
"'08-04-30,'0','BAGHDAD — Tariq Aziz, who for years was the public diplomatic face of Saddam Hussein’s government, went on trial in Baghdad on Tuesday, facing charges over the execution of Iraqi merchants during the Baathist era.Mr. Aziz, 72, who was deputy prime minister under Mr. Hussein, looked frail as he entered the court carrying a walking stick. It was the first time he has appeared to answer charges since he surrendered to American forces on April 24, 2003, two weeks after Baghdad fell to American forces.The case centers on the execution in 1992 of more than 40 Iraqi merchants who were accused by the government of price-gouging in violation of strict state controls during the time when Iraq was subject to United Nations sanctions.If convicted, Mr. Aziz faces the death penalty. Among the other defendants are Mr. Hussein’s half-brother Watban Ibrahim al-Hassan and his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid, who is known as Chemical Ali.Mr. Majid did not attend on Tuesday because of ill health after suffering a heart attack in custody. He has already been sentenced to death in another case for war crimes over his involvement in killing tens of thousands of Kurds, some by poison gas. Judge Raouf Abdul-Rahman adjourned Tuesday’s hearing until May 20, citing Mr. Majid’s absence.Speaking from Jordan by telephone, one of Mr. Aziz’s lawyers, Badie Arif, said: “It is not a solid case. They don’t even have enough to bring him to trial in the first place.”'"
"'08-04-30,'0','A broader 20-city index dropped 12.7 percent. Prices are nearly 15 percent off their high in July 2006.As foreclosures rise and mortgage lenders tighten their standards for loans, the market is expected to continue to feel the pressure of large inventories and a dearth of qualified buyers, economists said.“This is not, alas, a fluke,” Ian Shepherdson, a London-based economist at High Frequency Economics, wrote in a note to clients. “The monthly declines have been accelerating steadily over the past year and this just marks another step on the way.”The slump has hurt manufacturers, construction firms and other businesses that depend on the housing industry, forcing layoffs in some companies. It also lies at the root of the credit crisis on Wall Street, where banks were left holding investments linked to mortgages that defaulted or were downgraded.The problems are likely to weigh heavily on the nation’s overall economic growth in the first three months of 2008. Many economists think the economy slowed to a crawl in the first quarter; some predict it contracted. The government will release its first-quarter growth estimate on Wednesday. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth.The fall in home prices has also cut into Americans’ home equity and forced some homeowners to grapple with mortgages for more money than their houses are worth. The problems have contributed to a deepening gloom, reinforced on Tuesday by the grim confidence survey released by the Conference Board.The private report, which polled up to 5,000 households in April, showed Americans’ confidence in the economy fell to its lowest point since March 2003, at the start of the invasion of Iraq. The respondents also felt worse about the economy’s future prospects than at any time since the mid-1970s, and many were bracing for job losses.At just over 15 percent, the number of respondents who said they expected their income to increase in the next six months was the lowest reading since the survey began 41 years ago.A depressed consumer is likely to spend less, which will also suppress overall growth. “With house prices falling, wages failing to keep pace with inflation and job worries growing, we suspect that both confidence and spending will remain under downward pressure,” wrote James Knightley, an economist at ING Bank, in a research note.The effects of the housing slump were spread more or less evenly across the country. All 20 regions included in the Case-Shiller index recorded price declines during February, with Western cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles and San Diego showing the steepest drops.Compared with February of last year, only the Charlotte, N.C., region showed a price increase.Single-family homes in Las Vegas, Miami and Phoenix lost more than a fifth of their value over that period, according to the report, which is released by the Standard & Poor’s ratings firm.Home values in the New York City area fell 1.2 percent in February and were down 6.6 percent compared with February 2007. Homes in Washington suffered a 13 percent year-over-year decline. In both Boston and Atlanta, home prices fell about 5 percent in 12 months.David M. Blitzer, who oversees the index, said the prices would most likely keep falling. “There is no sign of a bottom in the numbers,” he said in a statement.'"

"'08-04-30,'0','BERLIN — Knut the polar bear cub abandoned by his mother was a sensation one year ago, a ball of adorable white fluff that seduced the nation and the world beyond, even landing on the cover of Vanity Fair with Leonardo DiCaprio. But lately, he has been Germany’s problem cub more than its darling.As the bear has grown from a virtual living stuffed animal into a 350-pound adolescent, newspapers here have taken issue with everything from Knut’s weight to his sexuality, with one paper asking if the bear is gay. But the most enduring question is the one posed by animal-protection groups from the very beginning: how being hand-raised by humans would affect him when he grew up.When Knut was nuzzling his handler, Thomas Dörflein, to the delight of an adoring public, the objections of outside experts were brushed aside. His antics weren’t bad for business either, bringing in an estimated $8 million in extra revenues for the Berlin Zoo last year.But times change, cubs grow up and those experts may have been on to something after all. “With Knut, it’s clear that he has imprinted on humans, and when neither his keeper nor visitors are there he cries out,” said Thomas Pietsch, a biologist and expert on wild animals for the animal-welfare group Four Paws in Germany. Peter H. Arras, a zoologist and animal-protection advocate put it more succinctly: “He’s a psychopath addicted to human attention.”That attention has fallen off significantly. Knut is now too large and too strong to play with Mr. Dörflein. And the largest crowds of spectators have moved south. In the Bavarian city of Nuremberg, a new young cub named Flocke, or Snowflake, claimed the crown of cuteness when she was introduced to the public earlier this month. A third cub in Stuttgart, named Wilbär, is being brought up the old-fashioned way, by his mother.'"
