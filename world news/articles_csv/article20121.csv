"'12-01-01,'0','Landry Fields had a breakout game with 21 points. And Toney Douglas (17 points) settled into his playmaker role, dishing out 8 assists and connecting repeatedly with Chandler. The Knicks thus salvaged a three-game trip that started with losses to Golden State and to the Los Angeles Lakers.“I thought Toney played like he did last year,” Coach Mike D’Antoni said, praising the young backcourt of Douglas and Fields. “They will be products of, if the ball moves, they’ll play better.”For the first time in three games, the ball did move, to the tune of 26 assists, with Anthony contributing five and Bill Walker six. It helped, too, that the Knicks played a Sacramento team that seems to lack an identity at either end of the court.Marcus Thornton led the Kings with 14 points. Tyreke Evans, the former rookie of the year, had only 13 points. Jimmer Fredette, the rookie sensation who has energized Kings fans, had only 7 points, going 2 for 10 from the field.The best rookie on the floor, though, was Harrellson, who was taken with the 45th pick last June — 35 picks after Fredette. He made his first attempt, a 3-pointer, then hit three more from the arc, finishing 5 for 11 from the field.“It’s a big honor for me, and I hope I did well,” Harrellson said of replacing Stoudemire.Aside from the big shots, Harrellson held DeMarcus Cousins, his former teammate at Kentucky, largely in check. Cousins had 9 points and 11 rebounds.“I stopped one of the best big men in the league,” Harrellson said, adding later, “I’ve improved since I played with him, and he didn’t know really what I could do out there.”Stoudemire called his injury “a typical ankle sprain” but his status for Monday’s home game against Toronto is uncertain.D’Antoni had few options. He chose Harrellson for his beefy build and 3-point shot but added before tip-off: “It’s a little sight unseen. I don’t know yet.”Three minutes after tip-off, Chandler was on the bench with two fouls, and the Knicks’ vaunted frontcourt was reduced to Anthony and two second-round picks, Harrellson and Jerome Jordan. Against any other team, that might have been a reason to shudder.Despite the patchwork lineup, the Knicks promptly went on a 15-0 run — including three 3-pointers from Douglas — to take an early 20-10 lead. The Knicks pushed the lead to 22 points without a single basket from Anthony, who did not convert until the 6-minute-11-second mark of the second quarter.The Kings found their stride around that time, with Jason Thompson igniting a surge that cut the deficit to 12 points. Anthony kept the Knicks in control, scoring 12 points in the period as the Knicks took a 56-42 lead into halftime.When the Kings pulled to 14 behind in the fourth, Chandler responded with an 8-point burst in 71 seconds, twice converting off feeds from Douglas and once from Walker.“I’m really trying to get in rhythm with my guards, trying to get my guards used to playing with me,” said Chandler, who had his highest point total since Feb. 26, when he was with Dallas.The Knicks are trying to increase Chandler’s offensive role to take some pressure off Stoudemire and Anthony and to open the floor.“If we can get ever get them one on one” with defenders, Chandler said, “because we play basketball like we did tonight, it’s a nightmare for teams.”Iman Shumpert (knee) and Jared Jeffries (calf) are making steady progress and will be re-evaluated Monday. Jeffries is walking without pain and could resume running if doctors clear him. It is possible he could be playing by the end of the week. Shumpert said he was “ahead of schedule” and was cleared to shoot jumpers before the game while wearing a knee brace. He could be a week or two away from returning. “Man, I’m very optimistic,” he said.'"
"'12-01-01,'0','“It is a sad and tragic way to end the year,” Mr. Green said. “Over time, he became a certified explosives expert for A.T.F. who oversaw and assisted in conducting explosives training for law enforcement here in the United States, but also volunteered to travel overseas to Afghanistan and Iraq as part of A.T.F.’s explosives training for our troops in the military and police in those countries.”Special Agent Capano was married, lived on Long Island and had two children, a daughter who is in high school and a son who is in college. His father is a retired law enforcement officer, Mr. Green added.It was just before 2 p.m. on Saturday when a man walked into the drugstore, said Officer Maureen Roach, a Nassau County police spokeswoman. She did not say if the man was armed.“He was demanding OxyContin and cash,” said Lt. Kevin Smith of the Nassau County police, adding that he did not know how much was stolen.There were customers in the store at the time of the robbery, Lieutenant Smith said, though he said he did not know how many.A law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was unresolved, said the preliminary accounts indicated that after the man left the pharmacy, he went to a parking lot, and people pointed him out as the possible robber. Special Agent Capano then confronted the man.Somehow in the struggle between Special Agent Capano and the robbery suspect shots were fired, “and that is when the agent is shot,” the official said.Next door to the pharmacy is a deli that, according to the official, was believed to be owned by a retired Nassau County police officer or detective. Some people from the pharmacy ran into the deli and told the people there what had happened. Also in the deli was an off-duty member of the New York Police Department, the official said.“They come out and see these guys struggling,” the official said.The official said it was believed that either the retired Nassau officer or the off-duty New York officer shot at the struggling men. The suspect was hit by gunshots and was fatally wounded.It is not clear if Special Agent Capano was shot then or if he had been wounded in the struggle with the suspect. He was taken to Nassau University Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.Ryan Lecertosa, 24, was on his way home when he drove past the pharmacy Saturday afternoon and heard several gunshots. He said he saw a large man in front of the shop with a blood-soaked shirt.“He was holding his chest, and then he collapsed,” Mr. Lecertosa said, adding that the man was instantly surrounded by about six people.As the authorities try to establish just what happened, they will have to collect whatever guns were present, and try to figure out who fired, and how many shots. They will check the ballistics. Autopsies will be performed. Among the questions will be what bullets caused what wounds. Eyewitness accounts will be gathered, as well as any admissions made spontaneously, if they were.Asked for details about the shooting and whether New York police officers were somehow involved, Detective Brian Sessa, a New York Police Department spokesman, said: “We are looking into it. It is not our investigation; it is Nassau County’s investigation. We’re looking into it.”The episode aroused memories of the shooting deaths last June of four people inside a pharmacy in Medford, N.Y., several miles east of Seaford, in Suffolk County. The killer, David S. Laffer, 33, pleaded guilty in September to first-degree murder. After killing the four — a pharmacist, a clerk who was still in high school and two customers — he fled the store with thousands of pain pills.That crime, described by prosecutors as one of the most horrific in the history of Suffolk County, appeared to have been a severe example of a national epidemic involving drugstore robberies by prescription drug addicts.'"
"'12-01-01,'0','Florida will be without the starting right tackle Matt Patchan against Ohio State in the Gator Bowl.Coach Will Muschamp said Patchan injured his upper back during practice and had been ruled out for Monday’s game.Xavier Nixon, who has struggled all season and was eventually benched, will most likely start in Patchan’s place. The Gators could also be without guard Dan Wenger, who has missed practice with an ankle injury.'"
"'12-01-01,'0','Hendry is a good man, and his nine-year tenure as general manager had its moments. But in going big-time to replace him — Theo Epstein? the Cubs? — Tom Ricketts made an undeniably shrewd move. He restored hope. It’s the currency of the sports culture in Chicago.And it disappeared at Soldier Field about three series into Caleb Hanie’s second start as Jay Cutler’s replacement as the Bears quarterback.With Cutler, the Bears had the sharp look of a playoff team. Without him — and without Matt Forte, Johnny Knox and a couple of starting offensive linemen — they’re almost unwatchable.Now the blame game is under way in earnest: Jerry Angelo, Mike Martz and Lovie Smith must pay for this failing, preferably in that order. In the court of talk-radio opinion, a wholesale housecleaning is mandatory, one year after the Bears played for the N.F.C. championship.Upon further review, they probably weren’t as good as they looked last season, when remarkably good health and some lucky scheduling breaks eased their way, or as bad as they’ve looked in the last month, as Cutler’s absence underscored his stature as a franchise quarterback.Hanie? Uh, no. The reaction is rather personal among those of us who believed he had enough talent and moxie to salvage a playoff appearance; sports scribes don’t like to admit it when they’re wrong. But it happens.At the 1986 Final Four in Dallas- — Louisville over Duke in the title game — I remember feeling bad for Mike Krzyzewski as the jubilant Cardinals cut down the nets.I had quietly been pulling for Krzyzewski as a fellow Chicago guy, and he had groomed this Johnny Dawkins-Mark Alarie-Jay Bilas group for big things since they were freshmen.Now the three would be moving on, and I wondered if Krzyzewski had missed his one shot at glory, given Duke’s lofty academic standards and the relentlessly competitive Atlantic Coast Conference. Four national championships, 11 Final Fours and an Olympic gold medal later, Coach K is the undisputed king of college basketball, at least. In November, as he was about to surpass Bob Knight’s record for career victories, ESPN’s fawning coverage would have you believe he cured cancer at halftime of the 2010 Carolina game and brokered Middle East peace during a TV timeout.He is coaching basketball. There are high school guys who do that and also teach history, sweep out the gym and wash uniforms. And they don’t make $4 million a year.Myth-making in sports is as old as the games themselves, but the practice seemed to reach new heights (or depths) in 2011, with alarming consequences. It is fair to ask if some of what Jerry Sandusky is supposed to have done could have been prevented if preserving the Legend of Joe Pa hadn’t been such an unquestioned imperative at Penn State.Derrick Rose is 62 years younger than Joe Paterno, but his canonization process has begun. Rose, the Bulls’ fourth-year point guard is a great basketball player and a great story, a product of Chicago’s downtrodden Englewood neighborhood, imbued with the will and the drive to escape the mean streets that have claimed too many other promising young men.He is also a decent, grounded guy whose humility and gratitude came through at a recent news conference announcing a five-year, $94 million contract extension that should provide nicely for generations of Roses.But that’s not enough. We want Rose to transform Englewood, eradicate poverty, unemployment and gangs, turn it into a model community of Derrick Rose-caliber citizens.That’s a lot to ask of a 23-year-old who spent one year in college.Rose is a kid, a kid who happens to be an amazing basketball player, to the delight of his hometown. A good kid, too. Let’s say that’s enough for 2012. He’ll get the rest of it.'"
"'12-01-01,'0','For the average American driver, the time wasted in traffic jams has more than doubled in 30 years. The best way of easing that gridlock — not to mention saving gas, curbing pollution and finally finishing that novel — is public transit.Yet, as more Americans are sensibly leaving their cars at home and opting for the bus or train, mass transit is in deep financial trouble. “We are going over the cliff,” Elliot Sander, chairman of the Regional Plan Association, said recently. “We will be back where we were in the 1970s and 1980s, where the older systems across the country are literally falling apart.”That alarm is not an idle one. But it comes with one piece of good news: the number of trips taken annually on public transit is now more than 10 billion and rising, compared with 7.8 billion trips in 1995, outstripping population growth and the number of miles traveled on streets and highways.Ridership, which dipped during the recession in 2009, is rising again as more baby boomer retirees take buses and high gas prices push more people to try the thriftier option. Even some cities in areas dominated by cars — like Dallas and Salt Lake City — have expanded their public transit systems.The problem is, financing for mass transit has not kept pace as cash-strapped state and local governments limit their support. The federal government, which provides only about 17 percent of financing for transit systems, should be doing a lot more, particularly since nearly 60 percent of rides are related to work, with commuters from every income level.'"
"'12-01-01,'0','Mr. Butters said the modest 2012 growth projection for the overall S.& P. was dependent on financial sector earnings climbing by around 25 percent this year. Last year, banks, brokers and insurers collectively saw their profits rise just 6 percent. The forecast also depends on tech sector profits expanding by around 10 percent this year.“The question is, do people have a lot of confidence that financial companies will perform so well?” he asked. As for technology, Mr. Butters pointed out that one tech leader, Oracle, recently reported worse-than-expected revenue growth, which could be a harbinger of the challenges faced by the broader tech sector as well as the general economy.Technology revenue growth, for instance, is expected to slow to 7 percent this year from 12 percent in 2011. Similarly, sales growth for the entire S.& P. 500 is expected to slow to around 4 percent in 2012, a sign that the global economic slowdown is starting to seep into corporate results. Global gross domestic product growth is expected to slip to 2.7 percent this year, from 3 percent in 2011, according to IHS Global Insight.So if investors can’t rely on strong earnings growth or a rapidly expanding economy, what’s left to keep the bulls hopeful?One possible answer may be dividend growth, market observers say.“In an environment where economies around the world are slowing, growth is starting to get scarce,” said Thomas Huber, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, “and interest rates are so low, it makes sense to focus on companies that can grow their dividends over time.”Unlike corporate profits, which rebounded to record levels last year, overall dividends paid by domestic companies have yet to recover fully to the highs reached before the global financial crisis. Yet that could change early this year. S.& P. 500 dividends are expected to grow by nearly 11 percent in 2012, said Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at Standard & Poor’s. “The dividend story is good and should continue to be good,” he said.Yes, there is always the possibility that companies could reverse course and cut their payouts to shareholders. “But if companies cut, forget dividends — that’s a sign that the economy is really shot,” he said.MR. SILVERBLATT says one reason for continued strength in dividends is that companies are sitting on record amounts of cash. And “companies have been pounding their chests about the importance of dividends, yet the dividend payout ratio is a little under 30 percent,” he said, referring to the percentage of earnings that corporations are passing along to shareholders as dividends.Historically, he said, the payout ratio has hovered around 50 percent for S.& P. 500 companies.Low interest rates are another reason that investors are likely to focus on dividend growth. Since 1962, the dividend yield of the S.& P. 500 has averaged about 40 percent of the yield on 10-year Treasury notes. Today, however, the S.& P. is paying more, dividend-wise, than 10-year Treasuries.In such an environment, market strategists say, investors tend to lean toward dividend-paying stocks. And if corporate profit growth slows as expected, that interest will only grow.'"
"'12-01-01,'0','“If I try one quick fix and it doesn’t work, I may be more likely to try the next quick fix,” says Lisa Lahey, the co-founder of Minds at Work, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., which coaches executives and educators in sustained behavior change.Supposed easy remedies like celebrity diets hold a powerful allure, but they rarely work in the long term, she says. After all, it’s hard for people to shake the underlying conditions — like stress or anxiety — that cause unwanted habits. If exercise tapes, dietetic meals, nicotine lozenges and personal finance apps worked by themselves, we’d all be fit, thin, smoke-free and rich.The hard work of changing a lifestyle isn’t as alluring as dropping 30 pounds in 30 days. But some stop-smoking and weight-loss programs, as well as gyms, are trying to help for the long haul, a strategy that can improve customers’ chances of success and, for companies like Weight Watchers International, build brand loyalty and revenue.JANUARY is the most important month of the year in the health club industry. At many gyms, new memberships double. Given that about a third of all members tend to turn over every year, the resolution crowd is crucial.“The resolutioners always pop up,” says Scott Hamann, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets covering the fitness industry.But you probably know what happens next. Only a fraction of members work out twice a week or more, despite all those monthly dues. Health clubs in the United States had more than 50 million members and revenue of $20.3 billion in 2010, according to the latest data from the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, an industry trade group. But clubs reported that members typically visit only 54 times, or slightly more than once a week.People might want to do the math before joining a gym, says Stefano DellaVigna, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and a co-author of a study titled “Paying Not to Go to The Gym.” From an economics standpoint, he says, many people would be better off paying per visit than signing up for a rolling monthly membership. People who seldom use their pay-by-the-month plans often don’t get around to canceling them, the study found.“People overestimate their future attendance,” Professor DellaVigna says. “They are not getting their money’s worth.”In any given month, one-fifth of a gym’s members are typically inactive, club executives say. These no-shows are great customers for the gyms.“You don’t have any equipment depreciation,” says Sean Naughton, an analyst at Piper Jaffray. “You don’t have anybody who has to service them — other than charging their credit or debit card every month.”Still, some health clubs are trying to have their customers visit the gym more regularly.“Most of these businesses want to sign you up and hope you don’t show up,” says Scott M. Rosen, the chief operating officer of Equinox, the upscale fitness chain. At Equinox, he says, members not working out for two weeks automatically receive an e-mail from a club manager inviting them — nudging them, you might say — to come back. “We want you to be engaged and we want you to get results.”Town Sports International, the company behind the Washington, Philadelphia, Boston and New York Sports Clubs, offers a 30-day trial membership for $30 — long enough for most newcomers to figure out whether they are ready to make workouts a regular habit, says Robert J. Giardina, the company’s chief executive. More than 100,000 people have tried the 30-day plan.“Exercise isn’t easy. Most people don’t like it,” Mr. Giardina says. “But if they can get past a certain point — usually it’s about two months or 12 workouts — they get committed.”Life Time Fitness, a family-oriented chain with more than 1.3 million members, tries to engage people by helping them find activities they enjoy so they’ll make them a habit. Its 100,000- to 200,000-square-foot clubs, mostly in suburban locations, offer fitness, basketball leagues, racquetball, swimming, yoga, tennis, Pilates as well as weight-loss programs and spa treatments.“It’s about getting over the hump of making New Year’s resolutions,” says Jeff Zwiefel, the company’s executive vice president.To reinforce its message, Life Time has “membership engagement advisers” who call new members at regular intervals during the year. In 2010, the company had revenue of $913 million.THE idea that we can transform ourselves is deeply ingrained in American culture. Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography described a self-improvement plan that he devised for himself as a young man. It included virtues to which many of us still aspire: control stress (“Be not disturbed at trifles,” Franklin wrote); get organized (“Let all of your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time”); and show some temperance (“Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation”).But Franklin didn’t have to cope with home shopping channels and the local drive-through McDonald’s. Americans spent about $26 billion on diet soda, prepackaged diet dinners and artificial sweeteners in 2010, along with about $1.2 billion on diet books and exercise videos, and about $3.3 billion on commercial weight-loss programs, according to Marketdata estimates. Despite all that, people generally lose only modest amounts of weight and have difficulty keeping it off, says Kelly D. Brownell, the director of the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity; human biology and the current food environment, he says, are stacked against us.But some programs promote themselves as helping people navigate our national menu of cheap, fattening food. Weight Watchers has long promoted a multipronged approach — with a flexible diet, based on its own point system, along with weekly educational meetings.Yet Weight Watchers, too, ramps up advertising and marketing around New Year’s, says Cheryl L. Callan, the company’s senior vice president for marketing. Rather than heavily promote prepackaged diet foods, as some of its competitors do, she says, Weight Watchers concentrates on helping people learn healthier routines “until they become second nature.” It is devoting more resources to its Web site and to mobile apps, like a new supermarket barcode scanner, that help people navigate restaurant menus or grocery stores.Members using its digital tools, in addition to attending meetings, lose significantly more weight than people who only attend meetings, Ms. Callan says. Weight Watchers had revenue of about $1.4 billion in the first three quarters of 2011, compared with about $1.1 billion in the same period of 2010.But there is little evidence of the long-term effectiveness of commercial weight-loss programs, obesity researchers say. A study financed by Weight Watchers that was published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2003 concluded that overweight and obese people who attended Weight Watchers weekly lost only about six pounds, on average, after two years. Still, that was better than people in a comparison group who received self-help information and two counseling sessions, who, on average, lost less than one pound over the period.JANUARY is known as “the quitting season” in the smoking-cessation business.Americans spent about $522 million on over-the-counter nicotine replacement lozenges, gum, skin patches and other anti-smoking products in the 12 months ended Nov. 27, according to the SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm that tracks product sales. During the first week in January, however, sales of the NicoDerm CQ patch, as well as of Nicorette gum and lozenges, typically jump by about 40 percent, according to GlaxoSmithKline, which markets those brands.“January is a key time for us,” says Sue Kelsey, the company’s marketing director for consumer smoking-cessation brands.Only about 3 to 8 percent of smokers quit on their own, says Dr. Anne M. Joseph, a professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota who studies smoking cessation. While nicotine replacement doubles the chance of success, most smokers don’t quit. Even under controlled conditions during medical studies, only about 20 percent of volunteers assigned to use nicotine replacement products kicked the habit, she says.“We don’t yet really have a magic bullet, to be blunt about it,” Dr. Joseph says.GlaxoSmithKline has just introduced a program at Walmart with QuitNet.com, a leading smoking-cessation Web site. Walmart is offering a 90-day premium membership to the site for $10. But shoppers who buy Nicorette and NicoDerm can get free membership to the site through a rebate. The drug maker has also joined with some national drugstore chains to make pharmacists available to counsel smokers on strategies and products for quitting.“What you will see around Jan. 1 is a whole bunch of ads for nicotine replacement therapy, because those are commercial products,” says William Riley, a program director at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute who oversees tobacco research.Meantime, he says, government resources, like the 1-800-QUIT-NOW hot line and a Web site, smokefree.gov, are available at no cost. Last year, the federal government introduced a program, called SmokefreeTXT. Smokers signing up for it receive free text messages encouraging their efforts to quit and offering practical advice. People who are having particular difficulties, like a craving or a relapse, can receive additional support by texting the service.“The nice thing about text messages is that they are proactive,” says Lorien C. Abroms, an assistant professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University. “They come to you.” A recent study in Britain reported that one such text message program doubled a smoker’s chance of quitting.LAST month, I read five self-help books. I went to the gym six times. I took yoga and Pilates and meditation and Zumba classes. I de-cluttered my apartment and downgraded from cappuccino to espresso.But making resolutions stick isn’t just a matter of changing your mind-set. It’s also a matter of economics. Many people need better incentives, economists say.In one study at the University of California, Santa Barbara, economics researchers gave students a handout on the benefits of exercise. Then they divided the students into three groups. One group was paid $25 to go to the university’s gym once during one week; the second got an extra $100 to go eight more times over the next four weeks; the third group got no money at all.Even after the payment period expired, some students continued to work out. Shocker: the students who were paid the most money hit the gym more than twice as often as those who got nothing. The researchers concluded that money might work as an incentive to help people move past thresholds so they can form new habits.Health clubs, for one, might consider new business models that reward people for gym attendance, says Professor DellaVigna at Berkeley. Gyms could charge higher membership fees, he says, while offering rebates of $10 or $20 whenever a member worked out twice or more during a week.While industries are profiting from all those failed resolutions, giving customers an incentive to keep their promises might be good for business, too, says Professor DellaVigna.“None of this has yet become a business,” he says. “But, if one of these approaches is successful, I have no doubt that companies will jump on it.”'"
"'12-01-01,'0','Re “Reinvention and Survival, Circa 1915” (Dec. 25), Nancy F. Koehn saw several business leadership lessons in the failed expedition of the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton.In describing Shackleton and his crew, the article said that “whatever came before them on the ice, their leader would give his all to bring them home alive.” Today, however, chief executives fail to understand that this is a leader’s primary responsibility.Corporate tyrants are laying off employees the minute the value of their own stock options threatens to decrease by a penny. Driven by greed, these executives lack what your article called a “credible commitment to a larger purpose and flexible, imaginative methods to achieve a goal,” where the larger purpose is the prosperity of the human race as a whole, not the magnitude of their personal portfolios.In the article, Professor Koehn says Shackleton’s ability to adapt to new circumstances could be applied to various recent events: the financial crisis of 2008, the gulf oil spill and the Japanese nuclear disaster.That’s not the right message. The right message is a little thinking ahead can prevent crises.Shackleton led a disastrous misadventure to traverse the South Pole, and didn’t listen to warnings. While reacting correctly to a crisis is admirable, thinking ahead to prevent the crisis is a lot better.Looking at the 2008 financial crisis, why did we previously relax regulations on financial institutions? As for the oil spill, why did we not have strong controls on offshore drilling? And in the case of the nuclear disaster, why build a nuclear plant on the coast in an earthquake zone?'"
"'12-01-01,'0','A pair of NASA spacecraft are slipping into orbit around the Moon this weekend to try to answer persistent questions about Earth’s celestial companion.How did the Moon form? Is the lunar core still molten? And why is the Moon such an uneven lump?Over the decades, more than 100 spacecraft have gone to the Moon, “and yet we still don’t know why the front side of the Moon looks different than the back side of the Moon,” said Maria T. Zuber, the mission’s principal investigator.The side of the Moon that faces Earth is flat and mostly smooth. The other side is mountainous.“So, to me,” said Dr. Zuber, a professor of geophysics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, “if you’ve taken a hundred spacecrafts’ worth of measurements and you still don’t know the answer to something fundamental like that, then it’s likely the answer isn’t on the surface, it’s somewhere else. We’re making a bet here, by really learning the internal structure very well, that we’ll be able to answer those questions.”This $496 million NASA mission, called the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory, or Grail, will conduct a single measurement: a map of the Moon’s gravitational field. But it will do it with such precision that scientists will get a clear picture of the interior.Grail consists of two identical spacecraft that were launched side by side on a rocket on Sept. 10. Instead of taking a direct three-day trip to the Moon, they followed a longer, lower-energy trajectory that headed toward the Sun before looping back to cross paths with the Moon.Grail-A entered an elliptical orbit of the Moon Saturday afternoon. Grail-B is to follow on Sunday at 5:05 p.m., when it will be time for a belated New Year’s party for the mission team of 60 people.'"

"'12-01-01,'0','Despite its opium-haze ambience and luxuriant imagery — the gifted cinematographer is Josée Deshaies, Mr. Bonello’s wife — the film remains clear-eyed about the situation of its characters, indentured servants who incur mounting debts to a generally sympathetic madam (Noémie Lvovsky). They may share a sisterly camaraderie, and some have escaped crueler fates, but for these women the threat of violence and disease is ever present — and only getting worse.The act of savagery that opens and haunts the movie, perpetrated against the prostitute the others call “the Jewess” (Alice Barnole ), amounts to the original sin of the 20th century. Mr. Bonello situates his film at a precise moment in time: what two title cards describe as “the twilight of the 19th century” and “the dawn of the 20th century.” The patrons of L’Apollonide casually invoke the scandals and fads of the day: the Dreyfus Affair, H. G. Wells’s “War of the Worlds,” the brand-new Paris Métro.But time is always in complicated, dreamlike flux in “House of Pleasures,” which circles back and forward and sometimes folds in on itself. A period film reflects not only the time in which it is set but also the historical understanding of the time in which it is made, and Mr. Bonello closes the gap between then and now with, among other devices, anachronistic soundtrack selections: vintage Atlanta R&B over the credits, “Nights in White Satin” for the emotional climax.At once bracing and romantic, this evocation of an irretrievable past crystallizes a simple truth that has eluded so many other costume dramas: what we think of as history was, for those who experienced it, nothing more or less than life.The Atacama Desert, a cloudless, craggy plateau on the north Chilean coast, is one of the most arid places on the planet, but it proves to be fertile ground for the filmmaker Patricio Guzmán and his career-long project on remembrance as a moral imperative. Since his landmark three-part documentary, “The Battle of Chile” (1978), Mr. Guzmán has been a steadfast chronicler of the occluded horrors of the Augusto Pinochet regime, rallying against what he sees as the convenient amnesia of his still-traumatized country.His latest essay film, “Nostalgia for the Light,” derives both its metaphysical and its political force from the associations that it forges between those who spend their days digging into the barren Atacama earth and those who spend their nights gazing up at the crystalline sky.Its altitude and climate make this edge-of-the-world landscape a rich repository of history in more ways than one. Astronomers, exploiting the transparency of the atmosphere, study unthinkably distant constellations whose light has traveled for eons before reaching us. Archeologists uncover petroglyphs of millennia-old civilizations and ruins of 19th-century mines, preserved in the humidity-free air. And, seeking traces of a more recent but no less shrouded era, women whose loved ones were executed and supposedly buried in the desert during Pinochet’s murderous reign comb the pitiless expanse of sand and rock for human remains.All these quests, as Mr. Guzmán observes in his ruminative narration, are attempts to reckon with the past, on vastly different scales. The wonder of “Nostalgia for the Light” is how it entwines and juxtaposes these perspectives, shifting telescopically from the immensity of the universe to the vagaries of human memory, reminding us that the calcium in the stars is the very material in our bones. Ultimately it’s a movie that obeys what Mr. Guzmán calls memory’s “gravitational force.” Here, as in many of his films, the past exerts a pull, but it also illuminates the present, and our obligations in the here and now.The council estate — as the housing project is called in Britain — has always loomed large in British cinema, a brutalist emblem of working-class life in any number of kitchen-sink dramas. This last year alone it served as a backdrop in movies as different as “Tyrannosaur” (a Gothic tragedy), “The Arbor” (a documentary) and “Weekend” (a gay romance).But this setting has perhaps never been reimagined with the nerve and verve of Joe Cornish’s feature directing debut, “Attack the Block.” Here an imposing but run-down South London tower block — “the endz,” in the parlance of the local teenagers — comes under siege by furry aliens with glow-in-the-dark fangs. “Attack the Block” invites comparisons with another 2011 kids-versus-aliens romp, J. J. Abrams’s Steven Spielberg homage, “Super 8.” But this brisk, scrappy action-adventure owes much less to Mr. Spielberg’s nostalgic child’s-eye view (Mr. Cornish, as it happens, was a writer of Mr. Spielberg’s “Adventures of Tintin”) than to filmmakers like Joe Dante and John Carpenter, who spike their B-movie thrills with tongue-in-cheek subversions and offhand social commentary.Mr. Cornish complicates viewer sympathies by opening with a mugging. A few teenage hooligans, black and mixed race, hold up a young white woman at knifepoint. These thugs turn out to be the film’s heroes (their brooding leader, Moses, is played by John Boyega , above in foreground, surely a future star), and their incensed victim is forced into an uneasy alliance with them when an interspecies turf war breaks out.It’s too glib to suggest, as some have, that this picture of turmoil in multicultural Britain presaged last summer’s London riots. But while “Attack the Block” never strains for relevance, it shows a keen awareness of its milieu: how race, class and gender govern life in these parts. The way the kids respond to the extraterrestrial threat — with self-sufficient bravado — has everything to do with what they’ve learned to expect. “Feels like just another day in the endz,” one of them says. The secret weapon of this alien-invasion movie is not special effects but social reality.The most salient thing about the addictive, preposterously ambitious Argentinian film “Historias Extraordinarias” (“Extraordinary Stories”) is that it runs more than four hours: a thicket of stories within stories that follow three main characters over 18 chapters and dozens of subplots involving scores of secondary figures, locations on two continents, multiple cross-pollinated genres, telenovela-ready cliffhangers and a live lion. The second most salient thing is that this elaborate superproduction is proudly homemade: written and directed by Mariano Llinás, right, who also co-starred and composed the de facto theme song, all for the grand sum of $50,000.The marathon duration is crucial for a movie about the Scheherazade-like seduction of an endlessly unfolding tale. And the microscopic budget helps demonstrate Mr. Llinás’s evident belief that ingenious storytelling is often economical, combining minimum information with maximum insinuation.(Completed in 2008 and the subject of a cult following at home — it played for more than a year at a Buenos Aires cinémathèque — the movie received a belated New York run last spring.)Scenes with barely any dialogue are blanketed in a conspiratorial voice-over that sometimes wryly anticipates the action (“This is what’s going to happen”) and sometimes subtly undermines it. The three main characters, known only as X, Z and H, never meet, but their circumstances come to mirror one another. One suddenly goes from witness to perpetrator of a crime he doesn’t understand; another is a bureaucrat piecing together the secret life of his dead predecessor; the third gets a job photographing riverside stone markers that someone else seems bent on destroying.All three, given the task of making narrative sense of situations that lack obvious meaning, are effectively acting out an allegory on the uses and abuses of fiction. Drawing on Argentina’s rich literary heritage — the forking paths of Borges, the hopscotch patterns of Julio Cortázar — Mr. Llinás pulls off the rarest of cinematic feats. “Historias Extraordinarias” is a movie that instills in its characters and viewers alike a deep hunger for stories.'"
"'12-01-01,'0','IF you want to stir things up at an Occupy Wall Street encampment, mention that Bentleys and Rolls-Royces are selling like truffle-infused hotcakes. But executives at those storied British brands say their success is not just a 1 percent solution; brisk sales of ultraluxury models, you see, bode well for the masses that drive Chevys.The recession may have sidelined some buyers in the fund-manager class, but Bentley’s sales around the world zoomed roughly 30 percent in 2011. And over at Rolls-Royce, the new Ghost — a mere $250,000, but hardly downscale — paced the brand to a global sales record, said David Archibald, president of Rolls-Royce Motor Cars North America. That total, some 3,500 cars, follows a record 2,711 sales in 2010.The first decade of the millennium brought roughly a tenfold explosion in popularity for Bentley and Rolls, which shared the British luxury throne before being conquered, separated and modernized by German automakers. It may have been a blow to national pride, but Bentley and Rolls, backed by the deep pockets of Volkswagen and BMW respectively, at last had the resources to develop new models that reached showrooms as the sales drought abated.More help from Germany, if somewhat less direct, arrived with Daimler’s recent decision to wind down its white-elephant Maybach brand. Despite some notoriety — the rappers Jay-Z and Kanye West dissected a Maybach as a lark in the music video for this year’s “Otis” — the $350,000 Maybach limousines never caught on with movers and shakers.Christophe Georges, Bentley’s North American president, said that rising luxury-car sales showed that consumers were regaining faith in the economy. That connection is stronger for cars than for other luxury goods because they are such visible symbols of wealth.“If you collect art, no one sees it outside your home,” he said. “But when people are losing jobs, you don’t want to show off a new Bentley. So when luxury cars move up, it’s a real expression of confidence.”'"
"'12-01-01,'0','Mr. Walentas, whose daily uniform usually consists of a hoodie and jeans, lives in an art-filled SoHo loft with his wife, Kate, a photographer, and their newborn son, Theo. At Two Trees, he has assembled a small, tightknit group of people in their 30s to work with him. They are as much friends as employees, including his college roommate, Amish Patel, who is now his No. 2.Over the last few years, even as the economy has continued to sputter, this team has started work on a number of ambitious projects. The list includes Mercedes House, the sprawling $600 million ziggurat-shaped building designed by Enrique Norten on the West Side of Manhattan, which will have 700 rental units and 160 condos when finished.Others on the list: a 72-room hotel on the edge of Williamsburg that will feature a restaurant and a rooftop bar; a mixed-use building that has yet to break ground just south of the Brooklyn Academy of Music that will have 350 rental apartments and 50,000 square feet of cultural space; and a controversial, long-planned condominium building on Dock Street in Dumbo that in its latest iteration is to house a public middle school.Bruce Ratner, the president of the Forest City Ratner Companies, which is developing the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn, said he had watched Mr. Walentas grow more confident as he took control of the company.“What is really interesting about David and Jed is that they both have a vision for what they want,” he said. He pointed to other large-scale development projects across the city, saying the extent of their success had been dependent on the developer’s vision.“Battery Park City is a great place,” Mr. Ratner said, “but it does not have the same sense of character” as Dumbo. Rockefeller Center, on the other hand, has a definitive sense of character, because “the Rockefellers had some idea of what they wanted that place to be.”In Dumbo, he said, the guiding vision was to retain the area’s industrial flavor (without the industry), while providing a street-level experience both diverse and interesting — even if it means subsidizing rents for small-business owners and declining the high rents offered by big-box stores, or selling off properties and cashing out.“Jed holds firm to the vision,” Mr. Ratner said. “And that is not a minor comment.”The Walentases have won admirers for their attention to the aesthetic details of their developments, and for supporting artists, whom they encouraged early on to move to Dumbo. But the family have also made some enemies along the way.Judy Stanton, the executive director of the Brooklyn Heights Association, has battled with both David and Jed Walentas over numerous projects.“I think Jed has better manners — which is not to say he is well mannered — than his father,” she said. “He does not come up to people out of the blue and say really crude, rude things.”David Walentas, whose shirt cuffs bear not his monogram but his motto, “No Guts No Glory,” makes no apologies for the battles he has waged. “I was the lone ranger out there at war with everyone,” he said, noting that his success had allowed his son the luxury of patience.But critics like Ms. Stanton still get under his skin. “They are up there on the hill, holier than thou,” he said. “But if it had been up to them, there would be no Dumbo.”Jed Walentas is the first to acknowledge that he has not had to fight and scrap his way to the top as his father did. “We had this massive head start,” he said.The condominium proposed for Dock Street has met with an outcry from community groups worried about the impact it will have on the view from the Brooklyn Bridge.“The bridge is set off so beautifully by the fact that there are not tall buildings around it,” Ms. Stanton said in an interview.In 2004, when Two Trees proposed the Dock Street project, an 18-story residential building on the site of St. Ann’s Warehouse, city officials shot it down amid fierce opposition.But Two Trees did not give up, and on the latest go-round, with Jed Walentas at the helm, it aggressively courted community groups from poorer neighborhoods, promising to build a public school. And with the project stalled, the company was able to buy a neighboring building, which allowed it to tweak the design.This time Mr. Walentas won approval. The proposed building is now 17 stories high and set back slightly. A lawsuit has since held up construction, but he hopes the way will be clear by summer.When he joined Two Trees in 1998, Jed Walentas played a central role in selecting the kinds of retail outlets that would give Dumbo a distinctive ambience. He sees it as the duty of the younger generation to be more assertive in defending the real estate industry and what it means to New York.“The older generations are less interested in really battling on certain issues,” he said.  “They are, rationally, extremely risk-averse, and they will often choose comfort over progress. I think the public and the elected officials underappreciate how genuinely civic-minded the real estate industry is and how closely aligned the long-term interests of the city are with our industry.”Several weeks ago, when the Occupy Wall Street movement was nearing its peak, he explained why he thought his way of making money was very different from what others do to create wealth.“Unlike someone on Wall Street, who can make a lot of money in New York and then move on,” he said, “we are in it for the long term.” He was standing in the construction zone for the second phase of Mercedes House, so named because the ground-floor commercial space is leased to a Mercedes-Benz dealership. “This building will be here for a hundred years. It’s not like we can load it onto a 747 and move it. And for it to be successful, the neighborhood needs to be successful.”Still, there is no getting around the fact that new construction in New York’s prime neighborhoods is geared toward the wealthy.When David Walentas bought two million square feet of space in Dumbo in 1981, he paid $12 million. Today, a single penthouse apartment in the ClockTower building in that neighborhood is listed for $23 million.So it comes as little surprise that developers are often accused of creating playgrounds for the privileged.The younger Mr. Walentas said he understood the concern. But, he argued, it is the conditions surrounding new construction that often drive up costs for everyone.“The reason real estate is so expensive is because it is so difficult to build,” he said.The best way to keep costs down across the board, he added, is an aggressive approach to changing zoning laws — specifically, rezoning land in transitional neighborhoods to allow for housing. More supply, he declared, will translate to lower prices. Even so, the ultimate success of both his projects and the city depends on continuing to attract a diverse group of talented people.“What New York cannot become is homogenous,” he said. “We need to find ways for the world’s most curious and interesting and passionate and energetic people to come here and explore themselves and their ideas.”Although Mr. Walentas is now fully engaged in the real estate world, he was not always sure he would go into the family business.At the University of Pennsylvania, he worked as a sports reporter for the campus paper. When he graduated in 1997, he was offered a job at The New York Post.But he turned down working the night shift on the sports desk to take a day job with Donald Trump.“I had no concept of what I was doing, but a weird amount of confidence,” Mr. Walentas said.The men do not seem natural soul mates. Mr. Trump, known for building his own brand as much as buildings, is not shy about displays of wealth and status. Mr. Walentas says he doesn’t see the point in putting his name on buildings, and wears his wealth lightly. But the two clicked and still speak very highly of each other.After a year, Mr. Walentas went to work at his father’s company. Now, he said, his father is largely hands-off, involved in only a small number of major decisions and some details that interest him personally.“I have been very good at letting go,” David Walentas said. “A lot of people want to hang on and dominate. I think you have to let people burn their fingers and skin their knees a little bit.”With the advantages he has been given, Jed Walentas said, he believes it is important to give back, and he supports projects involving education, cultural institutions in Brooklyn, and art in public spaces. He has hired Lisa Kim, an art adviser, to guide him in that effort.He said that if his wife did not keep him in check, their loft, an old theater space that he converted himself, would be even more crammed with art.His one “absurd” purchase, he said, was the vintage bubble hockey game he keeps in his home office.“I was totally obsessed with that game as a kid,” he said.  “My grade-school friends still come over and we act like we did when we were playing it in arcades at age 12. I think we were better then, though.”'"
"'12-01-01,'0','It is sometimes the case that on the morning of Jan. 1, I arise bleary-eyed from a brief sleep with those famous final words of Beckett’s “Unnamable” on my mind: “You must go on, I can’t go on, I’ll go on.” Fortunately, I’m not reflecting on the whole messy enterprise of life itself. I’m concerned with drinking. Can I, should I, really keep going after a season of festive drinking that ended a little too festively?Before I go on, a disclaimer: You should not have cause to make a habit of the hair of the dog. And if you’re under the impression it will truly help KO your hangover, you’re standing on shaky scientific ground.     Moving on, then: When it comes to picking a next-day drink, I enjoy making bloody marys a good deal more than I like drinking them. A pint of Guinness frequently feels like just the thing, but it’s not as nourishing as it looks. What I really want is protein and a bit of effervescence.Josey Packard, a bartender at Boston’s Drink (it took the prize for Best American Cocktail Bar at the 2011 Tales of the Cocktail festival), suggested just the thing. “The very best experience I have ever had with a pick-me-up, the absolute best,” she said, “was the classic cocktail called the Electric Current Fizz”The cocktail, which appears in George Kappeler’s 1895 treatise, “Modern American Drinks,” is in two parts: a Silver Fizz — a tall cocktail made of gin, lemon juice, sugar, an egg white and soda water — paired with a variation on the Prairie Oyster.       Kappeler instructs readers to make the fizz first and to “save the yolk of the egg and serve it in the half-shell, with a little pepper, salt and vinegar.” Packard recommends a few lashings of Worcestershire and Tabasco instead of vinegar. “Shoot the yolk,” she says, “then enjoy the fizz at your own pace.”Fear of salmonella aside, the white makes the drink delectably frothy, and the yolk provides the all-important protein. (I’m afraid there’s also no alternative.) I find a shot glass makes downing a yolk less forbidding than the half-shell, and do take your time with the fizz. As with nightcaps, a hair of the dog is most judiciously limited to one serving: too much of a good thing will not improve the odds that it will succeed, though you might feel, if only for a few moments, like the bon vivant, mash-up offspring of Bertie Wooster and Sally Bowles.       At the start of a new year, all seems possible.'"

"'12-01-02,'0','The note, somewhat cryptic, seemed to suggest that efforts to fight global warming siphoned money from worthy causes like fighting poverty. “Every day nearly 16,000 children die from hunger and related causes,” it said.Then the note’s author seemed to dangle a challenge for hackers and programmers, saying that even though he was releasing 5,000 e-mails, “The rest, some 220,000, are encrypted for various reasons.”“We are not planning to publicly release the pass phrase,” the note added coyly.The stunt was enough to jump-start a police investigation that had long seemed dormant.In December, citing a request from British law enforcement, the Justice Department asked that Automattic, the parent company of the blog host WordPress.com, preserve three days of digital logs for three blogs where the links to the latest e-mails first appeared. In a raid in Leeds, England, the police also confiscated laptops from the home of one blogger; he says the police have told him that he is not a suspect.The note, the encrypted file and the fresh signs of police interest have inspired musings on both sides of the climate divide.Kert Davies, the research director of the environmental group Greenpeace, suggested that the note was “a strong clue on the predisposition of the hacker.”“It smells a lot like a certain quadrant of the denier community,” he said. “They pretend to be concerned that we are impeding development in poor countries. Only certain think tanks think that way and play that way” — mostly in Europe, he said.Some have noted that in 2009, the online trickster used the initials R.C. and linked to a zip file named “FOI2009,” an apparent reference to Freedom of Information statutes in both Britain and the United States.This time, he signed his blog comments simply as “FOIA,” a common nickname for the leaker in online discussions of the e-mail affair.Myron Ebell, director of energy and global warming policy at the Competitive Enterprise Institute in Washington and a frequent spokesman for climate change skeptics, said the encryption of the file had challenged his thinking on FOIA’s identity.Previously, he said, he had assumed the leaker was an employee of the University of East Anglia who had been troubled by the denial of requests for the prompt public release of scientists’ full data and e-mails under Britain’s Freedom of Information Act.But a principled commitment to open information is not in keeping with an encrypted file, Mr. Ebell said. So he suspects a different kind of intelligence is at work.“It is very suggestive of someone who has thought through how to cause the con men at the C.R.U. the maximum possible anxiety,” he said, referring to the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. “It is like knowing your building has a bomb in it that could be detonated at any time.”Yet Brendan DeMelle, executive director of DeSmogBlog, a Web site devoted to debunking what it describes as misinformation campaigns by deniers of climate change, suggests that the encrypted file is merely a desperate attempt to distract people from the fact that the scientists were vindicated.“It is sort of bait,” he said. “It raises questions on what else is out there. In the end, uncertainty is their product.”The three blogs where comments were submitted alerting the online community to the new e-mails are all known for their critiques of the work of climate scientists.Asked if he had any clues to the leaker’s identity, Steve McIntyre, the Canadian blogger who runs climateaudit.org, said, “I don’t know who it is and I can’t think of any reason why anyone would think I did.” He has not been contacted by any law enforcement entity, he said.Roger Tattersall, a Web content manager at the University of Leeds who had two laptops confiscated by British police constables last month, did not shed light on the mystery, either. “I do not wish to issue a denial, because it invites the assumption that there is an accusation or suspicion,” said Mr. Tattersall, who authors a blog known as Tallbloke’s Talkshop. He added, “The police have stated that I am not a suspect.”In an e-mail provided by Mr. Tattersall to The New York Times, his lawyer emphasized that his client would have cooperated with the police without their needing a search warrant. The Norfolk constabulary, which carried out the raids, refused to comment on the raid or any investigation.Jeff Condon, the author of a blog called The Air Vent, said he had no idea who posted the links to the e-mails on his blog.Yet he said he found it interesting that for the most part, the phantom posted links on blogs like his own, where many of those who commented seem conversant in technology.“Most of my readers are college graduates, 50 percent have Ph.Ds,” he said. “This is the kind of people that the guy who dropped the links” sought to reach, he said.Still, Mr. Condon said he did not believe that “FOIA” is a serious person. At times, he said, he has assumed that the leaker is a mischievous student.“No adult with sensitive information would release it that way,” he said. “It’s pranklike behavior.”Yet among scientists whose e-mails were released and whose research practices were then investigated, the signs that an investigation is afoot have revived hopes that the e-mail thief will ultimately be unmasked.“It seems to me the authorities wouldn’t have acted without some actionable intelligence,” said Michael Mann, a scientist at Pennsylvania State University who specializes in climate modeling and whose messages came in for particular scrutiny in 2009. “They must know something that we don’t yet know.”'"
"'12-01-02,'0','“I can do this forever, and it’s most gratifying,” Mr. Trotter, 52, said in an interview on Sunday. “That said, there are so many other things to do in life. Twenty-five years in this line of work is fantastic. It’s just time to step back, breathe deeply and do something different.”Locally and nationally, people in the dining industry said they were surprised or, if not entirely surprised, sentimental about the closing. Acquaintances and former employees described Mr. Trotter as a quirky perfectionist, a constant boundary pusher (using unlikely items like pig ears, in the memory of one admiring former employee) and a sometimes difficult boss. He was also credited, even by his critics, for being a trailblazer whose influences can be tasted and felt in many newer restaurants and someone who helped put Chicago, once known mostly for deep-dish pizza and hot dogs, on the epicurean map.“In the late ’80s and through the ’90s, he was on top of the food world,” said Curtis Duffy, who moved to Chicago more than a decade ago to work for Mr. Trotter and described him as probably his most significant professional influence.Mr. Duffy, who went on to be the chef at Avenues here and plans to open his own restaurant, Grace, this year, added: “It’s hard to stay on top of something that’s evolving. I think he’s still on top. He wants to close on top.”In the 1980s, Mr. Trotter emerged from a sea of fine dining restaurants that were narrowly focused on French-style cooking, said Mitchell Davis, executive vice president of the James Beard Foundation.“But Charlie helped define a unique American perspective on it, rich with French tradition and also other traditions in the world,” Mr. Davis said. “He helped make Chicago a global food town.”To hear patrons of the restaurant tell it, Mr. Trotter made dinner no longer just dinner, but an event. Servers were known for their scrupulous attention and care. The small plates came and went with careful pairings of wine. Fellow chefs described Mr. Trotter’s kitchen as technically perfect.In more recent years, though, there were setbacks. When the Michelin guide came to Chicago for the first time in late 2010, two edgy restaurants (Alinea and L2O) got the highest ratings, three stars. Mr. Trotter’s received two stars. And while the world of television chef shows and buzzy online restaurant promotions blossomed, Mr. Trotter mainly focused on his kitchen — a place where, even as modernist approaches began flourishing elsewhere, “when you eat an artichoke, it still looks like an artichoke,” said the chef Mario Batali, a friend.In a fast-changing culinary world, rare is the fine dining restaurant that lasts 25 years. “Almost impossible anymore,” said Alan Richman, the food and wine critic for GQ magazine. “I think you’ll see fewer and fewer restaurants accomplish that.”Mr. Trotter said he had first considered closing 10 years ago, then again five years ago. “It’s not just like some overnight thing I’m doing,” he said. “I did feel some pangs of sentimentality and nostalgia. On the other hand, full steam ahead.”Reflecting on a quarter-century in the food world, Mr. Trotter said he had watched the evolution of American cuisine and the evolution of the American eater — from someone who enjoyed a once-in-a-while night out to the foundation of a “food-savvy populace” that dines out constantly.Responses came fast after word of the closing began spreading on Saturday, Mr. Trotter said. People were already securing reservations for the final eight months of dinners.'"
"'12-01-02,'0','Mrs. West, 58, was equally pleased with Mr. Cuomo. “He’s kept his promises,” she said. “He came in here with a real force right away implementing things.”Indeed, as Mr. Cuomo puts the finishing touches on his second State of the State address, which he will deliver on Wednesday, and lawmakers prepare to return to Albany for a new legislative session, the governor appears more of a force than ever.The income tax overhaul that he brokered last month has placated frustrated Democrats, and the Occupy Albany encampment, once an emblem of liberal angst toward him, has been dismantled. At the same time, the well wishes Mr. Cuomo received on Sunday offered a tactile impression of the confidence he has inspired in many voters, for both his legislative victories and his steadying hand in a capital long roiled by scandal.The governor, in a suit and tie, greeted his visitors in front of a fireplace in the mansion’s receiving hall; he was accompanied by his daughters and his girlfriend, the Food Network host Sandra Lee, in a white dress.Again, Ms. Lee was a draw. One guest praised her for her advocacy for hunger programs, and another invited her and Mr. Cuomo to visit a youth garden in Albany. “The governor said, ‘We’d like to get out more this year,’ ” Tom McPheeters, 71, said.But the overwhelming theme was praise for Mr. Cuomo’s first year as governor. Some cited his successful advocacy for the legalization of same-sex marriage; others praised his handling of the state budget; and still more said they were grateful New York finally had a governor who was not a punch line for late-night comics.“We thanked him for bringing integrity back to the governor’s office,” said Doug Young, 55, of Malta, who works in air-conditioning sales.Sharon Cupoli, a 58-year-old from Guilderland who works as a programmer in the state comptroller’s office, said she was not thrilled about every aspect of the labor contract that Mr. Cuomo struck with her union, the Public Employees Federation. Yet she gave him high marks for his handling of the state’s finances.“He is really trying to get people to think about government differently,” she said.The affection for Mr. Cuomo extended to those not yet old enough to vote. Kevin McManus Jr., 9, a fourth grader from Endicott, who serves on his student council, said he planned to run for president next year and already had an attractive plank of his campaign platform. “I think that I’m the only one in my school that’s met the governor,” he said, noting that he planned to show his classmates a photograph of him and Mr. Cuomo.Ms. Lee also served as a potent ice breaker for young visitors.“I love your hair,” she gushed to Skylar Small, a fourth grader from New City who visited with three fellow Girl Scouts from St. Augustine School.They asked Mr. Cuomo about his favorite part of being governor (helping people) and the hardest part of his job (the 24-hour demands of the position).Skylar, 9, called herself impressed. “I think he’s been doing a very good job,” she said, “and he’s so lucky he gets to live in such a big house.”'"
"'12-01-02,'0','But for those who trekked, by choice or by trade, through the Midtown detritus on Sunday, the ubiquity of vomit was never to be whitewashed. Or, in some cases, washed at all.Cleaning crews for both the Times Square Alliance and the city’s Sanitation Department breezed past viscous evidence of overindulgence throughout the morning. “That’s a liquid,” said Keith Mellis, a spokesman for the department. “We pick up litter.”Among some workers and businesses, magical thinking seemed to set in, with the hope that the waste would be swallowed up by the earth, or at least ground and trampled into debris so unrecognizable that passers-by would never know they were supposed to be disgusted.One worker, gathering confetti, said he had not noticed any such deposits left on the ground. Within a square block of his perch, on 41st Street and Seventh Avenue, there were no fewer than seven collections of the stuff. Four were in suspicious proximity to a McDonald’s location; two were beside a cluster of McNuggets, discarded at the curb.Inside the 49th Street subway station, a worker for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority mopped raw eggs off the speckled floor outside the platform.Cleaners, she said, were supposed to address “vomit, liquids and defecation” first as they made their rounds. But her peers above ground, she added, often avoid the task whenever possible.“Human nature,” she said. “They try to get away with it.”Sheila Glorioso, a night auditor at Hotel 41 between Seventh and Eighth Avenues, said she knew early in the night that conditions would conspire to produce an especially filthy morning.“The weather was nice, place is packed, people are crazy,” she said. “I know what to expect.”The hotel suffered only one overnight sidewalk deposit near its premises, about 3 a.m., she said. The staff cleaned it up itself, since the culprit was a hotel guest.Ms. Impola, visiting with a friend from Helsinki, said most of the heaving she observed happened around the same time — that critical moment when clubs close, dinner has long since been digested, and the prospect of a morning crash begins to set in. Her group, she said, as she shifted in her dress on Sunday morning, had been immune to upset stomachs.“We’re from Finland,” she said. “You keep it all in.”The mystery, at least to some, was how people in Times Square could possibly have been so inebriated.“There’s no drinking in Times Square during the ball drop,” an officer inside a police substation on 43rd Street noted late Sunday morning. “I doubt people are puking.”He had not been outside all morning, he said, convincingly.'"
"'12-01-02,'0','Adblock Plus’s lead developer, Wladimir Palant, has tried to quell the anger, replying personally to the disappointed commenters and explaining that the introduction of “acceptable ads” is true to his vision for the ad-blocking project. The project was never meant to rid the Internet of all advertising, he says, but of annoying advertising.“We feel that the original ‘kill all’ approach isn’t productive here; we need to start differentiating between ads and giving people better ways to allow some of them,” Mr. Palant, who lives in Cologne, Germany, wrote in an e-mail.Last August, he created a company, Eyeo, with the backing of an unnamed private investor, and a managing director, Till Faida, who also lives in Cologne. The company pays Mr. Faida and Mr. Palant’s salaries, along with the salary of another programmer based in Moscow. (For years, Mr. Palant had worked on the project on the side.)Eyeo, whose only product is Adblock Plus, has a motto that alludes to its bigger aspirations: “We want to make the Internet better for everyone. Purging bad ads is a good way to start.”Mr. Faida has left open the possibility that some big Web sites will pay his start-up as part of the new service; small sites will never be charged, he said. In an e-mail, he wrote: “In the long term, we of course have to think about how to make our movement sustainable — including larger Web sites that will increase their revenues by partnering with us in the costs of maintaining the project seems to be a way that will work.”In an interview, Mr. Faida focused on the plight of those smaller Web sites that had suffered collateral damage from ad-blocking programs. While the programs can seem like niche products, they can really affect the revenue for Web sites, he said. He estimated that in the United States 3.5 percent of all Internet users have Adblock Plus installed; in Germany, where use of the Firefox browser is higher, it is 12 percent.“I just talked to a tech Web site here in Germany, they have seven employees and 40 percent of their users have ad-blockers,” he said. “There was a tech convention in America, and they couldn’t afford to send more than one journalist because so many of their ads are being blocked.”Mr. Palant has argued that to make advertising less distracting and intrusive, you need carrots as well as sticks: blocking the ugly and loud ads but promoting the simple, calm and informative ones. By making the “acceptable ads” setting the default one, he wrote on the Adblock Plus Web site, he was trying to leverage the millions of users to change the behavior of Web sites.“Only by being able to deliver a large audience to reward sites that carry subdued advertising, will they have an incentive to make the change,” he wrote. If he had not made the “acceptable ads” feature the default, and therefore, only a few users enabled it, advertisers “will go back to more annoying ways of advertising because that’s where the money is right now.”The way “acceptable ads” works, Mr. Palant and Mr. Faida explained, is that Web sites agree to publish certain advertisements that meet Adblock Plus’s standards on intrusiveness — no beeping or flashing, nothing that slows the computer’s operations. They are then added to the “white list” of acceptable advertisements.It is, ultimately, not a technical solution but a contractual one — there is no way yet for the software to judge an ad acceptable. The plan is to rely on users to flag Web sites that are not living up to their agreements.What gives the project potentially greater meaning is that if Web sites do, in fact, adapt to the “acceptable ads” challenge, the calmer ads will be seen by all users of the Internet, whether they use ad-blocking programs or not.Certainly, all sides can agree that the introduction of “acceptable ads” represents a new strategy, if not a new vision, for the ad-blocking project. In the process, Mr. Palant risks alienating the tech community that embraced and spread the word about Adblock Plus, which says that in addition to the millions of daily users it has 30 million to 35 million “active users” and a total of 150 million downloads of the program.The acceptable-ads program is in its early stages; Mr. Faida listed a few companies that were now participating, including a couple of German tech sites, t3n.de and Netzwelt.de. These companies have not paid Eyeo to be listed, Mr. Faida said, stressing in a phone conversation that, “we haven’t sold out in any way.”The ad-blocking program is the product of a community. Without volunteers who maintain filter lists of Web addresses of online ads, the program wouldn’t know what to block.One of the keepers of these filtering lists, Ryan Brown, 34, from New Zealand, described the experience as a labor of love. He gets some donations for maintaining his list, he said, but not enough to pay his costs. In an e-mail, he didn’t sound thrilled by the changes, especially by how top-down the process has been, and how sweeping.But he added about Mr. Palant: “I trust the decisions he makes in regards to this project; he’s not here to sabotage anything. I would’ve preferred a little more openness on the acceptable ads process, as a community. Because of this one change there has been plenty of hate in the forums regarding this one feature.”'"
"'12-01-02,'0','Mark Elliot, an executive from the , said in a letter to that such piracy threatened 19 million American jobs. Those figures surely include some politically motivated hyperbole, but anybody who has spent time around a twentysomething consumer knows that piracy is a thorny fact of life for content companies.In an effort to stanch the flow, on Oct. 26 Representative , Republican of , introduced the legislation that has come to be known as SOPA. The Senate version, called the Protect IP Act, is seen by tech companies as less onerous because it targets domain name providers and ad networks and not Internet service providers. Both bills seek to create remedies to pirated content because most of the foreign-based sites operate outside of the United States’ legal system.WOULD IT FIX THE PROBLEM? Probably not, and even if it made some progress toward reining in rogue sites, the collateral damage would be significant. Under the terms of each proposed bill, the , as well as copyright holders, could seek a court order against a Web site that illegally hosts copyrighted content and then wall off the site permanently.Under the House version, private companies would be allowed to sue Internet service providers for hosting content that they say infringes on copyright. That represents a very big change in the current law as codified in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which grants to Web sites as long as they act in good faith to take down infringing content upon notification.WHY ALL THE ALARM? The bill has exposed a growing between technology and entertainment companies. Digitally oriented companies see SOPA as dangerous and potentially destructive to the open Web and a step toward the kind of intrusive Internet regulation that has made a global villain to citizens of the Web.Entertainment companies think that technology companies are aiding and abetting thieves on a broad scale, but the legislation is alarming in its reach, potentially creating a blacklist of sites and taking aim at others for unknowingly hosting a small fraction of copyrighted material. In a joint letter to Congress, , , , , , and many other companies made it clear that they perceived a broader threat in the effort to thwart pirate sites.“We support the bills’ stated goals — providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign ‘rogue’ Web sites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting,” the letter read, which was published in a full page ad in The Times.“Unfortunately, the bills as drafted would expose law-abiding U.S. Internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities, private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of Web sites.”, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said in an open letter on the Web that SOPA would “undermine the openness and free exchange of information at the heart of the Internet. And it would violate the First Amendment.”You can see why big Internet guys are upset by SOPA. Maybe you and I should be, too.WHY THE POLITICAL SUPPORT? Various amendments intended to tone down SOPA or limit its damage were voted down by large majorities in the House Judiciary Committee in mid-December, an indication that the indignation of various constituencies on the Web is having little impact.That’s partly because entertainment companies have deep and long-lasting relationships inside the Beltway. Maplight, a site that researches the influence of money in politics, reported that the 32 sponsors of the legislation received four times as much in contributions from the entertainment industry as they did from software and Internet companies.There is also a cultural divide at work, according to Yancey Strickler, one of the founders of Kickstarter, a Web site that helps raise funds for creative projects, and a critic of SOPA.“The schism between content creators and platforms like Kickstarter, Tumblr and is generational,” he wrote in an e-mail. “It’s people who grew up on the Web versus people who still don’t use it. In Washington, they simply don’t see the way that the Web has completely reconfigured society across classes, education and race. The Internet isn’t real to them yet.”The debate has highlighted how little Congress knows about the Internet they are proposing to re-tool. In a piece often cited on the Web, the computer culture journalist Joshua Kopstein watched the debate in Congress in which members bragged about their online ignorance, and he wrote an open letter on the technology Web site Motherboard titled, “Dear Congress, It’s No Longer O.K. to Not Know How the Internet Works.”Whether they know what they are doing or not, lawmakers seem intent on moving forward.Congressional supporters of piracy legislation have been in a big hurry because the Web is starting to come alive with opposition — nearly 90,000 Tumblr users have phoned members of Congress and more than a million people have signed an online petition protesting the legislation.Last week, in a much talked about blog post, Declan McCullagh of CNet speculated that even though big Web companies like Google, Amazon and Facebook are outgunned in terms of political connections, they have the capability to turn their sites into billboards denouncing SOPA and utilizing their close, constant relationship with consumers.I like my movies (and music and television) as much as the next couch potato, probably more. And I wouldn’t steal content for any reason, in part because I make a living generating a fair amount of it. But it’s worth remembering that the film industry initially opposed the video cassette recorder and the introduction of DVDs, platforms that became very lucrative businesses for them and remarkable conveniences for the rest of us.Given both Congress’s and the entertainment industry’s historically wobbly grasp of technology, I don’t think they should be the ones re-engineering the Internet. The rest of us might have to just hold our noses and learn enough about SOPA to school them in why it’s a bad idea.'"
"'12-01-02,'0','ACCORDING to a recent study by the Centers for Disease Control, drug overdoses have increased almost six-fold in the last 30 years. They now represent the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, having overtaken motor vehicle accidents for the first time on record.One might expect such news to spur politicians to explore new options for drug abuse treatment, prevention and enforcement. Instead, at precisely the wrong time, extremists on both sides have taken over the conversation. Unless we change the tone of the debate to give drug-policy centrists a voice, America’s drug problem will only get worse.Indeed, moderates have historically been key contributors to both the debate and the practice of effective drug policy. In 1914, Representative Francis B. Harrison, a New York Democrat, worked with Republicans and President Woodrow Wilson to pass the first major piece of federal anti-drug legislation, in response to a surge in heroin and cocaine use.Other moderates, from Theodore Roosevelt to John F. Kennedy, made drug policy an important part of their domestic agendas. President Bill Clinton worked closely with Bob Dole, the Republican Senate majority leader, on sensible measures like drug courts and community policing. And Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the reason there is a drug czar in the first place, having pushed the idea for years before President Ronald Reagan approved it.So where are the moderates now? Certainly, the current political climate makes it hard to come together on any question. Republicans are too timid to touch any domestic policy issue, like effective drug prevention and treatment, that might appear to cost taxpayers more money. And too many Democrats have yet to recognize that drugs are an issue that they and their constituents should care deeply about: after all, drug abuse and its consequences affect the most vulnerable in society in especially harmful ways.'"
"'12-01-02,'0','An aggressive promotional campaign helped “Downton Abbey” win six Emmy Awards, including best mini-series or movie, away from competitors on HBO and Starz.“The thinking was that they had to up their game,” said Kliff Kuehl, president and chief executive of KCPT, a public television station in Kansas City, Mo. “That’s what we’ve evolved to — trying to give people that pay-TV moment.”“Downton Abbey,” which follows an aristocratic English family and its nosy staff at a sprawling estate on the cusp of World War I, was first shown on ITV in Britain. It slowly built an audience in the United States after critics called it a “delightful romp.” Viewers who didn’t typically watch PBS tuned in.The first season, consisting of four 90-minute episodes, had a nightly average of 4.9 million viewers, in contrast to 1.9 million viewers on an average night on PBS stations, according to Nielsen. The number of women ages 25 to 54 who watch “Masterpiece,” which typically has an average age of 64, was up 56 percent during “Downton Abbey.” More than one million viewers, mostly from the ages of 18 to 49, streamed “Downton Abbey” on PBS.org or via Netflix.“It was the closest thing to water-cooler television as public television gets,” said Rebecca Eaton, executive producer of Masterpiece, produced by WGBH Boston.A water-cooler show couldn’t come at a more critical time. The Budget Control Act, which ended the debt ceiling crisis in August, strips public television and others of a portion of federal financing starting as early as 2013.In 2010, PBS had $571 million in total revenue, down from $624 million in 2007. (A PBS spokeswoman said annual revenue varies based on programming investments.) Federal financing for public television in 2010, through grants and appropriations to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, was $97.8 million, or 17 percent of PBS’s total revenue. That’s down from $121 million, or 19 percent, in 2007, according to audited consolidated financial statements.States, meanwhile, under severe budget pressure, have cut financing for local public broadcasting stations. In Florida, Gov. Richard Scott, a Republican, vetoed $4.8 million in funds for stations. In April, Daystar Television, a Christian media group, announced its plans to buy WMFE-TV, a public station in Orlando. Since then, another local Orlando station, WUCF, has picked up PBS content. In January, KCET-TV in Los Angeles, citing financial problems, ended its 40-year relationship with PBS.“People say ‘your business model is broken’ and we should walk away from federal appropriations,” said Paula A. Kerger, president and chief executive at PBS. “It’s an unusual system but frankly, PBS was envisioned as a public/private partnership. I don’t think we can trade out that blend that makes public television different.”PBS is hoping that prime-time hits like “Downton” and “Sherlock,” which appeal largely to better-off viewers, will attract donations to local PBS stations that will be used to pay dues. In turn, that helps finance other programs like “Sesame Street” and “Sid the Science Kid.” PBS Kids is the most-watched bloc by children aged 2 to 5 and was originally created for underprivileged young viewers who lacked access to early-childhood education. (Viewers can also donate directly to the “Masterpiece” programming bloc through the Masterpiece Trust.)“That wasn’t just chance, but an effort to reach a wider audience and really think about how we can make the case to them to continue their support,” Ms. Kerger said.But first PBS must connect to that wider audience. Though the broadcaster has a limited marketing budget, it has introduced an ambitious campaign ahead of the season premiere of “Downton Abbey” that includes placing ads on CNN, BBC America and Lifetime and in publications like People and TV Guide.A social media campaign includes “Downton” actors sending Twitter messages about the show and sponsored, promotional Twitter messages. Viewers can unlock “Downton Abbey” stickers on GetGlue. On Dec. 26 fans got a 10-minute preview of “Downton Abbey” on the “Masterpiece” and PBS Facebook pages.“Social media drove the success of ‘Downton’ the first time around,” said Lesli Rotenberg, senior vice president of marketing and communications for PBS. “This time we’re using social media to help further drive buzz.”Viking River Cruises has signed on as “Masterpiece’s” corporate sponsor, filling a five-year void that began when Exxon Mobil withdrew its support in 2004. Viking will send mailers to customers pegged to the “Downton Abbey” Season 2 premiere. A corporate message will come on right after the show’s host, Laura Linney, introduces the program. “Our demographic is affluent baby boomers, 55-plus,” said Richard Marnell, Viking’s senior vice president of marketing. “We’d been looking for a broadcast partner that reaches that group.”Originally envisioned as a mini-series, “Downton Abbey” had such success that the writer, Julian Fellowes, agreed to do additional seasons. The second season begins in 1916 and will run for seven episodes. Its September premiere in Britain averaged more than nine million viewers or roughly a 35 percent share.In October, PBS introduced a redesigned iPad app modeled loosely after HBO Go. Combined, the mobile apps and online video player offer free access to 2,700 hours of local and national video. Ms. Kerger said PBS was exploring ways to link app downloads to easy-to-access online donations. “I want to be very careful that we don’t become commercially driven in the online space,” she said.PBS doesn’t expect “Downton” to immediately lead to an influx of cash, and still plans to push shows like “Nova” and “Antiques Roadshow” in prime time.“No one sat around and said ‘How can we sex it up?’ ” said Mr. Wilson, PBS’s chief programmer. Still, he said: “There’s nothing better for our future than to have a large audience. That engagement stimulates financial support.”'"
"'12-01-02,'0','As the two men spilled outside, two more men arrived: an off-duty officer of the New York Police Department and a recently retired Nassau County police lieutenant. Both had been in a nearby deli, and one or both were armed, according to the person and another official, both of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing.More shots were fired in the seconds that followed, and details of precisely what occurred remained murky a day later.Yet at one point, Mr. McGoey, who lived in Hampton Bays, N.Y., tried to reach for a gun on the ground, the first official said. The off-duty city police officer fired at Mr. McGoey, hitting him two or three times, the official added. It was not immediately clear how many shots the retired police lieutenant fired, if any.“There are two or three seconds they haven’t accounted for, when the fatal shots were fired,” the official said.But at the end of the shooting, Mr. McGoey was dead and Agent Capano was mortally wounded. He was pronounced dead at Nassau University Medical Center.The first official said Nassau County investigators were considering the possibility that Agent Capano was killed by one of the other officers.Should investigators conclude that the fatal bullet or bullets were fired by the off-duty New York City officer or the retired Nassau lieutenant, it would underscore a peculiar danger that law enforcement officers in Nassau County and some other New York suburbs face: the ubiquity of other officers — on duty, off-duty and retired — who often converge at the scenes of emergencies, raising the possibility that an officer might be mistaken for a criminal.Just a few minutes’ drive from the pharmacy, a plainclothes Nassau County police officer, Geoffrey J. Breitkopf, was fatally shot in March by a Metropolitan Transportation Authority officer, Glenn Gentile. By the time both men had arrived at the scene, a house in Massapequa Park, the danger was supposed to have been over: minutes earlier, other officers had fatally shot a young man who had threatened the police and a civilian with knives.It is believed that a retired New York police sergeant had yelled “gun” on seeing Officer Breitkopf’s rifle, moments before Officer Gentile opened fire.Near the pharmacy where the shooting occurred on Saturday is the deli that, according to the first official, is believed to be owned by the retired Nassau police lieutenant. The retiree and the off-duty city officer, who happened to be in the deli, had rushed to the pharmacy after hearing of a robbery in progress from customers who had fled the pharmacy, the person said.“They come out and see these guys struggling,” the second official said of the chaotic scene that confronted the retiree and off-duty city officer.Rory O’Connor, an assistant special agent in charge of the Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms New York field division, offered a terse description of the events leading to Agent Capano’s death.“John walked into that pharmacy as a customer while off-duty,” Agent O’Connor said Sunday. “He subsequently engaged in a struggle with the suspect, and John was shot, as well as the perpetrator.”“As to who did the shooting, I’m not going to discuss that,” Agent O’Connor added, explaining that he was deferring to the Nassau County police, who are leading the investigation.Spokesmen for the Nassau County Police Department declined to provide further details of the shooting.Mr. McGoey was released from prison in August after serving more than 10 years for a robbery conviction, prison records show. In the 1990s, records show, he served nine years for robbery.The elder Mr. Capano said that one detail in the troubling chain of events made sense to him: that his son had intervened. “He never walked away from anything,” said Mr. Capano, speaking to reporters outside the pharmacy.John Capano lived in Massapequa, just a few minutes from the pharmacy. He was married and had two children: a daughter in high school and a son who is in college, said Joe Green, a recently retired bureau spokesman.On Saturday, Agent Capano had planned a trip to a church to drop off used clothing, a neighbor, Scott Parlatore, said.Mr. Parlatore said that although Mr. Capano had undergone neck and back operations and, for a time, had walked with a cane, he was always willing to clear snow for elderly neighbors.In recent years, his knowledge of explosives and his expertise in post-blast investigations had led to assignments in Iraq and Afghanistan, Agent O’Connor said.Representative Peter T. King, who knew Agent Capano and is an old friend of the elder Mr. Capano, said it was a “tragedy for a person who spent his career in A.T.F. and had gone to Iraq and Afghanistan to be killed on New Year’s Eve in his hometown, on the street where his father was virtually mayor.”“The only part that made sense,” Mr. King continued, “is that John Capano died the way he lived. He was fearless, and he never hesitated to do what he had to do.”'"
"'12-01-02,'0','BEIJING — The brother of a prominent dissident rights lawyer who had been missing for 20 months said Sunday that the lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, was being held in a prison in the remote western region of Xinjiang.The brother, Gao Zhiyi, told two news agencies that he had been informed that Gao Zhisheng was in a prison in Shaya County. The brother said he had received an official notice on Sunday telling him that Mr. Gao was now back in prison because a court had revoked his probation, and that he would have to serve three more years.Mr. Gao, a Beijing lawyer known for taking politically delicate cases, was sentenced to three years of probation in 2006 for inciting subversion of the state. The official Xinhua news agency reported last month that his probation had been revoked.But human rights advocates say Mr. Gao was never on probation because he had been missing for 20 months, presumably in police custody. Over the years, Mr. Gao has disappeared for lengthy periods and re-emerged to say he had been tortured by security forces.After his 2006 conviction, Mr. Gao was supposedly released on probation, but then disappeared. He resurfaced briefly, and apparently was seized by security officials again in 2009. He re-emerged in April 2010 and gave an interview to The Associated Press, presumably with the permission of officials, and then disappeared again. Mr. Gao’s brother said at the time that he had seen Mr. Gao in the custody of public security officers.Mr. Gao is one of China’s most outspoken dissidents, and his case has attracted support from foreign governments and human rights groups. The United States government has called on China to release Mr. Gao, who once defended practitioners of Falun Gong, a banned spiritual group.'"

"'12-01-03,'1','Mr. Myers is the third person to be appointed to the post, which was created in 2008 and is chosen by a committee formed by two groups: the Center for the Book in the Library of Congress and Every Child a Reader, a nonprofit organization affiliated with the Children’s Book Council, a trade association for children’s book publishers. He succeeds Katherine Paterson, the novelist best known for her “Bridge to Terabithia,” and the first appointee, Jon Scieszka, author of books including “The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales.”The choice of Mr. Myers represents a departure from his predecessors and is likely to be seen as a bold statement. His books chronicle the lives of many urban teenagers, especially young, poor African-Americans. While his body of work includes poetry, nonfiction and the occasional cheerful picture book for children, its standout books offer themes aimed at young-adult readers: stories of teenagers in violent gangs, soldiers headed to Iraq and juvenile offenders imprisoned for their crimes.While many young-adult authors shy away from such risky subject material, Mr. Myers has used his books to confront the darkness and despair that fill so many children’s lives.But he does so, critics say, with a sense of possibility. Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 2008, Leonard S. Marcus praised Mr. Myers’s body of work. “Drugs, drive-by shootings, gang warfare, wasted lives — Myers has written about all these subjects with nuanced understanding and a hard-won, qualified sense of hope,” Mr. Marcus wrote.Robin Adelson, the executive director of the Children’s Book Council, said that while there was a hard edge to Mr. Myers’s writing, there was also the message of holding yourself up and believing in what you can do.“I think part of what makes him such a great choice for this post is that his writing is a little bit of everything,” she said. “There’s this interest in history and this deep knowledge of history in Walter’s writing. Then there’s this definite hard-core, hard-edged realism.”His appointment could be viewed as another volley in a debate that intensified last year about young adult literature and whether it is too grim, too dark and too violent for the age group. An essay in The Wall Street Journal in June by Meghan Cox Gurdon questioned contemporary teenage fiction that “can be like a hall of fun-house mirrors, constantly reflecting back hideously distorted portrayals of what life is.”But Jennifer Brown, a member of the ambassadorship selection committee and the children’s editor for Shelf Awareness, an industry newsletter, said: “With Walter’s work, he’s very responsible about conveying enough to give you a sense of the grittiness, but there’s not a lot of graphic violence. With Walter’s books, it’s much more about the emotional impact of the violence that these kids grow up around. It’s not a fantasy.”Mr. Myers’s own biography provides a glimpse into the experiences that shape his work. Born Walter Milton Myers in West Virginia in 1937, he was given away by his father to a couple, Florence and Herbert Dean, after his mother died when he was a small child. They moved to Harlem with Walter, who later added the middle name Dean in their honor.Reading was not an integral part of his home life. Herbert Dean worked as a janitor and was illiterate. Florence Dean cleaned houses and was employed in a button factory.But by the age of 5, Mr. Myers was learning to read through whatever material he found at home. Mrs. Dean sometimes read him “true romance” magazines, full of short stories. Comic books from his older sisters provided more reading material.In fourth grade he published his first poem in the school yearbook, igniting a lifelong love of poetry. Sitting in an easy chair in his living room on a recent afternoon, Mr. Myers recited its lines with a laugh:“I know a lady oh so fair.To me she gives such loving care.I love that lady like no other.Because that lady is my mother.”When he saw it in the yearbook, “I ran all the way home, I was so excited,” Mr. Myers said.But by the time he entered his teens, his home life had become a tremendous distraction. An uncle was murdered, sending Mr. Dean into a deep depression. Mrs. Dean, who had long struggled with drinking, became a full-blown alcoholic. And the young Walter, while praised by his teachers for his quick mind and reading ability, began to flounder at school.“I wasn’t showing up,” he said. “My thinking capacity fell off a cliff. My head was totally, completely filled up with what my thing was at home.” Mr. Myers enlisted in the Army on his 17th birthday, dropping out of Stuyvesant High School in Manhattan.After serving in the Army, he found his way back to writing. Mystery magazines published his submissions, earning him $5 or $10 checks. Then he entered — and won — a contest for writing a picture book. (In the meantime he held down jobs at the Postal Service and an employment office, among other places.) Since then his books have won the Coretta Scott King Award and the Michael L. Printz Award. “Monster,” the story of a young Harlem man’s trial for murder, was a National Book Award finalist in 1999.As ambassador, Mr. Myers will appear at Children’s Book Week in New York in May and at the National Book Festival in Washington. He will receive a medal at the Library of Congress next Tuesday. One of the first things he expects to say is that reading is not a Victorian pastime.“People still try to sell books that way — as ‘books can take you to foreign lands,’ ” he said. “We’ve given children this idea that reading and books are a nice option, if you want that kind of thing. I hope we can get over that idea.”'"
"'12-01-03,'1','Ms. Bingley said she was stunned to see, in the Sept. 18, 2001, issue of The Sun, a photograph of her son reading a bedtime story to his two sons, which she did not give to the paper. The story also contained details about her son that she said no one from her family had provided to The Sun. “It never made sense to me,” she said, adding that she suspects hacking or worse by the paper. “I’d like very much for the government to tell us whether this happened or not. Celebrities seem to have no trouble finding out.”In July, as revelations about widespread phone hacking by the tabloid were spilling out, another British newspaper, The Daily Mirror, reported that a private investigator said that News of the World reporters had offered to pay him to retrieve phone records of Sept. 11 victims. After the report, which was not confirmed by other news organizations, the Justice Department opened an investigation. To date, no evidence has emerged publicly that Sept. 11 victims were hacking targets.Jodi Westbrook Flowers, a lawyer at a South Carolina firm that represents more than 6,700 relatives of Sept. 11 victims, said she and her colleagues had scoured the British tabloids and found scores of details about the victims. Relatives were not certain how the tabloids found out so much so quickly after the attacks.One of the relatives, whom she declined to identify, said that five days after Sept. 11, The Sun published the words from a voice mail message left on his cellphone by his son, who was aboard one of the planes that hit the World Trade Center. (British authorities are also investigating whether hacking occurred at The Sun, which, like The News of the World, is owned by News Corporation.)In late September, Ms. Flowers, of the Motley Rice law firm, sent Mr. Holder phone numbers of two dozen relatives of victims and asked that Scotland Yard run them through the 12,000 pages of documents seized from the home of Glenn Mulcaire, the private investigator responsible for most of the hacking by the now-shuttered News of the World. She said at least 100 of her clients, in both the United States and Britain, now want similar information.On Nov. 3, Vida G. Bottom, chief of the Justice Department’s public corruption unit, wrote to the lawyers, saying, “The F.B.I. has undertaken a preliminary review to assess the veracity of those allegations.”Ms. Flowers said she was disappointed by the vagueness of the response. “We asked a simple threshold question, and we basically received a nonanswer,” she said.Ms. Flowers added, “If there was no hacking, it is wildly coincidental that so many people describe similar experiences.”Even so, two Justice Department officials with knowledge of the inquiry said they did not expect much to come of the investigation. The officials, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss a continuing criminal inquiry, said the investigation remained open in case Scotland Yard discovered evidence confirming the suspicions of the Sept. 11 relatives. They both said they were doubtful such evidence would emerge.Tracy Schmaler, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said only, “It’s an ongoing investigation.”Norman Siegel, a lawyer for nearly two dozen victims’ families who also attended the meeting with Mr. Holder, said, “As far as I know, there is still serious interest in this investigation not only by the Department of Justice and the F.B.I. but by Attorney General Holder himself.” He said he understands his clients’ frustration, but remains optimistic they will ultimately believe their suspicions have been investigated “in good faith.”A determination that the relatives of Sept. 11 victims were hacked would add a new, explosive twist to the scandal, particularly if they are in the United States. The confirmed cases of hacking — which extend to celebrities, government officials and crime victims — have all been confined to Britain.Many of the instances recounted by relatives of victims do not fit the pattern of the confirmed hacking cases, in which cellphone messages were illegally accessed in pursuit of tabloid stories. But even if they cannot point to subsequent tabloid stories, the relatives with memories of the odd occurrences after the attacks are eager for an answer from the Justice Department.Lorie Van Auken, whose husband, Kenneth Van Auken, died in the World Trade Center, said she noticed clicks on her home phone line for months after the attacks and overheard cross-talking voices. “It is mystifying,” she said of the Justice Department’s silence. “This is a peace of mind issue. We just want to know the truth.”In interviews, more than a half-dozen relatives of Sept. 11 victims reported having suspicions that someone had gained illegal access to their phones.Jack Grandcolas, whose wife, Lauren Grandcolas, was aboard Flight 93, which crashed in Shanksville, Pa., said that one night several months after her death, his home telephone rang and he listened as the answering machine played previously recorded messages, apparently through a password-enabled command. “It was as if the phone had been accessed by someone,” he said.Among the messages was the one his wife left from the plane saying: “I’m totally fine. I just love you more than anything, just know that. And you know, I’m, you know, I’m comfortable and I’m O.K. — for now. Just a little problem.”Years later, that message appeared on YouTube accompanied by a laugh track. Although Mr. Grandcolas said he allowed two documentary producers to use the message, his memory of the answering machine episode and clicking sounds he heard on his phone after the attacks made him wonder if he was a victim of hacking.Lucy Aita, whose fiancé, Paul Innella, 33, of East Brunswick, N.J., died in the World Trade Center, said she also recalls clicking sounds on her telephone for months after the attacks.“Every time we picked up the phone, we heard a little clicking noise that was intermittent,” she said. “Then we started hearing voices of people, as if they were on a speaker phone. A few times we’d say, ‘Can you stop listening to us, please?’ Then all of the sudden, we’d hear a click and they would be gone.”'"
"'12-01-03,'1','The Knicks need their All-Star big man.“I miss him a lot; I miss him a lot,” said Anthony, who missed a three to tie with less than 15 seconds left on what Coach Mike D’Antoni called a busted play. “But most important I want him to be 100 percent healthy.”Seventy percent, Anthony said, won’t do, and D’Antoni agrees.“I don’t think there is a rush,” D’Antoni said. “He’s got to be 100 percent before he plays. We’re not going to risk anything.”Referring to the truncated schedule, Stoudemire said: “It’s such an impactful season. You don’t want anything to linger on.”Still, D’Antoni acknowledges that getting Stoudemire back as soon as possible is necessary for his offense, especially its pick-and-roll foundation, to start hitting on all cylinders, something it did infrequently during the three games the All-Star big man played before going down.Because Tyson Chandler is more capable and occupies more space in the pick-and-roll than any of Stoudemire’s sidekicks last year, Stoudemire’s has to adjust, D’Antoni said.Stoudemire dismissed any problems with making those adjustments, saying, “I’ve played with these guys.” But D’Antoni said: “It takes time. Everybody has different characteristics, and it just takes a while to blend them all and getting everybody to trust in what they’re doing.”On Monday, whether it was a lack of trust in his teammates or just how the game played out, Anthony couldn’t explain his 31 shots, or the season-high 35 3’s the Knicks launched, of which they made just 10.They scored only 11 points during a second quarter in which they dug a 17-point halftime deficit, then stormed back to within three in the third behind a 10-point burst by Douglas: two threes sandwiched around a four-point play. But after him, only Chandler, again plagued by fouls, scored in double figures (11).“You might be able to sneak by one game,” D’Antoni said of life without Stoudemire.Just not past a team that blew a 16-point lead to lose Sunday night in Orlando and squandered another double-digit advantage in a loss to Dallas this season.Of the other injured Knicks besides Amar’e Stoudemire, the rookie guard Iman Shumpert could return soonest. He tested his sprained right knee with an extensive workout Monday, could practice Tuesday and may be ready Wednesday, less than two weeks after he injured his knee in the season-opening win over Boston. The original prognosis was twice that. ... Jared Jeffries will not return until a day or two after he is ready, Mike D’Antoni said, to make sure his injured right calf has healed. The timetable is thus uncertain. ... Baron Davis remains weeks away from returning from his back injury, D’Antoni said. ... The N.B.A. rescinded the flagrant foul Mike Bibby received Sunday in Sacramento.'"
"'12-01-03,'1','Although the government has long restricted the work and words of opponents, its tolerance has diminished further since February, when unrest in the Arab world unnerved senior leaders. Dozens of rights lawyers and intellectuals have been detained, countless others have been subjected to heightened police surveillance, and propaganda officials have sought to tighten controls on the Internet.The artist and critic Ai Weiwei, who disappeared for more than two months, is still battling tax-evasion charges, an accusation he says is designed to silence him.“The government seems to be going in only one direction, which is more control and harsher punishment against political dissidents,” said Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. “This is a reflection of the broader atmosphere in China, which is more conservative and hard-line.”Mr. Bequelin and other analysts say they suspect the space for dissent will only narrow in 2012. There is the coming change in leadership, a transition that takes place once every decade, as well as the specter of an economic slowdown that party leaders worry could exacerbate social tensions.Prognosticating in China is always a risky endeavor, but there are signs that the Communist Party is seeking to sharpen the tools it uses to quash dissent. A proposed revision to the criminal code would allow the police to secretly detain for six months those accused of “endangering national security,” a catchall designation often wielded against political offenders.Jerome A. Cohen, a professor at New York University School of Law and an expert on Chinese law, called the revision “sinister” and said it would unduly strengthen the hand of the police. “It legalizes repressive and abusive state tactics,” Professor Cohen said.The case of Ms. Ni and Mr. Dong highlights the ways officials can leverage the legal system against those they deem to be nuisances. Ms. Ni, 51, who received a law degree from China University of Political Science and Law, drew the attention of the authorities in 2002, when she used her expertise to help neighbors in Xicheng fighting eviction, part of the government’s sweeping effort to remake the capital ahead of the Olympics.Detained after she tried to photograph demolition crews, she said she was kicked and pummeled over the course of 15 hours, leaving her incontinent and unable to walk. She was released after 75 days but continued her legal work while also seeking redress for the beating. Over the next few years, she was arrested twice more and convicted of “obstructing public business.”During her three years in prison, she said, she endured frequent indignities: An officer once urinated on her face, she said, and prison officials often took away her crutches, forcing her to crawl from her cell to the prison workshop. One of her tasks included cleaning toilets.Her daughter, too, said she was subjected to government surveillance. “The police followed me to school and watched me all day so I would experience the fear,” said the daughter, Dong Xuan, now 27.Ms. Ni gained her freedom in April 2010, but found herself homeless after the police made it difficult for her to rent an apartment or a hotel room, she said. Supporters donated a tent, which she and her husband pitched in a park in central Beijing. But when petitioners and reporters began showing up in large numbers, the authorities moved the couple into a dingy hotel room.Their latest arrest, in April 2011, appears to have been prompted by Ms. Ni’s continued work dispensing legal help to people who flocked to the couple’s tiny room at the Xin Royal Palace Hotel. Indeed, one of the charges she faces is fraud — prosecutors say her disbarment meant she was not allowed to engage in legal work.The couple are also accused of failing to pay their hotel bill.The police tried to dislodge them last winter by cutting off water and electricity to the room, she said. Their plight caught the attention of Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the American ambassador, who visited them in February. After photographs of Ms. Ni working by candlelight began to spread on the Internet, the authorities took the couple into custody.During their trial last week, Ms. Ni, thin and weak, was propped up on a makeshift bed, an oxygen mask tethered to her face. Outside, a heavy police presence prevented family members, supporters and foreign diplomats from entering the courtroom. Their lawyer, Mr. Cheng, claims the proceedings were illegal because 9 of his 10 witnesses were barred from testifying.Reached by phone, a spokesman for the Xicheng District People’s Court declined to answer questions about the case.The only witness was Ms. Ni’s daughter, who spoke briefly about her mother’s health problems. “I don’t expect her to get a fair trial,” Ms. Dong said afterward. “My mother can’t walk, and she can barely breathe. I can’t understand why they just won’t let her be.”'"
"'12-01-03,'1','It’s nearly a century since the magazine Poetry was founded on uncertain prospects and an “open door” promise: “May the great poet we are looking for never find it shut.” Across the decades, the slim, challenging magazine has survived, publishing all manner of startling new poets, including T.S. Eliot, Langston Hughes, Wallace Stevens, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ezra Pound and Marianne Moore. Robert Frost happily celebrated its first decade in a subscription blurb urging readers to try Poetry as the “best boost” ever for struggling versifiers.Frost understood poets need all the help they can get, and it is a pleasant surprise to discover the magazine currently grappling with success. Its circulation has nearly tripled to 30,000 since Christian Wiman, a poet and critic, took over as editor eight years ago. Poetry receives 100,000 submissions a year and publishes 300 — the open door now closer to the eye of a needle.The magazine has a busy foundation and splendid new headquarters in Chicago financed from what, in the imagined world of threadbare poets, was an eye-popping and deeply envied bequest of $200 million in 2002 from Ruth Lilly, the pharmaceutical heiress.Lyrical and affordable things are happening, like poetry apps for readers’ smartphones and an increase in the rate paid to poets. The magazine now has an inviting edge of criticism that does not spare established poets — and lively complaints from some loyalists that its 100-year-old mission is being compromised in a populist vs. elitist squeeze. In short, Poetry has become a controversial must-read, not a bad formula for a happy centenary.'"
"'12-01-03,'1','The surreal scene at Jets headquarters Monday seemed fitting for a team that had peddled its inflated beliefs: in the end, all that noise produced nothing. Nowhere was that more apparent than in Ryan’s answer to a question about Holmes. Ryan spent 36 seconds discussing what he perceives as Holmes’s assets, uttering the phrases “good teammate” and “a lot of positive things,” before mentioning that the Jets in general have to “change some things.”Ryan lumped Holmes in with everyone else on the team, as if 52 other players had failed to show up to a wide receiver meeting called by Sanchez on Thursday or pouted in a huddle Sunday, leading to a skirmish that resulted in his benching.“I don’t think I had the pulse of our team the way I’ve done in the past,” said Ryan, who said that “became clear” during individual meetings with players Monday.When he met with the team as a whole, Ryan blistered the Jets with an impassioned speech that left him in tears. He pleaded for unity, beseeching the Jets several times to “get back to being a team and not a bunch of individuals,” as guard Brandon Moore put it. It was harsh and unforgiving, but in their minds, players nodded along.In reshaping the Jets’ roster, Tannenbaum jettisoned many of their true leaders — Jerricho Cotchery, Tony Richardson and Thomas Jones — in favor of those with comparable ability but minimal locker-room presence, players like John Conner or Nick Folk. On Monday, Tannenbaum said he always considered whether the Jets were mortgaging character for talent but did not answer when asked whether he had made mistakes in assembling the roster.“Any guy that’s a Jet is someone that we feel good about on all levels,” said Tannenbaum, who added that he was confident in the team’s nucleus.The Jets’ formula for success had been so simple. They could afford to acquire players with questionable pasts, like Holmes and Antonio Cromartie, because of confidence that Ryan would form a cohesive group through sheer force of personality. As one off-season acquisition, Derrick Mason, evolved into a disaster and was traded to Houston, Holmes’s fusillade of critical comments toward Sanchez and the offensive line reinforced Ryan’s miscalculation of Holmes as captain material.When Holmes and Moore met with him in his office leading to their Oct. 17 game against Miami, Ryan was satisfied.“I thought that we were past all that,” he said, adding later, but “we were not as close of a football team as I thought we were.”Of Holmes, guard Matt Slauson said: “That kind of stuff destroys teams. That’s Football 101: you don’t call out your teammates. You do, but not like that. You don’t call them out publicly. If you’ve got a problem, you go up to them and say, ‘Hey, I’ve got an issue.’ You don’t go to the press and blast them like that. But that’s something that will be fixed.”It will be done internally, and not at the behest of a captain. Ryan called that experiment “a huge mistake,” even though the Jets’ five other captains — Moore, Sione Pouha, Revis, Sanchez and Eric Smith — were well respected in the locker room.“I want to have 53 of the same type of guys,” Ryan said.'"
"'12-01-03,'1','“But he didn’t see,” General Dabi told the , asserting that the observer was referring to a hypothetical case.In interviews, several people who have dealt with the general said he was a likable and efficient administrator, and some said it was conceivable that he could run the observer mission with fairness.Others, though, called him exactly the wrong kind of person to lead such a mission: a career enforcer for an authoritarian government who had shown a harsh hand in dealing with opponents.“I don’t know if they looked into his background,” said Faisal Mohammed Salih, a columnist with the Sudanese newspaper Al Akhbar. “This is a human rights mission. They should have chosen someone who is sensitive to human rights issues. Military men in the Arab world should be the last choice for such missions.”Several attempts to reach General Dabi on his cellphone or through the observer delegation’s office in Damascus were unsuccessful.On Monday, the Arab League came to his defense. At a news conference in Cairo, the league’s director, Nabil al-Araby, called General Dabi a “capable military man with a clean reputation,” The Associated Press reported.Mr. Araby addressed criticism that the observer mission was weak, understaffed and easily manipulated by the government, saying the observers were trying to be less reliant on the government’s planning, The A.P. said.But he conceded the main criticism of Syrian activists, that the mission has been powerless to stop the bloodshed. Although the tanks had been withdrawn, he said, snipers persisted.Syrian activists say more than 150 people have been killed since the monitors arrived last week. On Sunday, an Arab League advisory body, the 88-member Arab Parliament, called for the group to leave because the government was continuing to kill its opponents.Given General Dabi’s biography, the activists have been skeptical of the mission from the start.Originally from the town of Berber in northern Sudan, General Dabi, 63, graduated from military college in Sudan in 1969, according to a résumé he provided to journalists after his selection.For decades, he played a forceful if quiet role in the government of President . He was a member of a trusted inner circle who rose to power immediately after the 1989 coup that brought Mr. Bashir to power. Time and again, the president picked General Dabi for important security posts, often overseeing counterinsurgency campaigns or clampdowns on dissidents.His first post in the Bashir government was as head of military intelligence. His name was rarely in the news, but reports by from the early 1990s document the role that military intelligence agents played in executions, torture and disappearances as the government fought insurgents in southern Sudan. The rebels were also accused of atrocities, including executions and indiscriminate shelling of cities.Erwin van der Borght, the director of the Program for Amnesty International, said General Dabi never investigated the “widespread” allegations of atrocities.After serving as the head of the external security agency and then deputy chief of staff in the armed forces, he was assigned by Mr. Bashir to curb a bloody civil conflict in the region.The general arrived in Darfur in early 1999 with “two helicopter gunships and a company of 120 soldiers,” according to “Darfur: A Short History of a Long War,” by Alex de Waal and Julie Flint, making clear to warring Masalit and Arab tribesmen that their refusal to comply with a cease-fire would be dealt with harshly.“He ordered the gunship pilots to put on a display of firepower in front of tribal leaders — ‘to show what the helicopters could do,’ ” the book said.Rebel leaders from Darfur charged that General Dabi’s four-month tenure in western Darfur was a precursor to the government’s brutal counterinsurgency campaign in the region several years later, and that the government-backed militias known as the Janjaweed rose to prominence then.Mr. de Waal, who interviewed General Dabi for the book, said in an e-mail: “He took the line that the problems needed a very firm hand, a show of force to demonstrate who was in charge. The Masalit see his months there as a time of repression. Al-Dabi insists he was evenhanded and effective.“Either way,” Mr. de Waal added, “he was a controversial figure and an exemplar of a military style of conducting political business.”Several years ago, when the Sudanese government needed someone to defend its repeated violations of an arms embargo in Darfur to experts, the president again turned to General Dabi.As members of a United Nations panel tried to pry information from Sudanese officials about the violations in Darfur, including bombings, General Dabi repeatedly obstructed their investigation, curbing their travel and making sure that no one spoke to them without his approval, two members of the panel said. One of the members called him the “bottleneck.”“Al-Dabi is not about the truth, or facts,” said another member, Enrico Carisch, who was the panel’s coordinator in 2008. “He is about fitting the facts and the truth to the policies. There was never any confusion.”The Arab League has not publicly said why it chose General Dabi to head the Syria mission, though Mr. Salih, the Sudanese columnist, and others have speculated that he was ’s choice. The general had served as Sudan’s ambassador to Qatar, a league member that helped drive the action against Syria and has ties with Sudan. Analysts also point out that Sudan’s friendly relations with Syria made it easier for Damascus to accept him.General Dabi is not the only liability in an observer mission that analysts say suffers from deep flaws. While its members include some respected human rights workers, others are said to be diplomats and functionaries sent by Arab League governments with their own woeful records of human rights. The Arab League has not released a list of the observers.When the observers arrived in Syria last week, after a few hours of training, critics quickly pointed out that the 60-member team was hardly sufficient to monitor a conflict spread across a country of 20 million people. Even so, the protesters, emboldened by the observers, took to the streets in larger numbers, culminating in huge marches in cities across Syria on Friday.Government attacks on civilians have continued, but there have also been reports of battles between armed gunmen and government forces. On Monday, despite promises by an opposition militia to halt attacks on the government, armed gunmen stormed several military checkpoints in the northern province of Idlib, killing an unknown number of government soldiers and kidnapping dozens of others, Reuters reported.Mr. Araby, the Arab League’s director, said it was often hard for the observers to tell who was shooting at whom.'"
"'12-01-03,'1','But some of the union’s executive members have suggested that Caterpillar’s contract demands were intended to provoke a shutdown of the Canadian factory as a prelude to moving all production to the United States.Caterpillar has a long history of tough labor negotiations and bitter labor disputes. In 1995, workers at the company’s unionized operations in the United States returned to work after declaring a 17-month strike a failure. In 2009, workers took executives at Caterpillar France hostage during a dispute over the restructuring of operations in Grenoble.Electro-Motive is the second-largest maker of locomotives in North America, after General Electric, and for most of its history was a unit of General Motors. While the parent company, Electro-Motive Diesel, is based in LaGrange, Ill., its only assembly plant in recent years has been the Canadian operation.But last October, Progress Rail, Caterpillar’s rail operations holding company, opened a new locomotive assembly plant in Muncie, Ind.The Canadian Auto Workers say that wages and benefits are substantially lower at the new American factory.The union has suggested that, in addition to reducing labor costs, the company may also want to end Canadian production to avoid potential problems with “Buy American” provisions of United States government procurement rules. While the United States government has said that Canada is exempt from any such measures, labor leaders say that has not always been the case in practice.The purchase of Electro-Motive Canada was reviewed by the Canadian government under the nation’s foreign investment laws. The union has asked the government to release what conditions, if any, were attached to the subsequent approval. The Canadian government recently settled a dispute with United States Steel under those laws after the company shut down a Canadian steel maker shortly after acquiring it.“When a foreign company comes in and purchases an existing facility, there has to be a benefit to Canadians,” said Mr. Carrie, the union executive. “Americans coming in and trying to slash wages in half is not a benefit to Canadians.”Industry Canada, the government department that handles investment reviews, was closed for the New Year holiday on Monday and did not respond to requests for comment.Anne Marie Quinn, a spokeswoman for Electro-Motive Canada, declined to answer questions about the company’s contract demands, its long-term production plans or any commitments made to the Canadian government.The company’s Web site about the labor dispute, though, said that the cost of wages and benefits for its workers in Illinois, who are represented by the United Automobile Workers, is about half that for the London plant.The site says that the now-expired contract at the Canadian factory “also has antiquated work rules that make the London operation inefficient.”'"
"'12-01-03,'1','The most diplomatically fragile proposal involves a financial transaction tax, which has been proposed by the European Commission and could raise about $74 billion a year, starting in 2014. Under the plan, the tax would be levied at a rate of one-tenth of 1 percent on all transactions between institutions. Derivatives contracts would be taxed at the rate of one-hundredth of 1 percent.French and German policy makers see this as a “Robin Hood tax,” a way of discouraging speculative transactions and raising cash from the bankers who provoked the financial crisis.Financial analysts say that it was Britain’s concern over this impending legislation — and the potential damage it could do to its banking industry — that was at least partly responsible for its unyielding stance at the December meeting. British leaders feared that in the absence of global regulations, banks would simply relocate from London to New York, Singapore or other lower-tax domains. The British government points out that even a study by the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, suggests that the tax could reduce European gross domestic product by 1.76 percent.Under the proposed legislation, a British veto would no longer prevent nine or more nations that wanted to go ahead from doing so. In principle, this would allow Britain to continue as a partial tax haven. But a clause in the law would require banks in the smaller group of nations to pay the tax on some transactions, even if they operate in London.Similarly, moves to harmonize the base on which corporate taxes are assessed in Europe could work among a smaller number of nations even if Britain did not take part. Large corporations operating across borders would be able to opt for a unified tax system in the countries that sign up for the plan. That would simplify tax issues for companies operating in the participating nations and might even tempt some to relocate to them at the expense of Britain, which is likely to stay out.“Obviously, these proposals are both on the table for 27 member states, and we would like to see them agreed by the 27,” said Emer Traynor, spokeswoman on taxation for the European Commission. “However, if that is not possible, these proposals are also workable if done by a smaller group. It is still completely feasible for a smaller group of member states to go ahead with them and deliver big benefits.”Despite Britain’s December veto of the treaty change on the euro, no additional protection for financial services was secured by the British. Neither of the two tax plans has yet been discussed fully by the 27 member nations, and smaller groups of countries could not contemplate forging ahead unless they were rejected.The new way of devising laws is not always aimed against Britain. The British have, in fact, joined one plan, which aims to build a European system for patent protection. But the shift in the way the union is legislating is significant because it changes the rules of the game.Some European officials argue that Britain, which has long promoted the idea of a more variable model of European integration, with countries free to pick and choose the degree of cooperation, is now experiencing the downside. Laws are being drafted in the knowledge that Britain may not take part and so are intended to prevent it from reaping a competitive advantage by staying out.'"

"'12-01-03,'1','Today, the big children will eat, Cynthia, 15, and Guellor, 13. Tomorrow, it will be the turn of the little ones, Bénédicte, Josiane and Manassé, 3, 6, and 9.Of course, the small ones will fuss. “Yes, sure, they ask for food, but we don’t have any,” said their mother, Ghislaine Berbok, a police officer who earns $50 a month. There will have been a little bread for them at breakfast, but nothing more.“At night they will be weak,” she said. “Sure, they complain. But there is nothing we can do.”The Berboks are practicing a Kinshasa family ritual almost as common here as corrugated metal roofs and dirt streets: the “power cut,” as residents in this capital of some 10 million have ironically christened it. On some days, some children eat, others do not. On other days, all the children eat, and the adults do not. Or vice versa.The term “power cut” — in French, délestage — is meant to evoke another unloved routine of city life: the rolling blackouts that hit first one neighborhood, then another.Délestage is universally used in French-speaking Africa to describe these state-decreed power cutoffs, but when applied to rationing food it illustrates a stark survival calculus, one the head of a household must painfully impose on the rest. And unlike the blackouts, it is not merely a temporary unpleasantness mandated from on high.“If today we eat, tomorrow we’ll drink tea,” said Dieudonné Nsala, a father of five who earns $60 a month as an administrator at the Education Ministry. Rent is $120 a month; the numbers, Mr. Nsala pointed out, simply do not add up. Are there days when his children do not eat? “Of course!” Mr. Nsala answered, puzzled at the question. “It can be two days a week,” he said.Though residents here frequently gather on crowded street corners to argue politics, their daily struggle may help explain why the capital did not experience sustained mass demonstrations after disputed election results were announced last month. Sporadic protests and street clashes certainly erupted, but the margin of survival here is simply too slim for most people to demonstrate for very long.“People in Kinshasa are so poor, they are living hand to mouth,” said Théodore Trefon, a researcher at the Royal Museum for in . “They simply don’t have the means to mobilize for a long time.”Beyond that, the government leaves little room for expressions of popular discontent. said that Congolese soldiers had killed at least 24 people and detained dozens more after the flawed elections that returned President to office.Whatever the city’s misgivings about the vote, daily life itself is enough of a challenge.“On the weekend, you’ve got to do everything you can to have food because you are at home with the children,” said Mr. Nsala, the administrator. “But there are days, for sure, when we don’t eat. I’ll say, ‘There isn’t enough to eat, so you, maman and the kids, you take it.’ ”Mr. Nsala, soft-spoken and precise in his diction, stared at the floor of his modest cinder-block, metal-roofed living room. Fuzzy television news played in the background. His wife was selling vegetables out front, to supplement the meager family income. Don’t ask him about meat.“Maybe, if we make a sacrifice,” he said, pointing out that a pound of beef costs $5.At the Berbok household — where Ghislaine’s husband, a teacher, earns $42 a month, adding to her salary as a police officer — there has been no fish in a year.“Délestage. That means: ‘Today we eat. Tomorrow we don’t.’ The Congolese, in the spirit of irony, have adopted this term,” said Mr. Nsala quietly. He added that the family had eaten the day before: “So, today, there is nothing.”The food délestage is not new in Congo, a country rich in minerals and verdant landscapes yet also one of the hungriest on earth, according to experts. It is last on the 2011 Global Hunger Index, a measure of and child compiled by the International Food Policy Research Institute, and has gotten worse. It was the only country where the food situation dropped from “alarming” to “extremely alarming,” the institute reported this year. Half the country is considered undernourished.Ten years ago, even poor Congolese could expect to eat one substantial meal a day — perhaps cassava, a starchy root, with some palm oil, and a little of the imported frozen fish that is a staple here. But in the last three years, even that certainty has dropped away, said Dr. Eric Tollens, an expert on nutrition in Congo at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium, where he is an emeritus professor at the Center for Agricultural and Food Economics.Dr. Tollens blamed the “total neglect of agriculture by the government,” which is fixated on the lucrative extraction of valuable minerals like copper and cobalt. Less than 1 percent of the Congolese national budget, he said, goes to agriculture. Foreign donors finance “all agricultural projects,” he said, and “massive amounts of food” are imported in this rich land, so food is expensive.“Agricultural productivity is simply gone,” he said in an interview, adding that there was no reason for a lush, fertile country like Congo to be importing 20,000 tons of beans a year.“It’s worse than or ,” he said, citing two sub-Saharan nations perennially teetering on the verge of famine. “Come on, come on. With so many resources, what’s happening?”Half the population eats only once a day, Dr. Tollens wrote in an essay several years ago, while a quarter eats only once every two days.“Before, we ate three times a day; now, we eat by délestage,” said Cele Bunata-Kumba, a tennis coach who lives in the Matongele neighborhood of Kinshasa with his wife and 12 children.“Today, it’s the children who eat,” he said. “We, the adults, we can sacrifice ourselves. We, the adults, we can get by,” he said, grimacing. “Yes, yes, of course, all day. With nothing to eat. No bread. Sure, that happens,” he added.In the immediate term, the street-smart Kinois — as Kinshasa’s residents are known — famous for hustling and adept at the art of survival in a harsh environment, must cope. They must feed their children, the top priority, a number of families said.In the household run by Elisa Luzingu and her sister-in-law Marie Bumba — Ms. Luzingu’s husband is out of work — the children range in age from 7 to 17. Délestage means no meals, three days a week. “My children are studying, so, it is very difficult,” Ms. Luzingu said.On the days without food, Ms. Bumba said, the children “will be very tired and hungry.”On a recent gray Sunday, at least, “everybody eats,” Ms. Bumba said, standing outdoors in the bare courtyard next to a simmering pot of matembele: sweet potato, palm oil, greens and a little fish. There were smiles all around. The food was almost ready.“The Kinois,” said Mr. Bunata-Kumba, the tennis coach. “For him, eating is day to day.”'"
"'12-01-03,'1','ISTANBUL — Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister of Gaza, who is making his first official trip abroad since his Islamist movement took over the Palestinian strip in 2007, sought Monday to strengthen ties with the Arab and Muslim world in the wake of regional uprisings that have produced a rise in Islamist political strength.Here in Turkey, where Mr. Haniya arrived after visiting Egypt and Sudan, he was quoted by the semiofficial Anatolian Agency on Monday as saying that “the Arab Spring is turning into an Islamic spring.”Turkey, ruled by the Islamic-based Justice and Development Party, has grown close to Hamas and has downgraded its relations with Israel. In 2010, a group of ships and boats sailed from Turkey in an effort to break the Israeli naval blockade of Gaza, and Israeli commandos boarded the vessels to stop them. When they met with resistance, the commandos killed nine activists on board. Turkey has demanded an apology and compensation; Israel has refused.Mr. Haniya visited the Mavi Marmara, the largest ship of the flotilla, on Monday and said, “The blood of Mavi Marmara martyrs and that of Palestinian martyrs is joined for a hopeful future.”While Mr. Haniya tours the region seeking financial and political support — he is heading to Iran, a major backer, in the coming days, according to the semiofficial Iranian news agency FARS — his rivals in the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority were due to meet with Israeli officials on Tuesday for the first time in 15 months.'"
"'12-01-03,'1','Eric Fuller, brand director for Brisk, said the brand’s sales had more than doubled in the last two years, to a projected 104 million cases this year from 48 million cases in 2009. Similarly, according to data provided by Larry Finkel, director of food and beverage research for MarketResearch.com, Brisk’s dollar sales in supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchants excluding Walmart rose 12 percent, to $94.3 million, in the year ending April 17, 2011.That rate of growth far exceeded the rate of dollar sales growth of PepsiCo’s other Lipton ready-to-drink tea brands, Lipton, Lipton Diet, Lipton PureLeaf and Tazo.Brisk’s rate of dollar sales growth also exceeded that of rival brands Arizona, up 3.5 percent, and Snapple, up 6.2 percent. During this period, Arizona Beverage Company brands generated 30.8 percent of all ready-to-drink tea dollar sales, PepsiCo 29.9 percent and the Dr Pepper Snapple Group 17.2 percent, Mr. Finkel said.The 3-D release of “Phantom Menace” is slated for Feb. 10, and the “Star Wars” campaign is aimed at continuing Mekanism’s success in increasing Brisk’s social media presence and sales. PepsiCo’s initiatives will include the introduction, starting Tuesday, of special “Star Wars” packaging and promotions at retailers.Among these are a one-liter, limited-edition bottle of raspberry iced tea with a Darth Maul label; codes under caps of one-liter bottles of Brisk’s 12 teas and juice drinks, which will help buyers play the “Star Wars” mobile game; and a new one-gallon jug, in four flavors, for home consumption.On Wednesday, a new Brisksaber mobile game app — developed by Flying Wisdom Studios of San Francisco — will be introduced in the Android and Apple marketplace; players will be able to unlock new game characters, vehicles and weapons by redeeming bottle cap codes. The app will be promoted on Facebook and Hulu, and through Tapjoy, an app ad network, beginning Jan. 9.On Jan. 15, 15- and 30-second TV spots will start running, initially on Fox Broadcasting’s Sunday night “Animation Domination” programming, and subsequently on network and cable stations like Adult Swim, Comedy Central, MTV, Spike and Syfy.The 30-second spot shows Yoda and Darth Maul beginning to fight. Darth Maul’s light saber malfunctions many times before he falls into a Brisk vending machine. Although he is reinvigorated when he drinks the iced tea, just as he again tries to attack Yoda, the vending machine squashes him. Yoda says, “Too old for this I’m getting,” while the voice-over proclaims, “That’s Brisk, baby,” a tagline introduced in Brisk’s original animation spots.More than 500 movie theaters in 15 states will run the TV spots for two months starting Friday; similar radio ads will run starting Jan. 23 on stations in New York and Southern California. Brisk also will hold sampling events across the country from late January through mid-March.Mr. Fuller said Brisk’s 2012 advertising and marketing budget would be in the “low double digits” of millions of dollars, the most PepsiCo had ever spent to promote the brand. He also said 75 percent of this spending would occur in the first quarter of the year.According to the research firm Kantar Media, PepsiCo’s annual advertising expenditures for Brisk never exceeded $670,000 in 2007, 2008 and 2010, and totaled $4.7 million in the first nine months of last year. It said PepsiCo did no advertising for Brisk in 2009.Industry observers and experts differed about the prospects of the PepsiCo campaign.Noting that recently rising commodity prices had led to higher prices for ready-to-drink teas and subsequent softening of sales growth, Michael Bellas, chairman and chief executive of Beverage Marketing, a consulting company, called Brisk the “dominant value brand” in the ready-to-drink tea category.“Consumers are more worried about spending and looking for value. My gut feeling is the new 128-ounce packaging and gaming should put Brisk right where it wants to be,” he said.However, Irma Zandl, a New York-based market researcher who specializes in Generation X and Y consumers and has advised PepsiCo in the past, said the new ads “executionally felt very formulaic.”“They felt like every other 30-second spot with a superhero,” Ms. Zandl added. “I didn’t feel, ‘Wow, I’ve got to post them on Facebook because they’re so fresh.’ The question is, will young guys think this is so amazing and fabulous? Young consumers are so much savvier and have set the bar so much higher because they see so much.”'"
"'12-01-03,'1','A new study has found that high bodily levels of the trace elements nickel and selenium may be associated with reduced risk for pancreatic cancer, and that high levels of arsenic, cadmium and lead may increase the risk.The study, published online Dec. 19 in the journal Gut, included 118 pancreatic cancer patients and 399 patients with other diagnoses at several hospitals in Spain. Researchers analyzed toenail samples with plasma mass spectrometry, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace elements.After controlling for age, sex, smoking, diabetes and other factors, the scientists found that the subjects with the highest levels of arsenic were at twice the risk for pancreatic cancer, compared with those with the lowest concentrations. Those with high levels of cadmium were at three times the risk for pancreatic cancer, while those with the highest levels of lead were at six times the risk.Those with the highest levels of nickel and selenium, on the other hand, were at significantly lower risk for pancreatic cancer.Dr. Núria Malats, an epidemiologist at the Spanish National Cancer Research Center and the senior author of the new study, said that it was the first to provide these kinds of results with trace elements, and that it did not mean that people should take dietary supplements.'"
"'12-01-03,'1','A large study has found that a rise in resting heart rate over a decade may indicate an increased risk of death from coronary artery disease.Norwegian researchers studied 30,000 healthy men and women age 20 and older, checking heart rates at intervals 10 years apart. The scientists followed the subjects through 2008, recording the number of deaths from coronary heart disease. The results were published Dec. 21 in The Journal of the American Medical Association.Compared with those whose heart rates remained stable at 70 beats per minute or less, those whose rates increased to 85 or more were almost twice as likely to die of heart disease. For those with resting rates between 70 and 85 beats per minute at the first test, an increase to greater than 85 was associated with an 80 percent increase in death rate.There was no direct decrease in heart disease risk with decreasing resting heart rate, but among the 7,000 people whose heart rates had decreased from between 70 and 85 to below 70 beats a minute, risk for death from any cause was reduced by 40 percent.The subjects were completely healthy at both measurements, said Ulrik Wisloff of the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. “So resting heart rate is a simple, cost-free and strong biomarker that should be monitored regularly.”'"
"'12-01-03,'1','Some scholars now ask: Why stop there? Why honor the uncertain boundary that separates one species from all others? Is it time for a Shakespearean stage direction: Exit the humanities, pursued by a bear? Not quite yet, although some scholars have suggested it is time to move on to the post-humanities.The Animals and Society Institute, itself only six years old, lists more than 100 courses in American colleges and universities that fit under the broad banner of animal studies. Institutes, book series and conferences have proliferated. Formal academic programs have appeared.Wesleyan University, together with the Animals and Society Institute, began a summer fellowship program this year. A program at Michigan State allows doctoral and master’s students in different fields to concentrate their work in animal studies. At least two institutions offer undergraduate majors in the field. And just this fall, New York University started an animal studies initiative, allowing undergraduates to minor in the field.Dale Jamieson, director of that program, said that activity in animal studies had been “somewhat inchoate” up to now, but that he hoped N.Y.U. could help “to make it a more cohesive and rigorous scholarly field.”Animals have never been ignored by scholars, of course. Thinkers and writers of all ages have grappled with what separates humans from the other animals and how we should treat our distant and not-so-distant cousins. The current burst of interest is new, however, and scholars see several reasons for the growth of the field.Kari Weil, a philosophy professor at Wesleyan whose book “Thinking Animals: Why Animal Studies Now?” will be published in the spring, said that behavioral and environmental science had laid a foundation by giving humans “the sense that we are a species among other species” — that we, like other animals, are “subject to the forces of nature.”Think of the effect Jane Goodall had when she first showed the world a social and emotional side of chimpanzees that made it almost impossible to keep them on the other side of the divide. Or watch the popular YouTube video of a New Caledonian crow bending a wire into a tool to fish food out of a container, and ask yourself how old a child would have to be to figure out the problem.The most direct influence may have come from philosophy. Peter Singer’s 1975 book “Animal Liberation” was a landmark in arguing against killing, eating and experimenting on animals. He questioned how humans could exclude animals from moral consideration, how they could justify causing animals pain.Lori Gruen, head of the philosophy department at Wesleyan and coordinator of the summer fellowship program in animal studies there, said one of the major questions in philosophy was “Who should we direct our moral interest to?” Thirty years ago, she said, animals were at the margins of philosophical discussions of ethics; now “the animal question is right in the center of ethical discussion.”Jane Desmond of the University of Illinois, a cultural anthropologist who organized a series of talks there about animals, says that what goes on in the public arena, beyond the university, has had a role in prompting new attention to animals. There are worries about the safety of the food chain, along with popular books about refusing to kill and eat animals.Animals as food are a major subject of academic interest, Dr. Gruen said, adding, “Given that the way most people interact with animals is when they’re dead and eaten, that becomes a big question.”The animals humans live with and love are also a major subject.Another strain of philosophy, exemplified by the French writer Jacques Derrida, has had an equally strong influence. He considered the way we think of animals, and why we distance ourselves from them. His writing is almost impossible to capture in a quotation, since it constantly circles around on itself, building intensity as he toys with the very language he is using to write about what he is trying to understand. His approach has been adapted in a lot of academic work.In “The Animal That Therefore I Am,” for example, he discusses at length not only what he thinks of his cat, but what his cat thinks of him. In a fairly simple sentence — and thought — for him, he writes about his cat: “An animal looks at me. What should I think of this sentence?”What animals think — in fact, what animals have to say — is something scholars now take quite seriously, recognizing of course that there are limits to that approach. As Dr. Weil of Wesleyan said, referring to the gulf between animals and previous outsiders (“others”), like women or African-Americans, “Unlike the other others, these others can’t speak back or write back in language that the academy recognizes.”The academy does, it seems, recognize and understand Derrida and, sometimes, follow in his word tracks. Consider, for instance, “Animal, Vegetable, Mineral: Ethics as Extension or Becoming? The Case of Becoming-Plant” in a recent issue of The Journal for Critical Animal Studies. Other writing is quite approachable. The moral arguments about eating animals are clear. And there are studies that any urban dweller could profit from, like “How Pigeons Became Rats: The Cultural-Spatial Logic of Problem Animals.”The great variety of subjects, methods, interests and assumptions in animal studies does raise questions about how it holds together. Law schools, for instance, routinely have courses in animals and the law. Veterinary schools have courses about the human connection to animals. Some people group courses in how to use animals in therapy as part of animal studies.None of this variety diminishes the energy or importance of what is going on, but at least some people who work on subjects that would be included under the animal studies rubric, like Dr. Jamieson at N.Y.U. and Dr. Desmond at Illinois, think the scholarly ferment has a way to go before it can clearly see itself as an academic field.Dr. Desmond says it is “not yet a field.” It is, she says, “an emergent scholarly community.” One thing it does not lack is energy.'"
"'12-01-03,'1','LONDON — Iran announced on Monday that it had successfully test fired a cruise missile during naval exercises near the Strait of Hormuz that have heightened tensions in a diplomatic standoff over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions.The state news agency IRNA said the missile test was carried out on Monday, the final day of 10 days of maneuvers near the strait, the vital oil-exporting waterway. IRNA quoted Adm. Mahmoud Mousavi, a spokesman for the exercises, as saying the surface-to-sea missile, known as the Qader, struck its targets with precision and destroyed them.Iran had previously announced that it intended to test a missile during the exercises, raising fears that it might try to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz in retaliation for tougher international sanctions.The Qader missile was unveiled in August. It was said to be capable of striking warships at a range of about 125 miles, a distance that would include some American forces in the Gulf region.Despite threats from some Iranian officials to disrupt shipping through the narrow passage, Admiral Mousavi was quoted as saying on Sunday: “We won’t disrupt traffic through the Strait of Hormuz. We are not after this.”The announcement of the latest missile test came after Iran’s nuclear agency said its scientists had produced their first nuclear fuel rod despite a sanctions regime to curb a nuclear program Iran insists is peaceful.'"

"'12-01-04,'1','Diane M. Ramirez, the president of Halstead Property, said she was not alarmed by the year-to-year decrease in sales because the 2010 figure had been inflated by a surge in sales in the last months of that year, as buyers rushed to make purchases before an anticipated increase in capital gains taxes. The capital gains tax rate had been scheduled to return to 20 percent from 15 percent in 2011, but Congress extended the lower rate just before it was to expire. “I think what we’re seeing is just the normal ebb and flow of the market,” she said.Pamela Liebman, the chief executive of the Corcoran Group, said the drop in sales volume was largely propelled by a dip in the number of new developments coming to market. While co-op inventory remained stable, she said, condo inventory, at 3,466, decreased 11 percent from 2010.While some areas, including parts of Harlem, still have new condo projects on the market, downtown neighborhoods like the West Village and Chelsea have extremely low inventory. “We’ve had a lot of clients hungry for great condos in the West Village, and we have had nothing to show them,” Ms. Liebman said.A report by Streeteasy.com showed overall inventory at 13,147, down 5.9 percent from 2010. “I think inventory being down is actually a good thing, because it keeps prices from plummeting even more,” said Sofia Song, Streeteasy’s vice president for research. “It suggests that a lot of sellers are holding on to their properties to wait out the market.”The reports also show that luxury sales of $3 million and up continued to be strong. At the super-high end, there were 23 sales with price tags of $20 million or more in 2011, the highest annual number since 2008, according to Ms. Liebman.Hall Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, said luxury sales rebounded early in 2011 and held strong throughout the year. His firm registered three sales over $20 million in the last three months, and will soon record the record-breaking $88 million sale of a penthouse at 15 Central Park West.At nearly $13,000 per square foot, Mr. Willkie said, “that price may prove to be a one-off and not a proxy for anything.” He said, though, that apartments at One 57, the Extell Development Company’s 90-story hotel and condominium tower across from Carnegie Hall, which is not scheduled to open until 2013, were selling for $10,000 per square foot.“But even with all these extraordinary sales we’ve seen,” he said, “the high end, like the rest of the market, is still very price-sensitive. Buyers have to feel that prices are justified.”Ms. Herman said she expected the bookends of the market, at the entry and luxury levels, to continue to do well. “But what’s getting killed is the middle market,” she said, “the average person who’s looking to trade up and trying to spend between $700,000 and $1.1 million.”Because banks have tightened their lending restrictions so much, she said, many of those buyers “have no borrowing power, even if they have good, steady jobs.” Until financing loosens up, she said, many of those buyers will be unable to trade in their entry-level apartments for larger spaces.'"
"'12-01-04,'1','The city has already spent about $40 million on the struggling schools, with the expectation that the state would reimburse it.State education officials said the money would most likely cover costs incurred until Dec. 31, the day by which New York City and nine other school districts benefiting from the grants were to have put evaluation systems in place. The state’s education commissioner, John B. King Jr., announced on Tuesday that he had suspended the grants to all 10 of those districts. He gave them 30 days to request a hearing to make a case for the money, in effect giving them extra time to reach labor agreements.While Michael Mulgrew, the president of the city’s teachers’ union, still had hope for a compromise, city officials stood their ground. “Negotiations are over,” Natalie Ravitz, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said on Tuesday.The city has reached out to the state to determine whether rules governing the grants might allow the money to be restored some other way. “We’re looking at every available option,” she said.Principals, meanwhile, have already bought equipment, hired teachers and, in some cases, signed contracts to offer after-school programs.At John Dewey High School in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Barry Fried, the principal, said his school still had to pay $500,000 to its external partner, the Institute for Student Achievement, chosen by the city to oversee its progress.Geraldine Maione said she used the grant to take William E. Grady Career and Technical Education High School in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, to a B from a D on its progress report card. Now that the money has been suspended, she said, “I feel like Moses led us halfway across the desert and then disappeared in the middle of the night.”Dennis M. Walcott, the city’s schools chancellor, has blamed the United Federation of Teachers’ intransigence for the collapse of the negotiations, writing in an op-ed published in The New York Post on Tuesday that the union “threw away those desperately needed federal dollars because they wanted new job protections for the worst-performing teachers.”For the union, however, the objections were a matter of fairness. Mr. Mulgrew wants the city to hire independent arbitrators to run the process used by teachers to appeal poor ratings.A system to judge the performance of teachers and principals is also required by the federal Race to the Top program, a rule that applies to every school district in the state, which is benefiting from the program’s $700 million in education aid. For state and city officials, though, the difficulty in reaching agreements with unions over an evaluation system that would apply to a small number of failing schools is a warning. “If we can’t establish an evaluation model in 33 of the city’s most struggling,” said Ms. Ravitz, “that leaves us feeling not incredibly optimistic for the prospects for the entire system.”'"
"'12-01-04,'1','A lot of that serious-mindedness can be attributed to how Ms. Flores, 49, has raised Kevin and his brother, Ashton, 13, despite their tumultuous childhoods.Ms. Flores said her ex-husband, the boys’ father, physically abused the boys when they were younger. She said she, too, was a victim. Soon after Kevin was born, she said, her then-husband locked her and their son out of their apartment because he could not stand the baby’s crying. The situation deteriorated quickly, and after one violent night in 1998, when Ms. Flores wound up in a hospital, she decided to seek a divorce. It was granted in 2001.Court documents from 2004 — during the time the father had custody rights, Ms. Flores said — detail accusations of his kicking the boys in the legs and back, among other abuse. He was charged with two counts each of assault, menacing, harassment and endangering the welfare of a child.Ms. Flores was granted a U-visa, given to victims of certain crimes, like domestic violence. She said that after the boys’ father lost custody, he vanished, ignoring orders to pay $80,000 in child support. But he has tried to get in touch over the years, as in 2007, when he contacted Kevin on Facebook.“I almost quit it after that,” Kevin said of the social network. “I felt cyberterrorized.” In fact, he said, he plans to drop his father’s surname when he is legally allowed to do so.Being a single mother of two has been challenging for Ms. Flores, a native of Argentina who is employed privately as an events planner for Jewish families in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn. Among other duties, Ms. Flores, who is fluent in Spanish and English, makes sure the Spanish-speaking chefs hired by the families for holiday parties follow kosher dietary rules when preparing meals.But the work is done on a freelance basis, which means that when she called in sick once for many days in a row, she was not paid at all. In a good month, Ms. Flores can earn $2,000, and her longtime boyfriend, Pablo Cruz, a handyman, chips in when he can. But the rent on her two-bedroom apartment is $1,100 a month, and utility, insurance and gas bills eat up most of what is left of her earnings. Food stamps help, though.With money tight, Ms. Flores had few places to turn last fall when Kevin needed a computer for his school assignments. She sought help from Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.In October, the agency drew $1,199 from the fund to buy an iMac for Kevin, which sits proudly on a desk in Ms. Flores’s tidy, spare home.Other bills, however, are piling up, like the one for SAT preparation classes, which Kevin just finished; Ms. Flores also paid for similar courses for Ashton to improve his chances of being admitted to a Roman Catholic high school, like Xavier High in Manhattan.Ms. Flores hopes that if Kevin and Ashton excel in school they might someday find the steady, high-paying work that has mostly eluded her in this country. That is why she encourages any activities that could give them an academic edge — like park-renovation projects.“It’s so important,” she said. “If you’re not educated here, you’re not going to go very far.”'"
"'12-01-04,'1','United States prosecutors charged three Swiss bankers on Tuesday of conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide more than $1.2 billion in assets from tax authorities.The office of the Manhattan United States attorney said in a statement that the indictment accused the bankers of trying to “capture business lost by UBS A.G. and another large international Swiss bank in the wake of widespread news reports that the Internal Revenue Service was investigating UBS” in 2008 and 2009.Neither the international Swiss bank nor the other purported co-conspirators were identified by prosecutors.The three bankers worked as client advisers at a Zurich bank branch and hid certain Swiss bank accounts and the income they had generated, prosecutors said. They did not identify the bank branch.The indictment filed in United States District Court in New York identified the three bankers as Michael Berlinka, Urs Frei and Roger Keller. It said they all lived in Switzerland. Their lawyers were not immediately known.If convicted, the bankers face a maximum prison term of five years under the conspiracy charge.'"
"'12-01-04,'1','Barely a quarter of the town’s 600 residents have returned to their homes, but the alleys resonate with the sounds of heavy machinery, drilling and hammering. Though dressed in the neon colors of civil protection and public safety workers, many of the crew members are local volunteers, men and women from Vernazza or nearby towns, come to give a hand as best they can.Matteo Barletta, an architect charged with mapping the damage done to the town’s buildings, said that several teams were at work on various aspects of the reconstruction, and that a list of priorities had been set.“The bakery, pharmacy, tobacconist, bank, fish shop and butcher, these are to reopen to reactivate the town,” he said.Said Mayor Vincenzo Resasco, speaking in his office high on a hill, where it was spared from the waters: “There’s a lot of work to be done because Vernazza is still not secure. The territory isn’t in the condition to withstand even normal rainfalls.“The real problem is that if we don’t get money soon, we’re going to have to stop,” he said, adding wryly, “and there isn’t a lot of money in Italy these days.”Securing the town, the mayor explained, includes painstakingly restoring the stone walls that delineate the terraced hilltops that surmount it. “With the stones that came down, we’ve recovered enough to build a second wall of China,” Mr. Resasco said.These man-made terraced patches where vines and olive trees have been cultivated for centuries once ensured the survival of the five villages, which were best reached by water until the advent of the railway.Tourism changed the Cinque Terre, and not necessarily for the better, said Claudio Frigerio, a retired union worker and local activist who has long lobbied for a more environmentally conscious approach to the area’s development. While tourism has been a lifeline, the crowds sometimes give the walking paths a rush-hour intensity. Tour groups and cruises can swell visitors here to around two and a half million a year, too many for critics.And as tourism supplanted farming and fishing as the town’s chief economy, regular maintenance of the terraced hills lagged, an oversight that many now say was a contributing factor to the devastation of Oct 25. In 1951, about 3,500 acres were cultivated in the Cinque Terre. Today, there are fewer than 275, according to Vernazza town officials. “As we saw, the territory wasn’t able to stand the impact of the rain; the land was already in a state of degradation,” Mr. Frigerio said.As a part-time farmer of one of those terraced lots, Mr. Frigerio is the first to admit that growing crops on the unevenly terraced slopes overhanging the Cinque Terre is “physically demanding and not in the least profitable,” but “it is a necessity,” he said. To lose the landscape, as well as the various paths linking the towns, “is to lose the area’s identity,” he said, something that will hurt its value as a tourist destination.However, persuading young people to take up the rigorous work of farming the steep slopes may be, well, an uphill battle. “It’s easier to rent three rooms a year instead of farming up a hill and earning very little,” said Daniele Moggia, a 36-year-old volunteer at Vernazza City Hall. But the calamity “made us understand the importance of preserving the environment and farming.”The Cinque Terre is one of the few rural areas in Italy where people don’t leave “because there is work here,” he said.Angelo Maria Betta, mayor of Monterosso al Mare, the other Cinque Terre town badly damaged by the storm, cannot wait to reopen flooded businesses for the spring season. “If we don’t fix the Cinque Terre, we’re going to make a hole in the local economy that’s going to be hard to fill,” he said. Officials say the paths linking the towns will be open by Easter, and they vow to restore the towns as quickly as they can.“Vernazza will be rebuilt as before,” Mayor Resasco promised. “I have made a pact with citizens to make the town better than it was. It is a message of hope, not resignation. We are from Liguria, and we are stubborn.”'"
"'12-01-04,'1','Two fighters were killed when Libyan militias fought a gun battle across one of Tripoli’s busiest streets on Tuesday. Tripoli-based former rebels controlling a security compound in the capital fought an hourlong battle with at least 24 fighters from Misurata who had come to free a group of prisoners, according to medics and former rebels. Tripoli officials had set a deadline of Dec. 20 for militias to return to their homes, but the Misurata fighters hold a vast arsenal of tanks, rockets and guns that are testing the ability of the transitional government to assert its authority.'"
"'12-01-04,'1','A metaphysical road movie about life, death and the limits of knowledge, “Once Upon a Time in Anatolia” has arrived just in time to cure the adult filmgoer blues. It was directed by the Turkish filmmaker Nuri Bilge Ceylan, whose earlier movies include “Distant” and “Three Monkeys” and who in recent years has emerged as one of the consistently most exciting directors on the international scene. His latest, which shared the grand prize at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival, takes the unassuming form of a police investigation that, as miles and words mount, evolves into a plangent, visually stunning meditation on what it is to be human.The story is direct, if the journey less so. A man has been murdered, and a small battalion — a doctor, a prosecutor, a few policemen, several soldiers, diggers with shovels and a transcriber with a laptop — has invaded the countryside with the suspect to dig up the body. The trouble is that the accused, Kenan (Firat Tanis), claims to have been drunk when he committed the murder and can’t remember where he buried the body. And so off the men go in two cars and a Jeep, driving up and down the sensuous, rolling hills of Anatolia, the enormous peninsula that constitutes most of Turkey and which the ancient Greeks called the land of the rising sun.The sun has nearly set when the men first appear en masse, pulling into a turn in the dirt road where a solitary young tree pierces the parched amber landscape like a shot arrow. Making the most of his wide-screen frame — a format made for landscapes like these and filmmakers as sensitive as this one — Mr. Ceylan initially keeps his distance from the characters by showing them in extreme long shot, a vantage that accentuates how small they are in relation to the wide world enveloping them. This is the first in a series of stops that the men will make as, again and again, they look for the body in a search that reveals far more about the living than about the dead.Mr. Ceylan soon cuts in for a closer look as he turns his brilliant eye for landscape to the gaunt and rounded, pitted and smoothed faces of his travelers. Much like the stopovers during the search when the men clamber out of their vehicles, these faces — including those of the doctor, Cemal (Muhammet Uzuner), and the prosecutor, Nusret (Taner Birsel) — are effectively narrative layovers, breaks in the larger journey. There’s a murder at the story’s center, but as one after another face fills the frame, a tear violently trembling in one man’s eye while the memory of a dead wife hovers in another man’s look, it becomes evident that the greater mystery here is of existence itself.The title of “Once Upon a Time in Anatolia” suggests the work of Sergio Leone, including most obviously Leone’s 1968 masterpiece, “Once Upon a Time in the West.” I don’t want to make strong claims about the influence of that or any other Leone film on “Anatolia,” though the twinned landscapes of this movie’s natural vistas and the ugly beauty of its fantastic faces evoke Leone. (More than a few of Mr. Ceylan’s actors could outgargoyle Leone performers like Jack Elam.) Yet, like most westerns, “Once Upon a Time in Anatolia” is, among other things, an examination of violence and masculinity, one in which women remain critical if largely off-screen figures, silent if never truly mute.Mr. Ceylan doesn’t trumpet his ideas, but lets them quietly surface, often through the stories that the men tell one another and that at times take the form of parables. In one, a driver, Arab Ali (Ahmet Mumtaz Taylan), tells the doctor how he likes to drive to the countryside for target practice, just to let off some steam. Enveloped in darkness, the wind rising like sighs, Arab Ali at first registers as a somewhat buffoonish, borderline-dangerous character whose Hobbesian worldview (it’s shoot or be shot) is a reminder that this is, after all, a search for a murdered man. Yet, like the doctor, the prosecutor and the police chief, Naci (Yilmaz Erdogan), Arab Ali proves more complex than he seems because his words are those of a man puzzling through the meaning of life.'"
"'12-01-04,'1','I found Joe Nocera’s attempt to minimize the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the financial crisis unconvincing (“The Big Lie,” column, Dec. 24).These two government-sponsored enterprises went broke and ended up being bailed out by taxpayers at cost of more than $170 billion — a cost that has never been repaid and continues to increase. By contrast, the private banks repaid their bailouts. Fannie and Freddie, not the banks, imposed the bigger burden on taxpayers.That enormous burden is in no way alleviated if, as Mr. Nocera claims, Fannie and Freddie bought up risky subprime mortgages to maintain their market share, rather than to satisfy affordable-housing mandates. That simply underscores their shortsighted greed and complicity in the financial crisis.Given their thin capitalization and what is effectively a taxpayer guarantee, Fannie and Freddie had no business dabbling in risky subprime loans in the first place.'"

"'12-01-04,'1','“One of the problems is the delay in the BB 10 software and that may have led to the selection of chips that caused the most recent delay,” said Rod Hall, an analyst with JPMorgan Chase.While the analysts’ skepticism is partly based on speculation, it has also been fueled by RIM’s general loss of credibility with them. For more than a year, the company has been forced to repeatedly restate financial forecasts and failed to deliver some critical, new products on time.“They don’t have a firm grasp of the issues and realities of bringing these phones to market,” said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. “There are not many believers right now,”RIM has declined to identify the new chip. RIM also declined to comment directly about development problems with BlackBerry 10 or the battery life of the new phones.It reiterated the earlier remarks of its co-chief executives, Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazaridis, that the delay was simply the result of its decision to wait for an improved chipset. “RIM made a strategic decision to launch BlackBerry 10 devices with a new, LTE-based dual core chipset architecture,” the company said, referring to a chip that supports a high-speed wireless service known as LTE that is now available in some parts of the United States. “As explained on our earnings call, the broad engineering impact of this decision and certain other factors significantly influenced the anticipated timing for the BlackBerry 10 devices.”But it is no secret that RIM has been struggling with its new operating system, which is based on technology from QNX Software Systems, a company based in Ottawa that RIM acquired in 2010.The BlackBerry PlayBook, RIM’s money-losing tablet computer, was the company’s first product to use a QNX operating system. Despite the BlackBerry brand’s strong association with e-mail, it arrived in April 2011 without e-mail software or the ability to directly synchronize users’ address books and calendars.Software that was supposed to remedy those issues and others has been delayed and is now promised for February.Mr. Misek, said that RIM initially tried to merge, or thread, some of its current operating system with QNX to speed up the development timetable. But that proved unsuccessful, forcing RIM to create more software code from scratch than it initially anticipated.Michael Morgan, the senior analyst for mobile devices at ABI Research, said that many problems with BlackBerry 10 came from making it work on RIM’s network, which moves all BlackBerry data, giving corporate e-mail a high level of security and all users lower wireless data bills.To accommodate people with both BlackBerry phones and PlayBook tablets, RIM had to redesign security features on its network, which currently allow only one hand-held device access to any given user’s account, Mr. Morgan said.“When you change something that low level in an operating system, it has ramifications which affect every function,” Mr. Morgan said.Like many analysts, Mr. Morgan also says he thinks that RIM is struggling to bring the long battery life that has been a hallmark of BlackBerrys to the new phones.While the QNX operating system has a reputation for reliability, he said, it has been mainly used in situations where power consumption is not a significant concern. Many touch-screen navigation and control systems in cars, for example, use QNX. But automobiles carry large batteries and alternators that recharge them.When ABI’s researchers disassembled PlayBook tablets, Mr. Morgan said, they found several systems to reduce power consumption. He said, however, that those measures might not be enough for phones that will have much smaller batteries than the PlayBook. “QNX is being applied now in a place it hasn’t been before,” he said.Adding to the problem is RIM’s decision to make the new phones operate on LTE networks. Most current chips that operate on those high-speed networks have a reputation for quickly draining batteries.While LTE networks are relatively scarce today, they are likely to be an important selling point for new phones a year from now.'"
"'12-01-04,'1','A business executive who became the first woman to be appointed chief financial officer of a large Dutch company resigned on Tuesday, citing a dispute over a management reorganization at her employer, the phone operator KPN.Carla Smits-Nusteling, KPN’s chief financial officer, resigned a little more than two years after being appointed, saying she disagreed with a decision to quadruple the top management board to 12 members from three, the company said.Mrs. Smits-Nusteling, who had worked for KPN in a variety of financial roles since 2000, was named chief financial officer in September 2009 by the chief executive at the time, Ad Scheepbouwer.Last April, Mr. Scheepbouwer retired and was succeeded by Eelco Blok, the KPN board member responsible for international mobile operations. Mr. Blok announced a reorganization to simplify KPN’s management, under which nine business units had been reporting independently to the three-member board.Under Mr. Blok’s plan, the unit heads would join board members on an expanded executive committee.

"'12-01-04,'1','Mississippi State defensive tackle Fletcher Cox is skipping his senior season and declaring for the N.F.L. draft. Cox is considered one of the country’s best defensive line prospects and is projected by N.F.L. evaluators as a second-round pick, though some analysts believe he could be selected late in the first round.Cox, who is 6 feet 4 inches and 295 pounds, was the only player from Mississippi State to be a first-team all-Southeastern Conference selection this season. Cox, a third-year junior, finished a dominant season with 14 ½ tackles for loss and 5 sacks.“God works in many ways,” Cox said in a telephone interview. “He answered my prayer and I knew deep down in my heart it was time for me to go.”Cox played both defensive tackle and defensive end at Mississippi State, but said he expected to be evaluated as a tackle by N.F.L. teams. The ESPN draft analyst Todd McShay currently has Cox ranked as the 20th best player in the draft and the second best defensive tackle available behind Penn State’s Devon Still.Mississippi State Coach Dan Mullen lauded Cox for his commitment to the program. When Mullen was hired in December 2008, Cox was the program’s top committed recruit.“He never wavered for a day,” Mullen said. “He recommitted to me when I got the job and has been a leader since that day.”'"
"'12-01-04,'1','American officials have said in recent months that the opening of a Taliban mission would be the single biggest step forward for peace efforts that have been plagued by false starts. The most embarrassing came in November 2010, when it emerged that an impostor had fooled Western officials into thinking he represented the Taliban and then had disappeared with hundreds of thousands of dollars used to woo him.The official killed in September, , had been greeting a supposed Taliban negotiator when the man detonated a bomb in his turban.The opening of an office in Qatar is meant to give Afghan and Western peace negotiators an “address” where they can openly contact legitimate Taliban intermediaries. That would open the way for confidence-building measures that hopes to press forward in the coming months. Chief among them, American officials said, is the possibility of transferring a number of “high-risk” detainees — including some with ties to — to Afghan custody from Guantánamo Bay. The prisoners would then presumably be freed later.American officials said they would consider transferring only those prisoners the Afghan authorities requested. Among the names being discussed are Muhammad Fazl, the former Taliban deputy defense minister; two former provincial governors, Khairullah Khairkhwa of Herat and Noorullah Nori of Balkh; Abdul Haq Wasiq, a former top Taliban intelligence official; and one of the Taliban’s top financiers, Muhammad . Mr. Fazl is accused of having commanded forces that killed thousands of Shiite Muslims, who are a minority in Afghanistan, while the Taliban ruled the country.The American officials said that another idea under consideration was the establishment of cease-fire zones within Afghanistan, although that prospect was more uncertain and distant. The officials asked not to be identified because of the delicacy of the talks.Some analysts are skeptical of the prospect for meaningful peace negotiations with the Taliban. The Taliban are viewed as unlikely to cede significant ground at a time when NATO has begun to withdraw troops and intends to end combat operations here in less than three years. Another uncertainty is the role of , which provides safe haven to Taliban leaders and has undermined past efforts at reconciliation talks that it sees as jeopardizing its interests.But American officials have said for years that the war in Afghanistan would ultimately require a political solution. The “surge” of additional troops at the end of 2009 has largely been aimed at getting the Taliban to the negotiating table.On Tuesday, the White House affirmed the necessity of a negotiated solution. Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the White House’s , said in an e-mail that such “Afghan-led peace initiatives” were central to the American strategy of “denying Al Qaeda a safe haven, reversing the Taliban’s momentum, and strengthening the capacity of Afghanistan’s security forces and government.”Western officials stressed that a peace process was closer to the beginning than the end.“Publicly, I don’t think we could have asked for a stronger endorsement of the peace process from the other side,” said a Western diplomat in Kabul, who asked not to be identified, in keeping with diplomatic protocol. “But this isn’t even close to having a done deal. That’s going to take years, if it even happens.”There was no immediate comment from President of Afghanistan, who has been cool to the idea of NATO’s conducting its own talks with the Taliban, fearing a deal that would undermine his control. When word that Qatar had agreed to host a Taliban office first surfaced in December, the Karzai government rejected the notion and recalled its ambassador from the Persian Gulf state.Afghan officials complained at the time that they had not been formally notified by the Qataris, and that they preferred that any such mission be in or . But a week ago, Mr. Karzai grudgingly agreed to Qatar as the site. Still, Mr. Karzai is likely to remain insistent that any talks be limited to reducing tensions rather than achieving a comprehensive solution to the war.Even so, Afghanistan’s High Peace Council, appointed by Mr. Karzai, welcomed the Taliban move. Arsala Rahmani, a top negotiator on the council, called it “a gesture of good faith,” Reuters reported.Three suicide bombings on Tuesday in the southern city of Kandahar provided a bloody reminder of the violence that continues to plague Afghanistan. Thirteen people, including a child and four police officers, were killed, Faisal Ahmad, a spokesman for the government of Kandahar Province, told The Associated Press.Since the debacle with the impostor, the and its allies have focused on establishing a trustworthy channel for pursuing a peace deal with the Taliban. The push began early last year when American and German negotiators managed to make contact with a man they believed to be a legitimate representative of , the Taliban’s reclusive leader.The Western diplomat said Tuesday that the Taliban announcement was a product of 10 months of on-again, off-again talks with the man, Tayeb Agha, a former secretary to Mullah Omar. The talks were shrouded in secrecy in large part to protect Mr. Agha and other Taliban intermediaries.The biggest concern was that Pakistan, where most of the Taliban’s leadership is believed to reside, would obstruct any talks in which it did not play a direct role.Afghan and American officials have long feared that Pakistan aimed to use the peace process, which it says it supports, as a way to solidify a dominant position in Afghanistan. The Qatar office is seen as a way of lessening Pakistani influence over the talks.'"

"'12-01-05,'0','The Knicks (2-4) spent their (brief) preseason talking up their new defensive focus, emboldened by the arrival of center Tyson Chandler and the defensive-minded assistant coach Mike Woodson. So far, the results are scant, or at least sporadic.The Bobcats seemed to do whatever they wanted, shooting 55.3 percent from the field and leading by as many as 16 points in the fourth quarter. They dominated despite losing a night earlier in Cleveland and despite losing Corey Maggette to a hamstring injury in the third quarter.Boris Diaw paced the Bobcats with 27 points, going 12 for 15 from the field. Gerald Henderson added 24 points and made 10 of his 13 attempts. Byron Mullens, a backup center, added 16 points, mostly on jump shots.The Knicks never seemed to be close to any of them when the ball left their fingertips.“It takes time to be a good defensive team,” said Chandler, who helped the Dallas Mavericks become an elite defensive team last season. “We just have to dedicate ourselves to get there.”Anthony said the Knicks were lacking a “trust factor” on defense. Chandler suggested the Knicks were “out of sync,” blowing a rotation on one possession, then exacerbating matters the next time by trying to improvise. The rushed schedule has allowed little practice time, and injuries have disrupted the Knicks’ rotation, further slowing their progress.“No training camp, no preseason — games are just piling on us,” Chandler said, adding, “It’s almost impossible to do right now.”Amid the gloom, there was at least some reason for excitement. The Garden echoed with chants of “Shumpert!” as he scored 18 points in just his second N.B.A. game, his first since spraining his knee Dec. 25. Shumpert dazzled with 3-pointers and swift drives, showing no ill effects from the injury, nor any discomfort with his knee brace.Stoudemire, who had missed two games because of a sprained ankle, also came back strong, with 25 points and 12 rebounds.Shumpert proved so critical to the Knicks’ success at both ends of the court that Coach Mike D’Antoni put him back in the game in the fourth quarter, against his better judgment. The fatigue and dehydration brought on leg cramps, forcing Shumpert out with 3 minutes 50 seconds left.“I knew that was going to happen,” D’Antoni said, with a tone of regret. He added: “I had to get him back in there, because he was playing well. I’m just glad I didn’t hurt his knee.”It was an unfortunate end to what had been an exhilarating evening for Shumpert and his growing legion of fans. The crowd cheered every time he checked into the game and booed when Toney Douglas was sent to replace him early in the fourth quarter.The injury did not dampen Shumpert’s confidence. He took a pull-up jumper the first time he touched the ball, and a transition 3-pointer on his next time down the court. He drained both.He then electrified the arena with a flying dunk attempt over Bismack Biyombo, the Bobcats’ rangy rookie forward, who fouled him to break up the play. Shumpert said his knee felt fine.“I just felt a little step slow, a little sluggish, which will get better in time,” he said. “Other than that, we just got to pull things together.”Jared Jeffries will probably not return until early next week, Mike D’Antoni said. Jeffries, who injured his right calf on opening day, is making steady progress, but the Knicks are exercising caution because of the nature of the injury. “We just got to make sure he doesn’t pop it again,” D’Antoni said. “Then he’s out for a while. So we’ll be overly cautious about it.” ... The returns of Iman Shumpert and Amar’e Stoudemire knocked Mike Bibby and Steve Novak out of the rotation and reduced the role of Josh Harrellson to minor relief. Bibby did not play for the first time since opening day, when he was recovering from back soreness. Harrellson, who had started two games in place of Stoudemire, played just 3:28.'"
"'12-01-05,'0','But Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is already talked about as a possible presidential candidate in 2016, outlined a plan for 2012 that was more pragmatic than visionary, combining soaring rhetoric about New York’s greatness with plans for rebuilding bridges, creating commissions, opening casinos and restoring . His top-line proposal would have made proud — Mr. Cuomo wants to build the nation’s largest convention center at the Aqueduct racetrack in .“Last year, in many ways the high-profile accomplishments dealt with social justice issues and legislation addressing social justice issues,” he said. “This year, the relevant set of challenges are economic development and making the state function to generate jobs in partnership with the private sector. They are apples and oranges.”Whether one agrees with him or not, Mr. Cuomo accomplished a lot in his first year. He persuaded a Republican-led Senate to endorse . He reached a deal with the Legislature to approve a property cap. He closed a $10 billion budget deficit in March without tax increases, and then last month appeared to bow to the Occupy movement by creating higher tax brackets for the rich while lowering tax rates for the middle class. He largely tamed the Legislature, which appeared ungovernable during the brief Spitzer and Paterson administrations, so quieting it that at times Albany’s rule by “three men in a room” — the governor and legislative leaders — seemed reduced to one.Mr. Cuomo also demonstrated some of the other characteristics that have surfaced over the course of his political career, including a penchant for operating in secret and an eagerness to stamp out even seemingly minor perceived threats. If a voter blinked last month, he or she would have missed the governor’s speedy revision of the state’s tax code, without public input or legislative debate. He resisted for seven months before releasing his daily schedules to — a type of document his predecessors had agreed to release. And his administration went to some length to forestall Occupy Albany demonstrators from camping near the Capitol, creating a curfew to keep them from staying overnight at a state-owned park.But, even if Mr. Cuomo faces the challenge of following up on his own first act, he also has the advantage of taking office after four chaotic years in Albany.“If the government is functioning, if we’re not fighting, if it looks like a professional, competent operation, that’s what they are responding to,” he said of voters.Sitting in his office during the interview, he brandished a copy of “The Happy Warrior,” a book wrote about Gov. , and cited the description of Mr. Smith’s governing style to explain why he has assiduously courted a maligned Legislature.“He says in here, F.D.R. talking about Al Smith, that the test of an executive is the ability to get things done with a legislature,” he said, while thumbing through pages looking for an apt quote. “An executive, in part, rises or falls on his ability to get things done with the legislature. That’s my job.”While still nosing through the book, Mr. Cuomo fielded one last question: Will he be in in four years, when the next presidential caucuses are held?“You think I’m going to move and become a farmer?” he replied, gamely. “Not only are my ratings going to plummet, they’re going to plummet to the point I have to flee the state. You would love that story, ‘Former governor flees the state!’ ”“I’m focused on being the governor of the State of New York,” he said, smiling. “If you get past your cynicism for a second, you would understand that. I have been doing things and pursuing things that I would not if I were thinking about running for president.”'"
"'12-01-05,'0','In a snap, the retired lieutenant brought his own weapon to the man’s ribs and fired once.The retired lieutenant had shot an off-duty federal agent, John Capano, 51, who was doing just what Mr. Geraghty was doing: Trying to stop a robbery.On Wednesday, four days after the friendly-fire shooting — the second fatal one in Nassau in a year — a clearer account was emerging as officials pieced together a moment-by-moment timeline of the shootings, based on witness accounts and crime scene photos, preliminary ballistic and medical analyses, a review of surveillance footage and a reconstruction of the 911 calls.Mr. Capano had been in the pharmacy that day picking up prescriptions for himself and his cancer-stricken father. A man identified as James McGoey, 43, came in and robbed the store of cash and hundreds of painkillers.Mr. McGoey had what appeared to be a .45-caliber handgun, but was in fact a silver pellet gun.Mr. Capano had trailed Mr. McGoey as he left the pharmacy and shot him. The two ended up on the sidewalk, locked in a scuffle. It was into this confusing scene that Mr. Geraghty inserted himself.When he shot the agent, Mr. Capano’s .40-caliber Sig Sauer handgun fell loose. Mr. McGoey got it — and rose up as if to fire it, several people said.Then, the off-duty city officer, Joe Abria, discerned the real threat and fired several times at Mr. McGoey, killing him, the people said.The full weight of what went wrong hit Mr. Geraghty when a pharmacist emerged and directed his grief toward the man whom Mr. Geraghty had shot.“The pharmacist came out, and said, ‘John,’ meaning John Capano,” said one person with knowledge of the case. “Geraghty realized it was the wrong person and he pulled the agent’s shirt up, and put his hand on the wound, to put pressure on it, on the side of his chest.”So, two men were dead in the melee in Seaford, N.Y., and officials were left to piece together the complicated remnants of a killing enveloping people with ties to three law enforcement agencies: the New York City and Nassau police forces and the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, where Mr. Capano was a senior special agent on Long Island.The A.T.F., a close-knit bureau of some 2,500 agents, turned its attention to a funeral on Friday and helping to establish a fund for Mr. Capano’s family. The agent was married, with a daughter in high school and a son at Northeastern University.“This tragic incident has left the entire A.T.F. family saddened, and we will seek every opportunity to ensure that John’s wife and children remain part of the family and feel secure in the future,” said Joseph Anarumo, a special agent in charge of the bureau’s New York office.Meanwhile, Mr. Geraghty, who put in 27 years on the Nassau force and retired last year to open a deli with his son, was devastated, according to his lawyer, Brian J. Davis. He said Mr. Geraghty learned Sunday that it was an agent he had accidentally killed.“It was probably one of the worst days of his life,” said Mr. Davis, who acknowledged that Mr. Geraghty shot Mr. Capano but denies any criminal culpability. “It was a terrible, terrible tragedy. My client was going out there to stop a robbery and unfortunately, the way it unfolded, the wrong person got shot, and it is a horrible shame.”'"
"'12-01-05,'0','Despite such deterrents to armed confrontation, oil and foreign policy analysts say a miscalculation is possible that could cause an overreaction from one side or the other.“I fear we may be blundering toward a crisis nobody wants,” said Helima Croft, senior geopolitical strategist at Barclays Capital. “There is a peril of engaging in brinkmanship from all sides.”Various Iranian officials in recent weeks have said they would blockade the strait, which is only 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, if the United States and Europe imposed a tight oil embargo on their country in an effort to thwart its development of nuclear weapons.That did not stop President Obama from signing legislation last weekend imposing sanctions against Iran’s Central Bank intended to make it more difficult for the country to sell its oil, nor did it dissuade the European Union from moving toward a ban on Iranian oil imports.Energy analysts say even a partial blockage of the Strait of Hormuz could raise the world price of oil within days by $50 a barrel or more, and that would quickly push the price of a gallon of regular gasoline to well over $4 a gallon. “You would get an international reaction that would not only be high, but irrationally high,” said Lawrence J. Goldstein, a director of the Energy Policy Research Foundation.Just the threat of such a development has helped keep oil prices above $100 a barrel in recent weeks despite a return of Libyan oil to world markets, worries of a European economic downturn and weakening American gasoline demand. Oil prices rose slightly on Wednesday as the political tensions intensified.American officials have warned Iran against violating international laws that protect commercial shipping in international waters, adding that the Navy would guarantee free sea traffic.“If the Iranians chose to use their modest navy and antiship missiles to attack allied forces, they would see a probable swift devastation of their naval capability,” said David L. Goldwyn, former State Department coordinator for international energy affairs. “We would take out their frigates.”More than 85 percent of the oil and most of the natural gas that flows through the strait goes to China, Japan, India, South Korea and other Asian nations. But a blockade would have a ripple effect on global oil prices.Since Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates all rely on the strait to ship their oil and natural gas exports, a blockade might undermine some of those governments in an already unstable region.Analysts say that a crisis over the Strait of Hormuz would most likely bring China and the United States into something of an alliance to restore shipments, although Mr. Goldwyn said China would more likely resort to private diplomacy instead of military force.Europe and the United States would probably feel the least direct impact because they have strategic oil reserves and could get some Persian Gulf oil through Red Sea pipelines. Saudi Arabia has pipelines that could transport about five million barrels out of the region, while Iraq and the United Arab Emirates also have pipelines with large capacities.But transportation costs would be higher if the strait were blocked, and several million barrels of oil exports would remain stranded, sending energy prices soaring on global markets.“To close the Strait of Hormuz would be an act of war against the whole world,” said Sadad Ibrahim Al-Husseini, former head of exploration and development at Saudi Aramco. “You just can’t play with the global economy and assume that nobody is going to react.”The Iranians have struck in the strait before. In the 1980s, Iran attacked Kuwaiti tankers carrying Iraqi oil, and the Reagan administration reflagged Kuwaiti ships under American flags and escorted them with American warships. Iran backed down, partially, but continued to plant mines.In 1988, an American frigate hit an Iranian mine and nearly sank. United States warships retaliated by destroying some Iranian oil platforms. Attacks and counterattacks continued for months, and a missile from an American warship accidentally shot down an Iranian passenger aircraft, killing 290 passengers.Energy experts say a crisis in the strait would most likely unfold gradually, with Iran using its threats as a way to increase oil prices and shipping costs for the West as retaliation against the tightening of sanctions. So far, energy experts say, insurance companies have not raised prices for covering tankers, but shipping companies are already preparing to pay bonuses for crews facing more hazardous duties.“My guess is this is a lot of threats,” said Michael A. Levi, an energy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, “but there is no certainty in this kind of situation.”'"
"'12-01-05,'0','He and his top aides planned to huddle Wednesday night to go over a new series of ads to run through the month in the January battlegrounds of New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. The ads will portray Mr. Romney, by name, as a “Massachusetts moderate” whose record and policies are unacceptable to the conservative party base.Besides questions that Mr. Gingrich has raised recently about taxpayer-paid abortions under “Romneycare,” aides indicated they were weighing ads charging that the Massachusetts health care law signed by Mr. Romney had driven companies like Fidelity out of state. They also said Mr. Romney had capitulated to liberals by refusing to cut capital-gains taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 annually.“We think to this point in time Governor Romney has gotten a pass, and it’s time to let the light shine his way,” said R. C. Hammond, Mr. Gingrich’s spokesman.But as illustrated by the protester’s cartoon — from 1995, when Mr. Gingrich, then the House speaker, supposedly forced a federal government shutdown partly out of pique at a poor seat on the presidential plane — the strategy carries a danger of reviving an old image of Mr. Gingrich as thin-skinned and tantrum-prone. There is also a risk that voters may judge Mr. Gingrich hypocritical after he vowed so long to run a positive, “solutions-oriented” race.He insisted again on Wednesday that he was not going negative but simply drawing contrasts based on his rivals’ records. It is a distinction that may be lost on some voters.And there is another risk: collateral damage to Mr. Gingrich’s consulting, writing and speaking career, which he developed in his decade as a private citizen. It has made him rich, even if, as shown on Wednesday when he switched from his Iowa uniform of khakis back to a suit, he appears to own just one tie. He must take care not to emerge from a bruising campaign with a tarnished brand should he ultimately return to the private sector.The campaign’s funds are depleted after the Iowa fight, and it is not clear that even an ad that raises sharp questions about Mr. Romney will break through to voters given how those created by Romney supporters attacking Mr. Gingrich saturated the airwaves.A “super PAC” supporting Mr. Gingrich is also planning an ad campaign, its focus to be determined, but the group appears to be waiting for an influx of money from Texas supporters of Gov. Rick Perry.Mr. Gingrich’s remarks to the voters here seemed lackluster, as if he felt the effect of his midnight flight. But when asked if he was discouraged, he denied it.“In this campaign so far, I’ve been dead once, resuscitated, limping along, the front-runner, drowned in a tidal wave of Romney and Ron Paul negative ads and survived. So I don’t worry about much of anything.”Mr. Gingrich predicted that the race would come down to Mr. Romney and a more conservative alternative, and that it would be him once conservative voters picked their tribune. “I think for the short run they’ll splinter, but each cycle they splinter less,” he said. “Be patient. It’s all working out pretty well.”Mr. Paul’s surge, he said, is not a threat. “He’s not going to be the nominee,” Mr. Gingrich said flatly. And he promised to engage Mr. Paul head on in the next debate on Saturday over his hands-off views about Iran’s quest for a nuclear weapon.'"
"'12-01-05,'0','After Mr. Romney claimed the Iowa caucus by eight votes, Wednesday was his chance to savor a triumph on the national political stage that has eluded him, repeatedly and painfully, for years. And to some degree, he did: the half-glow of a thin victory pervaded the day. Campaign aides erupted in applause when he boarded his plane from Iowa to New Hampshire, prompting a rare display of swagger from Mr. Romney, who answered them with effusive congratulations. ”It’s unbelievable,” he told them. “Let’s do it again.”At times, though, the campaign handled the Iowa victory in a self-deprecating tone. Mr. Romney began referring to his razor-thin margin as a “landslide,” dubbing his campaign bus the “Landslide Lounge” and nicknaming his top adviser in Iowa “Landslide.”Not even Mr. McCain could resist a jab. “By the way,” he told an audience in a high school gymnasium here. “We forgot to congratulate him on his landslide victory last night.”At one point, Mr. Romney jokingly pleaded with the audience to deliver a bigger result for him in New Hampshire. “Do you think we can get more than an eight-vote margin here?” he asked. “I hope so.”The crowd — which was confined to smaller space within the gym, giving the room the appearance of being more packed than it actually was — was friendly, though not exactly warm. Mr. Romney faced questions on several of his least favorite topics. A young man from the Occupy Wall Street movement asked if Mr. Romney would modify his statement that “corporations are people” to corporations are “abusive people.” Another voter asked about his Massachusetts health care program, which many Republicans have unfavorably compared to President Obama’s plan. And a Chinese-American woman told him that she was offended by his remarks about China, and criticized his economic plan.“After 20 years of Reagan economics, trickle-down theory, it didn’t help me,” she said. “My tin can is still empty.”When Mr. Romney then turned to a school-age boy, perhaps looking for a lighter question, the young man asked him about a military alliance with Iraq now that the United States has withdrawn from the country — a question Mr. Romney quickly turned over to Mr. McCain.But on a day when the Romney campaign tried to cement its role as the nominee apparent, it was the endorsement from Mr. McCain that carried the greatest weight.Mr. McCain’s support, strategically delivered in New Hampshire, the state that put the Arizona senator on the path to the Republican nomination in 2008, was a political coup, timed to expand Mr. Romney’s already commanding lead.What was supposed to be a closely guarded secret, culminating in a surprise appearance by Mr. McCain at a school in Manchester, leaked out in the early hours of Wednesday morning, apparently at the hands of those close to Mr. McCain — much to the chagrin of aides to Mr. Romney, according to advisers.But mainly, the Romney team was crowing over an endorsement that could have lifted the fortunes of a New Hampshire rival, Jon M. Huntsman Jr.The Romney and Huntsman families — two intertwined clans that go back to the early days of Mormonism — publicly split in 2008 when Mr. Huntsman, then the Utah governor, endorsed Mr. McCain.Two Romney advisers said Mr. Huntsman had hoped Mr. McCain would return the favor ahead of the New Hampshire primary, which Mr. Huntsman has built his presidential campaign around.Still, even as Mr. McCain offered his unqualified backing, he made clear that there were limits to how far he would take his support for a Romney White House.On stage, Mr. McCain deftly dodged a voter’s inquiry about whether he would ever serve as Mr. Romney’s vice president, leaving the question unanswered.Pressed by reporters, Mr. McCain did little to mask his lack of enthusiasm for the idea. “I’m happy in the Senate,” he said.'"
"'12-01-05,'0','The Food and Drug Administration issued an order on Wednesday requiring makers of implantable surgical mesh used to treat urinary incontinence in women to study its risks.The move comes after years of reports of serious injuries linked to the devices, including infections, pain and other complications. It follows a recommendation in September by an F.D.A. advisory panel that the agency require such studies.The move Wednesday by the agency is similar to one it took last year when it ordered producers of all-metal artificial hips to undertake patient studies. The mesh products and the hips belong to a class of implantable devices that manufacturers do not have to study in patients before they are marketed or closely follow in patients afterward.Female incontinence is often caused by two conditions. One is called pelvic organ prolapse, in which muscles that support organs like the bladder weaken, allowing them to descend and press against the vaginal wall. The other, stress urinary incontinence, is also caused by muscle weakening.In 2008, the F.D.A. issued a warning that the use of vaginal mesh was associated with complications but said at the time that such problems were rare. However, from 2008 to 2010 there was a fivefold increase in adverse event reports related to the use of vaginal mesh to treat pelvic organ prolapse, said Dr. William Maisel, the chief scientist of the F.D.A. division that oversees medical devices.'"
"'12-01-05,'0','The agreements opened the gates to the deluge of Chinese tourists — 213,000 arrived in November, 30 percent more than in November 2010 — who buoyed the local economy with more than $3 billion in spending last year. Other firsts include a pair of giant pandas from China, an early reward for Mr. Ma’s Beijing-friendly gestures, and nearly 1,000 mainland students who now study at Taiwan universities.The burst of contact has reawakened old sensitivities and raised new ones.Nathan Batto, a political scientist at the Academia Sinica, a research institute in Taipei, said that the underlying issue for many voters was whether Taiwan could remain autonomous.“The single question that frames all elections here is who we are and what do we want to be,” he said. “Should Taiwan get closer to China or keep its distance?”The United States has not publicly weighed in on the race, but, privately, some officials have expressed unease over the candidacy of Mr. Ma’s main opponent. She is Tsai Ing-wen, 55, an academic and former government minister whose Democratic Progressive Party has traditionally advocated formal independence. In the past, pushes for independence have irritated China and worried Washington, Taiwan’s steadfast ally and its supplier of military hardware.Beijing has not been coy in telegraphing its preference. At a recent news conference, a spokesman for its Taiwan Affairs Office said a victory for Ms. Tsai could “inevitably threaten the peaceful development of cross-strait ties.”In Taiwan, the welter of factions includes indigenous residents and descendents of the mainland Chinese who settled here decades, or even centuries, before the Nationalists arrived. Business-minded Taiwanese know where the money is: the million or so Taiwanese now working and investing in China appear to be backing the Nationalists and Mr. Ma.“We certainly don’t want to jeopardize the status quo,” said Liu Chia-hao, a spokesman at Taipei 101, an iconic green-glass tower that dominates the Taipei horizon. Mr. Liu said that mainland visitors packing the building’s observatory and high-end shops helped the $1.8 billion project break even three years early.“We’d like this vibe to continue,” he said.Even in some of Ms. Tsai’s party’s traditional bases of support, like the largely ethnic Taiwanese population of southern Pingtung County where she was born, are tilting toward the Nationalists. Since 2008, mainland officials, encouraged by Mr. Ma’s new trade policies, have been offering princely sums for every last mango, banana and orchid the Pingtung farmers grow.“President Ma promised he would open agricultural markets to China, and in his first month he did,” said Cheng Cheng-ying, manager of the Taiwan Floriculture Exports Association.Invoking the blue flag of the Nationalists and the green of Ms. Tsai’s party, he said, “If you ask my neighbors, they say they are green, but inside they have all become a little bit blue.”But warming ties have also stoked deeply rooted fears, fanned by Ms. Tsai and her party, that the island is becoming too cozy with the authoritarian behemoth next door.“Let’s face it, China wants nothing more than to devour us, and the K.M.T. is giving us away,” Zhou Zhu-zhen, a retired nurse, said last month during a rally, using an acronym for the Nationalists.The race has been dominated by parochial concerns and mudslinging. Last week, Ms. Tsai and her surrogates accused the president of using the intelligence authorities to monitor her campaign illegally. The Ma camp has been raising questions about Ms. Tsai’s role in a state-financed biotech company that yielded her handsome profits. Both have denied any wrongdoing.On paper and in person, the two bear striking similarities. Educated abroad — Mr. Ma at Harvard and New York University, and Ms. Tsai at Cornell and the London School of Economics — they spent their early careers in academia. Both are reluctant campaigners, wonkish rather than telegenic. Each promises generous social spending and a city’s worth of low-cost housing.Polls suggest that they are in a statistical dead heat, with a third candidate, James Soong of the People’s First Party, pulling roughly a tenth of the vote, mostly from the incumbent. Ms. Tsai hopes to prevail with her party’s traditional supporters: besides the island’s native Taiwanese and the farmers in the south, they include blue-collar workers who dream of a return to the 1990s, when Taiwan was a high-tech manufacturing powerhouse.The front-runners dance gingerly around the issue of China. It emerges mostly in the form of debate on the so-called 1992 Consensus, a nebulous pact between Beijing and Nationalist Party leaders that allows both to recognize the principle of one China, bypassing uncomfortable details. Ms. Tsai, a former minister of the Mainland Affairs Council, which helps set cross-strait policy, says the arrangement is a fiction. She wants the voters to determine how Taiwan defines itself in future negotiations with China.Although she has dialed down her party’s stridency on independence, Ms. Tsai warns that Nationalist policies are eroding Taiwan’s sovereignty. In an interview, she offered a simple example of distasteful compromise: “When Chinese visitors come, we have to put away our flags,” she said.Mr. Ma waves off such complaints, saying that détente has strengthened the island’s global standing.Beijing has halted efforts to wrest away the few remaining countries that recognize Taiwan diplomatically, and has removed its longtime opposition to the island’s participation in some international bodies. The last three years of calm across the straits, Mr. Ma said, have been good for the island and the region.“Taiwan is no longer regarded as a troublemaker,” Mr. Ma said in an interview, “but as a force for peace.”'"

"'12-01-05,'0','GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Offering a detailed series of apologies, Rangers Coach John Tortorella expressed regret Wednesday for his comments after the N.H.L. Winter Classic.Tortorella had suggested the game’s on-ice officials may have conspired with the league and NBC with a goal of sending the game to overtime or a shootout. After the Rangers practiced Wednesday afternoon, Tortorella began his news briefing by asking for some time to clear the air.“I tainted the Classic with my mouth,” Tortorella said. “It was wrong with my sarcasm and frustration, and I apologize to everyone involved.”The apology did not come in time to avoid a fine from the N.H.L. in the amount of $30,000, according to a league official.“There is no acceptable explanation or excuse for commentary challenging the integrity of the league, its officials or its broadcast partners,” the N.H.L. senior vice president Colin Campbell said in a statement. “People can disagree with calls by officials on the ice, but even in instances of the utmost frustration, there is no justification for speaking as inappropriately and irresponsibly as Mr. Tortorella did.”After the Rangers’ victory at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Tortorella was asked about some questionable calls by the referees Dennis LaRue and Ian Walsh in the final minutes of regulation when his team held a 3-2 lead.'"
"'12-01-05,'0','Though Ms. Miller, 35, now lives on Avenue B and Second Street with her boyfriend of several years, the actor and artist Leo Fitzpatrick, she remains a social force. She hopes that 143, the new store she opened with a fellow designer, Lindsey Thornburg, on Ludlow Street, will become a “daytime Club Chrissie,” she said, “now that my group of friends is sort of more settled down and coupled up.”They may have grown up, but Ms. Miller is still very much, as her friend Jen Brill put it, “the most popular girl in school.” Her years as a precocious teenager were spent going to raves and sneaking into legendary parties like NASA. “I don’t know how we even got in,” she said. “It was always someone who knew someone.”Though she attended expensive private schools on the Upper East Side, including Convent of the Sacred Heart, Ms. Miller said she had a hard time competing with super-wealthy classmates. Her mother, Susan Miller, was a photography agent (before she became the astrologist behind the Web site AstrologyZone.com), and her father worked in advertising. “You know in ‘The Jerk,’ how Steve Martin wakes up and realizes he’s not black?,” she asked. “At some point I was like, Oh wait, I’m not a rich kid.”To earn extra money, she began to D.J. — inspired by one of her good friends, Mark Ronson, who was already making a name for himself in the clubs. “He was a big record collector and turned me on to a lot of music.” And through her friend Max LeRoy, whose father owned the old Tavern on the Green, she landed a regular spot playing at that Central Park restaurant.After high school, Ms. Miller briefly left the city to attend the State University of New York at Purchase, where she majored in sociology of mass media and minored in film. Upon graduating, she moved to the East Village and took odd jobs — freelance graphic designer; part-time salesclerk at Filth Mart, a vintage shop run by Ms. de Matteo, where she learned the ins and outs of retail. “O.K., yeah, I’ve never had a ‘real’ job,” she said.Then in 2003, “just for fun,” Ms. Miller said, “I started making T-shirts” emblazoned with tongue-in-cheek slogans like “The Socialites” (written in the Strokes font) and “Page Six Six Six.” Charlotte Ronson carried them in a NoLIta store and, soon after, a buyer from Bloomingdale’s happened by, liked what she saw and placed a big order.Before long, celebrities like Britney Spears were photographed wearing the Page Six Six Six tee. A friend introduced Ms. Miller to Madeleine von Froomer (a design assistant at Proenza Schouler at the time), and with money she had saved, the two started Sophomore in 2007, as a New York counterpart to casual-chic Los Angeles-based lines like Juicy Couture and James Perse.“I thought there was a market for upscale fashion basics here in New York,” Ms. Miller said. “I don’t really like to dress up and wanted to create clothes that someone like me would feel comfortable in — but still be able to wear out at night.”Opening Ceremony was the first store to sell the Sophomore line, and now the jersey-based pieces are available at more than 100 boutiques worldwide. (Apparently, Australians are big fans.) “I like to say that we’re the cheapest thing at an expensive store,” Ms. Miller added.With Ms. von Froomer as the main designer, Ms. Miller oversees all the designs and, as the creative director, generates the brand’s look and feel, including its too-hip look books.

"'12-01-05,'0','The British auditor for newspaper sales said on Wednesday that an unusual distribution arrangement operated by The Wall Street Journal Europe appeared to comply with its reporting standards, saying an investigation had turned up “no clear evidence” of violations.Under a program, an educational consulting firm had bought 12,000 copies of the paper for 1 euro cent each. Payments were then made to the firm by The Journal through third parties.The arrangement came to light after the publisher of the European Journal at the time, Andrew Langhoff, resigned last October over what The Journal described as questions of journalistic ethics related to the deal.The Audit Bureau of Circulations in Britain looked into the matter but said it found no problems. “The payment arrangements underlying this contract were complex and at times circuitous, but A.B.C. has found no clear evidence that these copies should be regarded as not compliant with the reporting standards for international publications,” the audit bureau said.The audit bureau said, however, that it had begun a separate review of its standards for certain multicopy circulation deals involving international publications “to ensure they fully reflect industry requirements and provide the requisite clarity for all concerned.”'"
"'12-01-05,'0','Mr. Hildebrand, who spent part of his career at a New York hedge fund, is known internationally for his work drafting regulations, known as Basel III, that would oblige banks worldwide to limit their use of leverage to strengthen risk management.The disclosure of the transactions immediately took on political overtones because of the involvement of the Swiss People’s Party in bringing the matter to light. The party, which campaigns on a platform of limiting immigration and keeping Switzerland out of the European Union, has been among Mr. Hildebrand’s most vocal critics.“There have been disputes about monetary policy, but so far no one has questioned his integrity,” said Daniel Kübler, a professor of political science at the University of Zurich.Noting that Mr. Hildebrand had pushed for more financial disclosure by top officials of the central bank, Mr. Kübler said he found it difficult to believe that the accusations were true. But he added, “If it is confirmed, then he must resign.”Accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers who examined records of the transactions said that some were profitable for Mr. Hildebrand but others lost money. The report did not calculate the total profit or loss, but its findings raise the question of why Mr. Hildebrand, who is wealthy, would risk his reputation for relatively little return.Mr. Hildebrand has made enemies at home and abroad by pushing to impose rules on the country’s two biggest banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, that were tougher than those in other countries. He has also annoyed his former financial industry colleagues with his criticism of banker compensation and his advocacy of regulations to limit bank risk and prevent future financial crises. The rules have been endorsed by leaders of the Group of 20 largest economies.In Switzerland, one of Mr. Hildebrand’s most vocal antagonists has been Christoph Blocher, a businessman who is perhaps the best-known figure in the Swiss People’s Party. In the past Mr. Blocher has accused the Swiss National Bank of squandering the country’s wealth with costly currency interventions and has demanded that Mr. Hildebrand resign.The criticism has been muted since the bank announced in September that it would set a limit on the currency of 1.20 francs to the euro. The policy has been successful in keeping the franc, favored by investors as a haven from global financial turmoil, from rising to levels that would be ruinous for Swiss export companies.Bank Sarasin, an institution in Basel, Switzerland, where Mr. Hildebrand had an account, said Tuesday that one of its employees leaked information about the currency transactions to a lawyer close to the Swiss People’s Party. The employee, who was not identified, later met with Mr. Blocher, the bank said. The employee has been fired and has turned himself in to the police for violating bank secrecy laws, Bank Sarasin said.The report by PricewaterhouseCoopers found that one transaction was made without Mr. Hildebrand’s knowledge by his wife, Kashya, the owner of an art gallery in Zurich.“As I have worked in the financial and banking industry for over 15 years and always observe the markets, I felt at ease with this transaction,” Mrs. Hildebrand said, according to Reuters, quoting an interview she gave to Swiss television.Mrs. Hildebrand, who was born in Pakistan and grew up in the United States, met her future husband when both were working in New York during the 1990s at Moore Capital Management, a hedge fund, the Swiss daily Tages-Anzeiger reported.According to the PricewaterhouseCoopers auditors, Mrs. Hildebrand made a $500,000 currency transaction in August, days before the central bank stepped up its intervention in currency markets. But e-mails indicated that Mr. Hildebrand learned of the transaction only after the fact, and then instructed Bank Sarasin not to make any more trades without his approval, the auditors said.Weltwoche stirred fresh outrage in Switzerland on Wednesday by reporting that, instead, the trades were made using an account in Mr. Hildebrand’s name.The auditors’ report said that trades executed by Mr. Hildebrand were permissible under central bank rules because they were in connection with the purchase of a residence or other personal business.Mrs. Hildebrand did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment, and no one answered the phone at Kashya Hildebrand Gallery in Zurich on Wednesday.The committee that oversees the Swiss National Bank, known as the Bank Council, said in a statement on Dec. 23 that an inquiry “confirmed that no improper transactions were undertaken and there was no misuse of privileged information.”'"
"'12-01-05,'0','Senator Jerry Moran, Republican of Kansas, said on Wednesday that he was “outraged” that Boeing was moving that work to Washington State.“It is hard to believe that conditions would have changed so rapidly over the past few months to bring about the decision to not only move the tanker finishing work elsewhere, but to also close down the entire facility,” he said. “The fact that Boeing is now refusing to honor its commitment to the people of Kansas is greatly troubling to me and to thousands of Kansans who trusted that Boeing’s promise would be kept.”Mark Bass, a vice president for a division in Boeing’s military business, told reporters on Wednesday that the plant, which Boeing has run for 80 years, was too large and inefficient to be competitive as the Pentagon cut costs.He said other contracts for modifying and maintaining military aircraft were winding down, and a Boeing study concluded in November that the plant’s business “would continue to erode.”He said the plant had 97 buildings and stretched across two million square feet, but it must compete for maintenance work with smaller companies operating out of two aircraft hangars.Boeing maintains the president’s planes, known as Air Force One, at the Wichita plant. Company officials said some of the modification contracts, for airborne command and logistics-support planes, were ending, and plans for updating B-52 bombers had not materialized as expected.Mr. Bass said labor costs at the plant were higher than at rival sites.Boeing will move the engineering and project management work to its plant in Oklahoma City, adding 800 jobs there, he said. The modification and maintenance work will shift to San Antonio, adding 300 to 400 jobs there. And 200 jobs related to the tanker project will be moved to Washington, he said.Boeing’s decision was a major setback for Wichita, which has long been an aviation center. Boeing spun off work on its commercial planes there in 2005, and the new company, Spirit AeroSystems, supplies sections for Boeing jets. Other plane makers, like Cessna and Hawker Beechcraft, are based in Wichita.Boeing has laid off workers in other states over the last several years. The total work force in its military business has dropped to 63,000 from 71,000 at the start of 2009. Other military contractors have cut thousands of workers through buyouts and layoffs.Boeing officials said they could not specify Wednesday how many of the cuts had been made in response to cancellations or delays in weapons programs. They said some of the employees had been transferred to the company’s commercial-plane business, which has rebounded from the recession.'"
"'12-01-05,'0','A decade ago, the F.D.A. banned indiscriminate agricultural uses of a powerful class of antibiotics, called fluoroquinolones, that includes the medicine Cipro. Wednesday’s announcement was another of the F.D.A.’s incremental steps.“We believe this is an imperative step in preserving the effectiveness of this class of important antimicrobials that takes into account the need to protect the health of both humans and animals,” said Michael R. Taylor, deputy commissioner for foods at the agency.Cephalosporins are not used as widely in livestock as penicillin, since they require a prescription from veterinarians. But the drugs are routinely injected into broiler eggs and used in large doses to treat infections in cattle and other animals.The new rule will restrict only some of these uses and is therefore a modest step that, while applauded by consumer advocates, led many to call for far tougher measures.“This is particularly important because cephalosporins are so important to human health, but it’s only a first step,” said Laura Rogers of the Pew Charitable Trusts, which has advocated restricting agricultural uses of antibiotics.The F.D.A. initially proposed cephalosporin restrictions in 2008 but withdrew the rule before it could take effect because of opposition from veterinarians, farmers and drug companies. The rule announced Wednesday is less strict than that one, since it still allows veterinarians to use the drugs in to treat sick animals in some ways the F.D.A. has not specifically approved, and wide discretion to treat small-scale-production animals like ducks and rabbits. The rule bans routine injections of cephalosporins into chicken eggs and large and lengthy dosing in cattle and swine.Dr. Christine Hoang, assistant director of scientific activities at the American Veterinary Medical Association, said the new rule was a vast improvement over the one proposed in 2008.“We thought the original order was too broad and unnecessarily prohibited uses that were not likely to cause problems for human health,” Dr. Hoang said.Dr. Scott A. Brown of Pfizer, which makes cephalosporins used in animals, said the company “acknowledges the intent of the proposed order to respect veterinary discretion in determining the appropriate and responsible use of cephalosporin antibiotic medicines in the interest of animal health and human health.”The F.D.A. has yet to make final a guideline proposed in 2010 that would edge the agency closer to banning uses of penicillin and tetracycline in feed and water for the sole purpose of promoting the growth of animals or preventing illness that results from unsanitary living conditions. This issue has generated intense controversy among farmers and ranchers who contend that public health officials have exaggerated the danger of agricultural uses of antibiotics to humans.When asked about the penicillin guideline, Mr. Taylor of the F.D.A. said, “We’re hopeful that in the coming months, we’ll be able to carry forward on that work.”Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat from New York and a microbiologist, said the F.D.A. had been too slow and too timid. “We are staring at a massive public health threat in the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs,” she said. “We need to start acting with the swiftness and decisiveness this problem deserves.”But Dr. Gatz Riddell, executive vice president of the American Association of Bovine Practitioners, a veterinarian group, said the dangers of agricultural uses of antibiotics had been greatly exaggerated. “It is highly misunderstood in the human-health community how much antibiotics are used in animals who are not sick or at risk of becoming sick,” he said.'"
"'12-01-05,'0','The endorsement drew a snarl from , who skipped Iowa, where he drew 1 percent of the vote, to campaign instead in New Hampshire. “You can get all the Doles and all the McCains in the world, as Romney probably will,” said Mr. Huntsman, referring to former Senator , the party’s nominee in 1996. “But in the end, who cares?”Other candidates began staging in the state, too, as they sorted out the Iowa results. , who came in a close second in Iowa, prepared for a town-hall-style meeting Wednesday night in Brentwood, while Representative of ended her campaign and Gov. of prepared to gear back up after coming in fifth in Iowa and reassessing his strategy.Mr. Romney, the favorite in the primary just six days away, is hoping for a commanding win before the race turns to , which votes on Jan. 21. Because of the importance of that state in the primary process, Mr. Romney is planning a quick jaunt to Thursday and will be joined by Mr. McCain and Gov. of South Carolina. Mr. Santorum is also weighing a quick trip south, his spokesman said.But it is clear that Mr. Romney’s opponents, in an increasingly nasty and expensive race, do not intend to allow him an easy path here., who was buried under a barrage of negative attacks from Mr. Romney’s supporters and placed fourth in Iowa, landed in Manchester by charter jet at 3:30 a.m., and held a morning event in Concord focused on education. It was a lecture with hardly a mention of his Republican rivals or campaign strategy. But in a meeting with reporters, Mr. Gingrich made clear he would be delivering on his promise to go after and Mr. Romney more aggressively.“I am confident by the end of the day we’ll have had enough specific references that Governor Romney will get the message,” he said.Mr. Paul, who finished third in Iowa, called Mr. Gingrich a “chicken hawk” on CNN Wednesday morning for seeking a deferment during the Vietnam War. Mr. Gingrich said that as a father in the 1960s, he received deferments automatically.And he spoke mockingly of Mr. Paul: “What he just said has absolutely the same amount of accuracy as the newsletters he said he never wrote,” a reference to anti-black and anti- sentiments expressed in those newsletters in the 1990s. “This is a man who says wild and outrageous statements with no facts and later denies that he said them or wonders who wrote them because it couldn’t have been him even if it was under his name.”Despite the muddied result in Iowa, the caucuses — the first Republican contest of the season — began narrowing the field.Mrs. Bachmann, who came in second to last in Iowa, said Wednesday morning at a news conference in Iowa that she was ending her campaign, though she vowed to continue to work to make sure President Obama did not win re-election.“I will continue to fight to defeat the president’s agenda of socialism,” she said. But she noted that “the people of Iowa have spoken with a very clear voice” and said “I have decided to stand aside.” She made no endorsement of another candidate.Mr. Perry, who placed fifth, decided Wednesday to continue in the race after saying late Tuesday night that he would return to Texas to “assess” his candidacy.An important supporter with knowledge of Mr. Perry’s plans said he would skip the New Hampshire primary but still participate in the two debates this weekend. Mr. Perry is also sticking with his plan to campaign next week in South Carolina, which votes Jan. 21, the supporter and Mr. Perry’s aides said.His decision to stay in the race surprised some of his advisers. The governor’s wife, Anita, was in favor of pushing forward in the campaign, according to two Republicans who spoke on condition of anonymity.The campaign has been divided over strategy, the two Republicans said, and the decision provided the latest example of competing arguments among his team. Donors and other supporters also reached out to Mr. Perry and urged him to stay in the race through at least the South Carolina primary, given the volatility and unpredictable nature of the race.“This thing is far from over,” said Katon Dawson, the former Republican chairman of South Carolina and now an adviser to Mr. Perry. Turning a campaign cliché on its head, he added: “Iowa picks corn and New Hampshire picks campaigns’ pockets.”Mr. Santorum, a former senator and favorite among evangelical voters, is hoping to emerge as the conservative alternative to Mr. Romney.“Don’t sell America short,” Mr. Santorum said Tuesday night at a caucus in Clive, Iowa. “Don’t put someone out there from Iowa who isn’t capable of doing what America needs done.”Mr. Santorum now faces the challenge of trying to broaden his campaign organization on the fly to compete with the structure that Mr. Romney has spent years building. His aides vowed that he would compete with Mr. Romney everywhere.The Iowa caucuses did not deliver a clean answer to what type of candidate Republicans intend to rally behind to try to defeat Mr. Obama and win back the White House.It was the closest race in the history of the Iowa caucuses. In 1980, George Bush beat by two percentage points; only a tenth of a percentage point separated Mr. Romney from Mr. Santorum on Tuesday.The endorsement of Mr. McCain further solidifies Mr. Romney as the candidate of the Republican establishment.“I’m really here for one reason and one reason only,” Mr. McCain said on Wednesday in Manchester, “and that is to make sure that we make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States of America.”The McCain endorsement is significant in New Hampshire, where Mr. McCain has been a darling of the independents. It also comes as something of a slap back at Mr. Santorum, with whom Mr. McCain has had a rocky history. When Mr. Santorum faced a tough challenger in for his Senate seat from Pennsylvania in 2006, Mr. Santorum asked Mr. McCain for his support. But then in 2008, as Mr. McCain was campaigning for president, Mr. Santorum did not support him. In fact, he actively spoke against him.In an interview early Wednesday morning on CNN, Mr. Santorum congratulated Mr. Romney for getting Mr. McCain’s endorsement. But he also said he was not surprised by the move. “John is a more moderate member of the Republican team,” who fits with Mr. Romney’s “view of the world,” Mr. Santorum said, a backhanded compliment meant to underscore Mr. Santorum’s conservative credentials.Mr. Santorum, written off as a bottom-tier candidate for most of the campaign, begins his campaigning in New Hampshire at a “Faith Family and Freedom” town hall at 7:30 Wednesday night in Brentwood. He follows with a radio interview at 9 p.m. with WBZ radio in .After more interviews Thursday morning, he plans a town hall in Northfield, a lunch at the Tilt’n Diner in Tilton, an address at the College Convention in Concord and a town hall in Windham.Mr. Paul has been running a distant second to Mr. Romney in the polls here. He is well-organized here and is already advertising on television and could ride some momentum, especially with younger voters. Mr. Paul had no public events planned for Wednesday in New Hampshire.The fissures in the party, particularly among social and economic conservatives, have been exposed during the early stage of the presidential nominating battle. But while Republicans have yet to unite behind a single candidate, they are united in their determination to defeat Mr. Obama.As the candidates arrived here, they did not find a warm welcome — and not only because of the chill that has plunged New Hampshire into a deep freeze. Mr. Huntsman, who skipped Iowa and has been campaigning across New Hampshire by himself, has not exactly rolled out the red carpet for his fellow Republicans.“Welcome to New Hampshire,” he said at an event Tuesday night. “Who cares?”The candidates have packed schedules for the next six days. Highlights along the way include two debates this weekend, the first since before the Christmas break and a chance for the candidates to reframe their arguments given the Iowa results.Despite his disappointing finish, Mr. Gingrich pledged on Tuesday to press forward and be on the stage at the next debate on Saturday night in Manchester..“There will be a great debate in the before we are prepared to have a great debate with ,” Mr. Gingrich said, pledging to raise the intensity of his criticism of Mr. Romney. He offered a glimpse at his approach, calling Mr. Romney a liar whose conservative credentials could not be trusted.Mr. Gingrich wasted no time getting a start in New Hampshire. He held a town hall Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. in Concord and planned a post-lunch town hall at 3 p.m. in Lanconia. Wednesday night he will sit for a public interview at St. Anselm College.And on Thursday, while Mr. Romney prepares to leave for South Carolina, Mr. Gingrich will hold four town hall meetings, in Plymouth, Littleton, Lancaster and Meredith.Mr. Huntsman also has a full schedule. He began the earliest of the candidates, starting out with supporters waving his signs in Concord at 8:30 a.m. From there he goes to a 10 a.m. town hall in Pittsfield, a 12:15 p.m. tour of a plant in Barrington, a 4 p.m. town hall in Manchester and a meeting at his campaign headquarters.'"

But the S.E.C.’s enforcement staff will have discretion whether to use relevant facts from the criminal case in its own court documents for the civil case.Last year, the S.E.C. encountered the conflict between simultaneous admission and nonadmission of facts in three other cases involving bid-rigging by large Wall Street firms. S.E.C. officials declined to comment on whether additional cases could result from the Wall Street bid-rigging.Mr. Khuzami said the policy change had been under consideration since last spring and had been discussed with commissioners “over the last several months.”The S.E.C. has defended the practice of allowing companies to avoid admitting or denying charges, saying that by settling with companies, it saves the commission the far greater expense — and potential risk — of fighting them in court. The agency says it is usually able to get as much money from a settlement as it could win in a protracted legal case, with money being returned to investors more quickly.In drafting a settlement of securities fraud charges, companies frequently seek the “neither admit nor deny” language for fear that their acknowledgment of the conduct could be used against them in shareholder lawsuits seeking damages. But legal experts say that safe harbor does not apply when a company has admitted facts in a criminal case.Securities law experts differed over the practical importance of the change, with some saying it is a notable acknowledgment by the agency of flaws in its system, and others suggesting that it will not affect most S.E.C. cases, which involve only civil charges. Since the S.E.C. is not empowered to bring criminal cases it refers potential criminal cases to the Justice Department.“It’s an important development because it is a change of policy,” said James D. Cox, a professor at Duke Law School and co-author of a securities regulation textbook. “It’s a small step forward in addressing the concerns” that a federal judge recently voiced about the S.E.C.’s broader settlement policy.But David S. Ruder, an emeritus professor at Northwestern School of Law and a former S.E.C. chairman, said the change was merely “a tweaking” of policy that would not significantly reduce the commission’s reliance on the “neither admit nor deny” policy to settle cases.The practice has been in use for years by many government agencies in addition to the S.E.C. The Justice Department has, in at least one case, allowed a company both to admit and deny similar charges in a single instance. Last November, Merck pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that it promoted its painkiller for an unapproved use.At the same time, it settled a broader array of civil charges by the Justice Department that it made misleading statements about the drug’s safety. In that settlement, Merck expressly denied that it engaged in wrongful conduct.It has been the S.E.C.’s application of this policy, however, that has attracted renewed criticism, particularly in cases related to the 2008 financial crisis. The House Financial Services committee said it would conduct a hearing to examine the practice early this year.In November, , a Federal District Court judge in New York, rejected an S.E.C. settlement with Citigroup over securities fraud charges and was sharply critical of the practice. He said the “neither admit nor deny” language deprived the court of the facts necessary to determine if the punishment was adequate because it meant that there were no established facts on which to base a decision.The Citigroup case will not be affected by the policy change, because there is no accompanying criminal charge.

"'12-01-06,'0','The jockeying for this honor has, unsurprisingly, already begun. All across Los Angeles, young actresses from this year’s batch of talked-about films — including Felicity Jones (“Like Crazy”), Rooney Mara (“The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”), Elizabeth Olsen (“Martha Marcy May Marlene”) and Shailene Woodley (“The Descendants”) — are working round-the-clock with stylists, sometimes hastily acquired, to try to come up with “that one major dress,” as Ms. Welch put it.“It’s all about that moment where everything has to be perfect,” she said. “Everything has to align. The hair and makeup, the clothes, the fit.”On a recent Saturday, for example, the dark-haired, limpid-eyed Ms. Jones, 28, who plays a love-struck college student in the indie film “Like Crazy,” was going over designer collections with the stylist Jessica Paster.“She came to my house, she’s so sweet,” Ms. Paster said. “I love chai lattes, and she brought me and my assistant, Brie, a chai latte.”Ms. Paster continued, “She loved the Givenchy, the resort collection, and Alexander McQueen.”The women also sought inspiration from “pictures of old actresses, their styles, their silhouettes” and classic films, Ms. Paster said, adding that her client was smitten with Grace Kelly in “Rear Window.”Ms. Jones is high on the list of Ones to Watch this season. Named the new face of Dolce & Gabbana cosmetics, the spritelike Briton, who also appeared in Burberry’s fall 2011 campaign, has been evoking Audrey Hepburn-like glamour by mixing flirty, gamine looks, like the floral Dolce & Gabbana cocktail dress she wore to the New York premiere of “Like Crazy,” with more modern and subdued choices. At last month’s Gotham Independent Film Awards, where she won the breakthrough-actor award, Ms. Jones was radiant in an understated, mint-colored Proenza Schouler shift.“She’s been killing it on the red carpet,” said the stylist Ilaria Urbinati, who works with Elle Fanning, at 13 another whippersnapper fashion darling. “She’s the new Carey Mulligan to me, the one wearing really ladylike, sweet dresses, and not dressing too sexy or too provocatively, but still very interesting.”Ms. Mara, who is 26, is playing it more daring, bringing the punk-hacker aesthetic of Lisbeth Salander, her character in David Fincher’s film “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” off screen, in the form of severe bumper bangs, black lipstick and revealing cutout dresses.

And third of all, she has a Vogue cover. So she’s already ahead of the pack.”Ariel Foxman, the editor of InStyle magazine, said that actresses like Ms. Mara reflected a more assertive personal style than this year’s young starlets were displaying, in comparison with past seasons when a lot of actresses were perhaps doing the rather safe red-carpet presentation.” Most memorably, Ms. Lawrence wore a red va-va-voom Calvin Klein tank dress to the Oscars, making her look as if she’d just stepped off the set of “Baywatch.” Mr. Foxman suggested that when it came to the red carpet, there was no sartorial innocence anymore. (Certainly the youngest-ever best-supporting-actress nominee Tatum O’Neal’s accepting her award in a tux at age 10, as she did in 1974, seems unimaginable today.)“When I look at these women from 2011, they clearly know what they like, and they’ve made a consistent decision to present themselves in a certain way,” he said. “I can’t imagine anyone having started off as a blank slate.”That is certainly true of Ms. Olsen, 22, who’s grown up surrounded by fashion, thanks to her older sisters, Mary-Kate and Ashley, the famed progenitors of the boho-chic obsession for garbage-bag-size handbags and form-swallowing peasant dresses. Though so far, the sporty blond Elizabeth has defied expectations by opting for a cleaner, more wholesome style. At the Cannes Film Festival last spring, where her film “Martha Marcy May Marlene” screened after its rapturous reception at the Sundance Film Festival, she turned heads in a white, lacy, tiered dress — from her sisters’ high-end line, the Row — paired with crystal-embedded sandals by Giuseppe Zanotti.“Cannes was sort of her coming-out ball,” Ms. Urbinati said. “It’s not what you would expect someone who was up-and-coming to wear. It was white and a little bit flappery looking.”A less consistent fashion force is Shailene Woodley, 20, the scrubbed, usually ponytailed star of ABC Family’s “Secret Life of the American Teenager,” who plays George Clooney’s rebellious daughter in the Oscar-hopeful film “The Descendants.” At its Los Angeles premiere, she won raves in a floral Dolce & Gabbana dress, which made her look youthful yet glamorous — and vaguely Hawaiian, in keeping with the film’s theme. But the shapeless, gray Jeremy Laing dress worn to the New York Film Festival wrought a torrent of blogosphere snark. “Is that a poncho coming out of her right arm, a mesh blanket, a fishing net?!” the pop culture Web site The Insider said.“I’m very curious to see that one,” Mr. Bloch said of Ms. Woodley. “She’s the dark horse to me. She seems very high school girl, very unglamorous, like she was plucked out of nowhere. But I’d love to see her pull it off.”But in the end, how much does being fashionable matter to a dramatic career? Ms. Woodley, after all, and Ms. Mara are the only starlets in this article who have Globe nominations for their roles. Is it a concern, even, that the dress might upstage the actress?

"'12-01-06,'0','The jockeying for this honor has, unsurprisingly, already begun. All across Los Angeles, young actresses from this year’s batch of talked-about films — including Felicity Jones (“Like Crazy”), Rooney Mara (“The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo”), Elizabeth Olsen (“Martha Marcy May Marlene”) and Shailene Woodley (“The Descendants”) — are working round-the-clock with stylists, sometimes hastily acquired, to try to come up with “that one major dress,” as Ms. Welch put it.“It’s all about that moment where everything has to be perfect,” she said. “Everything has to align. The hair and makeup, the clothes, the fit.”On a recent Saturday, for example, the dark-haired, limpid-eyed Ms. Jones, 28, who plays a love-struck college student in the indie film “Like Crazy,” was going over designer collections with the stylist Jessica Paster.“She came to my house, she’s so sweet,” Ms. Paster said. “I love chai lattes, and she brought me and my assistant, Brie, a chai latte.”Ms. Paster continued, “She loved the Givenchy, the resort collection, and Alexander McQueen.”The women also sought inspiration from “pictures of old actresses, their styles, their silhouettes” and classic films, Ms. Paster said, adding that her client was smitten with Grace Kelly in “Rear Window.”Ms. Jones is high on the list of Ones to Watch this season. Named the new face of Dolce & Gabbana cosmetics, the spritelike Briton, who also appeared in Burberry’s fall 2011 campaign, has been evoking Audrey Hepburn-like glamour by mixing flirty, gamine looks, like the floral Dolce & Gabbana cocktail dress she wore to the New York premiere of “Like Crazy,” with more modern and subdued choices. At last month’s Gotham Independent Film Awards, where she won the breakthrough-actor award, Ms. Jones was radiant in an understated, mint-colored Proenza Schouler shift.“She’s been killing it on the red carpet,” said the stylist Ilaria Urbinati, who works with Elle Fanning, at 13 another whippersnapper fashion darling. “She’s the new Carey Mulligan to me, the one wearing really ladylike, sweet dresses, and not dressing too sexy or too provocatively, but still very interesting.”Ms. Mara, who is 26, is playing it more daring, bringing the punk-hacker aesthetic of Lisbeth Salander, her character in David Fincher’s film “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo,” off screen, in the form of severe bumper bangs, black lipstick and revealing cutout dresses. (Though her “moment,” thus far, was when she softened things up at the London premiere of her film, wearing an angelic white Givenchy couture gown that had critics swooning.)The drastic turnaround from Ms. Mara’s pre-“Dragon Tattoo” look — which was more girl next door, in keeping with her role as Mark Zuckerberg’s girlfriend in “The Social Network” — has elicited intrigue at fashion’s highest level: in November, Ms. Mara appeared on the cover of Vogue.“First of all, she has a Vogue cover,” said the stylist and frequent red-carpet commentator Phillip Bloch. “Second of all, she has a Vogue cover.

"'12-01-06,'0','The Mets said in a statement Thursday that they had hired CRG Partners, a firm known as a turnaround specialist and bankruptcy consultant, to provide “services in connection with financial reporting and budgeting processes.”They made the statement in response to a report on the blog Amazin’ Avenue, which is owned by SBNation.com.During the 2010 bankruptcy of the Texas Rangers, William Snyder, a managing partner of CRG, was the team’s court-appointed chief restructuring officer. The Rangers were subsequently sold in a bankruptcy court auction to a group led by Nolan Ryan and Chuck Greenberg.The Mets’ statement offered no details about their need for CRG’s expertise.According to its Web site, CRG offers financial advisory, restructuring and performance improvement services. It does advise companies who have sought bankruptcy protection.The Mets have never spoken publicly about taking such a step.Still, Peter Kaufman, president of the Gordian Group, an investment bank that specializes in bankruptcies and restructurings, said, “Given CRG’s expertise in bankruptcies, it’s certainly a fair implication that it’s been hired to prepare the necessary bankruptcy schedules, projections and filings.”The Mets are certainly under considerable financial pressure.They lost $70 million last season. They owe more than $400 million to a group of banks; $40 million to Bank of America; and $25 million to Major League Baseball that is past due. They also face the prospect of another year of falling attendance at Citi Field and have already reduced ticket prices.

"'12-01-06,'0','The going rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco is about $2,500 a month. That’s the same amount the city pays to use eight miles of Hetch Hetchy Valley in Yosemite National Park as a reservoir.The $30,000 annual fee was set by federal law in 1913 and has not been changed since. But now, as the federal government struggles with budget problems, a Central Valley congressman is pushing to increase the city’s Hetch Hetchy rent by a thousandfold, to $34 million a year.Representative Devin Nunes, a Republican from Tulare, said the current low rent amounts to a federal subsidy for San Francisco’s water and electricity supply and is unfair to farmers in his heavily agricultural district, whose water supply is diminished. He proposed to Congress’s Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction that the city be made to pay a fee comparable to what the government sought to charge Southern California Edison to operate a reservoir in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.The extra money would be a drip in the country’s deep financial hole, but it would drive up the city’s municipal power costs and reverberate through the water bills of 2.5 million Bay Area residents.The fee was established by the Raker Act, which was supported by influential San Francisco civic leaders but opposed by early environmentalists. It permitted San Francisco to build O’Shaughnessy Dam and lock in cheap hydroelectricity and water supplies.'"
"'12-01-06,'0','“Time and time again, San Francisco has demonstrated that when redevelopment is used to its fullest potential, it can deliver results,” Mr. Lee said on Dec. 29, citing the South of Market redevelopment projects Yerba Buena Gardens and Mission Bay as examples of successes.But critics of the redevelopment agencies said they were little more than slush funds for city officials to spend on other projects or to dole out to political allies and friends. And the recent audit of the Fillmore redevelopment area by the city’s controller’s office concluded that there was virtually no oversight of the money.Tiffany Bohee, the redevelopment agency’s executive director since October, said new systems have been created to monitor spending and contract performance. “You’re talking about righting historic wrongs,” she said of the Fillmore project. “Sometimes it works. Sometimes it doesn’t. But that was before my time.”Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of San Francisco Planning and Urban Development, a nonprofit research firm, said redevelopment agencies had used many strategies. “Some of them worked, and some of them didn’t,” he said. “The same agency that made Mission Bay happen also gave out money to community groups in other areas without as much to show for that.”The San Francisco Redevelopment Agency was created in 1948 to modernize parts of the city. The first and most famous of those efforts involved razing, and in some cases moving, hundreds of Fillmore-area Victorian row houses occupied by black families, and eliminating dozens of black-owned businesses just west of downtown San Francisco. The Fillmore Street jazz scene, which thrived in the 1940s, faded away.Critics said the redevelopment agency’s Fillmore jazz district plan, established in 1995, was an attempt to make amends for those urban renewal efforts. They said that by the time the redevelopment program was closed in 2009, the agency had squandered millions of dollars in grants, loans, contracts and subcontracts, leaving behind a few high-rise condominium buildings, a neighborhood of empty storefronts and lingering resentments.“This was the agency’s attempt to do penance for its past sins,” said Barbara Meskunas, who from 2005 to 2009 served on the Western Addition redevelopment area’s project area committee.London Breed, who served on the Redevelopment Agency Commission from 2005 to 2011, said the agency’s Fillmore project was hampered by unrealistic expectations. “The goal was to try to reinvent a district that was long gone, to try to artificially create something,” she said. “In the case of the Fillmore, we’ve not succeeded.”Fred Blackwell, executive director of the redevelopment agency from 2007 to 2011, said that some very good things had come out of the redevelopment. “But none of them atones for degradation of community that happened in the late ’60s or early ’70s,” he said. “And frankly, I don’t think there was any way for the redevelopment agency to atone for that decades later.”In all, the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency listed 30 contracts and programs totaling $57.4 million that were aimed at reviving the jazz entertainment district. The agency handed out $5.8 million to finance the Fillmore Jazz District revolving loan program and $22.5 million for an apartment building.Yoshi’s, a jazz club in Oakland, received a $4.4 million loan in 2007 to open a branch on Fillmore Street. In 2008 the club received $2.8 million more. The Fillmore Street business has struggled, in part because of a lack of demand for jazz in that location, said Kaz Kajimura, the club’s founder. To stay afloat, the club has branched out to R&B and rap.“Jazz was getting harder and harder to make the business out of,” Mr. Kajimura said, adding that the Fillmore club did not become profitable during a “normal month” until November 2011. (He said that a previous December had been profitable because of holiday parties and banquets.)In 2005, the redevelopment agency lent $1.7 million to the restaurant 1300 on Fillmore Street. In 2007, the agency lent the restaurant $350,000 more, and in May 2008, $852,000 more. In October 2008 the restaurant’s owners said they needed another $1 million to stay in business, according to city records. The agency lent them $100,000, and 1300 is still in business.Ross Mirkarimi, a former city supervisor who asked for the controller’s audit, said many of the agency’s grants had not been large enough to be effective. “It was sort of pocket money” instead, said Mr. Mirkarimi, whose district included the Fillmore neighborhood.Of all the projects in the Fillmore redevelopment area, the relocation of Powell’s Place seemed to generate the most initial enthusiasm. In 2005, after three decades in business, Mr. Powell said, the redevelopment commission approached him.“They came and said, ‘We can introduce you to the manager of the Fillmore Center; they have some buildings, property up there,” he said. “We would like to see you go there because of the history of the restaurant. We want to make it a Jazz Heritage Center and return Afro-American businesses into the area. And I was the anchor to go in there and get other businesses in.”In addition to a $360,000 loan, he mortgaged his house and a property in Oakland to pay for improvements to the Fillmore property. But the restaurant remained closed for six months while Mr. Powell waited for various permits, although he continued to owe lease payments. By the time he opened he was $60,000 in arrears on loan payments.In November 2007 the restaurant closed. The controller’s audit said the redevelopment agency never tried to collect the outstanding $360,000 loan.'"
"'12-01-06,'0','BEIRUT, Lebanon — The Syrian government said Thursday that it had released more than 500 prisoners who were not involved in “terrorist” acts. A human rights group said, meanwhile, that it had compiled evidence that thousands of other detainees were languishing in government prisons and secret detention centers where, the group said, torture was routine.The group, Avaaz, also said that its researchers had gathered the names of at least 617 people who had died under torture in government installations since the beginning of the uprising against Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad.The group’s estimate of the number of the detainees — 37,000 — was more than double the tally provided by the Local Coordination Committees, another activist group, which said Thursday that it had documented the cases of more than 16,000 detainees. With journalists rarely allowed to travel around Syria freely since the unrest started, it was impossible to confirm either report.Arab League observers currently in Syria are supposed to monitor promises by the government to release political prisoners. The observers, however, are not allowed to visit military sites, where rights groups believe that the government has transferred hundreds of detainees to hide them from the observers.The Syrian state news agency said Thursday that the government had released almost 4,000 prisoners since Nov. 5, “all of whom were not involved in the shedding of Syrian blood.”'"
"'12-01-06,'0','“Barack Obama doesn’t need any lectures from Mitt Romney on merit and making your own way in life,”  Mr. Axelrod said.To some conservatives, the Romney argument only highlights what they see as a lack of commitment from him to translate his words into specific actions to reverse the growth of government and expand markets and individual liberties.“His proposals tend to be fairly incremental,” said William Kristol, the former Republican White House aide who is now editor of The Weekly Standard. “But how does that fit with such a grand statement of the differences between the two parties?”“You hear him say things that make you think: They must have focus-grouped this and decided the phrases sound good,” he added.Citing the attack former Vice President Walter F. Mondale once leveled against a Democratic presidential rival, Gary Hart, Mr. Kristol concluded, “In a weird way, when you look at the Romney campaign you ask, ‘Where’s the beef?’ ”Mr. Romney’s advisers say he has pondered the larger issues about the direction of American society since he served as a Mormon missionary in France amid student riots in the ’60s. And they insist there is more beef than he receives credit for in his proposals to rein in spending, reduce regulations and convert Medicare from an open-ended program with defined benefits to one that defines and limits the federal government’s contribution.“He has put together the boldest, most credible plan of anyone out there,” said Stuart Stevens, a top Romney campaign strategist.Critics on the right see something different: a tinkerer more committed to avoiding political risk than to fundamental changes in the role of government. Mr. Romney opposes moving Social Security, the landmark entitlement program, toward a system of private accounts. He does not support repeal of Medicare’s prescription drug benefit, the substantial new entitlement enacted under President George W. Bush.Nor has Mr. Romney joined flat-tax advocates in proposing to scrap the longstanding American principle of progressive income taxation, which levies higher rates on those with higher incomes and thus redistributes wealth from the rich to the middle class and the poor.As governor of Massachusetts, he embraced the state’s obligation to increase minority hiring.“If you go program by program, the differences between Obama and Romney are more ones of degree,” said Michael D. Tanner, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute. “He’s a manager. He wants to manage the status quo, not blow it up. The status quo is redistributionist.”Here in New Hampshire and elsewhere on the 2012 primary trail, Mr. Romney’s rivals offer similar arguments. The former House speaker Newt Gingrich scorns Mr. Romney as a “timid Massachusetts moderate,” criticizing his plan to eliminate capital gains taxes only for Americans making under $200,000 a year.Former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who surged from behind to a virtual tie with Mr. Romney in the Iowa caucuses, highlights his role in helping end the federal welfare entitlement in 1996. Opposing him, he says, were the sorts of Republicans who behave like “cheap Democrats” rather than conservative reformers.Mr. Santorum proposes to extend that achievement by converting all means-tested federal entitlement programs, including food stamps and housing subsidies, into block grants to states. Mr. Romney would convert the federal role in Medicaid, the health program for the poor and the disabled, into block grants, but has no comparable plan for all other federal entitlements.Advisers to Mr. Obama, gearing up for a general election battle, criticize Mr. Romney’s formulation from different directions. The largest entitlement expansion the president has engineered, a national health care plan requiring Americans to obtain health coverage and offering subsidies who those who cannot afford it, closely resembles the expansion of coverage Mr. Romney ushered in for Massachusetts.Mr. Romney’s criticism of Mr. Obama taps a vein of conservative anger over the administration’s efforts to raise taxes on the rich, in part to help finance government assistance to middle- and lower-income Americans through tax cuts and education aid. Instead of seeking “equal outcomes,” as Mr. Romney asserts, administration aides call their goal expanding opportunities so more people can succeed.“Obama’s view is that people should have a fair shot,” Mr. Axelrod said.Partisan arguments aside, the American economy, government and society have moved broadly in the direction Mr. Romney advocates for decades by relying on market forces.Nicholas Lemann, whose book on SAT testing was subtitled “The Secret History of the American Meritocracy,” praised Mr. Romney’s advocacy of needed curbs on entitlement spending. But he dismissed the suggestion of a conflict between rewarding merit and cushioning market outcomes, calling both hallmarks of modern societies.Mr. Lemann, dean of Columbia Journalism School, said: “Historically, they go together.”'"

"'12-01-06,'0','On Bizarro World, a planet in Superman’s universe, people do everything backward and ineptly. If this anti-Earth had a filmmaker, that person would probably be a lot like George Kuchar (1942-2011), the pioneering underground filmmaker who dedicated his life to upending the values of conventional cinema.Long before video-making technology and Internet distribution became available to the masses, Mr. Kuchar and his frequent collaborator and twin, Mike Kuchar, lived out a promise that today is widely taken for granted: You do not have to possess the resources of a Steven Spielberg to create transporting movies. “George Kuchar: Pagan Rhapsodies,” an exhibition at MoMA PS1, proves this beyond a reasonable doubt.During his extraordinarily prolific five-decade career, Mr. Kuchar (pronounced KOO-char) stayed true to a style of demented, do-it-yourself movie production whose amateur acting, fractured narratives, ludicrous sets, preposterous dialogue, murky sound and all-around squalor expressed a core sensibility of cinematic sophistication, psychological acuity and moral urgency. He was a national treasure, and he is an artist who truly deserves his spot on the list for the Whitney Biennial opening in March.One of the 32 films and videos in the PS1 show, organized by its chief curator, Peter Eleey, is “Hold Me While I’m Naked” (1966), Mr. Kuchar’s most critically admired work. (A Village Voice critic’s poll ranked it No. 52 in a list of the best 100 films of the 20th century.) This 17-minute movie about the making of a movie focuses on a tortured, high-minded yet sleazily abject auteur who has reached a point of crisis in the creation of his latest opus. It stars George Kuchar himself, a tall, lumpy Mr. Potato Head of a guy in thick black-rimmed glasses who speaks in a nasal, heavily Bronx-accented voice.The trouble is that his leading lady, played by the lovely and pneumatic Donna Kerness — an erstwhile high school classmate of Mr. Kuchar’s in real life — is quitting. She is fed up with having to appear naked in all his films. It begins with Mr. Kuchar shouting directions at Ms. Kerness as she frantically flees from an unseen menace. Later, while shooting a love-making episode through a stained-glass window, the director asks her to remove her bra, which he thinks detracts from the artistic quality of the scene. (Knowing that Mr. Kuchar was unabashedly gay adds another layer to his polymorphous perversity.)'"
"'12-01-06,'0','But Mr. Diekmann said in an open letter published on Thursday that Mr. Wulff had been less than forthcoming.“In order to prevent misunderstandings regarding the content and motive of your phone call, we view it as necessary to publish a transcript of your message,” Mr. Diekmann wrote. He asked Mr. Wulff for permission to do so, in keeping with German laws regarding the privacy of personal communications.In his own open letter, Mr. Wulff said no. “The words that were spoken in an exceptionally emotional situation were intended for you and no one else,” he wrote. “I apologized to you shortly afterwards. You accepted this apology. That put an end to the dispute between us, and I believe that it should remain so.”Benno H. Pöppelmann, a legal expert at the German Association of Journalists, told Reuters that there was a strong argument against considering Mr. Wulff’s phone message to be private, meaning that Bild could release the transcript without his permission.The dispute highlights the power that Bild wields in the German political landscape. While he was governor, Mr. Wulff managed to maintain positive relations with Bild despite a divorce and remarriage to a younger woman, the kind of news that tabloid newspapers like Bild often sink their teeth into. Bild’s mixture of hard political reporting, society news and sex is read by about three million people daily.Other German politicians have been brought down by news media coverage in recent years. A barrage of reports claiming that Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg had plagiarized more than half of his doctoral thesis led him to resign as defense minister in 2011, and Mr. Wulff’s predecessor, Horst Köhler, stepped down in 2010 after media criticism of remarks he made about Afghanistan.Chancellor Angela Merkel has remained largely removed from the scandal surrounding Mr. Wulff, whom she picked to run for the largely ceremonial presidency in 2010. Both are Christian Democrats. If Mr. Wulff resigns, Ms. Merkel will face criticism for choosing him and what could be a protracted and divisive search for a successor.Members of her governing coalition sought to return to business as usual on Thursday, apparently satisfied with Mr. Wulff’s responses in the 21-minute broadcast interview. The opposition, however, was not.“The Wulff affair is not over yet,” said Thomas Oppermann, parliamentary spokesman for the largest opposition party, the Social Democrats. “Did President Wulff want to prevent the critical report or delay it? Did he accept unjustified advantages or not? Did he violate his duties as governor? These questions have not been fully cleared up.”'"
"'12-01-06,'0','An information technology worker at Bank Sarasin faces a criminal investigation for allegedly giving the information to the Swiss People’s Party, whose most visible leader, Christoph Blocher, has been a bitter critic of Mr. Hildebrand.Appearing on a Swiss television program Thursday, Mr. Blocher confirmed that he had passed on information about the transactions and called Mr. Hildebrand “no longer tolerable.”But Mr. Hildebrand also faces a storm of criticism across the political spectrum, with members of Parliament and commentators questioning whether he has damaged the credibility of the Swiss National Bank and Switzerland’s image abroad. Mr. Hildebrand is vice president of the Financial Stability Board, a group of central bankers and regulators that plays a leading role in recommending bank regulations to the leaders of the Group of 20 nations.Mr. Hildebrand vowed to “continue to apply all of my energy to my job as president” of the Swiss central bank.During the news conference, Mr. Hildebrand denied a key assertion by Weltwoche, a right-leaning Swiss magazine that first reported many details of the accusations. The publication said it had evidence that Mr. Hildebrand, and not his wife, had personally made a large investment in dollars just days before the Swiss National Bank stepped up its intervention in currency markets. The central bank was then engaged in an intense effort to stem the rise of the franc and protect Swiss exporters.Mr. Hildebrand said that his wife, Kashya Hildebrand, had legal power to use the account and bought dollars because she considered them very cheap. He described her as an economist and “strong personality” who takes a keen interest in finance.When he learned of the transaction the next morning, Mr. Hildebrand said, he immediately called his adviser at Bank Sarasin and told him not to make any more trades without his approval, and reported the transaction to S.N.B. compliance officials.Mr. Hildebrand said he now regretted that he did not undo the transaction. Auditors from PricewaterhouseCoopers, hired by the council that oversees the Swiss National Bank, agreed with Mr. Hildebrand’s version of events.But Mr. Hildebrand also said the case showed the need for more disclosure by top officials in the central bank. In the future, he said, he and other members of the S.N.B. directorate should make public all transactions worth more than 20,000 Swiss francs, or $21,000, and get clearance from the bank’s compliance department.Mr. Hildebrand said he had donated 75,000 francs to an organization that promotes preservation of Swiss mountain regions. That is the sum that Weltwoche, the magazine, said that Mr. Hildebrand earned on the trades.But it is unclear how much profit Mr. Hildebrand actually made from the trades.In August, Mrs. Hildebrand spent 400,000 francs to buy $504,000, the auditors said, two days before the S.N.B. stepped up its intervention in currency markets.In October, Mr. Hildebrand sold about the same amount of dollars at a more favorable exchange rate, earning about 64,000 francs.But in March, after the sale of a vacation home, Mr. Hildebrand had purchased nearly $1.2 million when the exchange rate was much less favorable. So at least on paper that investment was a money loser.Any profit would not be a large sum for the Hildebrands, whose personal wealth was evident Thursday in the size of their real estate assets. One reason that Mr. Hildebrand bought dollars in March, he said, was that the family’s Alpine vacation home had just sold for 3.3 million francs and he wanted to diversify his currency holdings.The accusations put huge political pressure on Mr. Hildebrand, but it appears unlikely that he will face criminal charges. Switzerland’s insider trading law does not apply to currency transactions, said Andreas Brunner, head of a prosecutor’s unit in Zurich that focuses on economic crimes.Mr. Brunner’s office said Thursday that it would pursue a criminal investigation of a 39-year-old former employee of Bank Sarasin for possible violations of the country’s bank secrecy law. The man, who was not identified, is suspected of leaking records of Mr. Hildebrand’s currency transactions.The employee was able to call up Mr. Hildebrand’s records on a bank computer but not print them out. Mr. Hildebrand asserted that the employee used a mobile phone or digital camera to photograph the computer screen.Bank Sarasin said Tuesday that it had fired the employee, who had turned himself in to the police in Zurich. The charges carry a maximum sentence of three years in prison.'"
"'12-01-06,'0','BRUSSELS — The European Commission said on Thursday that airlines that did not follow a new European law requiring them to account for their emissions of greenhouse gases could face being banned from European airports.The warning was the latest stage in an escalating war of words between the European Union and countries like China, which have expressed fierce opposition to a law that represents the European Union’s boldest move to date to protect the climate.The initiative went into effect at the start of the year and involves folding aviation into the European Union’s six-year-old Emissions Trading System, in which polluters can buy and sell a limited quantity of permits, each representing a ton of carbon dioxide.A European ban on noncompliant airlines would be a measure of “very last resort” applicable only in cases of “continued noncompliance,” Isaac Valero-Ladron, the commission’s spokesman for climate action, said on Thursday at a news conference in Brussels.Mr. Valero-Ladron said airlines would initially face fines by national authorities of 100 euros ($130) for each ton of carbon dioxide that they failed to account for under the permit system.'"
"'12-01-06,'0','JERUSALEM — Israel, which recently traded 1,027 Palestinian prisoners for one soldier held by Hamas, is planning on establishing rules that would prevent it from making such a lopsided exchange in the future, Defense Minister Ehud Barak said on Thursday.Interviewed on Israel Radio, Mr. Barak was asked about a classified report submitted to him on guidelines for handling negotiations regarding abducted soldiers. The interviewer asked whether the rules were expected to be made stricter so it would “no longer be 1,000 terrorists for one soldier.”“I believe that will be the conclusion,” Mr. Barak said. “There is no choice. We have to change the rules fundamentally to protect the state’s overall interests.” He said an important part of the report’s conclusions were on “how to approach the negotiations, in what framework, with what rules, and I think it’s clear that the rules will be a lot stricter.”The exchange was made for the freedom of Gilad Shalit, an Israeli sergeant who was captured by Hamas in a cross-border raid and held for more than five years in a case that wrenched Israelis.In a deal brokered by Egypt last fall, Israel agreed to a two-part prisoner release. In the first, in October, it freed 477 prisoners, a majority of whom had been convicted of manslaughter, attempted murder or intentionally causing death. The prisoners included the founders of Hamas’s armed wing and militants who kidnapped and killed Israeli soldiers and civilians; a mastermind of the 2001 bombing of a Jerusalem pizzeria that killed 15 people; and a woman who lured a lovesick Israeli teenager to a Palestinian city and had him murdered.'"
"'12-01-06,'0','With too much supply and limited demand from consumers, “there’s not enough room for all the retailers of old,” he said. The new year would probably bring “closing of stores and, I think, closing of retailers,” he said, adding, “It’s a more dire situation than many had anticipated.”Chains including Target, Kohl’s and J. C. Penney lowered their fourth-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, saying they had to discount items to entice shoppers in December.Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, said he believed those companies were affected by the good performance at Macy’s. Same-store sales at the company were up 6.2 percent, above analysts’ expectations, and the company said Thursday that both same-store sales and profit for the quarter should be higher than expected. Macy’s now forecasts fourth-quarter profit to be $1.55 to $1.60 a share, up from $1.52 to $1.57 a share.Walmart, the nation’s biggest retailer, does not report monthly same-store sales. During the recession, it benefited from a trading-down effect — people who shopped at Target would switch to Walmart — but analysts said they did not believe that explained the problems at Target, Kohl’s and J. C. Penney now. “Keep in mind, sales were O.K.,” Mr. Lejuez said; the problem was profits.“What’s more concerning is, this is December, and people are in the mall,” he said. “If you have to be this promotional to drive sales when you have captive traffic in the mall, what happens in January and February?”Apparel stores, which were slashing prices as the month went on, fared the best as a sector, with sales at stores open at least a year increasing 7.2 percent.Those figures exclude the Gap Inc. chains, which include Old Navy and Banana Republic, where same-store sales declined 4 percent. The Gap, Wet Seal, Cato, Bon-Ton and Fred’s reported the worst same-store sales.Target and Kohl’s, which both do huge promotions around the holidays, came in below analyst estimates, and both reduced their fourth-quarter profit expectations on Thursday.Target’s same-store sales were up 1.6 percent, versus expectations of a 3.1 percent increase. Target said in a statement that electronics, movies, music and books were particularly weak performers. It reduced its fourth-quarter profit expectations to $1.35 to $1.43 a share; it had earlier estimated $1.43 to $1.53 a share.Kohl’s same-store sales declined 0.1 percent, while analysts had expected a gain of 2.2 percent. Kohl’s said in a release that low sales of cold-weather gear were partly to blame. It lowered its fourth-quarter profit expectations to $1.70 to $1.73 per share, from $1.93 to $2.04 a share.J. C. Penney also lowered its fourth-quarter estimate, saying it expected to earn 65 to 70 cents a share instead of the $1.05 to $1.15 it had previously expected.J. C. Penney said its average price of an item fell for the month, though transactions were up. There was a “higher level of markdown activity caused by overall softer sales trends,” Angelika Torres, a spokeswoman for the retailer, said in prepared remarks.John D. Morris, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients that promotional activity at apparel stores was running above the level for December 2010. “Promotions were aggressive throughout the month, and particularly in the 10 days before Christmas,” he said.American Eagle Outfitters said in a release that in the last two weeks of December, “the company made a strategic decision to take a more aggressive promotional stance. While affecting margins, the decision enabled the company to generate strong unit sales.” Same-store sales for November and December together increased 12 percent, it said, although same-store sales slowed significantly in December. (Because it does not regularly report monthly sales, American Eagle is not included in the Thomson Reuters tally.)And that hurt profit: American Eagle, too, lowered its fourth-quarter earnings expectations, to 33 to 35 cents per share, down from 40 to 44 cents.The top five performers all beat analyst estimates by at least 3 percentage points. Those were Nordstrom, the teenage apparel stores Zumiez and the Buckle and the large discounters Ross and TJX.'"
"'12-01-06,'0','JERUSALEM — Ehud Olmert, who resigned as prime minister of Israel in 2008 amid corruption charges, was indicted Thursday and charged with taking bribes in the construction of a huge residential complex while he was the mayor of Jerusalem.Mr. Olmert, who is already on trial for three unrelated counts of fraud and breach of trust from before his tenure as prime minister, has denied all wrongdoing. In the newest — and by far the most serious — indictment, he is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to smooth the way for construction of the Holyland, an enormous hulk of a residential complex in southwestern Jerusalem.When the case was first made public nearly two years ago, the presiding judge called it “one of the worst corruption affairs in Israeli history.”The Holyland is built on a ridge with interlocking apartment buildings and one outsize tower that dominates the landscape for miles and is widely considered an eyesore. Jerusalem residents commonly call it “the monster.”Millions of dollars in bribes are thought to have been paid to allow the project to go up in a hurry and to grow to more than 12 times the height granted in the original permits. Mr. Olmert was the mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003 and then was the government minister with oversight over the Israel Lands Authority.'"

"'12-01-07,'0','When turnarounds succeed, companies come out leaner and arguably healthier. CRG, for instance, was the chief restructuring officer for Pilgrim’s Pride Corporation, one of the world’s largest chicken producers. Processing plants were closed, workers laid off and finances restructured, allowing Pilgrim’s Pride to emerge from bankruptcy protection in less than 13 months.“CRG helped guide us through a very difficult financial time,” said Don Jackson, the former chief executive officer of Pilgrim’s Pride, who now has the same title with JBS USA, majority owner of Pilgrim’s. “The result: New ownership. New financing. New management. A new approach.”In 2010, a bankruptcy court judge in Texas appointed William Snyder, a managing partner of CRG, as the chief restructuring officer of the Texas Rangers baseball team. Essentially, his job involved auctioning the team, which was ultimately sold to a group led by Nolan Ryan and Chuck Greenberg for $590 million. To sell the club, Snyder had the difficult task of getting the team’s owner, Tom Hicks, and his lenders to agree on what was being sold and who would get how much from the sale.Only 10 percent of CRG’s work, however, took place in bankruptcy court last year, according to a company spokeswoman. More often, she said, CRG advises healthy companies on how to improve their financial performance, sometimes by cutting costs and other times by finding new ways to do things.Later on Friday, the Mets again sent out a statement of sorts on Twitter, still sensitive to the public perception of CRG’s hiring. It repeated that “CRG isn’t providing bankruptcy services” and that CRG had no role in the team’s efforts to line up $200 million in cash by selling 10 or more minority shares in the team to private investors.It is unclear what CRG can do for the Mets that they have not already done on their own. The team, which lost an estimated $70 million last year, has already cut its payroll by trading Carlos Beltran, Francisco Rodriguez and other players with expensive contracts and by declining to re-sign free agents like Jose Reyes, who joined the Miami Marlins.Last month, the Mets said they were eliminating their minor league team in the Class A Gulf Coast League, a move that baseball executives with other teams say will save $750,000 to $800,000. In November, the Mets laid off nearly 10 percent of their 180 front-office employees, not the kind of step teams take in good times.The Mets still have not repaid a $25 million loan to Major League Baseball. They must also make bond payments worth more than $40 million a year.To assuage their lenders, who are owed hundreds of millions of dollars, the Mets have been trying to sell a dozen $20 million stakes in the team for months. The club reportedly has commitments from seven buyers.The Mets, whose deadline to repay some of their loans is approaching, may be worried about whether they can close all or some of the deals they have in place with prospective minority investors.As if those problems weren’t enough, Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz, the team’s owners, have been fighting a long and expensive battle with the trustee representing the victims of the Bernard L. Madoff fraud. If a settlement is not reached with the trustee, who is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars, a trial will begin in mid-March.Given the weight of these problems, it is not unreasonable for Wilpon and Katz to at least explore ways to restructure their team’s balance sheet, according to experts in sports finance. That includes, they say, considering whether to enter bankruptcy proceedings, or perhaps how to avoid that process.“There are so many balls in the air, it becomes clear that Wilpon would want to sit down with bankruptcy specialists,” said Andrew Zimbalist, who teaches sports economics at Smith College. “It’s complicated. It’s not simply shuttering a plant.”'"
"'12-01-07,'0','Mickelson is among a dozen invitees who will not ring in the new season here. Another is Lucas Glover, who came, paddle-boarded and withdrew after spraining his right knee during a fall in the Pacific Ocean. Glover and three other players who could not make the trip because of injuries — Fredrik Jacobson, Dustin Johnson and Brandt Snedeker — will receive last-place checks of $59,750, which should ease their recoveries.Something’s wrong when there is more star power in the broadcasting booth than on the golf course. Nick Faldo and Johnny Miller, who are working for Golf Channel, have eight major titles between them, six more than this week’s field.The PGA Tour is hardly the only sports organization that puts on an all-star event and then has to beg or bribe the honored guests to show up. Last year’s All-Star Game in baseball was missing Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez and Mariano Rivera, and this year’s Pro Bowl will surely lose a few superstars whose teams advance deep into the postseason.The athletes’ bodies are their temples, and even houses of worship occasionally lock their doors and turn off the lights. We get that. If the golfers did not run themselves ragged chasing paydays all over the globe, maybe they would be rested enough to give the gift of a star-studded field to the people who pay to watch them play and buy the products sold by the companies that underwrite the purses — like the $5.6 million the golfers are playing for this week.“I understand the frustration that a lot of guys don’t come here,” Stricker said, adding: “The schedule is so long and demanding at some times, especially toward the end of the year, that it’s just hard to play them all.”If there is a creative solution, Stricker is having a hard time visualizing it.“I don’t know if there’s anything that can be done,” he said. “Put it at the end of the year? I don’t know. You know, I don’t know if that would work, either. A lot of guys feel like it’s a special place to start the year when you do win and come here.”Tournament organizers decided this year to push the start of the 72-hole stroke-play event back a day, to Friday, so the finish would not bump up against the N.F.L. playoff games on Sunday. Instead, the final round on Monday will serve as the appetizer before the sports fan’s main course: the Bowl Championship Series title game between L.S.U. and Alabama.It was a good idea. Here’s a better one. Move back the start of the tour to mid-January so the European golfers — a group that includes the world’s four top-ranked players in Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Rory McIlroy and Martin Kaymer — have ample time to recover from their season, which ends in December.And to make it easier for the biggest stars to pay their debt to the sponsors and fans and collect their European Tour appearance fees, too, charter a private jet to whisk them to the Abu Dhabi tournament in late January.The schedule would have to be reshuffled and a couple of tournaments would be lost. Such is the cost of golf’s global reach. Much has been made of the lack of playing opportunities on the L.P.G.A. Tour, where a shrunken schedule keeps fans from seeing all the best players compete in the United States until mid-March in Arizona. The PGA Tour has an embarrassment of playing opportunities but finds itself in essentially the same problematic place.The first time that fans in the United States will see the best men’s players compete is the last week in February at the World Golf Championships match-play event in Arizona. In the meantime, the spotlight is on the superstars of tomorrow. Bill Haas, 29, one of nine players in the Tournament of Champions field under the age of 30, sounded positively thrilled to be here, perhaps because he has been well-schooled by his father, Jay, who played on the tour before the era of irrationally exuberant purses.“I know I would never miss it,” the younger Haas said, adding, “Maybe they play so much, certain guys win so many times, it’s no big deal not to be here.”'"
"'12-01-07,'0','Now that the most polarized and paralyzed Congress in memory has managed to kill one of its most resilient boondoggles — the three-decade-old, multibillion-dollar subsidy for corn ethanol — we hope it has not exhausted its resolve and will take a hatchet to other harmful energy subsidies, chiefly those it gives to fossil fuels.The ethanol subsidy was allowed to expire last Saturday, a death blow that was all the more remarkable coming just a few days before the Republican caucuses in the cornfields of , where the subsidy has long been seen as untouchable.The 45-cent-per-gallon for companies to blend ethanol into gasoline cost taxpayers $5 billion to $6 billion a year, deepening the budget deficit. It boosted corn prices and increased generally by encouraging farmers to replace other crops with corn. Its environmental virtues were less than advertised. Billed as a lower-carbon replacement for fossil fuels, corn ethanol generated more carbon dioxide than gasoline after taking into account the emissions caused when new land was cleared to replace the food lost to fuel production.Several factors conspired to kill the tax break (as well as an exorbitant tariff on imports aimed at keeping cheaper Brazilian ethanol out). Conservatives did not like the subsidy’s price tag and liberals saw it as a form of corporate welfare. It was also unnecessary and redundant. Corn ethanol is now commercially viable without the subsidy and is further supported by a Congressional mandate requiring refiners to blend up to 15 billion gallons a year.Congress should now focus on the oil industry, which has long enjoyed a web of arcane and unnecessary tax breaks — deductions for well depletion and intangible drilling costs. They are unique to the industry and, when combined with other subsidies, cost roughly $4 billion a year.has tried twice to kill these subsidies, without success. We hope he tries again in his coming Budget Message. The Congressional Research Service says that ending the subsidies would have no effect on gas prices for consumers and only a trivial effect on industry profits, which have been at record highs.'"
"'12-01-07,'0','Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey denied Friday that he was blocking an Obama administration nominee to a federal judgeship because of a grudge against her longtime companion, who led a corruption investigation of the senator during his tough election fight of 2006.Instead, Mr. Menendez said, he has “substantive” concerns about her knowledge of constitutional issues.Mr. Menendez is the first Democrat to hold up one of the Obama administration’s judicial nominees. The delay comes at a time when the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, has complained about the high number of vacancies on the federal bench — a tenth of judgeships are unfilled — and blamed Republican obstruction.On Friday, Mr. Menendez came under new pressure from groups on the left, after news outlets reported that he was blocking a Judiciary Committee hearing for Patty Shwartz, a federal magistrate judge in Newark whom President Obama has nominated to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Judge Shwartz was called “unanimously well qualified” in the American Bar Association’s review of her nomination.Lawyers and judges in New Jersey say Judge Shwartz is widely liked and respected. They had speculated that Mr. Menendez was blocking her nomination because her companion of more than two decades, James Nobile, was in charge of the public corruption unit at the United States attorney’s office for New Jersey when it issued a subpoena against Mr. Menendez in 2006. The investigation, into Mr. Menendez’s relationship with a nonprofit group, came in the midst of his campaign for his first full term in the Senate.'"
"'12-01-07,'0','A suggestion like this inevitably invites its opposite. This is perhaps especially true when it’s offered to a room dominated by opinionated New York artists, as it was on Thursday night when the San Francisco choreographer Laura Arrington introduced the New York premiere of “Hot Wings” to kick off performances at the American Realness festival.Ms. Arrington spoke these words as she invited her audience to lie on the stage of the Abrons Arts Center’s Experimental Theater, which she darkened while leading the room through yogalike breathing exercises, backed by the 1980s pop song “Up Where We Belong.”Things did not improve from here.Program notes bill the piece as aiming “directly at the contemporary fabricated female in a critique that uncovers a deeper feminine truth.” But this critique, such as it was, bore an awfully strong resemblance to the cheap and easy fabrications it was supposedly interrogating. Women (and one drag queen) in leotards and heels, acting hysterical, animalistic, coy and abusive, tossing their long locks and speaking in baby voices: really, world, is this still where we’re at?Of course, in the right hands these behaviors can be used to question or subvert stereotypes. Here, as performed by Atosa Babaoff, Rachael Dichter, Mica Sigourney and Liz Tenuto (who are credited as Ms. Arrington’s collaborators) they came off, at best, as unexamined performance clichés.“Hot Wings” didn’t restrict its clichés to gender representations. As the show cycled through dance-theater vignettes, we got nostalgic musical anthems (Tori Amos featured prominently); fun with microphones, heavy breathing and body parts as percussive instruments; fake laughing; full frontal nudity and skits with quirky animal props.In this piece, and in too much art floating around these days, the idea seemed to be that, as smart cultural consumers, viewers can make of such vapid concoctions a thoughtful commentary on some aspect of our contemporary society. And, yes, audiences shouldn’t be passive receivers. But there is little impetus to work hard when it seems that the people you’re watching haven’t worked nearly hard enough.'"
"'12-01-07,'0','When Mahler’s 80-minute Ninth Symphony is presented as the only work on an orchestra program, most people in the audience feel they have gotten their money’s worth. Especially if the performance of this turbulent and, by the end, sublimely moving symphony is as well played and resolute as the one Alan Gilbert conducted with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall.But Mr. Gilbert opened the program with the New York premiere of Thomas Adès’s “Polaris: Voyage for Orchestra.” And this restless 14-minute piece proved a fascinating teaser for the Mahler.The premiere of “Polaris” took place last January, when Michael Tilson Thomas conducted the New World Symphony in a program to inaugurate the New World Center in Miami Beach. It was conceived for performance with video by the filmmaker and video artist Tal Rosner. In Miami Beach, the visual elements showed images of rocky cliffs, sandy beaches and two worried women looking out to sea.“Polaris,” which explores themes of navigation and separation, can be performed without the videos, as Mr. Gilbert chose to do. The title refers to the North Star, or Pole Star, around which other stars seem to circle. Running through the score, like a loosely connecting thread, is an elusive melodic line that is presented in a series of canons with various instruments, including brass players stationed around the hall in the upper balconies.What came through in this hearing of the piece, played with vibrant colors and urgency, is the backdrop for the entwining melodic lines, which rustle along in churning, spiraling figures: a blur of busyness.At the opening of the slow first movement of Mahler’s Ninth, halting motifs and hesitant riffs coalesce into a multitextured, gentle accompaniment for a yearning theme in the strings. Mahler’s way of building a sonic texture from restless little figures is very much what Mr. Adès does in “Polaris.” This seemed the point Mr. Gilbert wanted to make. It worked for me.'"
"'12-01-07,'0','In the Justice Department settlement, Wachovia said it “admits, acknowledges and accepts responsibility for” manipulating the bidding process in the sale of on -exempt to institutional investors like cities, hospitals and pension plans over a six-year period ending in 2004.But in fashioning a settlement based on the same facts with the S.E.C, Wachovia agreed to settle the charges “without admitting or denying the allegations.” Wachovia is now part of .Under the new policy, a civil settlement will cite the admission of conduct or conviction in the corresponding criminal case, Mr. Khuzami said. But the S.E.C.’s enforcement staff will have discretion whether to use relevant facts from the criminal case in its own court documents for the civil case.Last year, the S.E.C. encountered the conflict between simultaneous admission and nonadmission of facts in three other cases involving bid-rigging by large Wall Street firms. S.E.C. officials declined to comment on whether additional cases could result from the Wall Street bid-rigging.Mr. Khuzami said the policy change had been under consideration since last spring and had been discussed with commissioners “over the last several months.”The S.E.C. has defended the practice of allowing companies to avoid admitting or denying charges, saying that by settling with companies, it saves the commission the far greater expense — and potential risk — of fighting them in court. The agency says it is usually able to get as much money from a settlement as it could win in a protracted legal case, with money being returned to investors more quickly.In drafting a settlement of securities fraud charges, companies frequently seek the “neither admit nor deny” language for fear that their acknowledgment of the conduct could be used against them in shareholder lawsuits seeking damages. But legal experts say that safe harbor does not apply when a company has admitted facts in a criminal case.Securities law experts differed over the practical importance of the change, with some saying it is a notable acknowledgment by the agency of flaws in its system, and others suggesting that it will not affect most S.E.C. cases, which involve only civil charges. Since the S.E.C. is not empowered to bring criminal cases it refers potential criminal cases to the Justice Department.“It’s an important development because it is a change of policy,” said James D. Cox, a professor at Duke Law School and co-author of a securities regulation textbook. “It’s a small step forward in addressing the concerns” that a federal judge recently voiced about the S.E.C.’s broader settlement policy.But David S. Ruder, an emeritus professor at Northwestern School of Law and a former S.E.C. chairman, said the change was merely “a tweaking” of policy that would not significantly reduce the commission’s reliance on the “neither admit nor deny” policy to settle cases.The practice has been in use for years by many government agencies in addition to the S.E.C. The Justice Department has, in at least one case, allowed a company both to admit and deny similar charges in a single instance. Last November, Merck pleaded guilty to a criminal charge that it promoted its painkiller for an unapproved use.At the same time, it settled a broader array of civil charges by the Justice Department that it made misleading statements about the drug’s safety. In that settlement, Merck expressly denied that it engaged in wrongful conduct.It has been the S.E.C.’s application of this policy, however, that has attracted renewed criticism, particularly in cases related to the 2008 financial crisis. The House Financial Services committee said it would conduct a hearing to examine the practice early this year.In November, , a Federal District Court judge in New York, rejected an S.E.C. settlement with Citigroup over securities fraud charges and was sharply critical of the practice. He said the “neither admit nor deny” language deprived the court of the facts necessary to determine if the punishment was adequate because it meant that there were no established facts on which to base a decision.The Citigroup case will not be affected by the policy change, because there is no accompanying criminal charge. The S.E.C. has appealed Judge Rakoff’s rejection of its Citigroup settlement.'"
"'12-01-07,'0','In June 1964, the real return over the previous 15 years averaged 15.6 percent a year, the highest that figure had ever been. The stock market did not begin to fall then, but it could no longer maintain the torrid pace, and the 15-year return figures began to decline. On a real total return basis, stock prices hit their highs for the era in late 1968, and by the mid-1970s were in free fall as high inflation combined with a bear market.By 1979, an investor who bought stocks in 1964, when the market seemed to be a sure moneymaker, had lost money after adjusting for inflation, even after including dividend income.In the early 1980s, the stock market turned around, and by mid-1997 the 15-year return figure had reached a new high of 15.8 percent.The second chart overlays the two cycles. The first line goes from the end of 1943 through the end of 1980, when the line was in negative territory. The second one, beginning at the end of 1980, continues through the end of last year.The match between the lines is far from perfect, but there are significant similarities. If past is prologue, the 15-year return is likely to continue to decline and to turn negative in about four years. That does not necessarily imply that stocks will fall during that period, since that could happen with small gains over the period. And, of course, there is no assurance that history will repeat itself.It is probably significant that opinion surveys show Americans are more pessimistic than they have been in many years. There is a fear that the American economy is in decline and that this country will be unable to compete with emerging Asian economies, principally China. There was a similar fear in the late 1970s, although then the fear was that the United States could not compete with Japan.Perhaps overconfidence inspired in part by a strong stock market also played a role in American military history. Within a few years after the 1964 peak for 15-year returns, the United States escalated the Vietnam War. Within a few years after the 1999 peak, the United States decided to invade Iraq.The other two charts indicate that the stock market may have done surprisingly well over the last 15 years, considering how little the economy grew over that period. Through the third quarter of last year — the most recent data available — real gross domestic product had risen at an annual rate of just 2.3 percent over the previous 15 years. That was the lowest return since the 15 years ending in 1960, a period that was distorted because it included the rapid decline in real gross domestic product in 1946 as the production of weapons halted after World War II.Similarly, over the last 15 years the total real personal income earned by Americans has risen at an annual rate of just 2.6 percent. That is the lowest for any similar period for which G.D.P. data is available. Both the G.D.P. and personal income rates of growth are well below where they were when the cumulative stock returns bottomed out in 1982.After the pessimism of the late 1970s and early 1980s, the economy and the stock market turned around as it became clear the American economy was resilient and could adapt to a changing world. The question now is whether that can happen again.'"

"'12-01-08,'0','And as far as real estate investment trusts go, their prices are starting to become uncomfortably high, said Chris Cordaro, chief investment officer at RegentAtlantic Capital. “We’ve been in REITs for clients for more than 20 years, but we’re completely out of them right now because of their valuations,” he said.Still, prices in income-producing sectors haven’t reached the point where strategists recommend abandoning the search for dividends. Instead, they say, investors just need to be more mindful of how they use the strategy.Thomas H. Forester, manager of the Forester Value fund, which outperformed 56 percent of its peers last year, noted that his fund sold its shares of a giant utility, Dominion Resources, when they were trading at a P/E of above 15.But his fund has not given up on the sector entirely. It continues to own shares of utilities with lower-than-average P/E ratios, like American Electric Power, which is trading at just 11 times last year’s earnings.Mark R. Freeman, co-manager of the Gamco Westwood Balanced fund, which beat 65 percent of its peers in 2011, adds that investors would be wise to focus on high yielders and on companies with the potential to methodically bolster payouts over time. “This is the wrong time to reach for stocks with the absolute highest yields,” he said. “I’m a bigger fan of companies that are yielding 2 to 4 percent now but that promise earnings growth in the future and higher-quality balance sheets.”FOCUSING on dividend growth should help create a more stable portfolio, market strategists say. After all, companies that can bolster their earnings and payouts consistently are likely to withstand an economic downturn better than their peers.What’s more, this approach should help investors find dividend-payers in less-expensive sectors of the economy.Henry B. Smith, chief equity investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company, an asset management firm in Radnor, Pa., said that the firm maintains two separate blue-chip dividend stock strategies. The first focuses on companies in position “to increase their dividends over time based on their above-average earnings growth,” he said, and is used in the Haverford Quality Growth Stock mutual fund. The other, available to clients though not through a retail fund, pays more attention to companies with higher current yields.While the second approach outperformed the first in 2011, the dividend-growth portfolio has a lower average P/E ratio — around 10 times 2012 estimated earnings, versus about 11 for the high-yielding portfolio.By focusing on dividend growth, investors will also be drawn to less-traditional income-producing sectors like technology.Mr. Cordaro of RegentAtlantic says that one of his favorite dividend-paying stocks these days is Intel, the chip maker now paying out a market-beating 3.3 percent dividend yield. The stock is trading at a modest P/E of 10, and its earnings are expected to grow roughly 10 percent annually.“You’ve got the same exact thing going on at Microsoft,” he said, referring to the software giant whose shares have a 2.9 percent dividend yield. Like Intel, Microsoft has earnings that are expected to grow around 10 percent annually, yet it is trading at less than 10 times last year’s earnings.“If I told you in 1998 that these companies would turn into dividend leaders,” Mr. Cordaro said, “you’d say I was crazy.”'"
"'12-01-08,'0','The virtual body, introduced last month at N.Y.U., represents an unusual collaboration between industry and academia. The companies, which originally paid BioDigital to develop medical animations of certain body parts for commercial purposes, agreed to let the design firm freely use the digital models for educational purposes. In recognition of N.Y.U.’s involvement, the company has pledged a small share of future revenue to the medical school.But the medical students were merely testing an early incarnation of an ambitious project.BioDigital plans to develop the virtual cadaver further on its new medical education Web site, biodigitalhuman.com, with the aim of providing a searchable, customizable map of the human body. Right now, Mr. Qualter said, the site is available only in a beta version. But in the coming months, the company plans to offer its code to, say, health Web sites that want to embed images of the respiratory system, or to doctors who want to show animations of prostate cancer surgery to patients.“We wanted to use our data visualization to improve knowledge of complex health topics,” Mr. Qualter said. His firm hopes to position the virtual body as the health education equivalent of Google Maps — available as a free, easy-to-use public Web site and in an upgraded, fee-based professional version.“We want to become a scalable model,” Mr. Qualter said, “a Google Earth for the human body.”Mr. Qualter and his business partner, Frank Sculli, a software engineer, founded BioDigital Systems in 2002 to help companies and institutions use 3-D storytelling to make medical topics more comprehensible and compelling. For instance, the firm created an animated heart to demonstrate how an implant from Medtronic could fix a prolapsed heart valve. At N.Y.U., the firm worked with the medical school to develop animations of operations for surgical education.Those kinds of commissions helped make BioDigital successful as a small business. But its executives concluded that its growth potential would be limited if they remained focused on one-off projects for limited audiences. Last year, they decided to combine all of their commissioned medical illustrations into one virtual human.“As a private company, as a service business, we can make a couple of million dollars annually,” Mr. Qualter said. But, as a product firm with a searchable map of the human body to market, he said, the company has greater potential to increase revenue and improve health education. “Once the BioDigital Human is really being used by a lot of people, we can leverage that.”IT is too soon to tell whether studying a digital human model will help medical students understand anatomy more deeply than they can by dissecting cadavers alone. But the virtual body certainly offers some advantages.In the N.Y.U. lab, Chana Rich, a 21-year-old first-year student from Fairfield, Conn., dissected an older, female cadaver. But the dead woman had undergone a number of surgeries during her lifetime, and her body was now missing its appendix, spleen and right lung.“She’s skinny and female,” Ms. Rich said, “so sometimes it’s hard to visualize the smaller vessels.”A few minutes later, Ms. Rich was in the projection room, isolating the liver of the virtual cadaver and examining the blood vessels connected to it.“In a cadaver, if you remove an organ, you cannot add it back in as if it were never removed,” she said as she adjusted her 3-D glasses. “Plus, this is way more fun than a textbook.”But her colleague, Susanna Jeurling, a first-year medical student from Washington, disagreed. Dissecting a real cadaver, she said, gives students a unique, tactile understanding of the body.“I don’t think this will ever replace cadavers,” said Ms. Jeurling, 24. “There’s something about being able to hold it and turn it in your hand.”Administrators at the medical school say they have no plans to phase out dissection, an educational method that dates back to the Ptolemaic era. The 3-D digital human body is merely a complementary teaching method, said Dr. Marc M. Triola, associate dean for educational informatics.“It’s an amazing blend of one of the oldest medical education techniques and the absolute newest,” Dr. Triola said.'"
"'12-01-08,'0','Windows Phone, which began appearing in devices in fall 2010, certainly stands out visually. It has bold, on-screen typography and a mosaic of animated tiles on the home screen — a stark departure from the neat grid of icons made popular by the iPhone. While most phones force users to open stand-alone apps to get into social networks, Facebook and Twitter are wired into Windows Phone. The tiles spring to life as friends or family post fresh pictures, text messages and status updates.Even so, relatively few consumers have been tempted, and sales have been lackluster. A big problem is that, initially, the handsets running Microsoft’s software, made by companies like HTC and Samsung, were unexceptional. Even more important, wireless carriers, the gatekeepers for nearly all mobile phones, have not been aggressively selling Windows phones in their stores. Most promote the iPhone and devices running Google’s Android operating system.And so Microsoft has struck a partnership with Nokia, and executives at both companies have high hopes that their handsets will catch on with consumers. On Monday at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nokia plans to introduce a sleek metallic Windows Phone called the Lumia 900 that will be sold by AT&T in the United States, according to two people with knowledge of its plans who spoke on condition of anonymity because the product has not yet been announced. Unlike other handset makers creating devices with Microsoft’s software, Nokia is not also developing Android phones.“We are doing our best work for Windows Phone,” said Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia and a former Microsoft executive.While the customers’ verdict is still unknown, the group that developed Windows Phone has already profoundly affected Microsoft itself, influencing work on other consumer products. The next major version of software for PC’s, Windows 8, will look a lot like Windows Phone, which Microsoft hopes will help it work better on tablet devices. A Windows Phone-like makeover was also part of the new software update for Xbox, which along with Kinect is one of Microsoft’s few consumer hits.Bill Flora, one of the designers of Windows Phone, said the care that Microsoft took in designing its products had changed vastly since he joined the company out of art school in the early 1990s.“Now, instead of 80 percent of its efforts being unenlightened, just 20 percent are unenlightened,” said Mr. Flora, who recently left Microsoft to form his own design firm in Seattle.THE tale of how Microsoft created Windows Phone starts with the introduction of the iPhone, in 2007. To Joe Belfiore, now 43, an engineer who oversees software design for Windows Phone, that was the spark.“Apple created a sea change in the industry in terms of the kinds of things they did that were unique and highly appealing to consumers,” Mr. Belfiore said in an interview at Microsoft’s campus here. “We wanted to respond with something that would be competitive, but not the same.”Microsoft had been an early player in smartphones with Windows Mobile, software that ran on devices made by Samsung, Motorola and others. But one word describes its early effort: complicated. Windows Mobile had a complex array of on-screen menus, including a start button for applications that was borrowed from Windows PCs. The software ran on sluggish devices that had physical keyboards and, in some cases, styluses.Once the iPhone exploded into the marketplace, Microsoft executives knew that their software, as designed, could never compete. So in December 2008, Terry Myerson, who had just taken over engineering for the mobile group, convened a meeting that members of his management team came to call the “cage match.”With a prototype of a new Windows Mobile phone on a table, Mr. Myerson, a no-nonsense engineer , led a heated debate over whether any of the software could be salvaged. No one was leaving the room until the issue was resolved, he said.Seven hours later, the meeting finally adjourned, after Mr. Myerson got a call from his wife saying a pipe had frozen at his home. By then, a consensus had emerged that there wasn’t much technology worth saving. “We had hit bottom,” Mr. Myerson, who is now 39.“That frankly gives you the freedom to try new things, build a new team and set a new path,” he added.The decision was to start from scratch, a move that had serious consequences. Not only did it delay a Windows phone, it gave Google an opening to woo Microsoft handset partners to Android.Charlie Kindel, a longtime Microsoft manager who joined its mobile team in early 2009, compared the pain caused by starting over to the predicament of Aron Ralston, the hiker who amputated his own arm in 2003 after it was it pinned under a boulder in the Utah desert.“This boulder comprised of Apple and Blackberry rolled on our arm,” said Mr. Kindel, who left Microsoft last summer. “Microsoft sat there for three or four years struggling to get out.”Mr. Myerson also had to rebuild the mobile team — and Mr. Belfiore was his first major hire.Mr. Belfiore is a rare breed of Microsoft executive: he joined the company in 1990 fresh out of college and stayed, even as others fled to work for companies with more pizazz.For much of his career, Mr. Belfiore worked on the design of Windows and Internet Explorer, the kind of Microsoft software that is everywhere but not always admired for innovation. But he was also known for spending hours testing Microsoft technologies outside the office to see how they could be simplified.In recent years, Mr. Belfiore earned a reputation in the company for working on more adventurous projects, even if they sometimes bombed in the market. Before he joined the mobile group, for instance, he oversaw design of Zune, Microsoft’s ill-fated answer to the iPod. A version of the product released in 2009, the Zune HD, was praised by reviewers for its spare design that featured elegant typography and snappy, animated screen transitions as users flipped around music collections. But the Zune HD came out years too late, well after the iPod had cemented its lead.Mr. Belfiore took over the mobile group in early 2009, just as designers were finishing up the earliest prototypes for Windows Phone. In those prototypes, Mr. Flora drew inspiration from the signs in airports and other transportation hubs. He borrowed the emphasis on clarity, clean typography and broadcast-quality transitions between screens from Zune, which he had worked on with Mr. Belfiore. The ideas gradually gelled into a software design language that Microsoft calls Metro.But there were challenges beyond design. Microsoft had to take a fresh approach to working with phone makers so it could have its slick new software function properly. Unlike Apple, Microsoft doesn’t make its own hardware. Before it restarted its mobile strategy, Microsoft did little to ensure that its handset partners were putting its software on devices that could run it well.No longer would that be tolerated. Microsoft gave its handset partners detailed specifications of the types of technical innards required, including processors with certain amounts of power and screen technologies. Handset makers grumbled about the rules, but the result was phones that ran better.“It’s not just about software,” said Albert Shum, general manager of the design studio for Windows Phone. “It’s about the whole end-to-end experience.”When senior executives got their first look at the software, Mr. Myerson said, there was “some hesitancy.” Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, didn’t like that the first screen that appeared after turning on the device contained oversized type that cut off the day of the week. (Wednesday showed up as Wed.) Revisions were made.But the group was given its creative freedom. And the critics, at least, have approved the final results.“It looks like nothing we’ve seen before from Microsoft,” said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm. “The company is being somewhat bold and saying what worked for them in 1992 won’t work now.”Still, last summer, Mr. Ballmer told Microsoft investors that he was disappointed with Windows Phone sales. In mid-December, he named Mr. Myerson, the engineering head, to take full control of the group. He charged Mr. Myerson with improving the Windows Phone advertising campaign and relationships with wireless carriers. A software update for Windows Phones in the fall added a number of improvements to the product.BUT this year is crucial; it will show whether a respected product is enough to help Microsoft make up for lost time. Even if it feels good to be a favorite of tech critics for a change, Microsoft needs a blockbuster in the mobile business, not a cult hit.“Entering the market so late with this experience has created some special challenges for us,” Mr. Myerson said. “I think if we were there earlier it would be different.”'"
"'12-01-08,'0','Department of Homeland Security officials say the training seminar, although only half a day, is central to bringing all ICE officers on board for an effort that they say will significantly raise the numbers of convicted criminals among deportees and is expected to lead in coming months to unprecedented suspensions of deportations of tens of thousands of illegal immigrants.Virtually all ICE commanding officers and prosecutors have gone through the training course and are working on the new strategy, Homeland Security Department officials said. But because of the silence from the ICE Council, a local of the American Federation of Government Employees, the officials will miss their Jan. 13 goal for completing the nationwide training blitz, which began in November.Mr. Crane has channeled his criticisms primarily through Republican leaders in Congress, working with Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Calling the administration’s plan “backdoor amnesty,” Mr. Smith said last week that evidence Mr. Crane presented to the committee showed that directives from ICE officials for agents to use discretion in enforcement decisions had “undermined the agency’s credibility and mission.”The National ICE Council faces a deadline late this month to say whether it will demand negotiations over the training, the officials said. Mr. Crane did not respond to repeated e-mail requests over several months for comment.On another side, the administration is facing intense pressure from Latino leaders and immigrant organizations to begin halting deportations.The cornerstone of the policy is a June 17 memorandum by John Morton, the director of ICE, in which he laid out a list of no fewer than 31 factors that ICE officers should weigh when deciding whether to proceed with a deportation. Peter S. Vincent, ICE’s top lawyer, added further guidelines on Nov. 17.With slide shows and chalk talks on a dozen hypothetical immigration cases, the training seminar challenges officers to decide which foreigners should be deported, using prosecutorial discretion to make more complex decisions than they have in decades. It instructs agents to focus on the worst offenders, including criminal convicts, gang members and foreigners who came back after being expelled. Other groups of immigrants — elderly people, children, military veterans, college students and parents of young citizens — are low priorities who can be allowed to stay, even if they are here illegally. A New York Times reporter sat through an abbreviated version of the seminar.Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said the policy was based on existing statutes and was intended to make good use of strained resources. With each deportation costing at least $23,000, she said, immigration agencies have money for 400,000 removals each year, a goal that the Obama administration has met in each of the past three years. But an estimated 11 million immigrants live here illegally.The training asks ICE agents what they should do, for example, with a young illegal immigrant turned over to the agency after being arrested by a state trooper for driving without a license. She has been living in this country since 1993 and has an infant son, an American citizen because he was born here. But she lied to ICE officers, failing to tell them she had a conviction for shoplifting in 1995.Answer: She is not a threatening criminal and may still be nursing her American baby. Officers should close her deportation case.How about the migrant who has been living here since he crossed the Southwest border illegally in 1996? He failed to appear for a crucial immigration court hearing back then. But he has no criminal record, and he coaches soccer at the school where his twin daughters, both citizens, are enrolled.Answer: This case, too, should be closed.Then there is the man from an Asian Pacific island, a legal resident of the United States since 1984 who even served two distinguished combat tours in Iraq. But he left the military and is now finishing a six-year prison sentence for a federal sex-trafficking felony.Answer: Despite his service, because of his grave sex offense he loses his resident status and will be sent by ICE to his birth country.Cases against illegal immigrants who win favorable prosecutorial discretion will be closed but not canceled, so ICE can easily reopen them. Mr. Morton said the immigrants would remain in “legal limbo,” not gaining any legal immigration status.Mr. Crane told Congress that the Morton directives presented enforcement agents with “a roller coaster of arrest authority that has changed from month to month, week to week and at times from day to day.” He said some agents were afraid to make any arrests.It is not clear how deeply the union’s resistance reaches into ICE ranks. ICE officials say many field agents have been drawn to the professional appeal of the high-profile anticrime operations against foreign street gangs, drug dealers and sex offenders that the agency is conducting ever more frequently.“Our folks understand that we have limited resources and we have to focus more than ever on our priorities,” said Chris Shanahan, the ICE field office director who oversees deportation operations in New York City, where all supervisors have had the training.“What I see from my officers,” Mr. Shanahan said, “is that they understand that criminal aliens and national security threats should be taken into custody and removed before a single mother, a pregnant woman or someone with small United States citizen children.”'"
"'12-01-08,'0','One of the executives who has been under pressure is James Murdoch, Rupert Murdoch’s son, who leads News Corporation’s European and Asian operations, and has long been considered a candidate to succeed his father as head of the company. The police investigation and testimony before a parliamentary committee identified a 2009 meeting in London attended by James Murdoch as crucial to unraveling the issue of whether senior executives conspired in the cover-up.Under questioning at two sessions before the committee last year, James Murdoch denied having approved an out-of-court settlement of more than $1.4 million to buy the silence of a British soccer union executive who was suing News International and threatening to go public with documents pointing to a wider use of phone hacking than the company had then admitted. Two other senior Murdoch employees contested Mr. Murdoch’s denial, saying that they had informed Mr. Murdoch of the extent of the phone hacking, and cited that as a reason for approving the settlement. One of the two, Colin Myler, the former editor of the The News of the World, was appointed editor last week of The Daily News in New York, a rival of the Murdoch-owned New York Post.Ms. Carter’s arrest drew attention for several reasons, including a Scotland Yard statement that said that she had been questioned on suspicion of trying to pervert the course of justice, a line of inquiry that has not been specified in police statements on most of the other arrests in Operation Weeting.In addition, Ms. Carter appeared to have had a close personal and professional relationship with Ms. Brooks, the most senior executive in the Murdoch hierarchy to have been arrested in the affair. Former News of the World employees who spoke on condition of anonymity said Ms. Carter had worked as a personal assistant to Ms. Brooks for 19 years, starting when Ms. Brooks was deputy editor of The Sun, another Murdoch-owned tabloid in London, and continuing as Ms. Brooks became editor of the The News of the World, editor of The Sun, and later chief executive of News International, overseeing all of the Murdoch titles in Britain.Ms. Brooks’s resignation in July followed closely the News Corporation’s abrupt decision to close News of the World, Britain’s highest-circulation Sunday newspaper, after 168 years of continuous publication.Ms. Carter, who was described by those who worked with her as Ms. Brooks’s “gatekeeper,” with close knowledge of Ms. Brooks’s schedule, e-mails and meetings, lost her job as personal assistant amid the storm of recriminations after the disclosure that one of those whose cellphones had been hacked was Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl who was abducted and murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002.News International’s acknowledgment that the The News of the World had hacked into the teenager’s phone at a time when there was still hope that she remained alive was a watershed in the scandal. Ms. Carter’s departure from News International closely followed that of Ms. Brooks, but Ms. Carter continued to write a weekly beauty column for The Sun until that, too, was discontinued in December.One of the issues under investigation by Scotland Yard is whether any documents or e-mails pertinent to the inquiry were deleted or destroyed as part of a cover-up. Although News International has provided investigators with an archive of 300 million e-mails, the company has been accused of having deleted e-mails and of providing former employees with lavish payouts on the condition of their silence. It has also been accused of making selective leaks to other sections of the news media that Scotland Yard suggested constituted a “deliberate campaign to undermine the investigation.”According to two former staff members who did not want to be named because they were discussing a topic that was the subject of an active police investigation, Ms. Carter was fiercely loyal to Ms. Brooks. A person who claimed to have been present on the day that Ms. Brooks cleared out her office at News International’s headquarters, and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the two women were seen carrying items to a parked car.'"
"'12-01-08,'0','The key to overcoming the desolation of a missed kick, Brotzman and other kickers and coaches said, is camaraderie and support. Brotzman texted and spoke with Boise State kicker Dan Goodale this season after Goodale’s 39-yard miss against Texas Christian ended Boise State’s chance at an undefeated season.Brotzman received hate mail and death threats, and he ultimately had to shut his Facebook account. He said the recovery process was not easy.“It took a couple days,” said Brotzman, who kicks for the Utah Blaze of the Arena Football League. “My family and friends helped out a whole lot. The coaching staff at Boise State rallied behind me. It helped out a whole lot, and the fans here at Boise State, they were tremendous and showed a lot of support.”Foster shut his Facebook page after his three misses against L.S.U. Joe Alleva, the L.S.U. athletic director, came to Foster’s defense in a phone interview on Friday, recalling that the attempts were from 44, 50 and 52 yards. “That’s just not easy, O.K.?” Alleva said.Alabama Coach Nick Saban also defended the Tide kickers. Saban typically employs Foster on kicks of 42 yards or longer and Jeremy Shelley, who had a kick blocked against L.S.U., on shorter attempts. Foster is 2 for 9 this season; Shelley is 16 for 20.“The world breaks everyone at some point,” Foster said. “Some are strong at those points, and others are weak. If you’re strong, you’re going to persevere through it.”Alabama’s possession leading up to Foster’s missed 52-yard attempt in overtime included a dropped pass, a sack and a 5-yard substitution penalty. Those long-forgotten mishaps reveal one of the often overlooked part of missed kicks: all the other dynamics that go into setting them up. Saban acknowledged the negative plays that led to the overtime miss and said the missed kicks from the first game would not affect the Tide’s strategy on Monday.“I think what we’ve tried to do with our guys is say, ‘Look, you had a bunch of low-percentage kicks in that game, and we are confident in your ability to just stay focused on the process of what you need to do to make your best kick,’ ” he said.Foster drew a large crowd Friday at the national title game media day and sounded confident that he had moved past the misses. He said he had revived his Facebook account and had moved on.“It’s done,” he said. “It’s in the past. Until someone invents a time machine, I’m not going to worry about it, because I can’t do anything about it.”The veteran kicker Jay Feely, now of the Arizona Cardinals, knows the extreme emotions that come with kicking in the N.F.L.While playing for the Giants in 2005, Feely missed three kicks and ended up as a subject of a “Saturday Night Live” skit. Weeks later, he hit an overtime game-winner in Philadelphia while the replay board showed him missing the kicks against Seattle.Feely said he had watched the spate of misses from the college kickers this season and could relate to their predicament.“I don’t think you ever forget it,” he said. “You think more about the misses.”Feely gives himself until Monday afternoon to think about the previous day’s game, he said, whether or not it was successful. An 11-year N.F.L. veteran, he said that for kickers to move forward, they need to “focus on the process, not focus on the product.”Feely said: “Even though it hurts when they have a miss, it’s not career-ending and it’s not going to end your life. To try to move forward, you have to not fear failure. That’s easier said than done. You can’t worry about missing and think about trying not to miss.”The kicker who received the most attention in the bowl season was the freshman Jordan Williamson of Stanford. In the Fiesta Bowl, he missed a 35-yard kick at the end of regulation and a 43-yard attempt in overtime.Stanford Coach David Shaw said in a phone interview Friday that the support of teammates and coaches would help Williamson bounce back.In the locker room after the loss to Oklahoma State, Stanford teammates approached Williamson one by one to offer their support, and lineman David DeCastro yelled at reporters who tried to approach Williamson for comment. Shaw said he expected Williamson, a top recruit out of Austin, Tex., to develop into one of the county’s top kickers.“I’m not worried about this lingering for Jordan,” Shaw said. “It’s going to make him tougher and stronger. It’s something that people are going to want to keep bringing up, but I’m onto concentrating on the next game-winning kick he has for us and preparing physically and emotionally for that.”Perhaps a lesson can be learned from one of the feel-good kicking stories of this bowl season. Michigan’s Brendan Gibbons won the Sugar Bowl with a 37-yard kick in overtime. In the postgame news conference, he cited the advice of Coach Brady Hoke.“Every time we’re struggling in kicking,” Gibbons said, “Coach always tells me to think about girls on the beach or brunet girls. That’s what I did, and I made the kick.”'"
"'12-01-08,'0','While all automakers typically do business with a host of parts suppliers, the design and construction of the combustion engine has largely been the exclusive — and jealously guarded — responsibility of the carmaker.This is changing with e-mobility.“With electric vehicles coming onto the market, carmakers are confronted with the question of whether to make or buy electric motors,” said Christoph Hammerschmidt of Electronic Engineering Times Europe, a print and online automotive publication. “Companies such as Daimler, BMW or Porsche are very reluctant to place this competency into the hands of external partners.“But it’s this or start from scratch,” he added. “Companies like Siemens and Bosch already have them. So why reinvent the wheel?”However, these partnerships, and the Daimler-Bosch joint venture in particular, may foretell the advent of another way of doing business, should electric motors actually become the dominant powertrain of the future. It is a future in which the carmaker is just part of the equation and not necessarily the most important part.For example, Daimler owns half of a new company, EM-motive, and in a significant departure from long-time industry practice, the motors go on the market under this name. Two directors of equal rank, one from each parent company, will run the company. The motors, designed to fit a wide range of vehicles, including cars, vans and delivery vehicles, will be sold primarily in Europe — even to rival automakers.First in line are Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz and Smart brands. The newest generation of the Smart Fortwo Electric Drive, a two-seat city car, is expected to go on sale this spring with the new motor.The carmakers take pains to put a positive shine on the new alliances; Daimler characterizes the ventures as “pooling competencies and exploiting synergies” rather than a loss of brand identity.“A company like Bosch has a lot of know-how and problem-solving capacity when it comes to electronics and electric motors,” said Matthias Brock, a spokesman for Daimler in Germany. “But motors for cars are something different, and this is where Daimler’s expertise comes in.”The partnership will enable the companies to get more motors to market and do it more quickly than either could have on its own. The different forms of partnership also enable manufacturers to share the considerable cost burden and high risk of e-car development.The goals are ambitious and the timelines are short. Later this year, Volvo will deliver a fleet of C30 Electric test vehicles to Siemens. Those cars will then be evaluated in real-world driving. As for Daimler and Bosch’s EM-motive, the new company plans to produce more than one million electric motors by 2020.These are grand visions for a market that is still in its infancy. But the new configurations in the industry reflect the seriousness with which carmakers and the electronics branch are taking e-mobility — and the bottom line on carbon emissions.“Now there’s all kinds of innovation happening,” said Roland Edel, vice president and chief technical officer for innovative mobility solutions at Siemens. “By 2020, either there’ll be a booming mass market for e-mobility or it will have flopped entirely.”'"
"'12-01-08,'0','Luxembourg pretty much lists itself; Afghanistan includes the sad remains of the great Buddhas of Bamiyan, blown up by the Taliban.The Marshall Islands has one listing only: the Bikini Atoll Nuclear Test Site. Some distinction, to put it gently: to cite for preservation a place of devastation consecrated to the potential end of everything.In his book “Disappearing World: The Earth’s Most Extraordinary and Endangered Places,” Alonzo C. Addison, a director in Unesco’s external relations department, arranges sites in varying degrees of distress from a variety of causes, including conflict, theft, development, pollution, invaders and tourism.Conflict is the most obvious threat, whether in Afghanistan, Jerusalem, Kosovo or around the Preah Vihear temple on the border of Cambodia and Thailand, where there have been three armed clashes since the temple was listed.The Darfur crisis has done extraordinary damage to the Garamba National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and to the northern white rhinoceros there, killed for horns by militias seeking to buy arms, Mr. Addison notes.But most troubling may be the unintended consequences of mass tourism. Nations want to promote these sites for income. And good or bad, Mr. Addison said in an interview, “The world is more global and some sites can’t deal with all the tourists,” whether it’s Machu Picchu or Angkor Wat. (Unesco is now trying to put Machu Picchu on the list of endangered sites.)In 2008, this newspaper wrote about the impact on a little town in northern Japan of the naming of the long-disused Iwami silver mines as a World Heritage site. With about 400 inhabitants and little infrastructure, Omori was inundated with hundreds of thousands of tourists, wanting to check off the new site.Norimitsu Onishi’s article described how one 90-year-old man woke up one day to find three tourists relaxing on a sofa inside his house.“The dark side, of course, is consumption,” said Francesco Bandarin, assistant director-general of Unesco and head of its World Heritage Center, speaking of the consumerism that so often surrounds heritage sites. “And consumption and preservation do not go together.” If a site is “within an hour of a harbor,” he added, “it becomes inundated by a flood of tourism and geysers of money.”Angkor, long isolated by war and the Khmer Rouge, he said, now has 200 hotels nearby.“This is a big problem now,” Mr. Bandarin said. “The tourism industry has a lot of power in many poor countries but a short-term vision.”UNESCO has drawn more criticism for its second convention, which focuses not on place, but on traditions. The Intangible Cultural Heritage list has been adding what are called “elements” only since 2008. So far, 139 countries have signed the convention, but not the United States. As Mr. Addison said, “Even the word ‘intangible’ is hard for average people to get their heads around.”There are 267 traditions enshrined so far, with 27 described as “in need of urgent safeguarding,” including “the watertight-bulkhead technology of Chinese junks.” The regular list includes oral traditions and performances, social rituals and crafts — from Cambodia’s Royal  Ballet to Indonesian puppet theater. And, perhaps peculiarly, the French gastronomic meal.Cécile Duvelle, the anthropologist in charge of Unesco’s section for Intangible Cultural Heritage, fiercely defends it to those who think the idea too vague and subjective. “The word ‘intangible’ is recent, but the concept is old: the idea of nonmaterial culture and traditions,” she said.The point, she emphasized, is not to “preserve and protect, which is to freeze something, but to safeguard.” Traditions can change as they are passed down, she noted, as a kind of living heritage that is continually recreated and evolving, yet provides a sense of identity. In return for listing them, governments commit to specific actions to promote, support and encourage them, whether it is a matter of altering or creating curriculums or even stopping deforestation.The traditions on the list are not judged on whether they are especially beautiful, let alone marvelous. Rather, they represent the world’s diversity. Their inclusion implies that they may be in danger from modernization and globalization. “The value,” Ms. Duvelle said, “is for the community, not for the world.”Inclusion on the list can, however, lead to manipulation. The French gastronomic meal, enshrined in 2010, is one example. It is meant to preserve the lavish family occasion that marks major life events: births, communions, weddings, birthdays, exam results, deaths. It recognizes “that the French community puts a gastronomic meal at the center of its celebration of life,” said Ms. Duvelle, herself French.Unesco was not pleased that three-star French chefs used the designation to try to promote themselves, culminating in a grotesque celebration at Versailles last April where some 60 celebrity chefs largely prepared meals elsewhere that were trucked in and warmed up on portable workstations for celebrity guests and the news media.Now there is talk, at least, of taking the recognition away because the state has not done much to safeguard the tradition except to advertise it abroad under the slogan, “So French, So Good!” While the United States has hesitated to sign the Intangible convention, citing concerns about its implications for intellectual property rights, Washington’s ambassador to Unesco, David T. Killion, says that “World Heritage is critically important.”Countries fight hard “for the cultural branding rights,” he said. He points out that Herbie Hancock, a Unesco goodwill ambassador, would like to see jazz recognized as an Intangible Heritage.And Paducah, Ky., is pushing for quilting.'"
"'12-01-08,'0','I took the question to , the scholar of philosophy and ethics who has done more than anyone else to spread the call for animal liberation. He agreed that killing a dog is no worse than killing a cow or a sheep or a pig. And that the dog’s own expectations (or lack thereof) do matter. “The wrongness of killing a dog is nothing like the wrongness of killing a normal non-infant human being,” he said, “who can envisage their future and have specific desires for their future.”If the dog could never again be happy, he allowed, there might be a case for merciful death. “But if the dog can go on enjoying life,” he said, “why not let it enjoy it?”So is there any morally consistent way for a veterinarian to refuse this request on principle, then tuck into a big juicy steak? If it came to that, Singer replied, it would be better to just eat the dog.On the basic point, I agree: the owner’s preference is not a good reason to end the dog’s life. You should tell her no. (Far better than telling her a dishonest yes. That’s just deceit.)But here’s another way to look at her proposal: It’s scary to think the world will outlive us. We worry that our loved ones won’t be able to carry on when we die — and we probably also worry a little that they will. Perhaps this woman’s request, which seems at first like the most capricious of death sentences, just reflects the most human of fears.Most likely, she is just trying, however misguidedly, to get her affairs in order. If you want to give her peace of mind, guarantee that Pomeranian a loving adoption rather than an untimely demise.LETTING THE CAT OUT OF THE BAGThough my yard is walled and fenced, my neighbor’s cat frequently treated my as a litter box. One day my dogs cornered the cat, and, well, the cat wound up sleeping with the fishes. My neighbor is recovering from extensive treatment. Would she feel better knowing the cat’s end, or should I let her hope the cat is out there playing in the park? Complicating factor: Since that time, two other cats have turned up stiff in my yard. Is God punishing me for having dogs? NAME WITHHELD,Is God punishing you? That’s an interesting formulation.It’s not unethical for a dog to kill a cat that wanders into its yard. That’s what dogs do — at least highly territorial dogs with sharp teeth and permissive owners. Nor is it unethical for you to love such dogs. Others will disagree, but if your yard is truly self-contained, and if you always take appropriate precautions when people visit, you can live with any dog you want, whether it yearns to kill cats or eat babies or wouldn’t hurt a fly.But how self-contained is your yard if three cats recently found their way in? And how surprised could you be, after the second, that they could not find their way out again?Framing this as an ethical dilemma about whether to tell the cat’s owner lets you sidestep your own role in the cat’s death. Your neighbor is seriously sick and has just lost a pet. False hope is not a gift. Please tell her the whole truth.'"

"'12-01-08,'0','It is a classic — really killer — combination, but one most people don’t play around with much. Once I started to think about it, though, the possibilities for pork and apples seemed myriad: obviously, you can cook chops and chunks in a cast-iron skillet, maybe with a little bacon and onions . . . an easy vision. Bacon-wrapped apples, skewered and roasted or broiled (or grilled, for you warm-climate people) is another. A B.C.A. — bacon, cheese (soft, mild, brie-ish cheese, especially) and apple — is a fine sandwich, especially when cooked as you would a grilled cheese.On the slightly more complex side, I turned to the stuffed pork loin. This recipe has been a symbol of winter to me ever since I saw its photo (the stuffing was apricots) in one of the Time-Life “Foods of the World” cookbooks. (These were important works of the ’60s and ’70s, at least to those of us who were cooking.)Although the apples contribute not only flavor but also moisture, it’s still important to use pork that has some fat in it. The obvious recommendation to “use the best pork you can find” is important, because among the usual objections to standard industrially raised pork is the one that it has been bred to the point of overleanness, so that only by undercooking the meat does it have any chance to retain moisture. (There are three ways meat can be moist: melted fat, retained juice or added liquid, but — as most of us have experienced — added liquid can’t compensate for a lack of fat in meat that has had the juices cooked out of it.)If you begin with meat from a pig that was raised on an actual farm by actual people, the roast can tolerate high heat and long-enough cooking to brown the outside and cook the inside through, yet still yield meat that’s moist and tender.The same is true for this more-or-less traditional Peruvian stew with apples, scented with chiles and lime. Shoulder is a more forgiving cut than loin (even master hybridizers have not been able to breed the fat out of pork shoulder, making it the most reliable cut you can buy in a supermarket), but you can still overcook it, and the temptation is compounded by the presence of liquid. Don’t be fooled: this is not a dish that requires superlong cooking, and I have found that even large cubes can be done in just over an hour. (My best bet for this dish is about an hour and a half, but as with all braises, you have to keep checking.)Finally: apple-and-bacon quiche, an updated version of the classic (and still-wonderful) Lorraine. You can chop or grate the apples; chopped apples leave you with a bit of chew; grated apples give a smooth, silken texture that is quite pleasing. What is really great is the way the sweetness of the apples cuts through the salty pork and cheese, a further extension of this killer combo.'"
"'12-01-08,'0','2. Sprinkle a countertop with flour and put the dough on it, sprinkling more flour on top. Use a rolling pin to roll with light pressure from the center out. If the dough is hard, let it rest for a few minutes; if it’s sticky, add a little flour. Roll, adding flour and rotating and turning the dough as needed; use ragged edges of dough to repair any tears, adding a drop of water when you press a patch in place.3. When the diameter of the dough is about 2 inches greater than that of a 9-inch tart pan, drape the dough over the rolling pin and transfer it into the pie plate. Press the dough firmly into the plate, all over. Once the dough is in place, trim as necessary; freeze for 10 minutes or refrigerate for 30 or so.4. Prick the pie crust with a fork all over, then bake it for 10 to 12 minutes, or until beginning to brown; remove and turn the oven down to 375. Meanwhile, fry the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium heat, then remove from pan with a slotted spoon; cool and chop.5. Pour out all but one tablespoon of bacon fat and use the same pan to fry the apples. Add salt, pepper and rosemary. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook, stirring frequently, until the apple is soft and lightly browned, at least 15 minutes. Adjust the heat so it doesn’t brown too much or crisp up. Turn off the heat and spread apples onto the crust; then sprinkle with bacon and cheese.6. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs and cream. Put the semicooked shell on a baking sheet and pour in the egg mixture. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until almost firm (it should still jiggle just a little in the middle) and lightly browned on top; reduce the oven heat if the shell’s edges are darkening too quickly. Cook on a rack; serve warm.'"

When it starts to foam, add the apples, onion and all the spices, along with some salt and pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the apples and onion are soft, 10 to 15 minutes.2. Meanwhile, wriggle a thin, sharp knife into each end of the meat, making a kind of pilot hole. Then use the handle of a long wooden spoon to force a hole all the way through the loin. Wriggle the spoon to make the hole as wide as you can. Stuff the apple and onion mixture into the roast from each end, all the way to the center. Sprinkle the roast with salt and pepper.3. Roast on a rack in a large roasting pan for 15 minutes, then lower the heat to 325. Continue to roast, basting with apple juice about every 15 minutes or so. If the liquid accumulates on the bottom of the pan, use it to baste; if not, add more juice.'"

Heat the olive oil in a skillet and brown the pork in it on all sides; you may have to do this in batches for the most efficient browning.

Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan, Dutch oven or slow cooker. Bring to a boil, then adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles steadily but not vigorously. (If you’re using a slow cooker, turn it to high and walk away for 4 or 6 hours.)3. Cook, stirring every 30 minutes or so, until the meat is very tender and just about falling apart, at least an hour.

"'12-01-09,'1','There are many reasons an apple a day may keep the doctor away. Among popular fruits, apples rank second (after cranberries) in antioxidant power, according to the nutritionist Jonny Bowden. They are extremely high in phenolic compounds (polyphenols), particularly quercetin, and if the apple is red, anthocyanins. These phytochemicals carry many health benefits, both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. Apples have been linked to lower rates of heart disease in several studies.The phytonutrients in apples are concentrated in and right under the skin. So whenever it’s possible when you’re cooking with apples, it’s best not to peel them. Seek out organic apples if possible, as the skin is also where you’ll find most of the pesticide residue, and conventionally farmed apples are on the Environmental Working Group’s list of the most contaminated produce.Scones are easy to make and lend themselves to whole-grain flours. These are particularly moist because of the grated apples.'"

"'12-01-09,'1','Since the financial crisis, regulators have been pushing big banks to increase capital and ensure short-term liquidity, a move aimed at avoiding the cash flow troubles that brought the financial system to the brink of disaster in 2008.The oversight panel of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an international organization of financial regulators, met on Sunday and issued a statement saying that while more liquidity was always better, that did not mean banks would never be allowed to dip below required levels.“During a period of stress, banks would be expected to use their pool of liquid assets, thereby temporarily falling below the minimum requirement,” the statement said. Among the main topics of the meeting were proposals on the so-called liquidity coverage ratio, which is intended to ensure that financial institutions have enough liquid assets to ride out a crisis.In 2008, at the peak of the country’s most recent financial crisis, banks ran short of funding problems. The government stepped in to lend them billions of dollars of taxpayer money. This contributed to the downfall of Lehman Brothers, which failed in September 2008, prompting it to file for bankruptcy, the largest such filing in United States history.The panel said it would issue more detail on its statement to clarify the liquidity coverage ratio, or L.C.R., rules “to state explicitly that liquid assets accumulated in normal times are intended to be used in times of stress.”It continued: “It will also provide additional guidance on the circumstances that would justify the use of the pool. The Basel Committee will also examine how central banks interact with banks during periods of stress, with a view to ensuring that the workings of the L.C.R. do not hinder or conflict with central bank policies.”While the statement may not have been surprising — regulators have pushed for banks to increase liquidity levels to weather a crisis.  It will still interest Wall Street, which still relies on short-term funding to run its operations.'"

"'12-01-09,'1','Business schools are not always forthcoming with precise enrollment data, but a number of schools acknowledge that they have seen substantial growth in recent years. Martin Hackett, managing director of open enrollment programs at Wharton, said that the trend was clear and that the school’s open enrollment program this year attracted 50 percent more participants from India than last year. “We are seeing more interest from companies in China and have plans to offer some open enrollment programs in China in 2013,” he said.Jorge Choy, the regional director of executive education in Asia at Insead, said that Insead did not provide exact numbers but added, “The share of Asian participants has increased significantly over the years, and this trend is expected to continue.”To understand the momentum for executive learning among businesspeople in the growing economies, it is useful to think of the explosion of personnel and the need to manage them, said Krishna G. Palepu, senior associate dean for international development at Harvard Business School in Cambridge, Massachusetts.Companies that lead in a fast-growing sector might be growing at five to six times the speed of the general economy, he said. To keep pace with that growth, they might have to hire even faster.“Real growth in employee base is more than the company growth rate because you are losing 10 percent to 15 percent of the people if you are a leader, because people always look to you and hire from you.”The most constraining aspect of growth is thus the lack of depth in leadership in companies in China and India, Mr. Palepu continued. “That kind of growth is not just kept up by innate leadership capacity that is available in the company or in the economy,” he said. “There aren’t enough business schools of high quality to train people fast enough to feed this machine.”That sharp growth often thrusts underqualified people, trained only as software engineers, for example, into a position of leadership just a few years after joining. “You are immediately in a position to have to manage a large group of people,” he said. “But you don’t have the general management skills, strategic thinking, financial management, communication and marketing skills.”Programs intended for working executives are designed to be flexible for this very reason: such executives cannot take much time out for study overseas. Some executive programs consist of short modules — each lasting one week, for instance — that take place over a course of six months to a year, while others combine in-class learning with online studies away from campus. Yet others accommodate busy executives with classes over just a few days. That means executives fly in, attend classes packed with sessions on leadership, innovation and strategy for as little as two days, and leave.“We have people coming to your programs who say, ‘This works for me,”’ said Mr. Hackett of Wharton.Local business schools in countries like India and China are springing up in response to these fast-growing learning needs, but the quality, the breadth and the diversity often do not match the European and U.S. equivalents, participants say.Ravikumar Panga, a sales executive at Ashok Leyland, a leading commercial vehicle manufacturer based in the state of Tamil Nadu, India, had completed an M.B.A. in India earlier in his career and has had extensive domestic sales experience ever since. But he was transitioning from a domestic sales job to a higher managerial position in Europe where his employer was making new, bigger acquisitions and was set to send Indian executives to run the units in Europe.“To that extent I had a conversation with management, and I said I am not getting that international exposure, how to deal with European colleagues and American colleagues,” he said. “I felt fine on the management techniques. But international exposure, less.” So, he is now participating in Harvard Business School’s management development program, composed of short-duration modules that amount to seven weeks of classes in total.“At an Indian business school, in a typical class of 100, 75 would be Indian students,” he said. “Then, the rest will be mostly from Singapore, Malaysia and a few from Dubai, and never from Europe, the U.S. and Australia.”At Harvard Business School, Mr. Panga enjoys mixing with students from 57 countries, including seven who stay with him temporarily in his living quarters on campus: two Americans, as well as students from Poland, France, Japan, China and South Africa.The group meets, disbands and reunites several times during the program, and Mr. Panga says he already misses being away from his so-called “living group.”“I don’t miss them in an emotional way, but in an intellectual sense, having a rigorous, fruitful discussion with classmates,” he said.Executive participants interested in venturing into the more developed economies have much to absorb in the manners of business of the developed world, school officials say, especially for those from China.“It is a degree to which personal relationship drives business success and business opportunities there. Sometimes they may over-rely on that rather than do strategic planning or approach new markets in a strategic way,” Mr. Choy said. “Their skills in those areas, strategic planning and thinking, may be less well-developed as a result.”Western business schools, meanwhile, have much to gain from all this, and business-savvy participants see it. “Business schools worldwide also saw this new opportunity in China — more investment coming in and economic development taking place,” said Ms. Yu of Tudou. “It is a two-way thing, domestic industries had the urge to learn more about Western education, culture and everything, and the outside world realized there is a big market in China.”And opportunities for these schools only look set to grow. Western business schools, supported by powerful marketing staff members who fly across the globe, pitching as well as coordinating programs with their emerging market clients, find the looming potential alluring.Sandhya Karpe, managing director of custom programs at Wharton, speaking from her hotel in Beijing, said that her clients were discerning and that internal processes to approve an engagement were often long and cumbersome. But she said that five years ago, the two leading markets, China and India, were much more price sensitive than now. “They have now evolved to a place where companies are marking large sums of money to support these initiatives,” she said. “They understand they need to engage with global schools and know that it clearly comes with a different price point.”'"

"'12-01-09,'1','Shown copies of the documents, a Justice Department spokesman did not dispute their authenticity, but declined to make an official available to speak about them. But in a written statement, the D.E.A. strongly defended its activities, saying that they had allowed the authorities in Mexico to kill or capture dozens of high-ranking and midlevel traffickers.“Transnational organized groups can be defeated only by transnational law enforcement cooperation,” the agency wrote. “Such cooperation requires that law enforcement agencies — often from multiple countries — coordinate their activities, while at the same time always acting within their respective laws and authorities.”The documents make clear that it can take years for these investigations to yield results. They show that in 2007 the authorities infiltrated Mr. Poveda-Ortega’s operations. Mr. Poveda-Ortega was considered the principal cocaine supplier to the Mexican drug cartel leader Arturo Beltran Leyva. Two years later, Mexican security forces caught up with and killed Mr. Beltran Leyva in a gunfight about an hour outside of .As for Mr. Poveda-Ortega, in 2008 he escaped a raid on his mansion outside Mexico City in which the authorities detained 15 of his associates and seized hundreds of thousands of dollars, along with two pet lions. But the authorities finally captured him in Mexico City in November 2010.According to the newly obtained documents, Mexico agreed to extradite Mr. Poveda-Ortega to the United States last May. But the American authorities refused to say whether the extradition had occurred.“That’s how long these investigations take,” said an American official in Mexico who would speak only on the condition that he not be identified discussing secret law enforcement operations. “They are an enormously complicated undertaking when it involves money laundering, wires, everything.”The documents, which read in some parts like a dry legal affidavit and in others like a script for a B-movie, underscore that complexity. They mix mind-numbing lists of dates and amounts of illegal wire transfers that were conducted during the course of the investigation.One scene described in the documents depicts the informant making deals to launder money during meetings with traffickers at a Mexico City shopping mall. Another describes undercover D.E.A. agents in posing as pilots, offering to transport cocaine around the world for $1,000 per kilo.Those accounts come from the testimony by a D.E.A. special agent who described himself as a 12-year veteran and a resident of Texas. There is also testimony by a Colombian informant who posed as a money launderer and began collaborating with the D.E.A. after he was arrested on drug charges in 2003. The Times is withholding the agent’s and the informant’s names for security reasons.In January 2007, the informant reached out to associates of Mr. Poveda-Ortega and began talking his way into a series of money-laundering jobs — each one bigger than the last — that helped him win the confidence of low-level traffickers and ultimately gain access to the kingpins.A handful of undercover D.E.A. agents, according to the documents, posed as associates to the informant, including the two who offered their services as pilots and another who told the traffickers that he had several businesses that gave him access to bank accounts that the traffickers could use to deposit and disperse their drug money.In June 2007, the traffickers bit, asking the informant to give them an account number for their deposits. And over a four-day period in July, they transferred tens of thousands of dollars at a time from money exchange houses in Mexico into an account the D.E.A. had established at a branch in Dallas.According to the testimony, the traffickers’ deposits totaled $1 million. And on the traffickers’ instructions, the informant withdrew the money and the D.E.A. arranged for it to be delivered to someone in .Testimony by the informant suggests that the traffickers were pleased with the service.“At the beginning of August 2007, Harry asked my help receiving $3 million to $4 million in American money to be laundered,” the informant testified, referring to one of the Colombian traffickers involved in the investigation. “During subsequent recorded telephone calls I told Harry I couldn’t handle that much money.” Still, the informant and the D.E.A. tried to keep up. On one occasion, they enlisted a Mexican undercover law enforcement agent to pick up $499,250 from their trafficking targets in Mexico City. And a month later, that same agent picked up another load valued at more than $1 million.The more the money flowed, the stronger the relationship became between the informants and the traffickers. In one candid conversation, the traffickers boasted about who was able to move the biggest loads of money, the way fishermen brag about their catches. One said he could easily move $4 million to $5 million a month. Then the others spoke about the tricks of the trade, including how they had used various methods, including prepaid debit cards and an account, to move the money.The next day, the informant was summoned to his first meeting in Mexico City with Mr. Poveda-Ortega and Mr. Beltran Leyva, who asked him to help them ship a 330-kilogram load to from Ecuador. The documents say the shipment was transported over two weeks in October, with undercover Ecuadorean agents retrieving the cocaine from a tour bus in and American agents testing its purity in Dallas before sending it on to Madrid.The testimony describes the informant reassuring the traffickers in code, using words like “girlfriend” or “chick” to refer to the cocaine, and saying that she had arrived just fine. But in reality, the testimony indicates, the authorities, tipped off in advance by the D.E.A., seized the load shortly after its arrival, rather than risk losing it.'"
"'12-01-09,'1','In Iowa, the Republican presidential contenders tried to outdo one another in attacking reproductive rights as they sought the support of caucusgoers from the religious right. In New Hampshire, where voters are less socially conservative, the candidates have focused more on economic issues.But the message from Iowa was crystal clear: Mitt Romney, Rick Santorum, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman Jr., Newt Gingrich and Rick Perry all stand ready to restrict a woman’s right to make her own childbearing decisions and deny essential health care to millions of women.The Republican field is united in its determination to overturn Roe v. Wade; to appoint Supreme Court justices supportive of that goal; and to end government payments to Planned Parenthood for family planning services, cancer screening and other vital health services provided to low-income women. The candidates also want to reinstate the global gag rule that barred family planning groups abroad receiving federal money from even talking about abortion.There are a few differences among the candidates. Only Mr. Gingrich has called for punishing judges who make abortion rulings not to his liking. Mr. Romney and Mr. Huntsman refused to sign the Susan B. Anthony pledge to appoint antiabortion cabinet members, among other things. Mr. Huntsman opposed the “personhood” initiative in Mississippi that would have given human fertilized eggs the legal rights and protections that apply to people, and outlawed abortion as well as some of the most widely used forms of contraception and in vitro fertilization. Mississippi voters resoundingly rejected the measure in November as going too far.Mr. Romney denied supporting the measure once it was defeated. But before the vote, in an interview with Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor and a Fox News personality, he created a different impression. When asked whether as Massachusetts governor he would have supported a constitutional amendment establishing that life begins at conception, he said, “Absolutely.”This fall, the Republican nominee probably will not be trumpeting this extreme agenda in trying to appeal to moderate women voters, a key constituency in the general election. But voters should not be fooled. The assault on women’s reproductive health is a central part of the Republican agenda. It is not too early for Democrats to point that out.'"

"'12-01-09,'1','The application says there is a need for a Hebrew charter in the Highland Park-Edison-New Brunswick area, even though there are many Jewish private schools close by and, as Ms. Akman has told state reviewers, no community survey has been done.The application says that the families served by the New Brunswick schools, which are predominantly black and Hispanic, support the Hebrew charter, even though school leaders and the local chapter do not.Since March 2010, community volunteers from Highland Park, Edison and New Brunswick have been battling to stop the school from opening, arguing that it would drain resources from traditional public schools in order to provide a free Jewish education that should be the responsibility of private schools.For each child who leaves a district to attend a charter, the charter receives 90 percent of the district’s per-pupil spending allotment. In modest-size communities like Highland Park, with a district of 1,500 students, that can take a substantial bite out of a school budget.What has been so frustrating to opponents is that despite repeated distortions in the Tikun Olam applications, the charter still may open in September.How could federal oversight be so lax?Part of the answer is that charter schools are a top priority for the Obama administration, making federal officials predisposed to support them.And part of the answer, as Justin Hamilton, an Education Department spokesman, explained in an e-mail, is that federal officials see their oversight role as limited. The department hires private consultants to rate the quality of a charter applicant, but those consultants “cannot use information not included in the grant application,” he said.In other words, if Ms. Akman writes that Assemblyman Peter J. Barnes III supports the charter, the federal consultants are not permitted to interview Mr. Barnes, who would have been happy to tell them that he does not.This prohibition against using outside information is intended to ensure that no special measures are taken to either favor or hinder an applicant, although what it really invites is fiction writing.Mr. Hamilton points out that the federal grant does not take effect unless the state approves Ms. Akman’s application. The federal role, he said, is to “operate as a funding source for applicants proposing to open high-quality start-up charter schools,” although it is hard to imagine why an applicant would propose a low-quality charter school.An applicant with a $600,000 pledge in her pocket may be seen in a new light by state officials. In mid-October, Ms. Akman wrote to the state’s acting education commissioner, Christopher D. Cerf, requesting assistance in winning approval for her fourth application. “We were just granted a substantial federal charter school grant,” she wrote him, and would “love to have a meeting to better strategize and prepare for our reapplication.”How Mr. Cerf responded is not known. E-mails between Ms. Akman and Mr. Cerf’s office were released after a request under the state’s Open Public Records Act. While Ms. Akman’s string of e-mails was made public, responses from Mr. Cerf’s office were redacted.What we do know is that in mid-October Ms. Akman made her fourth try, as 1 of 42 applicants statewide.And in December, the state made its first cuts, leaving 17 applicants — including Tikun Olam.Next week state officials are to announce which are approved. If Tikun Olam is successful, the school plans to open in September with 100 students.Ms. Akman has repeatedly refused to talk to reporters. She did not respond to a dozen e-mails and voice mail messages left at the real estate office where she works, Century 21 J. J. Laufer in Highland Park. When I called the personal cellphone number she listed on the state application, a woman answered. “Who’s calling?” she asked, and when I explained that I was a reporter, she said, “I’ll tell them you called, thank you,” and hung up.While I have independently confirmed the facts in this column, a lot of the distortions were first dug up by Darcie Cimarusti, an opponent of the charter school. She is an interior designer and educator with four children in Highland Park schools who is now a stay-at-home mom, and she has devoted an extraordinary amount of her time to stopping the charter.“Since May this has become my full-time job,” she said. “Some weeks, far more than 40 hours a week.” She has been joined by several dozen community volunteers.All over the state, volunteers, mainly women, have been working to keep charter schools out. Mostly they’re from prosperous suburbs with high-quality public schools: Livingston, Millburn-Short Hills, Maplewood, Teaneck, Cherry Hill.Even so, it is an uphill battle against an education establishment that includes Democrats ( ) and Republicans (Gov. of New Jersey) with strong financial backing (the Gates, Broad and Walton foundations).A spokesman for the state’s Education Department, Justin Barra, said in an e-mail that in the next review round for charter applications, representatives of Tikun Olam would be brought in for “an intensive in-person interview.” As for possible misrepresentations, he said: “Several individuals in the public comment process have raised concerns about potential inaccurate statements in the application. We will investigate these concerns.”In New Jersey, there is no limit to the number of times a group can modify its application and reapply for a charter, and Tikun Olam does not hold the record. “We do have applicants that have submitted more than four times,” Mr. Barra said.Mr. Hamilton, the federal spokesman, said that if the Education Department “becomes aware of material factual misrepresentations,” it could terminate the grant.An investigation would not require much digging. The list of public officials who supposedly support the Tikun Olam charter — but in interviews have said they really do not — is in the first paragraph on Page 18 of the federal application.Right after that, in Paragraph 2, the charter supporters provide some of the translations of the Hebrew words “tikun olam,” including “perfecting the world.”'"

Penney Company, Plano, Tex., and Saatchi & Saatchi, New York, part of the Publicis Groupe, ended their relationship on Dec. 31, five years after Saatchi & Saatchi began serving as the general market creative agency for Penney. The decision, which was described as mutual, came six weeks after Penney unexpectedly added Peterson Milla Hooks, Minneapolis, to its roster as a general market creative agency. Penney, which spends about $1.3 billion a year on advertising, also recently added the New York office of Mother to its roster, to handle unspecified projects, and changed public relations agencies, hiring PMK-BNC, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, after working with M. Booth & Associates.¶Target Corporation, Minneapolis, and Wieden & Kennedy, Portland, Ore., the lead creative agency for the Target retail chain, said they would part ways; Wieden & Kennedy had worked for Target for six years and was the lead creative agency since 2009. The announcement, which was a surprise, was reported by adage.com. The parting came three months after Michael Francis, chief marketing officer at Target, left to join J. C. Penney as president. Target spends more than $1 billion a year on advertising. ¶New York Life chose Euro RSCG New York as its advertising agency of record. Spending for the assignment, which had previously been handled by the New York office of Taxi, was estimated at $35 million. Euro RSCG New York is part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide division of Havas Worldwide, a unit of Havas. Taxi is part of the Y&R unit of the Young & Rubicam Group, a division of WPP.¶American Eagle Outfitters, Warrendale, Pa., said it had begun a review to hire its first worldwide agency of record, to handle tasks like creative development and media services for both traditional and digital media. The company sells apparel under brand names like American Eagle, Aerie and 77kids. American Eagle Outfitters has previously worked with various agencies on a project basis. The review, to be handled by Ark Advisors, New York, will occur after the company hired a new chief executive, Robert Hanson, who in his previous job at Levi Strauss & Company worked with major agencies like Wieden & Kennedy. Spending has not been determined; American Eagle Outfitters spent less than $10 million on advertising each of the last two years.¶Donna Speciale joined Turner Broadcasting System, part of Time Warner, as president for Turner entertainment and animation ad sales, overseeing channels like Cartoon Network, TBS, TNT and truTV. She had been president for video investment and activation at MediaVest USA, New York, part of the MediaVest division of the Starcom MediaVest Group, which is owned by the Publicis Groupe. The hiring of Ms. Speciale is part of a reorganization at Turner Broadcasting System that includes giving additional duties to Greg D’Alba, who had been executive vice president and chief operating officer for CNN ad sales, marketing and operations; he becomes president for news and Turner digital ad sales.The reorganization came after the departure in November of Linda Yaccarino, who had been executive vice president and chief operating officer for Turner entertainment advertising sales and marketing and acquisitions; she left to join NBCUniversal, New York, part of Comcast, as president for cable entertainment and digital advertising sales.

"'12-01-09,'1','Since the financial crisis, regulators have been pushing big banks to increase capital and ensure short-term liquidity, a move aimed at avoiding the cash flow troubles that brought the financial system to the brink of disaster in 2008.The oversight panel of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, an international organization of financial regulators, met on Sunday and issued a statement saying that while more liquidity was always better, that did not mean banks would never be allowed to dip below required levels.“During a period of stress, banks would be expected to use their pool of liquid assets, thereby temporarily falling below the minimum requirement,” the statement said. Among the main topics of the meeting were proposals on the so-called liquidity coverage ratio, which is intended to ensure that financial institutions have enough liquid assets to ride out a crisis.In 2008, at the peak of the country’s most recent financial crisis, banks ran short of funding problems. The government stepped in to lend them billions of dollars of taxpayer money. This contributed to the downfall of Lehman Brothers, which failed in September 2008, prompting it to file for bankruptcy, the largest such filing in United States history.The panel said it would issue more detail on its statement to clarify the liquidity coverage ratio, or L.C.R., rules “to state explicitly that liquid assets accumulated in normal times are intended to be used in times of stress.”It continued: “It will also provide additional guidance on the circumstances that would justify the use of the pool. The Basel Committee will also examine how central banks interact with banks during periods of stress, with a view to ensuring that the workings of the L.C.R. do not hinder or conflict with central bank policies.”While the statement may not have been surprising — regulators have pushed for banks to increase liquidity levels to weather a crisis.  It will still interest Wall Street, which still relies on short-term funding to run its operations.'"
"'12-01-09,'1','Jaime’s weapon, a Umarex SA177, was a .177-caliber, carbon dioxide-powered gun that shoots steel BBs and that has a metal slide with a plastic frame. It had no markings suggesting it was an air pistol. A federal law requires toy firearms and so-called airsoft guns — low-impact weapons used by the police in training and by hobbyists in outdoor games — to have an orange tip at the end of the barrel. But the law does not apply to pellet and BB guns like the one Jaime had.“When I looked at that gun, there is no doubt that looking at it from a distance it’s absolutely real,” said Carl A. Montoya, the superintendent of the Brownsville Independent School District and a reserve constable in the city. “I think the officers responded, obviously, from their training from that perspective, that it was a real gun.”In the aftermath of air gun-related episodes involving children, a few towns and cities in Texas passed laws prohibiting the public display of pellet and BB guns or making it illegal for minors to have them. The Texas State Rifle Association opposed the ordinances, arguing that the laws limited the rights of legal gun owners and violated state laws prohibiting municipalities from pre-empting state firearm laws.In October 2002, in the Dallas suburb of Coppell, an officer on patrol spotted a juvenile with what appeared to be a handgun. The juvenile fled and the officer pursued him, and as the officer left his vehicle the suspect was still holding the gun, a Coppell police spokesman said. The officer drew his firearm, and the juvenile threw the suspected weapon to the ground. It turned out to be an airsoft pistol that was a replica of a Sig Sauer P228 handgun. The following year, the nearby city of Plano passed a law making it a misdemeanor to brandish an air gun or other type of facsimile firearm in a public place.In 2007, 2008 and 2009, a total of 124 people, including 23 children and teenagers aged 18 and younger, were killed in Texas from accidents involving BB guns, pellet guns and other types of firearms that do not use gunpowder, according to data supplied by the Texas Department of State Health Services. Those figures do not include deaths stemming from police confrontations with people armed with air pistols. No agency tracks the frequency of those shootings.Nationally, about four children are killed on average each year in episodes involving BB guns or pellet guns, but that number also does not include deaths stemming from police shootings, according to the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission.In Brownsville, the officers who fired their weapons have been placed on administrative leave while a joint investigation is conducted by the Brownsville police, the school district police and the Texas Rangers. Police officials declined to comment about how Jaime acquired the air pistol, saying it was part of the investigation.“It’s a dangerous game you want to play, if you’re going to carry a gun that looks authentic,” said Detective Jose J. Trevino, a Brownsville police spokesman. “What for? You’re just putting yourself in a situation that might end up going bad.”Jaime’s motive remains unclear. On the 911 call, a man in the background, possibly a school administrator or employee, can be heard telling the officers shortly before the shooting, “He is saying that he’s willing to die, so be careful.”On Friday evening, dozens of teenagers dressed in white T-shirts reading “I ♥ Jaime” filled the pews and lined the walls of Holy Family Catholic Church for his wake. In between prayers of the rosary, mariachi musicians sang in Spanish as Jaime’s father, stepmother and mother were embraced by relatives. Jaime lived near the church and regularly attended on Sundays. On his trips to Mexico to visit his grandmother he collected pesos, and one day before Christmas he gave them to the pastor of the church to buy candy for neighborhood children.“At this moment, it’s hard to make sense of a tragedy like this,” said the pastor, the Rev. Jorge A. Gomez. “I think that’s what is more upsetting — it wasn’t a real gun.”'"
"'12-01-09,'1','At best, Winter Jazzfest is an extraordinary thing. It’s a significant jazz festival, not tied to any cultural institution. And it doesn’t rely on the names that would fill Carnegie Hall or Rose Theater, but on those that make up the music’s daily life, chosen with discernment and advocacy. That’s inspired.It took the form of about 60 performances (I passed through about a third of them) spread across Friday and Saturday in five rooms on or near Bleecker Street: Le Poisson Rouge, Sullivan Hall, Kenny’s Castaways, Zinc Bar, the Bitter End. Since 2005 Winter Jazzfest has leaned toward new groups, playing new music, and it helps push them into visibility: different audiences — twice as big or more as those groups would usually draw — enacting a different kind of listening, a sorting-out and contextualizing kind.The festival’s organizers, Brice Rosenbloom and Adam Schatz, made two positive innovations this year. They raised minimum pay scales for the bands, and lengthened the time between acts. What good does that do? You’d be surprised: it gives the crowd extra time to dissipate and change. The hope, not always realized, is for everyone to be walking around as much as possible, sampling and moving on.But I would bet that a lot of listeners — the festival sold out, with around 2,000 each night — were rooted to the spot, as they were probably hearing for the first time the pianist Fabian Almazan’s intense and crystalline trio music, sometimes augmented by a string quartet (a version of Shostakovich’s String Quartet No. 10 was a total ear-opener); or the trio of the violinist Mat Maneri, the bassist Shahzad Ismaily and the drummer Ches Smith stamping out free improvisation in an idiom all their own, with abrupt short-order themes; or ERIMAJ, led by the drummer Jamire Williams, a band that dissolves lines between rhythmic traditions in jazz and hip-hop as well as I’ve ever heard; or Herculaneum, a totally unslick, all-for-one sextet from Chicago scrambling aspects of postbop jazz, minimalism, rock dissonance and West African rhythms.Once you buy a ticket — $35 for a single night, $45 for two — you’re basically on your own. There’s no particular guiding philosophy about jazz on offer, not really even the dogma of no dogma. And this gives the power to the audience, in a way.But having one really good experience as a listener at Winter Jazzfest reminds you that you want to see all that you came to see. You don’t want to get marooned in a line or have your view entirely blocked by bottlenecks of people who aren’t really there to listen, packed into a space that’s completely wrong for the occasion. On Friday night around 9, the bouncer at the Zinc Bar, as affably as he could, told those in a large group lined up to hear Miguel Zenón’s quartet that they might have to wait for two hours to enter the club, at which point they’d be waiting for a different band. That’s nonsense.'"

"'12-01-10,'1','For months now, Greece has desperately been trying to persuade its private sector creditors — its bondholders that are not other governments — that it is in their interest to exchange their existing Greek for longer-term securities, while accepting about a 50 percent loss as part of the bargain. The negotiations are known as the private sector involvement, or P.S.I., to employ the widely used shorthand.A few months ago such a deal looked doable, as the large European banks that held most of this private sector debt, estimated to be about 200 billion euros, recognized that it was probably a better alternative than a default by Greece, which could wipe out their holdings. Moreover, the were vulnerable to political pressure from their home countries, where they have a big stake in remaining on good terms with the government and important officials.But as the talks have dragged on, many of these banks, especially big holders in and , have sold their holdings. Among the buyers have been London hedge funds and other independent investors that are now questioning why they should accept a loss — if at least in the short run Greece keeps meeting its debt payments.And as the number of such hedge funds holding Greek debt has grown, so has their ability to forestall a restructuring private sector agreement, thus bringing them closer to being able cash in on their risky tactic.“They are calculating that Greece will not default before March,” said Mitu Gulati, a sovereign debt expert at the School of Law and a co-author of a recent paper on the dynamics of the debt restructuring process in Greece.Mr. Gulati points out that it is these investors that are in many ways behind the delay in executing a private sector deal. “If you own a bond that matures in March and it is January, then you have every incentive to delay,” he said.Yet private sector involvement could prove a crucial component of the set of provisions that Greece must meet to receive its next lifeline payment from Europe and the I.M.F.The private sector loss agreement was expected to lower Greece’s borrowing expenses by as much as 100 billion euros through 2014. The agreement was also supposed to reduce Greece’s ratio of debt to gross domestic product to 120 percent by 2020, down from about 143 percent today. In short, the private sector involvement represents a crucial pillar of the 199 billion euros in financing that Greece will need from outside sources in the next three years.The German chancellor, , the most vocal proponent of requiring some sacrifice on the part of private sector lenders, has been the most forceful political leader in pushing for a resolution of the negotiations. Mrs. Merkel met with , the managing director of the I.M.F., in on Tuesday. They issued no statement, but aides said Greek debt was high on the agenda. Ms. Lagarde was then to meet Wednesday with the French president, , in .Bankers say that some I.M.F. officials are pushing for an even steeper loss to be imposed on private investors, reflecting a sense within the I.M.F. that Greece’s debt position has become unsustainable — even if the private sector were to accept a 50 percent cut in the value of its existing debt holdings.All of this is why the bond holders and speculators are making such a risky bet. Aside from the default danger, Greece and Europe may well be able to insert provisions into a private sector agreement that would prevent “free riders” — as the holdouts are sometimes called — from receiving their bond payments at all. Since the older bonds coming due in March are governed by Greek law, such procedures are an option.In this vein, Greece has taken steps to retroactively insert so-called collective action clauses into the bond contracts. These give the debtor the right to impose a restructuring on all creditors, including holdouts, once a certain majority of support for the private sector agreement. is reached.But some analysts see this right as moot. If a majority vote of bondholders could impose its will on a minority, the deal might no longer be seen as voluntary. And a voluntary agreement has been considered crucial to avoid activating — a type of against Greek debt default that many investors have bought.Activating -default payments is an outcome that European, particularly Greek, officials have been desperate to avoid. That outcome could lead to the same sort of expensive and unpredictable cascade of debt obligations throughout the financial system that endangered the banking system during the American subprime real estate collapse a few years ago.Another option for getting investors to go along with some sort of private sector deal is that Europe and the I.M.F. contribute more money to make the exchange more palatable. That would provide a carrot to the holdouts. But it would require more money from Europe and the I.M.F., which could be difficult to raise, given the public resistance to providing more bailout money to Greece.The bonds in question are trading at about 40 cents on the euro, a significant premium to the longer-dated securities that trade at about half that level, reflecting a market view that over the long term Greece will probably default, no matter what.A chunk of the bonds mature on March 20, when Greece must come up with 14 billion euros, a payment it will not be able to make without aid from the European Union and the I.M.F.In a recent report, estimated that as much as 80 billion euros in Greek bonds were now owned by independent investors, including hedge funds, and other asset managers.The bankers’ lobby that represents the creditors — the Institute of International Finance — has said that it expected enough creditors to agree to the private sector deal. But it is not clear how much sway the institute has over those inclined to reject the terms, especially hedge funds looking to make a quick profit.Already two outfits, Talanx, a German insurer, and Vega Asset Management, a hedge fund based in , have publicly opted out.

"'12-01-10,'1','That drive culminated in another field goal and a 12-0 Alabama lead, despite the loss of Alabama’s best receiver, Marquis Maze, early in the game, and despite L.S.U. flooding the line of scrimmage with defenders aimed at limiting Richardson’s impact.Afterward, as confetti swirled on the field, defensive lineman Nick Gentry said the Crimson Tide could sense earlier in the day that McCarron would show up.“A J, he was so calm,” Gentry said. “I don’t understand it. Most quarterbacks get the jitters. He was collected. He was ready to play the game.”In the teams’ meeting earlier this season, one late errant throw by McCarron landed in the hands of a defender and led to L.S.U.’s game-tying field goal. His coach, Nick Saban, said McCarron “wasn’t himself” in that game.In the rematch, McCarron turned momentum by turning to his less-heralded options. Wide receiver Kevin Norwood, who had only seven regular-season catches, gained 78 yards on four receptions. Tight end Brad Smelley even outgained L.S.U.’s offense, 37 yards to 36, late into the second quarter.In a game that was at once a defensive masterpiece and an offensive travesty, McCarron lifted Alabama to a 9-0 halftime lead. He anchored the early game plan, which mostly called for short-to-intermediate passes and heavy doses of play-action.McCarron threw 25 times in the first two quarters, and the more passes he completed, the more the L.S.U. defense was forced to allow him a smidgeon of respect. This opened lanes, once closed, for Richardson, which later opened up the occasional pass downfield. Saban later said Alabama knew it needed to throw on first down in order to win.“We’ve been leaning on No. 3 all year,” McCarron said of Richardson. “He’s our workhorse, he’s our guy.”By the end of the second quarter, McCarron had completed 18 passes for 156 yards and helped Alabama control the ball for nearly twice as long as L.S.U. For all the talk about these defenses — Alabama’s had yielded all of 43 yards at the half — McCarron was, if not an offensive stalwart, then a serviceable option in a game like this one.All this from a quarterback who, at age 5, nearly died in a WaveRunner accident. This past week, he recalled what happened: the crash into a pier; the left side of his face crushed; his left eye hanging by a tendon; the 86 staples he ultimately required.Yet there stood McCarron late Monday night, the first Alabama player to climb the stage. In one hand, he held a newspaper that proclaimed the Crimson Tide the top team in the land. The quarterback who won the game when some expected him to lose it was now the unlikely champion.'"

"'12-01-10,'1','“People need to get fired over this,” said David Tunley, one of the few Musk Oxen at the outdoor rink on an evening when the temperature was minus 23. “The litigation of whose fault it is will probably go on forever.”How Nome ended up short on fuel this winter is a complicated issue unto itself, but trying to get the Renda here to help has become a sub- odyssey — and perhaps a clunky practice run for a future in which and commercial interests make shipping through Arctic routes more common.“There is a lot of good knowledge that is coming out of this,” said Rear Adm. Thomas P. Ostebo, the officer in charge of the Coast Guard in Alaska.The learning curve has been steep. Since leaving Vladivostok, , on Dec. 17, the 370-foot Renda has encountered a fuel mix-up in and storms that prevented it from going to ; it has received a waiver of the Jones Act in the (to allow the foreign vessel to finally pick up gasoline in Dutch Harbor, Alaska, before transporting it to Nome) and broad support for its mission from Alaska’s Congressional delegation; it has been joined by the Coast Guard’s only operative icebreaker built for the Arctic, the Healy. It has had to alter its route to avoid the world’s most substantial population of a federally protected sea duck called the spectacled eider.As of Monday, the Renda and the Healy were about 140 miles south of Nome, having made little progress from the night before. Wind, current and the brutal cold are causing complications with breaking what is known as first-year ice — the kind that forms each winter and melts in the summer as opposed to lasting year-round. As soon as the Healy breaks open a channel, ice closes in behind it, squeezing the Renda.The Coast Guard has been among the most vocal government agencies in asking for more money and better equipment to deal with increased commercial activity in the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Admiral Ostebo said the Healy, a medium-duty icebreaker, was fully capable of making the trip to Nome but that using a heavy-duty polar icebreaker — the Coast Guard owns two: one is retired, the other under repair until at least 2014 — might have made a difference.He said the Coast Guard had thought that having the Healy lead the Renda would have been easier, “but it turns out that the pressure that ice is under quite frankly makes it hard to move through for the Renda.” He said these were “conditions I think we’re going to see a lot in the future.”If the Renda reaches Nome, it would be making the first maritime fuel delivery through sea ice in Alaska history. The effort comes as many interested parties are anticipating business that could develop as plans to conduct new exploratory offshore drilling just north of here as early as this summer.“These are not cowboys out here trying to do crazy things,” said Mark Smith, the chief executive of Vitus Marine, the Alaska company that proposed using the Renda to representatives for Nome. “All of the stakeholders involved in this mission look at it as a learning experience as they consider further development.”Nome usually receives its winter supply of fuel in early fall, before ice hardens over the Bering. But last fall, multiple shipping delays and then a major storm prevented the fall shipment from arriving. Many people here blame Bonanza Fuel, one of two local companies that barge in fuel and the one that failed to ensure its fall delivery made it. But the fuel company’s owner blamed the barge company for delaying shipments.“Certainly we’ll evaluate how this situation came together,” said Jason Evans, the chairman of the Sitnasuak Native Corporation, which owns Bonanza, “so that we’re not put in this situation and the community of Nome’s not put in this situation again.”Officials say Nome could run out of by March. A normal fuel barge cannot make the trip until ice melts in June or July.Dogs still pull sleds to Nome, in the annual Iditarod race each March, but there are still no roads here from outside. There are, however, more modern means of transportation. Mr. Evans said Nome could resort to flying in fuel through hundreds of small shipments but that shipping costs alone would be more than $3 per gallon. Fuel here already approaches $6. Conservation can only go so far.“You have to heat your home when it’s 36 below,” he said.The effort has prompted observers far and wide to comment on what it all means as the United States tries to figure out how to navigate the increasingly important Arctic. One question not to ask here: Regardless of how it came to this, is tiny Nome worth all the effort?“Why should we be treated any differently than the Lower 48?” said Mayor Denise L. Michels, noting that the Coast Guard also escorts commercial shipments through ice and difficult conditions in the and off the East Coast. “We keep saying that we are an Arctic nation.”'"
"'12-01-10,'1','Senator Robert Menendez’s decision to hold up President Obama’s nomination of Patty Shwartz, a well-regarded federal magistrate judge, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, has the unsavory flavor of political revenge.Judge Shwartz served for 14 years as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey, including two stints as chief of the criminal division in the United States attorney’s office, before becoming a magistrate in 2003. The American Bar Association, which examined her credentials, rated her “unanimously well qualified,” the highest possible grade. She has been hailed as a stellar choice for the appellate court by the state’s other Democratic senator, Frank Lautenberg, and by its legal and judicial communities.The only naysayer is Mr. Menendez, and, at the moment, his is the only vote that matters. Observing archaic Senate protocol, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the Judiciary Committee chairman, will not schedule a hearing on a judicial nominee until home-state senators return a blue-colored form with their recommendation. Judge Shwartz was nominated in October, but Mr. Menendez has not returned his “blue slip” — the only time a Democrat has tried to block one of President Obama’s judicial choices.In legal circles, Mr. Menendez’s action has sparked speculation that he is blocking Judge Shwartz to get back at her companion of two decades, James Nobile. Mr. Nobile was in charge of the public corruption unit in New Jersey under Chris Christie, the current governor who was the United States attorney for New Jersey at the time, when his office issued a subpoena against Mr. Menendez in connection with a corruption investigation at the close of his 2006 election battle.Mr. Menendez claims that his opposition to Judge Shwartz was based on “substantive” concerns about her knowledge of constitutional law. His action sends a chilling message to prosecutors pursuing possible corruption by powerful politicians: Beware of future payback against friends or relatives. Mr. Menendez owes Judge Shwartz’s nomination a serious second look.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','DAKAR, Senegal — Tens of thousands of Nigerians took to the streets in cities across the country on Monday to protest a sudden sharp rise in oil prices after the government abruptly ended fuel subsidies. At the same time, a national strike over the oil price increase shut down much of the country.Protesters held signs with slogans like “Remove Corruption, Not Subsidies” and burned tires in the commercial capital, Lagos, as well as in Abuja, the political capital, and in Kano, a northern metropolis. Several protesters were killed as the police sought to contain the demonstrations, according to multiple news reports.Analysts said the size and breadth of Monday’s protests were unusual, though previous attempts over two decades to end the annual subsidies, now $7 billion, have also been met with fierce resistance, and the government has always backed down.Nigeria, one of the world’s leading crude-oil exporters, is forced to import nearly all of its gasoline because the country’s refineries are dysfunctional. The government pays the subsidy to middlemen, who have become extremely wealthy, so that the fuel can then be sold to the public at low rates.Fuel doubled in price in the past week, to about $3.50 per gallon from about $1.70 per gallon, after the government announced it was ending a program that amounted to about a quarter of the national budget. In a nation where poverty is widespread and the per capita gross domestic product is only about $2,300, according to State Department figures, the increase was expected to transfer a significant financial burden onto individuals.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','Reviewing a 1982 Carnegie Hall recital by Mr. Weissenberg in The New York Times, Bernard Holland called his rendition of Bach’s “Chromatic Fantasy” “chillingly scientific.” He added:“It was anatomy instruction conducted by a master — a brilliant dissection of cold, gray, gleaming flesh, from which every trace of living blood had been conscientiously squeezed away.”To his critics, Mr. Weissenberg had no shortage of articulate rejoinders. In a 1983 interview with The Globe and Mail of Canada, he had this to say about his unemotional stage demeanor:“You cannot lose your control physically and be precise as to what your hands do. Can you imagine a surgeon operating on somebody, and swooning and looking up at the ceiling and being very excited about it? The patient would die. That is what happens in music too. The patient dies, because there’s too much going on besides the actual performance.”In any case, as reviews over many years made clear, Mr. Weissenberg did sometimes give performances, or make recordings, that were simply, electrically, unequivocally breathtaking.Alexis Sigismond Weissenberg was born in Sofia, Bulgaria, on July 26, 1929. (He was billed as Sigi Weissenberg early in his career.) An only child, he was reared by his mother, a pianist from whom he took his first lessons.In 1941, after Bulgaria allied itself with the Axis Powers, Sigi and his mother, who were Jewish, attempted to cross into Turkey using false papers. As Mr. Weissenberg recounted in an autobiographical essay on his Web site, alexisweissenberg.com, they were detained for several months at a concentration camp on the border.With the aid of a sympathetic German officer, who loved the Schubert that Sigi played on an accordion he had managed to bring with him, they were able to escape. Mother and son made their way to Istanbul and eventually to Palestine. There, Sigi, already a fine pianist, performed with the Palestine Symphony and other orchestras.After the war, the young Mr. Weissenberg moved alone to New York, where he studied at the Juilliard School with the pianist Olga Samaroff and the composer Vincent Persichetti. In 1947, at 18, he won the Leventritt Award, a prestigious international music prize.He made his New York debut the next year at Carnegie Hall, playing Chopin’s E minor concerto with the New York Philharmonic under George Szell.In the mid-1950s, Mr. Weissenberg moved to France. By then, critical opinion had begun to dog him, and engagements on major stages were drying up. He took a long sabbatical from public performance, spending a decade teaching and studying.“As a young artist I learned new works very fast and played them much too soon,” he told Newsweek in 1977. “In 10 years I would have reached a point where my whole repertory would have been overplayed and understudied. I did not want to end up at the age of 50 still a ‘promising’ pianist.”He re-emerged in the mid-1960s, and by the 1970s was again performing widely.Mr. Weissenberg’s recordings include the complete Beethoven concertos with Herbert von Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic. He also wrote music for the piano; an album of Mr. Weissenberg’s compositions was recorded by the pianist Simon Mulligan for the Nimbus label in 2001.That Mr. Weissenberg’s artistry was not to every taste was a subject about which he could eventually wax coolly philosophical.“I still don’t know why my playing is considered so disturbing,” he told The Times in 1983. “I remember in school, as a child, I learned that the flame of a candle is composed of a yellow light, which actually burns, and a blue light within it, which is ice cold. That is true of human beings as well. Perhaps it is the sight of that blue light in me that frightens certain people.”'"
"'12-01-10,'1','The new chief of Apple, Timothy D. Cook, received a one-time stock award worth nearly $400 million, the largest given by a company in a decade.The company’s board granted Mr. Cook one million restricted stock units to signal its confidence in him after Steven P. Jobs turned over the helm of the company to his longtime lieutenant.The stock award, half of which vests in 2016 and the remaining half in 2021, was worth more than $376 million, based on the closing price of Apple’s shares on Aug. 24, 2011, the company said Monday in a public filing.“As far as a singular award, we haven’t seen anything this large in a long time,” said Aaron Boyd, head of research at Equilar, an executive compensation data firm.The only one-time stock award in recent memory that was worth more, said Mr. Boyd, was the January 2000 stock option package that Apple gave its co-founder, Mr. Jobs. The 40 million options in that award were valued at more than $600 million at the time, Mr. Boyd said.Mr. Jobs, who was ousted from Apple in the mid-1980s, returned to the company in 1997 and transformed Apple with a string of hit products including the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','Mr. Romney, whose standing in the state has slipped in recent days, anticipated the disparagement and is trying to put a human face on the business to push back against being portrayed as a greedy titan who saw his own wealth rise as companies that Bain acquired laid off workers and closed factories. Mr. Romney, who went into business after receiving law and business degrees from Harvard and grew up as the son of the chairman of , seemed to acknowledge that he still needed to do more to connect with voters.“For me, this is going to be a battle about describing my heart, my passion to help, if you will, the great majority of Americans,” Mr. Romney said. He worked to brush aside the criticism of Bain, adding: “I thought it was going to come from the president, from the Democrats, from the left, but instead it’s coming from Speaker Gingrich and apparently others.”On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, his Republican challengers were ready to pounce on any opening. When Mr. Romney argued that consumers should have more choices in how they get their , he said: “It also means that if you don’t like what they do, you can fire them.” He added, “I like being able to fire people who provide services to me.”Former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of seized on the remark barely an hour later, telling reporters at a rally in Concord, “Governor Romney enjoys firing people; I enjoy creating jobs.” He added, “It may be that he’s slightly out of touch with the economic reality playing out in America right now.”The campaign of Gov. Rick Perry of briefly invited visitors to its Web site to download Mr. Romney’s comments about liking “to fire people” as a ring tone. Mr. Perry poked fun at Mr. Romney’s weekend comments that he knew what it was like to fear a “pink slip” from a lost job. As he sought to salvage his candidacy in South Carolina, Mr. Perry told voters that Mr. Romney’s firm had shut down a plant and fired 150 workers in the nearby town of Gaffney.“I have no doubt Mitt Romney was worried about pink slips,” Mr. Perry said, adding, “I’m sure he was worried that he would run out of pink slips.”Representative Ron Paul of Texas also made a cameo in the wealth distribution debate, using terms that one might be more likely to hear at an rally. He did not mention Mr. Romney by name, but declared at a stop in Hollis: “The wealth is taken from the middle class and it goes to the select few, who are the insiders.”But it was Mr. Gingrich who led the charge, smiling and seeming to taunt his rival, saying: “We’ll see if he has broad shoulders and can stand the heat.”Former Senator Rick Santorum of , who is trying to emerge as the leading conservative alternative to Mr. Romney, said Monday that he would not participate in what he portrayed as attacks on free enterprise. “I’m not making it a liability,” Mr. Santorum told reporters in Derry. “I believe in the private sector.”, the conservative radio host, who has not been shy about expressing disagreement with Mr. Romney, came to his aid on Monday and said the language of Mr. Gingrich was “out of bounds for those who value the free market.” The chairman of the Club for Growth, Chris Chocola, called Mr. Gingrich’s comments “disgusting.”Democratic strategists were gleeful that Mr. Romney’s fellow Republicans were picking up the attack they have long been planning to make, which they hope will undermine the central rationale of Mr. Romney’s candidacy, that he alone has experience as a job creator.Yet advisers to the Romney campaign said they were pleased to have an argument that reminds voters of Mr. Romney’s private-sector experience at a time of economic anxiety, with one saying derisively that Mr. Gingrich had made himself into the “lead witness” of the Obama campaign’s expected general election attack.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','IN 2010, the Chicago Public Schools declined to hire Darrell Langdon for a job as a boiler-room engineer, because he had been convicted of possessing a half-gram of cocaine in 1985, a felony for which he received probation. It didn’t matter that Mr. Langdon, a single parent of two sons, had been clean since 1988 and hadn’t run into further trouble with the law. Only after The Chicago Tribune wrote about his case did the school system reverse its decision and offer him the job.A stunning number of young people are arrested for crimes in this country, and those crimes can haunt them for the rest of their lives. In 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Crime Commission found that about half of American males could expect to be arrested for a nontraffic offense some time in their lives, mostly in their late teens and early 20s. An article just published in the journal Pediatrics shows how the arrest rate has grown — by age 23, 30 percent of Americans have been arrested, compared with 22 percent in 1967. The increase reflects in part the considerable growth in arrests for drug offenses and domestic violence.The impact of these arrests is felt for years. The ubiquity of criminal-background checks and the efficiency of information technology in maintaining those records and making them widely available, have meant that millions of Americans — even those who served probation or parole but were never incarcerated — continue to pay a price long after the crime. In November the American Bar Association released a database identifying more than 38,000 punitive provisions that apply to people convicted of crimes, pertaining to everything from public housing to welfare assistance to occupational licenses. More than two-thirds of the states allow hiring and professional-licensing decisions to be made on the basis of an arrest alone.Employers understandably want to protect their employees and customers from risk. Yet at the same time, there is a growing public interest in facilitating job opportunities for those who have stayed crime-free for a reasonable period of time. The weak economy and a rethinking of the logic of mass incarceration — driven in large part by budget pressures — have also brought attention to the situations of ex-offenders like Mr. Langdon, who face the collateral consequences of conviction long after their involvement with the criminal justice system has ended. Federal authorities are beginning to pay attention. Last April, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. urged state attorneys general to review laws and policies “to determine whether those that impose burdens on individuals convicted of crimes without increasing public safety should be eliminated.”It is well established that the risk of recidivism drops steadily with time, but there is still the question of how long is long enough. By looking at data for more than 88,000 people who had their first arrest in New York State in 1980, and tracking their subsequent criminal histories over the next 25 years, we estimate the “redemption time” — the time it takes for an individual’s likelihood of being arrested to be close to that of individuals with no criminal records — to be about 10 to 13 years. We also found that about 30 percent of the first-time offenders in 1980 were never arrested again, in New York or anywhere else.Employers could apply their own judgments around those estimates, but the real problem is the state and local rules — often embedded in statutes — that restrict employment or licensing for the rest of the individual’s life. In New York, former offenders can be forever denied licenses for certain jobs, ranging from beer distributor to real estate broker. Such “forever rules” — which fall heavily on minorities, who are particularly likely to be arrested — are inherently unfair.'"

"'12-01-10,'1','The concern that the quick hiring of McDaniels is unfair, although allowed by the N.F.L., and that he possesses extra insight into the Broncos roster he helped assemble that could aid the Patriots is probably overblown. The Patriots played the Broncos a month ago and have a season’s worth of game film to absorb.“I just stay in my lane,” Fox said, trying to avoid a controversy. “I let other people make the rules.”McDaniels bequeathed what seemed a questionable — or brilliant, depending on the game — gift to Fox and the franchise. With authority over personnel decisions, McDaniels had drafted receiver Demaryius Thomas in 2010 ahead of the more highly regarded Dez Bryant. Three spots later, he stunned the N.F.L. when he selected Tebow, at least a full round ahead of where most thought Tebow should go. McDaniels immediately insisted Tebow would not switch positions — a popular suggestion now and then — but would play quarterback.Tebow and Thomas connected on an 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play of overtime against the Steelers, propelling the Broncos to the divisional round. Another McDaniels draft pick, Robert Ayers, had two sacks. Suddenly McDaniels, criticized as having too much personnel power and using it poorly, can lay claim to putting in place the foundation for the Broncos’ startling renaissance. On Monday, Fox took pains to say that many people had a hand in drafting those players. But McDaniels had the final say, as Bill Belichick does in New England, and he might have been the only person in the N.F.L. who would have taken Tebow when he did.The inheritance has been a mixed blessing for Fox and John Elway, the team’s top executive. They reluctantly turned to Tebow this season — remember the fan billboards imploring them to do so? — and since he has been the starter, they have sometimes strained to sound fully supportive. The erratic success of Tebow, even though he remains a flawed quarterback, has essentially boxed them in, probably canceling any plans they might have had to seek another potential starter for next season.There seem to be, at best, mixed feelings for McDaniels in Denver, even among players. When Ayers was asked if McDaniels would have an advantage in game preparation if he were allowed to videotape practice, Ayers jokingly looked up to the ceiling for cameras. Without saying as much, he made it clear he was less than thrilled that McDaniels was allowed to join the Patriots’ staff in time for this week’s game. And although Thomas said McDaniels did a good thing for the organization by drafting him and Tebow, Ayers, a first-round pick in 2009, did not seem to want to credit McDaniels with too much.“God put me in a situation to get drafted where I did and blessed me with the ability,” Ayers said. “Josh McDaniels pulled the trigger on me with the 18th pick. I thank God, and I also give him a little credit for that, too.”How much credit McDaniels deserves remains an open question. He did not play Tebow when he was the coach, and his intent was to turn Tebow into something closer to a pocket passer. That is what the current Broncos brain trust would prefer, too. But Fox had a different vision, one that meant using the skills Tebow possesses now, and that is the one that has catapulted the Broncos forward, haltingly, perhaps, but definitely forward into the next round of the playoffs.In the richest twist of Tebow’s remarkable odyssey, McDaniels — one of the few people who believed Tebow could play quarterback in the N.F.L., and who was fired in part for the personnel mistakes he made — will be hoping Saturday night that Tebow reverts to the player almost everyone except McDaniels thought he was.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','Alcoa, the aluminum producer, posted its first net loss in more than a year on Monday on fewer orders for its products.Aluminum prices dropped about 12 percent in the fourth quarter. They have fallen more than 27 percent from their peak in April.Alcoa’s performance can reflect global economic trends because its products are used in a wide range of businesses like aircraft, automobiles, commercial vehicles like semitrailers, construction and pipe for the oil and gas industry. About half of its sales are in the United States. An additional 27 percent are in Europe.As a result, Alcoa has looked for ways to reduce costs. It plans to cut global smelting capacity 12 percent by closing a smelter in Alcoa, Tenn., and curtailing operations in Texas, Italy and Spain.Alcoa said that it lost $191 million, or 18 cents a share, in the October-to-December quarter. That compares with income of $258 million, or 24 cents a share, a year ago. It was the company’s first net loss since the first quarter of 2010.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','While the recession crimped spending by consumers, employers and state and local governments, the federal government picked up the slack.Federal health spending shot up 40 percent in three years, to $743 billion in 2010, from $530 billion in 2007, the report said. Some of the growth resulted from an increase in Medicaid enrollment and a temporary increase in the federal share of Medicaid spending, authorized by the economic stimulus law of 2009.Medicare spending, for older Americans and the disabled, grew in 2010 by 5 percent, the smallest rate of increase in more than a decade, the report said. The main reason was a slowdown in spending for the managed care program known as Medicare Advantage.Although some provisions of President Obama’s health care overhaul took effect in 2010, government economists said they had had little impact on the overall level of health spending and, in some cases, simply shifted payments from one source to another.One of the more remarkable findings in the report is that increases in the volume and intensity of health care services made only a tiny contribution to the growth of health spending in 2010. In the past, this factor, reflecting increases in the number and complexity of procedures, was often cited as a major reason for higher health spending.In 2010, the study said, hospitals reported a decline in admissions and slower growth in emergency room visits and outpatient visits. Likewise, it said, doctor’s office visits declined, and spending for doctors’ services grew just 1.8 percent, to $416 billion in 2010. Total health spending averaged $8,402 a person, up 3.1 percent from 2009, the report said.Doctors often prescribe drugs during office visits, and the decline in visits helped slow the growth of drug spending, as did the use of lower-cost generic medications. The number of prescriptions filled rose just 1.2 percent in 2010, and total retail spending on prescription drugs also grew 1.2 percent, to $259 billion, the slowest rate of growth in a half-century, the report said.For the first time in seven years, total private health insurance premiums grew faster than insurers’ spending on health care benefits, the administration said. Premiums totaled $849 billion in 2010, while spending on benefits totaled $746 billion. The difference includes administrative costs and profits.The White House said the gap showed that the new health care law was needed to “keep insurance companies in check.” Under the law, insurers must disclose and justify premium increases larger than 10 percent.In 2010, Ms. Martin said, “total spending on private health insurance benefits grew at the slowest rate in the 51-year history of the national health expenditure accounts.” Private insurance spending slowed, she said, because fewer people had private insurance, insurers shifted some costs to subscribers, charging higher co-payments and deductibles, and some subscribers switched to health plans with lower premiums.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Early Monday afternoon, as the rookie cornerback Prince Amukamara was addressing a group of reporters in the Giants’ locker room, the veteran Jimmy Kennedy sneaked up behind the pack.Kennedy watched for a few moments as Amukamara, who had on his backpack and was standing by the exit, spoke about his play in Sunday’s playoff victory against the Atlanta Falcons. Then Kennedy listened as Amukamara — echoing a theme espoused by other defensive players — talked about how the Giants were in a different place now as opposed to December, when they lost a close game to their next opponent, the Green Bay Packers.“Excuse me, Prince, I have a question,” he said. “Do you really think you’re going to leave today without doing cardio?”Indeed, some things never change. But while veterans will forever give grief to their rookie teammates, the Giants — specifically their defense — are embracing a recent transformation. As they began preparations for Sunday’s N.F.C. divisional playoff game at Lambeau Field, many of the players trained their focus on the positive developments that have taken place since the last time they saw Aaron Rodgers and the Packers.That game, a 38-35 defeat on Dec. 4, is a two-pronged memory for the Giants’ defense. Yes, they played the undefeated Packers close, but they also surrendered 31 points (the other 7 came on an interception returned for a touchdown) and could not stop Rodgers on the final drive as he drove Green Bay toward the winning field goal.'"

No immediate cause was given, but Mr. Sanhá was known to have diabetes and had been at the hospital for some time.Mr. Sanhá had become less known for his work as the president than for his frequent hospitalizations abroad, which were always described by aides as routine checkups.Since gaining independence from Portugal in 1974, Guinea-Bissau has had series of coups. Just two weeks ago, the army said a top military official had tried to seize power while Mr. Sanhá was ill.The country has also become one of the main transit points for drug traffickers ferrying cocaine to Europe.Mr. Sanhá won the 2009 presidential election, held after his predecessor, President João Bernardo Vieira, was assassinated.

"'12-01-10,'1','NEWARK — No hard, fast rule dictates that an orchestra has to engage in elaborate sleight of hand when presenting an unfamiliar work; still, there is something to be said for creating a useful context. A uniting theme, however basic, can provide a starting point for appraising a new or uncommon piece. Surrounding it with familiar music that is in some way related allows the audience to discover and apply its own connections.Jacques Lacombe, a French Canadian conductor now in his second season as music director of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, has proved himself a shrewd programmer. During his inaugural season he introduced a new winter festival, Man & Nature: Exploring the Elements in Music, with a series titled Water, matching canonical works like Debussy’s oceanic piece “La Mer” with fresher fare like Tan Dun’s inventive, splashy “Water Concerto.” More than just a series of concerts linked with an elemental gimmick, the festival included displays by New Jersey artisans and lectures by representatives of conservation initiatives.On Friday night at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center here, Mr. Lacombe and the orchestra opened their second winter festival, Fire, with a program built around a relative rarity: “Prometheus: The Poem of Fire,” by the Russian composer, poet and mystic Alexander Scriabin. The program, which was repeated on Saturday night in New Brunswick, N.J., and reviewed on Sunday afternoon at the center, offered what were said to be the orchestra’s first performances of a Scriabin work.Just presenting “Prometheus” was no small feat for this ambitious, neighborly ensemble, but Mr. Lacombe went further. Scriabin, who proposed synesthetic connections among specific keys, colors and temperaments, included in “Prometheus” a part for a color organ, which would project colored lights during a performance. Mr. Lacombe engaged Al Crawford, the president of the lighting-design firm Arc3design, to make Scriabin’s intent manifest.Onstage next to Yevgeny Sudbin, a prodigious Russian pianist and a noted Scriabin advocate, Mr. Crawford triggered lights from an electronic keyboard. Projected on five circular reflectors hanging overhead, violet light saturated the stage during the work’s low, rumbling opening chords. Throughout the piece beams of rose, green and white shone in restless permutations and complex fusions; the final bars, per Scriabin’s instructions, came with a blinding white flash.The display could have amounted to mere novelty, had the ensemble not delivered the goods musically. Unfamiliarity presumably accounted for a few isolated smudges, but on the whole the orchestra mastered this brilliant, diffuse and fitful music. Mr. Sudbin, making his New Jersey Symphony debut, played with elegance and vivacity.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','As many as four House seats hang in the balance, experts in election administration say.The legal question for the justices was how to treat maps drawn by legislatures in states with a history of discrimination. Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, changes in voting procedures in such states cannot take effect until they have been approved by either the Justice Department or a special three-judge court in Washington.Texas sought approval from the special Washington court, but it has not yet received an answer, though the special court has indicated that it is unlikely to approve at least some of the Legislature’s map. Because there were no approved maps as the first primaries in Texas loomed, the San Antonio court, which was hearing challenges to the Legislature’s maps under a different part of the Voting Rights Act, drew the competing set of maps.Officials in Texas asked the Supreme Court to block those judge-drawn maps, saying they did not give enough deference to the Legislature. Paul D. Clement, a lawyer representing Texas, told the justices on Monday that the San Antonio court should have used the legislative map as a starting point while the approval process was pending.Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that would turn Section 5 on its head. Justice Antonin Scalia, on the other hand, appeared inclined to allow Texas to use its Legislature’s maps until a court ruled that they were invalid.Chief Justice Roberts seemed to say that both of his colleagues had a point.“You cannot assume that the Legislature’s plan should be treated as if it were precleared,” he said.“But on the other hand,” he went on, the San Antonio court “can’t draw its interim plan assuming that there are going to be these Section 5 violations.”The case is a result of a population boom in Texas, which gained more than four million people in the last decade, about 65 percent of them Hispanic. The growth entitled the state to four additional Congressional seats.Justice Anthony M. Kennedy mused that the procedures created by Section 5, which upend the usual presumption that a duly enacted state law is valid, may no longer make sense.“Section 5 applies only to some states and not others,” he said. “Texas is at a tremendous disadvantage here.”The court ducked that issue in a 2009 decision but indicated that it might soon return to it and strike down the provision.“There’s a terrible history of discrimination in Texas,” said Jose Garza, a lawyer representing challengers to the legislative map.Chief Justice Roberts interrupted him. “The constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act is not at issue here, right?” he asked. Mr. Garza agreed.The question, instead, was what to do given that the special court in Washington has neither approved nor disapproved the Legislature’s maps. It did, however, reject Texas’s request for summary approval of its maps, saying the state had used “an improper standard or methodology to determine which districts afford minority voters to elect their preferred candidates of choice.”The case before the special court in Washington is scheduled to be tried this month, and that court may issue a final decision in early February.But for the press of time, there appeared to be some sentiment on the Supreme Court to allow the special court in Washington to complete its work before the justices ruled. But for primaries to proceed in April, Mr. Clement said, Texas needs to know which maps to use by Feb. 1.The three cases before the Supreme Court justices were Perry v. Perez, No 11-713, on the Texas House, Perry v. Davis, No. 11-714, on redistricting the State Senate, and Perry v. Perez, No. 11-715, on the House of Representatives.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','Many dog owners regard their furry friends as their children, and talk to them accordingly.Now, a new study reports that dogs, like infants, are able to study minor details in human communication and correctly interpret intent.Researchers from Hungary published the study in the journal Current Biology.They presented dogs with two videos. In the first, a woman says, “Hi, dog,” while looking straight at the camera. The woman then turns her head toward a container.The dog follows her gaze.However, when the woman is looking down, rather than at the camera, as she says, “Hi, dog,” the dog does not follow her subsequent gaze.Dogs pick up on the subtle difference in the woman’s behavior in the two situations, said Adam Miklosi, a behavioral biologist at Eotvos Lorand University in Budapest and one of the study’s authors.The study shows that dogs can read human behavior, he said, and understand when they are being addressed.Other studies have shown that infants have the same ability to interpret an adult’s intent.“Dogs are functionally similar to a 6-month-old, to a 1-year-old,” Dr. Miklosi said, “though how the dog mind is dealing with the problem, we don’t really know, and it’s probably different from an infant.”'"
"'12-01-10,'1','The first Haitian to get cholera at the onset of the 2010 epidemic was almost undoubtedly a 28-year-old mentally disturbed man from the town of Mirebalais, researchers reported Monday.The man, whose name was not revealed in the report, in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, was known as the village “moun fou” — Creole for “crazy person” — said the authors, who work for Partners in Health, a Boston group associated with Dr. Paul E. Farmer that has provided free health care in Haiti since 1987.Although his family had clean drinking water, the man often walked naked through town to bathe and drink from the Latem River just downstream from the Meye River, into which raw sewage drained from an encampment of United Nations peacekeepers from Nepal.Haiti’s outbreak was of a Nepali strain, and that encampment is considered the source.The man developed severe diarrhea on Oct. 12, 2010, and died in less than 24 hours. Two people who washed his body for a wake fell ill 48 hours later. Haiti’s first hospitalized cholera case was in Mirebalais on Oct. 17.The epidemic has since sickened nearly 500,000 people across Haiti and killed nearly 7,000.The man’s habits made him the first known victim, said Dr. Louise C. Ivers, one of the new report’s authors. But because of the “infamous living situation” in Mirebalais, which is desperately poor and was swollen with refugees from the devastating earthquake nine months earlier, the epidemic was inevitable.“Plenty of families drank from that river, and still do despite the risk,” she said.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','Physical exercise in children improves not only cardiovascular health but also academic performance, an analysis of several studies has found.The review, published in The Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, covered 14 prospective studies that included at least one measure of physical activity and one of cognitive skill or academic achievement.Nine studies compared students based on participation in gym classes or organized sports, rather than on measurements of physical activity. These produced inconsistent conclusions.But all three of the studies that measured time spent in physical activity found it associated with academic performance, and the two rated highest in methodological quality confirmed a positive relationship between physical activity and school achievement.The reasons for the connection are unknown, but the researchers suggest that exercise increases the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain and may lead to increased levels of norepinephrine and endorphins, important in stress reduction.The lead author, Amika S. Singh, a senior researcher at VU University Medical Center in the Netherlands, said there was no evidence about exactly how much or what kind of exercise is beneficial. But, she added, “I think it’s healthy to look for a good balance between time spent in academic work and in physical activity.”'"
"'12-01-10,'1','The report found fault with almost every one of India’s airlines, although the regulator said it had yet to examine Air India’s international operations.The concerns included a shortage of pilots at Air India Express, the state carrier’s budget airline; a shortage of engines and a spate of pilot departures at Kingfisher Airlines; a two-year delay in auditing international operations at Jet Airways; a lack of instructors for the Boeing 737 aircraft at SpiceJet; and incomplete investigations of incidents at IndiGo.The Indian airline industry is nearing a crisis after rapid growth, analysts say. In the last seven years, according to the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation, passenger numbers have tripled, to more than 150 million last year. About $14 billion has been invested in aircraft and more than $25 billion in the whole industry in that time, but the growth in pilots, flight trainers, regulatory safety experts and maintenance engineers has not kept pace with demand, according to analysts and regulators themselves.Stiff competition in the industry has recently driven down revenue to the point where several airlines are nearing bankruptcy, raising more safety concerns.“The airline sector is broadly at a brink of financial disaster,” said Kapil Kaul, the South Asia chief executive at the Center for Asia Pacific Aviation. “Most of them don’t have a business case to exist, and fund-raising options have dried up.”The Indian airline industry has lost $5 billion to $6 billion in the last five years and this year was expected to lose an additional $2 billion, he said.While in other parts of the world, some airlines may have consolidated or shut, in India they remained in business in part because they are financed by entrepreneurs who have a personal stake in trying to make the business work, Mr. Kaul said.“The airlines which are surviving are beyond business,” he said.The report did not discuss direct dangers to passengers. Mr. Kaul said that if the regulator had thought passengers were at risk, it would have grounded airlines.IndiGo, one of the few Indian airlines that is not losing money, disputed the regulator’s report, saying, among other things, that the airline had removed engines early to comply with a directive from the Federal Aviation Administration in the United States about one engine model, and that all employees were “strongly encouraged” to report any safety issues.A spokeswoman for GoAir said that the airline had met with the regulator on Jan. 6 about the report and that the regulator had “fully accepted” GoAir’s response. “GoAir has always been committed to guarantee high safety standards and will continue to invest all the resources necessary to keep our standards at the highest level,” she said.Jet Airways said, “All points raised by the report have been clarified and accepted by the safety department of D.G.C.A. Guest safety is of paramount importance at Jet Airways and JetLite,” a Jet subsidiary.'"
"'12-01-10,'1','The holidays may have created a lull in the action, but the new year promised to be just as hectic as the old for European leaders and Mrs. Merkel in particular. The head of the , , will arrive Tuesday evening for talks with the German chancellor. ’s prime minister, , is scheduled to come to Berlin on Wednesday.Mrs. Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy are scheduled to travel to on Jan. 20 for negotiations with the Italian government ahead of the next European Union summit in on Jan. 30.“Everyone would like a grand design rather than a series of small steps going forward, some going backwards,” said André Sapir, an economist and senior fellow at Bruegel, a research group based in Brussels. “Sometimes there doesn’t seem to be a design at all, and that has been unnerving investors being asked to refinance debt both private and public.”A drumbeat of bad economic news lately has led many economists to predict the imminent return to recession for many of the countries that use the euro. At the same time, European countries and financial institutions need to raise about $2.4 trillion in 2012.Asked whether she feared that more European nations might be downgraded by ratings agencies, further spooking markets, Mrs. Merkel replied coolly, “Fear does not motivate my political actions.”The gap between the countries with sound finances, and those like Italy and that are forced to pay high rates, has widened to a chasm of five percentage points or more. Germany on Monday joined the likes of the and as perceived safe havens where buyers of short-term debt are willing to lose money in return for shelter from upheaval and the possibility of even greater losses.Mrs. Merkel called the plan to stabilize the euro “an ambitious but attainable goal.” She hit several familiar themes, emphasizing that there were no quick solutions to the euro crisis and that Greece was an exception when it came to debt write-downs, often known as a “haircut,” for private investors.“Our intention is that no country must withdraw from the euro area,” Mrs. Merkel said.She and Mr. Sarkozy both voiced their determination to press ahead with a on financial transactions opposed by , but they appeared to diverge on the timing. Mr. Sarkozy, facing a strong left-wing challenge in his bid for re-election in May, suggested France might go it alone and challenge other countries to follow suit.The French prime minister, , said Monday in that France might present a bill on such a tax in February, hoping that other countries do the same. “Someone has to be the first to jump in the water,” Mr. Fillon said.Mrs. Merkel expressed support for Mr. Sarkozy’s goal of moving quickly on the financial-transaction tax, saying that European Union finance ministers should make a formal proposal by March. Although an agreement between the 27 members of the union was preferable, one among the 17 members that use the euro was acceptable.“If Sarkozy loses the election, which is entirely possible, the Socialists would certainly be a more difficult partner for Merkel,” said Frank Decker, a political scientist at the Institute for Political Sciences and Sociology at the University of . “As a result, she looks for ways that she can strengthen his position.”'"
"'12-01-10,'1','“Switzerland is losing an outstanding central banker with excellent international connections, which have brought great benefit to our country,” the Bank Council of the Swiss National Bank said Monday. Mr. Hildebrand said he could not prove that he did not know about a transaction of 400,000 Swiss francs, or $500,000, by his wife, Kashya, last August, just before the bank stepped up its intervention in currency markets.The bank released an e-mail from Mrs. Hildebrand to the couple’s adviser at Bank Sarasin in which she wrote, “We would like to increase our dollar exposure to 50 percent.” Mr. Hildebrand acknowledged that use of the word “we” would cause some people to doubt his version of events.Mr. Hildebrand said he sent an e-mail to the adviser the next day ordering that no further trades be made without his approval, and he informed the S.N.B.’s general counsel of the trade.“I never lied,” Mr. Hildebrand said. But, he said, “I can’t once and for all prove that it was the way I said it was.” He said he was resigning because he feared the accusations might have been a burden “during a time when total focus is needed on the duties” of the office. “Credibility is a central banker’s most valuable asset,” he said.Thomas J. Jordan, vice chairman of the S.N.B. governing board, will be the acting leader of the bank. Mr. Jordan is an economist who has worked at the bank since 1997. He is known for being slightly more hard-line on inflation than Mr. Hildebrand. But analysts said they did not expect a major shift in course.“We do not expect any change in the conduct of the Swiss monetary policy,” Julien Manceaux, an analyst at ING Bank, wrote to clients, adding, the exchange rate floor “is here to stay, with or without Philipp Hildebrand.”For much of the last three years, the S.N.B. has battled to keep investors from bidding up the value of the franc, which is seen as a haven from global turmoil. Its rise against the euro and other currencies threatened to make Swiss exports too costly.Mr. Hildebrand said he would also leave the board of the Bank for International Settlements, an institution based in Basel, Switzerland, that acts as a clearinghouse for national central banks. He will also resign as one of two Swiss representatives on the board of governors of the International Monetary Fund.“This is a step which saddens me greatly,” Mr. Hildebrand said. “I depart on good terms, and I would like to think I have been a damn good central banker.”Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of Canada and chairman of the Financial Stability Board, said in a statement that Mr. Hildebrand “has been instrumental in helping to manage the response to the global financial crisis and in developing major reforms to strengthen the resiliency and stability of the international financial system.”While Mr. Hildebrand earned renown outside Switzerland, he had critics at home. The right-wing Swiss People’s Party accused him of squandering the national wealth on intervention to buy euros and other currencies, whose value continued to fall against the Swiss franc, resulting in losses for the central bank.The party acknowledged playing a role in Mr. Hildebrand’s ouster, serving as the conduit for information taken from Bank Sarasin. A former information technology worker there faces criminal charges of violating bank secrecy laws in the case.Mr. Hildebrand probably will not be missed by many in the banking industry, either. He is a former banker — he and his wife met while both worked at Moore Capital Management, a hedge fund in New York.After the S.N.B. rescued the Swiss bank UBS in 2008, Mr. Hildebrand became a visible advocate of measures to limit the level of risk that banks take. He suggested Monday that his stands might have contributed to the vehemence of the attacks on him. He said a friend sent him an e-mail quoting Woodrow Wilson: “If you want to make enemies, change some things.”Mrs. Hildebrand apologized to the Swiss people and to her husband, Reuters reported. “I failed my husband by not considering the perception of a ‘conflict of interest’ created by my purchase of dollars,” she said. “My husband is a man of the utmost integrity, and I deeply regret that my actions might have led anyone to question this.”'"
"'12-01-10,'1','The chairman of the Swiss National Bank, Philipp Hildebrand, resigned after a scandal over a  currency trade made by his wife, the central bank said on Monday.The Swiss National Bank said in a brief statement that Mr. Hildebrand would speak about his decision at a media briefing later in Berne and make available a number of unspecified documents.Mr. Hildebrand's wife, Kashya, a former hedge fund trader who now runs a Zurich art gallery, bought 400,000 Swiss francs worth of dollars, or about $418,000, on Aug. 15, three weeks before her husband oversaw steps to cap the rise of the franc.Mr. Hildebrand last week rejected calls to step down, saying he learned of his wife's trade only the following day, rejecting claims by the Swiss magazine Weltwoche that he had personally authorized the currency deal, which made a big profit.'"

"'12-01-11,'0','“It is really inexplicable,” said Brandon Jones, a former Democratic state representative who had tried to pass legislation that would have added some oversight to the pardoning process. “I think that in some ways he has broken the mold.”Before the list became public, an outcry had grown about the pardons or other grants of clemency that were known. They numbered only 13 as of last weekend. Eight of them had been convicted of murder and had spent some time at the governor’s mansion.Having inmates perform tasks, like waiting on tables, at the governor’s mansion is a long-held custom and not unique to Mississippi. Suzanne Singletary, director of communications for the state’s Department of Corrections, said only certain inmates are eligible to work in the governor’s mansion, and are reviewed by correctional staff as well as by the governor’s staff for security concerns. They remain in custody while living on the mansion grounds.It is also common in Mississippi for such workers to eventually be pardoned by the governor, who is entrusted with that ability by the state’s Constitution.In Georgia, while inmates do work at the mansion, the governor does not have the power to pardon; in Louisiana, the governor can do so only if four out of five members of the state’s pardon board agree.Governor Barbour came under fire in 2008 for granting clemency to four convicted murderers. The news that another five had gained full pardons, and were released on Sunday, angered victims’ families, who said they were not consulted beforehand.On Monday, they joined Democratic state officials at a news conference in Jackson, the state capital. One of the speakers was Tiffany Brewer, whose sister was killed by one of those pardoned, David Glenn Gatlin.In 1993, Mr. Gatlin shot his wife, Tammy, while she was holding their 6-week-old baby, and then wounded her friend Randy Walker. Mr. Gatlin was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, and as recently as last month was turned down by the Mississippi Parole Board.The day after learning that Mr. Gatlin had been turned down for parole, Tammy Gatlin’s family was told that he would be released.“It’s awful; it really is,” said Ms. Brewer, her sister. “There’s pain, fear for our lives. Disappointment. Disgust.”'"
"'12-01-11,'0','In a faint voice, Danielo Morpeau, who is still learning English and speaks with a slight Haitian accent, read two of the first words he learned while living in New York: “melatonin,” to aid sleep, and “ Celexa ,” to treat depression.Danielo, 14, sitting on a futon in his family’s living room in Queens, had pulled out his small brown prescription bottles from beneath a table. He has leukemia, which, his father said, manifested itself after the family left Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in the wake of the January 2010 earthquake that ravaged the country.“It began with a cough,” Danielo’s father, Paul Eddy Morpeau, 47, said. “We’re from Haiti, where it’s rarely cold, and we thought it was normal after living in New York.”But the coughing, which began in September 2010, six months after the family’s arrival in Queens, only grew, and Danielo became weaker.“He never got better,” Mr. Morpeau said. “Only worse.”After two months of continual coughing and a growing fatigue, Danielo had blood tests at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center. When the results came back, in December 2010, he was rushed on doctors’ orders to the hospital.“I remember that day,” Mr. Morpeau said. “I was at work and I left immediately to the hospital. We were told he had cancer.”With a few hugs, kisses and tears, Mr. Morpeau, his wife, Benodette Morpeau, and their daughter, Ondine, watched as Danielo was taken into isolation for treatment.“I could only take my Bible with me,” Danielo recalled.He spent seven months getting treatment as his family, wrapped in sterile clothes from head to toe, remained by his side and prayed for his recovery.The process was grueling, Ms. Morpeau, 47, said as she, too, sat on the futon, which serves as Danielo’s bed and is next to a small folding cot where Ondine, 16, sleeps.Ms. Morpeau began crying as she looked through pictures of Danielo in the hospital. He was unconscious in nearly all the photos. He was also bald and skinny, with tubes protruding from his arms and nose. His sister is sitting next to him in one photo, watching. That is all they could do for months, Ms. Morpeau said.“I came with my sick son and every day he’s getting worse,” she said she remembers thinking to herself. “We didn’t come here expecting to have a sick son.”It was an ordeal to watch him suffer in a new country while he was unable to communicate, said Ms. Morpeau, who speaks Creole and French. It was also challenging to live someplace that did not feel like home, she said.The Morpeaus are coping with haunting memories of the earthquake as they try to build a new life in a one-bedroom apartment that sits atop a church. Ms. Morpeau had been a teacher when her school crumbled in the quake. Mr. Morpeau had worked as a network administrator for the nonprofit organization CARE Ayiti. When they arrived in Queens, they struggled to find work and pay rent. That was all overshadowed by Danielo’s illness.But his parents said the reason he had the opportunity to beat cancer was because he was in the United States.“Cancer is a death sentence in Haiti,” Mr. Morpeau said. “There’s no hope.”The Morpeaus came to the United States with the intention of applying for the temporary protected status given to Haitians after the earthquake, which they received.The mother and sister of Mr. Morpeau live in Far Rockaway, Queens, but he said he could not rely on relatives for financial help during Danielo’s treatment. “Many families were stretched,” said Sylviane Mauriol, the family’s caseworker at Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. She added, “It was about means and the state of the economy.”But the Morpeaus did get emotional support from their relatives and a Haitian earthquake survivors support group created by caseworkers at Catholic Charities. Danielo’s homecoming from the hospital in July, however, did not put an end to the family’s challenges. Mr. Morpeau had lost his job around that time because his employment authorization card had expired.The family, ineligible for public assistance or benefits, had relied solely on Mr. Morpeau’s income from his security job at Kennedy International Airport to pay the $800 rent. But the family fell behind. Ms. Mauriol used $400 in Neediest Cases money to pay half the back rent, while Catholic Charities paid the balance.“It’s not easy for us,” Mr. Morpeau said, “and that money was very helpful.”The creators of the Haitian support group, Lystra Madoo-Devine and John Woolley, helped Mr. Morpeau find another job as a security officer after he renewed his employment authorization card. Ms. Morpeau is attending a home health aide program in Brooklyn.Danielo’s leukemia is in remission, but he continues to get therapy, covered by the state’s Child Health Plus insurance program. He now has a full head of hair, and is attending Intermediate School 238.The rest of the Morpeaus are doing better, too, as they strive to help those left behind in Haiti.“We have hope and each other,” Mr. Morpeau said. “God helps us. God can do anything.”'"
"'12-01-11,'0','BRASÍLIA (AP) — Justice Minister José Eduardo Cardozo said Tuesday that Brazil would grant visas to thousands of Haitians who arrived recently in remote areas of the Amazon seeking work.The government said it would propose allowing a limited number of additional Haitians to come to Brazil — as many as 100 a month — by granting them temporary visas. But the government also made clear that it would step up the policing of Brazil’s borders with Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, where the Haitians are crossing.Thousands of Haitians have made arduous journeys to the Brazilian Amazon over the past year in a desperate search for work as Haiti struggles in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 earthquake.Mr. Cardozo said that Brazil would grant work visas to 2,400 Haitians who are stuck in two Amazon border towns and that an additional 1,600 Haitians in Brazil have been given visas already.Demand for manual labor in Brazil is increasing for projects related to the 2014 World Cup and the 2016 Olympics.Job seekers from nations like Pakistan and India who follow similar Amazonian routes to the country are usually expelled, but Brazil has made an exception for Haitians. Some authorities in Brasiléia and Tabatinga, where many Haitians land, have warned of strains trying to feed and house the Haitians while their visa applications are reviewed.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','Mr. Fernández and other business executives are now in the thick of efforts to recover the city’s peace. Their companies helped design the advertising image and campaign for the new state police force, and they are staffing recruiting booths and a call center. They are also paying part of the cost of government redevelopment plans, injecting money into community groups and sponsoring school programs.This burst of largess is relatively new for Mexico, where until recently corporate philanthropy had moved little past handing out toys to orphans at Christmas. Experts say it is still evolving.“In the last 5 or 10 years there has been progress both in terms of the quantity of the money and the quality,” said Michael Layton, director of the Philanthropy and Civil Society Project at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico. “But I don’t think Mexico has caught up to Brazil and other countries where the business sector has taken corporate philanthropy to heart.”Javier García Justicia, a sociology professor at the University of Monterrey, contends that most companies here could give much more. “There are companies that have really climbed aboard,” he said.“Others see it as a type of publicity,” he added, noting that they have assigned unqualified people to their corporate responsibility teams and seemed mostly concerned with splashy newspaper advertisements.He advises a new alliance of Monterrey corporations known as Red Sumarse, which plans to strengthen nongovernmental organizations working on community development. The telephone company Axtel and the tortilla maker Gruma lead about 20 companies in a public-private partnership that is adapting an American program, Gear Up, to invest in school infrastructure and encourage children not to drop out.The history of Monterrey is entwined with the powerful families that founded its industries more than a century ago. To them, the fraying of the city’s social fabric is personal.As the city’s chaos grew, Lorenzo Zambrano, the chief executive of Cemex, the world’s largest building-materials supplier, posted a furious message on Twitter.“He who leaves Monterrey is a coward,” he wrote in a comment that still resonates, almost 18 months later. “We have to take back our great city.”The city’s turmoil is also a sign of a Mexican reality that business leaders now admit was long ignored. “Violence is an expression of social inequality,” Mr. Zambrano said in a recent interview.Mr. Fernández can point to a personal watershed moment: the day when two Femsa security guards were killed in a shootout outside the exclusive American school in August 2010. It became clear to him then that violence was no longer a problem only for the slums.“I dedicate 20 to 25 percent of my time on this issue,” he said, flipping through documents outlining Femsa’s social programs. “When before I didn’t spend almost any time on it.”The company’s retail subsidiary Oxxo, for example, has begun a project in the run-down neighborhood just behind its headquarters. Along with two other companies and several community groups, Oxxo has a plan to build parks, open job opportunities and work to keep teenagers out of gangs.The most visible example of what has been done with help from the private sector sits on the prow of a mountainside looking over the city.Right in the middle of Independencia, a neighborhood so violent that children know how to take cover when shooting starts, is a sunlit community center, opened a few months ago. Women hop about in a midday aerobics class in the gym. Guitar chords waft from the music room, and children move knee-high chess pieces across a board laid out in the garden.The center, which looks out over new soccer fields and basketball courts, is the brainchild of Javier Treviño, a former Cemex executive who is now an official in the Nuevo León state administration. Following the example of Medellín, Colombia, where the city officials placed libraries in some of its most violent slums, Mr. Treviño picked Independencia as a pilot project.“Our view is that there is some involvement now, but it will unleash a more active involvement in the future, given what we’re doing,” Mr. Treviño said. Independencia is just the first of 70 neighborhoods across Monterrey and its blighted satellite towns marked for redevelopment.Mr. Treviño is not the only tie between Cemex and the administration of Gov. Rodrigo Medina, an ambitious — critics say inexperienced — politician from the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party. Cemex’s security director, Jorge Tello, a former federal official, is advising the state on its new police force.State and local officials are firing about two-thirds of all the police officers in Nuevo León and replacing them with the new Civil Force. Monterrey’s companies sent their marketing and human resources experts to help design the agency’s name, its uniforms, the benefits, even the way the squad cars should be painted.Cemex and other Monterrey companies have also set up a way for citizens to call their officials to account. Residents can message, post a message on Twitter or call in to report anything from a broken traffic light to a shootout. The incidents are marked on an online map. Skeptics of the business executives’ actions see a positive change but warn that the work is incomplete. “Businesses want to focus on security, education, attention to victims, but they don’t want to attack corruption, which is the root cause,” said Tatiana Clouthier, a former lawmaker who leads a watchdog group in Monterrey, Evolución Mexicana. “We are patching things up. That doesn’t mean to say that what they’re doing isn’t good, but it’s not enough.”For the people who live and work in Monterrey’s torn neighborhoods, the rush to improvement barely scratches the surface.José Manuel Avalos, a history teacher, stands in a classroom piled with broken computers. His school, Jesús M. Montemayor Junior High School, was one of 10 that were remodeled with state money and that are scheduled to receive additional help from the anti-dropout program.“If they really want to work seriously, they have to go to the kids’ houses, give them attention,” he said. “There is unemployment, low salaries. The children are left alone. They are always on the defensive. That means they resolve problems with aggression.”'"
"'12-01-11,'0','“Dividends have been rising strongly,” said Binky Chadha, the chief strategist at Deutsche Bank. “And the rise that we have seen has plenty of upside.”Companies that pay high dividends were some of the best performers in the markets last year.Telecommunications, utilities and health care shares had the highest yield rates at the end of 2011, at 5.86, 4.13 and 3 percent, respectively.McDonald’s had double-digit percentage stock returns, at more than 30 percent, and dividend yields that exceeded the S.& P. index. Other companies with similar performance included Bristol-Myers, Consolidated Edison and Home Depot. The dividend yield is the amount paid per share as a percentage of the stock price. In McDonald’s case, that equals 2.8 percent, or $2.80 for each share, which are now trading at $99.70.Even dividends from financial companies were higher in 2011 than in previous years. Because of the federal bailouts in 2008, banks need federal approval before they can increase dividends, but investors can still expect improving payouts. Dividends in the financial sector of the S.& P. index rose to $28.5 billion last year, up from $18.6 billion in 2010. The 2011 payout was still far lower than the $50.7 billion in 2008.JPMorgan Chase’s dividend for 2011 was $1 a share, up from its previous annual dividend rate of 20 cents, but in contrast to $1.52 before the crisis. Citigroup went to 4 cents a share last year after not paying a dividend in 2010.“Down the road, the financials clearly would like to bring back those long-term investors,” said Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial. “Clearly their goal is to become an investment vehicle as they were in the precrisis period.”American companies and investors rode out a volatile year in 2011, a year fraught with concerns about a spreading euro zone debt crisis, the possibility of an economic recession in the United States, the first downgrade of the country’s credit rating and the fiscal impasse in Washington. Oil prices jumped higher from the turmoil in the Middle East, supply chains were disrupted by the earthquake in Japan and severe weather hamstrung American companies, said Hank Smith, the chief investment officer for Haverford Trust Company.With memories still fresh from the credit freeze that followed the financial crisis, companies accumulated cash, with those listed on the S.& P. piling up about $2 trillion. But they also cut costs, increased productivity and reaped the benefits of overseas revenue, all of which helped increase profits to record levels and made corporate earnings one of the few bright spots on Wall Street. Mergers and acquisitions also picked up, said Mr. Smith.In announcing their dividends, many companies reflected the economic conditions. AT&T said it would increase its quarterly rate by a cent, to 44 cents a share, after being “very disciplined financially” through the “economic downturn.” Ford Motor said last month it would resume paying quarterly dividends to its shareholders for the first time since 2006. The automaker has just closed out its third consecutive profitable year and will pay out 5 cents a share on March 1.McDonald’s raised its quarterly dividend to 70 cents from 61 cents, or about 15 percent. The company is trying to squeeze more sales out of existing restaurants rather than building new locations, which would provide more cash for dividends and share buybacks, said John Staszak, senior analyst at Argus Research.While many companies increased their payouts, 101 American companies decreased or suspended dividends in 2011, the fewest since 2006.Vulcan Materials, which produces construction materials like stone and gravel, decreased its quarterly dividend to a cent, from 25 cents, partly because it needed the available cash.While the company said it recognized the importance of dividends to shareholders, it said it believed the decision was “prudent given the effects of the recession over the past three years on construction and our end markets.” Analysts say some of the turmoil in 2011 is unwinding, with the shocks from the euro zone debt crisis likely to become less of a headline because they are priced in. In the slow-growing American economy, companies with cash piles are expected to loosen up with share buybacks, capital expenditures or by increasing or beginning dividends, analysts said.One of the surprises for the year, Mr. Keon said, “might be that some of the technology companies might get more aggressive in their dividends. And some of the technology companies that don’t pay any dividends and have a huge pile of cash might start to do so.”Stuart Freeman, the chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, said there would probably be more interest in companies that benefit from recovery, like industrials and materials.But many analysts noted that timid investors were keeping cash or opting for safer havens, like 10-year notes, even though they paid less than the 2.1 percent yield on the S.& P.During a client appreciation event in Mattoon, Ill., in December, Scott L. Wren, a senior equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, stood in front of about 300 clients to explain why one of the best ways for them to build wealth was in stocks.“They are resistant to that, largely,” Mr. Wren said. “Many of these retail clients seem more than willing to sit on many low-yielding types of investments and ride out the current uncertainty until they feel better, and they don’t seem to be too upset about maybe missing some upside.”'"
"'12-01-11,'0','Belichick is at his bromidic best when discussing the Broncos, be it their active defense, their N.F.L.-best running game, their spread/option offense or their enviable roster. Denver is really good. Just ask him.“We have a lot of work to do,” he said Tuesday. “They’re a tough team to prepare for. They give you a lot of looks on both sides of the ball.”But ask him if there is anything to be gained from the losses of 2010 and 2011 — forget the Super Bowl — and he goes from rhapsodic to curt.“We’re looking toward this week,” he snapped. “We have five days until Denver — that’s what we’re looking toward.”But until the Patriots end their skid, it is fair game for public examination and discussion, if not in the inner sanctum of Gillette Stadium.The Patriots, as they are this year, were the No. 1 seed in the 2010 season, when the Jets beat them. The Jets, like the Ravens the year before and the Broncos this year, ran the ball well and had a good defense.There is also a certain unknown about this year’s Patriots, although it is hard to find much wrong with the offense, rated No. 1 in the A.F.C. Brady, once again, was spectacular, passing for 5,235 yards and 39 touchdowns. Rob Gronkowski set an N.F.L. record for touchdown receptions by a tight end with 17. Wes Welker set a franchise mark for receiving yards and led the N.F.L. with 122 receptions. Gronkowski was fifth over all, and second in the A.F.C., with 90. The Patriots won 13 games, and their three defeats were by a total of 15 points. They are the first back-to-back A.F.C. regular-season champion since the 1990-91 Buffalo Bills.The defense is another story. It ranked 16th over all in the A.F.C. — as in last — and 31st in the 32-team N.F.L. The passing defense also ranked last in the A.F.C. It would have been inconceivable years ago to envision a Belichick-coached team with such woeful defensive numbers.Then there’s their schedule. None of the Patriots’ 13 victories came against a team that finished the season with a winning record. Two of their three losses were to the 9-7 Giants and the 12-4 Pittsburgh Steelers. They also lost to the 6-10 Bills.Seven of their 13 victories came against teams that finished the season with 8-8 records, including Saturday night’s opponent, the Broncos.In a game played in Denver on Dec. 18, the Patriots spotted the Broncos a 16-7 lead and then roared back to win easily, 41-23. New England’s final two games followed a similar script: down by 17-0 to Miami before winning, 27-24, and down by 21-0 to Buffalo before winning, 49-21.“We can’t go out and fall behind early,” Wilfork said. “It will be a long day for us if we do that. That’s the top of our list — making sure we can start fast and finish. I would like to see that at least once this year.”'"

"'12-01-11,'0','We take issue with your characterization of Westchester County’s affordable housing settlement in “Westchester’s Desegregation Battle” (editorial, Jan. 1). Far from being “ultrawhite,” Westchester is proud to be the fourth most diverse county in New York. It is virtually tied with Manhattan, in terms of percentage of Hispanic and African-American population, according to the 2010 Census. If Westchester were a state, it would rank seventh in Hispanic population and 14th in African-American population.If there has been any “stonewalling,” it has been by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which has held up $7 million in housing and community development grants, hoping to force the county to do things not required in the settlement.Despite HUD’s roadblocks, Westchester is a year ahead of schedule in building the 750 units of affordable housing required by the settlement. Our success is attributable to working cooperatively with municipalities.HUD would prefer litigation. That’s not how communities get built.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','What a dynamite idea to draft Hillary Rodham Clinton to run for vice president with President Obama in 2012!She has served ably and loyally as secretary of state in the Obama administration. She now has broad experience in both foreign and domestic affairs. She is smart, compassionate, articulate, hard-working and a powerful campaigner. Her candidacy would re-energize a broad swath of women, young people, independents and seniors (of whom I’m one), thus ensuring a Democratic victory in November to the benefit of the nation.Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has served honorably and well in many public posts, including the vice presidency, and has the experience to make a fine secretary of state, among other possibilities.After four years as vice president, Mrs. Clinton would be undeniably well qualified and well placed to be elected the first woman president of the United States — an outcome I devoutly want to see before I die.Bill Keller suggests that Barack Obama sideline Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as his running mate in 2012 in favor of Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mr. Keller extols what he views as Mrs. Clinton’s virtues and argues that such a move would bolster Mr. Obama’s re-election chances.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','As the variables involved in a four-team playoff were discussed, many questions need to be answered for the idea to come to fruition. Will the bowls be involved? Will cities bid for the title game, Super Bowl style? Will university presidents support the change? How much would a playoff, which could double the B.C.S.’s annual $125 million payment from ESPN, hurt the finances of other bowls?On Tuesday, however, the conversation itself hinted at progress toward a playoff.“The environment has changed in the sense that we had five people who didn’t want to talk about it of the seven founders,” Delany said, comparing Tuesday with four years ago. “And I think the seven founders were the conferences plus Notre Dame, and four years ago five of us didn’t want to have the conversation. Now people want to have the conversation.”The four-team playoff was among eight or nine options discussed Tuesday. Others included minor changes to the current B.C.S. formula; eliminating the entire B.C.S. except for a No. 1-vs.-No. 2 title game; and playing the bowls as they exist and reseeding everyone after those games for a championship game between the No. 1 and No. 2 teams.The discussions come after Alabama’s 21-0 victory over Louisiana State was the second-lowest-rated B.C.S. title game ever, and after the ratings for all five B.C.S. games were the lowest rated on average. Some of that had to do with a switch to cable television — ESPN broadcast the Alabama-L.S.U. game — but it is clear that midweek bowl games like the Orange Bowl this year, the lowest-rated B.C.S. game ever, do not work well as standalone games.The B.C.S.’s executive director, Bill Hancock, stressed that Tuesday’s conversations were preliminary. “They have a lot of cans to kick down the road,” he said.Most of the commissioners stuck to the script as outlined by Ari Fleischer, the B.C.S. consultant and former White House press secretary, who instructed those involved to say they had a good conversation and refer all other questions to Hancock.“No decisions were made today and it was a very good, quality conversation,” the Southeastern Conference commissioner, Mike Slive, said. “I’m going to stop there.”Tuesday’s meetings offered a hint of change, but also a sense that the process will be slow, contentious and carefully scripted. The process has just begun, and there is little indication of exactly where it is headed.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','Free contended that its new offer was less than half the price of comparable packages from the three existing operators: Orange, part of France Télécom; SFR, owned by Vivendi; and Bouygues. Analysts said these companies might have to cut their rates sharply or risk losing customers to Free.“This is going to put a lot of pressure on the existing operators,” said Jessica Ekholm, an analyst at Gartner. “All of them are going to feel the pinch.”Mr. Niel, whose early days in business were spent operating racy sites for the Minitel, the French precursor to the Internet, has long delighted in tweaking the country’s business establishment, including Orange, whose parent is partly owned by the French state. Two years ago, he joined two other wealthy executives to buy the newspaper Le Monde, over the objections of President Nicolas Sarkozy.In acquiring a license from the government that allowed Free to become the fourth main mobile operator in France, Mr. Niel had to overcome vigorous lobbying from France Télécom and the other operators, who were worried about his reputation for cutting prices.Mr. Niel signaled Tuesday that he would not depart from the brash, aggressive, price-based marketing formula — an exception in France — that has attracted nearly five million customers to Free’s broadband offering in little more than a decade.“You now have the chance to teach your operator a lesson,” he said during a news conference in Paris. “You have two choices: You can sign up with Free, or you can call your operator and ask them to match our rates.”At least one operator, Orange, was sending text messages to subscribers on Tuesday, reassuring them that it was checking to make sure they had the appropriate calling plan for their usage.Analysts said that in the short run, migration to Free could be limited by the fact that many customers were on ironclad long-term contracts with another mobile operator. Free, by contrast, is not requiring a minimum subscription period.At the low end, Free is also offering a mobile package with a limited number of calls and text messages for 2 euros a month.Marketing and customer service could also be challenging for Free, analysts said. While Orange, SFR and Bouygues have networks of shops across France, Free plans to operate only a handful of stores, relying mostly on the Internet for sales.Free also has not yet built a network covering all of France; to offer nationwide service, it has contracted with Orange to use its network in many regions.'"

"'12-01-11,'0','“In the Solitude of Cotton Fields,” a visceral adaptation of a French play by Bernard-Marie Koltés, portrays a high-octane, sexually charged meeting between a dealer and a client, where the goods exchanged are unclear, but the high stakes are not. On another level, this production, staged in Polish with English supertitles by Radoslaw Rychcik, is about a confrontation between theater and rock concert. The rock concert wins.This show at La MaMa E.T.C. opens in smoky darkness as a band called the Natural Born Chillers lays down a pounding bass line while two silhouetted figures dance. The Dealer (Wojciech Niemczyk) does a ferocious, fist-punching twist, while the Client (Tomasz Nosinski) shrinks and unfolds his body in a repeated violent motion.It’s a hellish image, and as the lights go on, the men turn out to be wearing suits and skinny ties. They stand in front of microphones like rock stars, black eye makeup on their pale faces, telegraphing degradation and doom. It’s arrestingly theatrical, direct and simple.The monologues that follow, however, are an awkward fit. For one thing, it’s hard to read the translated dialogue through the smoke. The language often trades in animal imagery and oblique, hostile warnings. And then, at a climax, the lights go out, giving way to a lengthy series of sensationalistic, often disorienting images (Is that a shot from “Twin Peaks”? Alejandro Jodorowsky’s “Santa Sangre”?).Even though this video is often pornographic, it’s oddly bland, compared with the remarkable intensity of the live performers, who come to the Under the Radar festival courtesy of Stefan Zeromski Theater. Technology can be a great tool, but it can also seem like an ornamental trick. Here it reminds us of the singular power of live theater.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','MUMBAI, India — A month after political opposition led the Indian government to indefinitely delay a decision to allow foreign retailers like Walmart into the country, policy makers on Tuesday changed a rule that would make it easier for predominantly single-brand foreign chains like Ikea and Gap to set up fully owned stores here.The government said it would lift the current 51 percent ownership limit on foreign companies that sell just one brand of products — a group that would also include companies like Apple and Starbucks — if they met certain strict conditions. Many foreign chains, most notably Ikea, which buys a lot of furniture and furnishings from India, have not opened stores in the country because they did not want to take on Indian partners.The decision is one of a series of steps Indian officials took in recent weeks to bolster flagging investor confidence and increase the flow of foreign money to support its slowing economy and the falling rupee. This month, for instance, policy makers allowed individual investors who live in other countries to trade directly in the Indian stock market, rather than go through intermediaries like offshore funds.One of those market-opening proposals, though, was recently tabled after meeting political opposition.The government, led by the Congress Party, last month reversed a decision to allow 51 percent foreign investment in multibrand retailing — a category that includes companies like Walmart, Tesco and Carrefour. Many Indian political leaders, including some members of the Congress Party and its allies, opposed letting foreign retailers own controlling stakes of stores, saying they would decimate small shopkeepers and wholesale traders that employ about 34 million people. Much of that criticism was aimed at so-called big-box retailers like Walmart, which has a wholesale business in India.But the decision Tuesday to further open up single-brand retailing to foreign competition — a move officials had signaled in early December — suggests that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his aides believe there will not be significant political resistance to the niche foreign retailers, which will largely cater to the middle and upper classes of Indian society.Still, the approval comes with some strict conditions that may be difficult for some companies to meet. Among them is a requirement that single-brand retailers buy 30 percent of the value of their products from small Indian businesses and artisans — defined as businesses and individuals that have invested less than $1 million in factories or equipment. Previously, some analysts said that such a purchasing condition would violate World Trade Organization rules.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','Mr. Quinn’s international conglomerate of cement factories, luxury hotels, pubs and wind farms collapsed over the last two years after he placed huge bets on financial derivatives known as contracts for difference to speculate on the value of Anglo Irish shares.The High Court judge on the case in Northern Ireland, Donal Deeny, annulled Mr. Quinn’s bankruptcy declaration Tuesday morning. In his written ruling, he raised doubts about a lease dated last May and submitted as evidence of Mr. Quinn’s long-term office base in County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland, a rental for about 60 euros ($77) a month.The judge called it a “curious document” because it was written in legal language but not witnessed by a lawyer. He also noted that Mr. Quinn lacked a passport for Britain.Outside the courtroom, Mr. Quinn, who grew up in the borderlands of County Fermanagh, was defiant, calling the bank’s case a sham and saying that he had never worked anyplace else.“I worked in Derrylin six days a week, not five,” he said.“What Anglo Irish has done to the Quinn Group is like somebody taking a sledgehammer to a child’s toy — they’ve destroyed it,” he said. “It’s wrecked.”When asked if he had misled the court, he replied: “I’ve never misled anybody in my life. Everything I always promised, I always done.”The Irish Bank Resolution Corporation is already pursuing a bankruptcy case against Mr. Quinn in Ireland. It is “determined to recoup its costs and to maximize recovery for the taxpayer and the state,” a statement issued after the court ruling said.The Quinn case has raised awareness among other debtors about the prospects for seeking financial refuge in other European countries. At least three failed Irish property developers have declared bankruptcy in Britain, including Ray Grehan, who owes 312 million euros to the National Asset Management Agency, the state-owned bank created to take ownership of nonperforming loans.Anthony Joyce, a lawyer in Dublin who advises mortgage holders with large debts, said he was surprised that Mr. Quinn had not taken the step of moving his residence to Northern Ireland. He said that could be an alternative that Mr. Quinn could pursue.“We get calls every day from people with serious debt problems, and they are looking at this as an option,” Mr. Joyce said, noting that typically they moved to London for six months before filing for bankruptcy to take advantage of less-onerous laws.Several other rulings are expected this month in the struggle between Mr. Quinn and Anglo Irish, which was nationalized in 2009. Besides the bankruptcy case, the bank is in litigation elsewhere to take control of property owned by the Quinn family in Russia, Ukraine and India.A judge in Cyprus is expected to rule this month in a clash over several offshore companies claiming debts against the Quinn properties of more than 500 million euros.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','Meanwhile, bombing attacks in Damascus, the capital, have killed scores of people over the past month. The government has said that foreign-backed terrorists were responsible; the opposition claims the government carried out the bombings itself in a cynical effort to sully the protesters’ image.In the latest turn, the Arab League on Tuesday denounced attacks on its observers in Syria, who arrived last month to monitor an agreement brokered by the league that was meant to end the violence. The league’s secretary-general, Nabil el-Arabi, said that both loyalists and government opponents had carried out attacks, but that in the end the Syrian government was to blame for failing to provide for the security of the mission. He said the government was “totally responsible” for protecting its 165 observers.Arab League officials said that in the worst incident, 11 observers were injured on Monday in the port city of Latakia when their vehicles were attacked, in circumstances that remained unclear. The official news agency of , which said two Kuwaitis were among the 11 injured, described the assailants as “unknown protesters,” and the foreign minister of the blamed “non-opposition elements.”In his speech, given at the University of Damascus and broadcast on Syrian television, Mr. Assad sought to cast the violence in the country as solely a question of terrorism. He drew parallels between the bombings in Damascus and an Islamist revolt in Syria in the late 1970s and early 1980s, which threatened the hold on power of Mr. Assad’s father and predecessor, Hafez Assad, who ruled the country for three decades.“There can be no let-up for terrorism — it must be hit with an iron fist,” he said. “The battle with terrorism is a battle for everyone, a national battle, not only the government’s battle.” Occasionally interrupted by applause from a friendly audience of members of the ruling , university professors and members of Syria’s feeble parliament, he added that “victory is near.”“There’s no tolerance of terrorism or of those who use weapons to kill,” he said.In some ways, the speech was a rhetorical settling of accounts.Mr. Assad ridiculed the Arab League, which suspended Syria’s membership in November, a humiliation for a country that has long seen itself as a fulcrum of the Arab world. “Who lost with Syria’s suspension from the Arab League? Syria?” Mr. Assad asked. “No. The Arab League did.” He dismissed the oil-rich Arab states of the Gulf as countries without culture. ( , in particular, has led the region’s attempts to further isolate Mr. Assad’s government.)“Countries can rent and import some history with their money, but money does not make nations and cultures,” Mr. Assad said, in a not-very-veiled reference to the Gulf emirates.He also mocked the Syrian protesters’ characterization of themselves as revolutionaries.“This is not a revolution,” Mr. Assad said to an audience that chanted his name at the speech’s end. “Is it possible that he is a revolutionary and a traitor at the same time? This is impossible. If there were true revolutionaries, we would be walking together.”Reactions to Mr. Assad’s speech predictably broke along lines hardened by the uprising and the crackdown. “No Syrian can be neutral any more,” said a 23-year-old student at the university, who supported Mr. Assad and gave his name as Ali. “I wasted about two hours of my time listening to meaningless words,” retorted a 30-year-old anti-government activist in Damascus who gave his name as Mazen.Mr. Assad’s speech came at a time of feuding among his opponents in exile, who are deeply divided over the prospect of foreign intervention and the persistent gaps between opposition groups within Syria and those abroad.“He’s becoming stronger with our weakness,” Haytham Manna, a prominent Syrian dissident based in Cairo, said of Mr. Assad. “If the opposition doesn’t unify, the regime will gain strength.”Omar Idlibi, a spokesman for the Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group, called Mr. Assad’s speech another instance of the government’s obliviousness to the depth of the challenge it faces from protests and discontent.“For 10 months, the regime is living in denial,” Mr. Idlibi said in a telephone interview. “They’re denying reality. He doesn’t want to recognize the changes that occurred until today.”Even as Mr. Assad spoke, the death toll appeared to rise again. The Local Coordination Committees said on Tuesday that 30 people were killed, including 16 in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour; there was no way to independently confirm the figures. Opposition groups say hundreds of people have been killed in Syria since the Arab League observers began their work on Dec. 21.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','Still, some critics and analysts have warned that keeping tainted executives at the helm of Olympus threatened to undermine its turnaround effort by allowing discredited board members to name their successors and subvert meaningful changes in the management and accounting oversight of the company.Olympus “continues to suffer under shoddy corporate governance and an utterly discredited board,” Josh Shores, a principal at Southeastern Asset, said in a statement last Friday. “We maintain that the board should be replaced and a new board should oversee the company’s revival.”Olympus, a maker of cameras and medical optical devices called endoscopes, remains in dire need of fresh capital after recently restated accounts showed its shareholder equity at far lower levels than previously disclosed.Olympus on Tuesday defended its move. “The plan is for the current board members who were found responsible and are subject to lawsuits to complete passing on their roles to avoid any impact on business,” the company said in a statement.Olympus refused to make any of its  executives available to comment, or explain further why an executive it was suing would continue to head the company.Olympus has admitted to concealing losses dating back to the 1990s using an elaborate scheme involving offshore funds. The case has cast a harsh spotlight on lax corporate governance in Japan.That admission came after Mr. Woodford, who became president last April and chief executive in August, blew the whistle on fraudulent accounting at the company. He went public with his allegations after being fired in October.Olympus initially said it fired Mr. Woodford, one of a handful of foreign executives at top Japanese companies, over what it called his aggressive Western management style. But Mr. Woodford disclosed internal documents to show he was dismissed after he raised questions about irregular payouts related to mergers and acquisitions.Olympus later acknowledged that those payments, made from 2006 through 2008, were part of a scheme to own up to losses on past investments that it had long kept off its balance sheets. The scandal has led to government investigations in Japan, the United States and Britain. And Olympus appointed an outside panel to investigate the matter.Mr. Woodford later made a bid to return to the company with a fresh slate of directors, but he abandoned that effort last week after Japanese institutional investors continued to back Olympus’s current management.Meanwhile, Olympus’s external panel has sought to identify which of its officials were involved in the scheme. On Tuesday, Olympus said the panel had implicated 19 executives to varying degrees.Based on the panel’s findings, Olympus said it was seeking up to 3.6 billion yen, or $47 million, in damages from 19 past and present executives.The brunt of the damages sought will be from the former chairman, Tsuyoshi Kikukawa; the former executive vice president, Hisashi Mori; and the former internal auditor, Hideo Yamada, the company said. A separate third-party investigative panel appointed by Olympus said last month that the three had orchestrated the scheme to mask investment losses.Among current executives, besides Mr. Takayama, the company said it was suing five of eight current internal directors and one of its three current external directors. Those directors, as well as Mr. Takayama, would resign at an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting scheduled for March or April.The directors not named in Olympus’s lawsuit are expected to keep their seats on the board.Mr. Woodford, the ousted president, said Tuesday via e-mail that the entire board had been discredited when it fired him instead of investigating his allegations and that all directors needed to go. “It is completely the wrong basis to revitalize Olympus,” Mr. Woodford said. “The only way forward is an entirely new board of directors, untainted by the past scandal.”Southeastern Asset Management, an American firm that is Olympus’s biggest overseas stockholder, has also urged the company to purge its current management.'"
"'12-01-11,'0','On Tuesday, a five-member panel of the Supreme Court, led by Justice Asif Saeed Khosa, ruled that the government was guilty of “willful disobedience” and said that Mr. Gilani was “dishonest” for failing to carry out the earlier court orders.The judges laid out six options — including initiating contempt of court charges, dismissing the prime minister, forming a judicial commission and taking action against the president for violating his constitutional oath — and ordered the attorney general to explain the government’s position in court on Monday.A three-member judicial commission that is investigating the controversial memo is scheduled to resume its hearing the same day. Apart from having an acrimonious relationship with the judiciary, the government has an uneasy relationship with the country’s top generals.Mr. Zardari, who spent 11 years in prison on unproved corruption charges, says the corruption cases against him and Ms. Bhutto that date to the 1990s were politically motivated.In an interview last week with GEO TV, a news network, Mr. Zardari said reopening those cases would be tantamount to “a trial of the grave” of his wife.Mr. Zardari also claims immunity as president, but the judiciary, led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, has resisted that claim and has aggressively pursued cases against Mr. Zardari’s party, leading many government officials to speculate that the judiciary was being used by the country’s powerful military to dismiss the government before the March elections for the Senate, in which the Pakistan Peoples Party is expected to win a majority.Political analysts said the fate of Mr. Gilani, the prime minister, was in peril.Mr. Zardari called a meeting of his party officials and coalition partners on Tuesday evening to chart strategy, and he was expected to get a statement of support from his allies.“The situation is fast moving towards a head-on confrontation,” said Hasan Askari Rizvi, a political and military analyst based in Lahore. “It depends on what options are exercised by the Supreme Court.”According to the Pakistani Constitution, a prime minister can be removed only by the Parliament, and the Supreme Court can disqualify the prime minister only indirectly, Mr. Rizvi said.“If the court disqualifies the prime minister and the prime minister continues to enjoy the support of the Parliament, then the stage is set for a very dangerous confrontation,” he said.The legal standoff is forcing the government to defer issues of greater importance, like rescuing a failing economy and fighting Taliban insurgents, as it focuses on its political survival, Mr. Rizvi said.“The court, the military and the executive are trying to assert themselves,” he said. “It has become a free-for-all.”There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the bombing on Tuesday, but it appeared to have been carried out by Tehrik-i-Taliban, an umbrella organization of Pakistani militant groups, against the Zakhakhel tribe, which has formed a militia in support of the government, said Mutahir Zeb, administrator for the Khyber tribal region.Mr. Zeb said the Tehrik-i-Taliban sought to avenge the killing of Qari Kamran, a local Taliban commander, by security forces last week in an area occupied by the Zakhakhel.Mr. Zeb said a pickup truck exploded in the middle of a bus terminal used by the Zakhakhel in the town of Jamrud.The bomb destroyed several vehicles, damaged a nearby gasoline pump and shattered windows in the area. In addition to those killed, 27 people were reported wounded in the bombing and were taken to hospitals in Peshawar.“I was on duty at the nearby checkpoint when I heard a big bang,” said Mir Gul, a security guard. “I rushed toward the spot and saw bodies lying around while the injured cried for help. It was devastating. There was blood everywhere.”'"

"'12-01-12,'1','Other risks highlighted by the forum include the potential problems stemming from greenhouse gas emissions, computer attacks and water supply disruptions.The emphasis on economic and social risks is a big shift from the focus of a year ago, when the group’s annual report on potential disruptions highlighted natural disasters, a threat that materialized when a devastating earthquake struck last March.The earthquake quickly became a human, environmental and economic disaster, spawning a tsunami that killed thousands of people in Japan and setting in motion events that resulted in a meltdown in several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.The economic ripple effects from the spread throughout the world when manufacturing plants in Japan were shut down, causing widespread supply disruptions. It became a political event when, in the aftermath of the nuclear accident, announced that it planned to shut down its nuclear plants within a decade.“It was the world’s first trillion-dollar disaster,” said Erwann O. Michel-Kerjan, managing director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who contributed to the forum’s report. “It’s one of the flip sides of globalization. A local event can become a global event much more quickly.”As a result, a number of risk analysts — not just those at the forum — are looking less at the specific nature of individual disasters and more at potential connections between them. These have become increasingly evident in a variety of shocks in the last decade or so, including the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the global financial crisis that began in 2007 and the eruption of a volcano in in 2010, which produced a huge ash cloud that disrupted air travel across for about a week.“It seems like we are facing a lot more disasters,” said Bernice Lee, research director for energy, environment and resource governance at the British research organization Chatham House. “But it may just be that we are feeling their impacts more because they are more globalized.”In a separate report for Chatham House, Ms. Lee argues that the world has grown more vulnerable to such events in recent years because of various factors, including the rise of the Internet and the popularity of the so-called just-in-time model of supply-chain management in business.Under this system, many companies stock only enough parts to keep assembly lines running for a few days. In normal times, this cuts costs and makes manufacturers more flexible. When disaster strikes, however, businesses may be more vulnerable than in the days when warehouses stocked months of supplies.The Internet, meanwhile, can magnify and spread the effects of a disaster in other ways. Rumors, even if incorrect, spread quickly on social networking sites — sometimes more rapidly than emergency services can communicate accurate information. As word of disasters like the terror attacks of Sept. 11 or the earthquake in Japan spreads globally, consumers hunker down in front of their computer screens or televisions, rather than going about their daily lives. This increases the economic effects of a crisis, even in areas far removed from the source.Howard Kunreuther, professor of decision sciences and business and public policy at Wharton, said that after the earthquake in Japan, researchers noticed an increase in sales of earthquake , even in places at little or no risk of earthquakes.“Before an event, nobody thinks something will happen to them,” he said. “After an event, people sometimes act equally irrationally.”While scientists can predict the probability — if not the exact timing or scale — of certain natural disasters, the ability to read a crystal ball may be more helpful than complex calculations in determining risks stemming from human events.Leading many forecasters’ worries is an escalation of tensions between the United States and . In addition to political turmoil, military action between the United States — or — and Iran could cause a sharp increase in oil prices, especially if the were blocked.Ed Yardeni, an independent economist in New York, lists this as one of his “four horsemen of the apocalypse” for 2012. The others, cited in a note to clients, are: a severe global squeeze stemming from the crisis in the euro zone; social upheaval in China and India; and a severe global emanating from Europe.Graham Hutchings, director of analysis at Analytica, adds to these the uncertainty caused by elections in a number of countries, including , and the United States, as well as a leadership transition in .Leadership changes can also come as a surprise, as they did to several heads of state in the Arab world last year, with a speed and suddenness that startled the experts. How the Arab Spring evolves, and how far the protests spread in the Arab world and beyond — as old assumptions about geopolitical alignments are being cast aside — are among the big uncertainties of 2012.“This is an uncharted world, one that we’re not familiar with, one that is not populated by two or three big powers and the other countries aligning themselves with one or another of those,” Mr. Hutchings said. “It is one that is marked by a dissolving of certainties, one that is more dependent on culture and context.”And, in what might turn out to be the most accurate prediction of 2012, he added, “Attempts to predict the affairs of humankind are marked by a kind of arrogance and are bound to fail.”'"

"'12-01-12,'1','The administration is preparing regulations to limit carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants, but Ms. McCarthy would not say when they would be released. Efforts by the Obama administration and Democrats in Congress to pass legislation reducing greenhouse gas emissions failed in the Senate in 2010, and industries represented by the data released on Wednesday have spent heavily to oppose such laws.The new registry does not cover direct emissions from agriculture, forestry or transportation, which are not required to report them in detail.The data shows that power plants are responsible for 72.3 percent of reported emissions and that the three largest single sources — two generating stations in Georgia and one in Alabama — are owned by the Southern Company, based in Atlanta.The E.P.A. does not directly provide the corporate ownership of all of the sources, although some is available on spreadsheets accompanying the map.The Natural Resources Defense Council, however, has compiled emissions by utility, using the E.P.A. figures.The report also shows that Texas has by far the highest total emissions from power plants and refineries, with 294 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent spewed into the atmosphere. The next highest total comes from Pennsylvania, with 129 million metric tons.Although sleekly presented, the E.P.A.’s registry has its limitations. It is neatly organized by state and emissions source, but that does not reflect the nature of the electric system, which is responsible for the bulk of the emissions in the inventory but is not divided by state lines. The ranking makes the District of Columbia look like a fairly small emitter and Pennsylvania like a large one. But some of the coal burned in Pennsylvania flows through the regional power grid to feed Washington and other areas.And the emissions inventory does not capture information about the efficiency of the source. New York University, for example, may rank as a big emitter in New York, but a year ago it opened a co-generation facility that makes electricity and uses the waste heat to heat and cool buildings, thus doing far more work per pound of carbon dioxide emitted than most other sources.Still, David Doniger, the policy director for climate and clean air at the Natural Resources Defense Council, described the new database as a “very powerful small-d democratic tool.”“It means that every high school student or local reporter can see who the biggest carbon polluters are in his or her own backyard,” he said. “Carbon pollution and climate change are very abstract when you’re dealing with national or international data. This brings it home.”'"
"'12-01-12,'1','Corps workers have brought the repaired levees to a height of 55 feet, measured against the river gauge at nearby Cairo, Ill., though another $20 million from Congress would be needed to bring them to the former height of 62.5 feet.And while critics of the decision to blast — including Missouri state officials, who sued to block the corps — warned that the rich farmland would be inundated by toxins, these days green shoots of winter wheat are poking up through fields. Much of the wheat is a second crop, following soybeans that industrious farmers hurried to get into the ground just weeks after the flood. The corps estimates that 90 percent of the farmland is back in operation.“There are some areas where it’s going to be hard to get back in and farm it, but not on the scale we feared when this happened,” said Dickie , the executive director of the local county office for the ’s Farm Service Agency. The floodway is just one of the complex features built along the after the disastrous flood of 1927 that have transformed the mighty river into what the corps calls an engineered system — not just levees, but enormous works of infrastructure that can hold water back or divert it at critical spots along the river’s path.One of those critical spots is here, at the confluence of the Mississippi and Rivers, where the water volume increases tremendously but the river’s channel is squeezed by hills to the east and a narrowed plain between riverbank and levee to the west. Opening the gaps at Birds Point allows as much as 550,000 cubic feet of water per second to be diverted from the Mississippi’s main flow, lowering the height of the river and taking pressure off the levees.That was the reason officials used high explosives to open the gaps in May. At the height of the crisis, the move was often characterized as a desperate attempt to save Cairo, a fading, largely African-American town, by damaging the fortunes of well-to-do white farmers.But Maj. Jon Korneliussen, the project engineer on the reconstruction, contended that the enormous basin, bounded at the western end by a set-back levee, can help prevent flooding to some 2.5 million acres of land extending east into parts of Kentucky and south and west across a broad alluvial plain all the way into . Using the floodway allowed the 200 residents of the basin to evacuate and move valuable possessions and equipment out of harm’s way, he said, without the sudden and uncontrolled devastation that a breach elsewhere could have caused.George C. Grugett, executive vice president of the Mississippi Valley Flood Control Association, said that the choice, while hard, was justified. “What a disaster for the people inside the floodway,” he said. But if the levee had not been breached, he said, “it would have been a greater disaster.”Water at Cairo, he noted, was reaching levels that all but mandated blowing up the levee. “They didn’t have any choice in it,” he said.Announcing the decision, Maj. Gen. Michael J. Walsh said: “I have to use this tool. I don’t have to like it.”Blasting gaps into the levee measuring thousands of yards across was supposed to render the flow of floodwaters relatively gentle, minimizing damage. It did not turn out way, especially at the middle area, where shortages of high-energy explosives left a gap just 800 feet across. Water jetted through the narrow channel, scooping out 400,000 cubic yards of sandy soil and fanning it out across farmland with drifts several feet deep in spots.The 800-foot gap “wound up a disaster,” said R. D. James, a local farmer and engineer who is a longtime member of the Mississippi River Commission, which advised General Walsh on the decision. In other places, ridges in the landscape shaped water into scouring torrents, causing further damage to fields and roads.Pinhook, in the path of the flood, was wiped out, said Ms. Robinson, who raised eight children there. Her house had been flooded four times before during high water seasons, she said, but this time the force of the waters from the levee breaches washed through her five-bedroom home. “Honey, it was to the top of my house,” she said. It is all gone now, and she is living nearby in Sikeston, Mo.“It’s kind of heartbreaking,” she said.LaToya Robinson-Tate, a daughter of Ms. Robinson, said she and others were hoping to relocate Pinhook beyond the floodway. “When we move it, will we have a Pinhook day!” she said. “It will be a party of parties.”On a recent blustery day, the workers rebuilding the levees were shutting down operations until spring thaws would make the soil workable again. With no way for grass to grow atop the levee to hold soil, they were covering the new work in heavy sheets of black plastic and securing them with sandbags tossed off a four-wheel all-terrain vehicle.Now the levees need to be rebuilt to their original height, Mr. James, of the river commission, said. Occupants of the floodway “were basically guaranteed protection from Congress to 62.5 feet,” he said. “That’s just not happening.” (The Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, passed last month by Congress, may provide the money to finish the job.)Mr. James said he continued to marvel over what happened in May. “If you look at the entire Mississippi system during the flood, it basically operated the way our forefathers designed it in 1928, which is unbelievable to me,” he said.He said he knew that many of his neighbors, like Mr. Wallace, claimed the destruction was for nothing — that diverting the water had no effect except to upend their lives. “But from an engineering perspective, I have to think it did,” Mr. James said. “From a personal perspective, I’m sorry we had to use it.”'"
"'12-01-12,'1','A Circuit Court judge in Jackson temporarily blocked the release of 21 inmates on Wednesday night who were among 215 convicts granted clemency by Gov. Haley Barbour in his final days in office. State Attorney General Jim Hood argued that granting clemency for some convicts was unconstitutional because the pardons had not been sufficiently publicized beforehand. Earlier Wednesday, Mr. Barbour, who left office Tuesday, issued a statement about the pardons, which have caused a storm of controversy. Of those granted clemency, 188 had already left prison, most of them years ago, it said, and the “pardons were intended to allow them to find gainful employment or acquire professional licenses as well as hunt and vote.” Of the 26 who were in custody, 13 were placed on “indefinite suspension due to medical reasons because their health care expenses while incarcerated were costing the state so much money.” The remaining number includes five inmates released on Sunday, including four men serving life sentences for murder, who had worked at the Governor’s Mansion. The judge ordered those five men to appear in court on Jan. 23.'"
"'12-01-12,'1','Secretary of State said on Wednesday that the administration was “still in the preliminary stages of testing whether this can be successful.”But she went on to say that for the first time there appeared to be support for a political resolution that included leaders of the radical Islamic government that ruthlessly ruled the country from 1996 until the American invasion after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.“The reality is we never have the luxury of negotiating for peace with our friends,” Mrs. Clinton, who has pressed the initiative within the administration, said at the State Department.“If you’re sitting across the table discussing a peaceful resolution to a conflict, you are sitting across from people who you by definition don’t agree with and who you may previously have been across a battlefield from.”The negotiations — potentially as historic and as politically wrenching as the peace talks that ended the Vietnam War — come after more than a decade of war in Afghanistan and they could unfold in the middle of ’s re-election campaign.The reversal of the Taliban’s longstanding public refusal to negotiate with the United States — and the administration’s willingness to reciprocate — punctuated a highly compartmentalized effort that has proceeded in fits and starts, with the knowledge of very few officials, according to administration and Afghan officials involved in the negotiations. Begun by the American envoy , who died in 2010, it has been conducted by his successor as senior representative to Afghanistan and , Mr. Grossman, a former ambassador to Turkey who came out of to take on what has been described as one of the most difficult jobs in government. His team includes about a half-dozen State Department, Defense Department and intelligence officials.Only a month ago, when envoys from dozens of countries gathered in , Germany, hoping to announce a new push for political reconciliation in Afghanistan, the effort appeared moribund. The fiercest opposition came from Mr. Karzai, whose position on the prospect of talks, one senior administration official said, involved wild swings in mood and position.Under pressure from the administration, however, Mr. Karzai ultimately relented, dropping his objections, though he continued to make demands on the location of any Taliban office until the day after it was announced.With the United States and already having announced that they would withdraw most international forces from Afghanistan by 2014, the search for some kind of political reconciliation between the new government and the Taliban became an imperative for the administration.Nearly a year ago, Mrs. Clinton first signaled the opening for talks by recasting the administration’s longstanding preconditions: that the insurgents lay down their arms, accept the Afghan Constitution and separate from . Instead, she described them as “necessary outcomes.”By then, Germany’s intelligence agency had already brokered a meeting in Munich in November 2010 between the Americans and Tayeb Agha, an English-speaking former aide and spokesman for the Taliban’s leader, Mullah Omar, who is believed to remain in hiding in Pakistan.Initially, the Americans were wary, having been recently embarrassed by an imposter posing as a top Taliban envoy (who ultimately made off with tens of thousands of dollars in payments).The killing of in Pakistan last May added momentum to the peace efforts, underscoring the increasingly limited ties between Al Qaeda and the remaining Taliban. One of the conditions that the United States has sought is a Taliban renunciation of Al Qaeda and international terrorism.Over the course of what officials described as several meetings, Mr. Agha verified his true identity and connection to the Taliban leadership in hiding by posting a prearranged message on a Web site used by the group, according to the officials.That led Mr. Grossman, a veteran diplomat whose style has been far more low-key than the flamboyant Mr. Holbrooke’s, to meet with Mr. Agha personally in October in Doha, Qatar, to discuss “confidence building” measures, including the opening of a political office.Then things ground to a halt. Mr. Karzai, still angered by the killing the month before of the official in charge of reconciliation, , balked at the prospects of a Taliban office in Qatar. Mr. Karzai has often reacted angrily to diplomatic efforts that he perceives are under way without sufficient consultations. His aides in this case said he was properly notified.Mrs. Clinton and other officials have repeatedly said publicly that any reconciliation effort must be led by the Afghans themselves, and yet privately they have pressed very hard for the Afghans to do so, the officials said.”I don’t think it’s a secret that we need the Afghans — we need Karzai to be part of this,” said a Western diplomat in Kabul. Is he? “He says so. We’ll have to see.”The situation pivoted sharply shortly after Christmas, officials and Western diplomats in Kabul said. In meetings up and down Afghan government, American and other Western officials made the stakes clear: if President Karzai wanted to leave a peace deal in place when his final term ends in 2014, this was his best chance. The Americans wanted the Qatar office to happen, the Europeans were on board and, most important, it appeared the Taliban’s leadership was willing.A senior Afghan official acknowledged “divisions” in the presidential palace over the matter between those with pro-Western sympathies within President Karzai’s inner circle, and those whose wariness of America and its objectives in Afghanistan runs deep.The official said that even though Mr. Karzai agreed to the Qatar office in the days after Christmas, he remained “uncertain” about whether the Taliban were sincere. That skepticism is shared by many in Washington.“What actually ends up unfolding and what understandings are reached to launch something more visible and serious — all of that has not been fully determined yet,” a senior administration official familiar with the effort said.As the process becomes more visible it is likely to face more intense scrutiny, especially on Capitol Hill. The release of high-level Taliban leaders from Guantánamo would certainly risk a political backlash in an election year. To criticize Mr. Obama for trying to close the prison, Republicans often point to instances in which some former detainees took part in terrorist or insurgent activity, and lawmakers from both parties tied the administration’s hands even further by imposing new restrictions on transfers.A Taliban transfer could be the trial run of that system, and administration officials are studying the most recent version as they consider the deal. It requires the secretary of defense and the secretary of state to certify to Congress that the government to which a detainee would be transferred has certain steps to ensure that the detainee will not engage in terrorist activity.Such a certification must take place 30 days before any transfer. While the administration provided a classified briefing to leaders of the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees about aspects of the reconciliation talks proposal late last year, it has apparently not yet made any formal certification.Rather than releasing the five Taliban leaders in Afghanistan, the idea appears to be a transfer to the custody of Qatar, whose government would keep them under some form of control — like surveillance, house arrest and blocking them from travel abroad. Those conditions remain subject to negotiation.Mrs. Clinton, who met with Qatar’s prime minister at the State Department on Wednesday, said no transfers were imminent.Even now, the officials said, much remains uncertain, including the role of Pakistan in any negotiations, as well as the willingness of any of the sides to come to terms on meaningful, lasting reconciliation that would protect what the United States considers nonnegotiable: a peaceful, democratic government that preserves the gains made over the last decade.Syed Muhammad Akbar Agha, a former Taliban commander who lives in Kabul and a cousin of the administration’s liaison with the Taliban, Mr. Agha, said in an interview that the former government now sought peace, even if it remained committed to its Islamic vision of Afghanistan.“The Taliban want peace like all of our Afghan brothers and sisters,” he said. “We believe in Islam, and we believe that Afghanistan should be an Islamic state. But the Taliban do not think that they can bring a true Islamic state only by force. We can bring those changes in many ways — by negotiating, by speaking.”'"
"'12-01-12,'1','“I think that there was a large number of people, including the chancellor, who were just very predisposed to be charter supporters, so it was hard for them to take off that hat,” said Michael Duffy, a former director of the city’s charter school office, who remembered having to lobby his superiors in 2010 to close a charter school in East New York, , that was forcing out special education students.Marc Sternberg, a deputy chancellor who oversees the charter school office, said the city had not changed its approach to monitoring charter schools.“Our focus has always been on opening new, excellent district and charter schools that provide students with a high-quality education,” he said in a statement. “In 2009, Peninsula Prep received a short-term renewal and were told that if they failed to meet the standards in their charter they would not be given another. They failed to do so, and we have to hold them accountable for that.”But charter school advocates and leaders believe that by closing Peninsula Prep, the city is issuing a warning to schools that it is no longer sufficient to be as good as or slightly better than traditional public schools; they have to be exemplars.Until now, the city’s rate of closing for charters — about 4 percent since the first charters were granted in 1999 — was below the national average: 15 percent of charters across the country have been closed since 1992, according to a report by the Center for Education Reform, published last December.By the city’s standards, Peninsula was not the worst charter school, nor was it the best. Last year, 46 percent of Peninsula’s students passed the state English exam, a better performance than 47 other city charters. On the math exam, 60 percent of its students scored as proficient. For the last four years, it received C’s on its annual progress reports. It was, by definition, in the middle of the herd. But not on Far Rockaway, where those scores were high enough for Peninsula Prep to outperform 9 of the 10 elementary schools its students are zoned for.Ericka Wala, Peninsula’s principal since July 2009, said the school had been improving, though slowly.“We were a struggling school in 2009 when everybody was A’s and B’s,” Ms. Wala said, “and when they raised the standard, we were able to maintain a C. The scores had to have gone up in order to do that. I do feel the school is being used as a warning.”New York City has closed charter schools for poor performance in the past, but their test scores were dismal. In other cases, schools were closed after they had already been damaged by poor fiscal or management decisions. Last year, the city succeeded in closing the Ross Global Academy, a charter school led by Courtney Sale Ross, the multimillionaire widow of Steve Ross, the chief executive. When the city announced plans to close the school, only 26 percent of its students had passed the state English test and 33 percent passed math.James Merriman, chief executive of the New York City Charter School Center, said a confluence of factors might have led the city to raise the bar for renewing charter schools. In 2010, state education officials toughened the math and English exams administered annually to students in third through eighth grades, after years of complaints about test score inflation. Across the city, scores dropped precipitously, and suddenly schools that once appeared to be holding their own were actually found to be in distress.Another factor is that as more charter schools reach their five-year renewal points, the city is judging them by their progress report grades, which were not given to schools opened and renewed before the reports began in 2008. The additional measurement affected Peninsula Prep, which failed to meet five of nine standards it had promised to reach, according to the city’s renewal report. One of the standards was receiving at least a B on its progress report.Charter school advocates said the Education Department had also become responsive to criticism that it treated charter schools differently from district schools. Since 2002, the city has closed 117 district schools, a vast majority of them for poor performance.“School closure is built into the charter idea — and needs to happen regardless,” Mr. Merriman wrote in an e-mail. “But certainly if a district is closing traditional schools for poor performance, not closing charter schools becomes doubly indefensible.”On the other hand, he said charter school critics and the teachers’ union had been too quick to urge the city to close charter schools, while defending failing district schools.Mr. Duffy, who is now a managing director at Victory Education Partners, said that in the early years of the , the city was focused on opening many charters to give parents new choices. But in 2010, a change in legislation that lifted the cap on the number of charter schools also diminished the city’s authority to open new charters, giving more power to the state Board of Regents. While the city is still focused on opening new charter schools — Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has promised to open 25 each year — charter advocates say the city’s charter school office has more staff members and resources to scrutinize schools it already opened.“I definitely think in 2012, what was good enough even five years ago is no longer good enough,” Mr. Duffy said.'"

"'12-01-12,'1','Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti on Wednesday threw his support behind a new tax on financial transactions, backing a push by Germany and France, but said he would prefer to have it apply across the whole European Union.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy have suggested such a tax among the 17-nation euro countries might be sufficient. But the Italian prime minister said he would rather have it applied across the full 27-nation EU — which would be more difficult because of British opposition.""We are open to supporting this initiative at the EU level,"" Mr. Monti said at a news conference with Mrs. Merkel during his first visit to Berlin since taking over from Silvio Berlusconi in November.While the Berlusconi government had rejected a new financial levy outright, Mr. Monti has said he thought it was a good idea, particularly as a means of reducing the tax burden on families.Mr. Sarkozy, who faces an election in April, has said France could even enact the tax unilaterally, but Germany has been more guarded.'"
"'12-01-12,'1','Stock indexes held firm near recent five-month highs on Wednesday as investors awaited crucial bond market tests for Europe in the next two days that could determine the direction of the euro zone crisis.Equities in the United States have been performing better in the face of turmoil from Europe’s sovereign debt problems. This is a major change from four months ago and comes as investors have taken improving economic data in the United States to heart and an optimistic view about corporate earnings.Wall Street recovered from early losses on Wednesday brought on by a warning from Fitch Ratings of severe repercussions, including a possible collapse of the euro, without more support from the European Central Bank.The Fitch news sent the euro to its lowest level in 16 months against the dollar, which would normally have spelled steeper losses for stocks.“The U.S. is being looked at clearly as the safe-haven trade, not only on the fixed-income side but now even from equity investors,” said Ken Polcari, managing director at ICAP Equities in New York.'"
"'12-01-12,'1','SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea indicated on Wednesday that it was open to further negotiations with the United States, which it said demanded a halt of its uranium-enrichment program in return for food aid before the death of Kim Jong-il last month.The day began inauspiciously as North Korea accused the United States of “politicizing” food aid, saying American negotiators had offered to ship humanitarian aid and temporarily lift economic sanctions if the North halted its uranium enrichment program.But a spokesman of the North’s Foreign Ministry struck a more conciliatory chord, saying, “We will wait and see if the United States has a willingness to establish confidence,” the official Korean Central News Agency reported.Negotiators took that as a sign that the government might be willing to engage Washington in talks under Mr. Kim’s son and successor, Kim Jong-un, even though it vowed not to negotiate with South Korea and even threatened to attack it.Kim Jong-il’s death left the world wondering where nuclear-armed North Korea, in the midst of a food crisis, would be headed under Kim Jong-un, who is consolidating his power as supreme commander of the North Korean People’s Army.'"
"'12-01-12,'1','Other risks highlighted by the forum include the potential problems stemming from greenhouse gas emissions, computer attacks and water supply disruptions.The emphasis on economic and social risks is a big shift from the focus of a year ago, when the group’s annual report on potential disruptions highlighted natural disasters, a threat that materialized when a devastating earthquake struck last March.The earthquake quickly became a human, environmental and economic disaster, spawning a tsunami that killed thousands of people in Japan and setting in motion events that resulted in a meltdown in several reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.The economic ripple effects from the spread throughout the world when manufacturing plants in Japan were shut down, causing widespread supply disruptions. It became a political event when, in the aftermath of the nuclear accident, announced that it planned to shut down its nuclear plants within a decade.“It was the world’s first trillion-dollar disaster,” said Erwann O. Michel-Kerjan, managing director of the Risk Management and Decision Processes Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who contributed to the forum’s report. “It’s one of the flip sides of globalization. A local event can become a global event much more quickly.”As a result, a number of risk analysts — not just those at the forum — are looking less at the specific nature of individual disasters and more at potential connections between them. These have become increasingly evident in a variety of shocks in the last decade or so, including the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the global financial crisis that began in 2007 and the eruption of a volcano in in 2010, which produced a huge ash cloud that disrupted air travel across for about a week.“It seems like we are facing a lot more disasters,” said Bernice Lee, research director for energy, environment and resource governance at the British research organization Chatham House. “But it may just be that we are feeling their impacts more because they are more globalized.”In a separate report for Chatham House, Ms. Lee argues that the world has grown more vulnerable to such events in recent years because of various factors, including the rise of the Internet and the popularity of the so-called just-in-time model of supply-chain management in business.Under this system, many companies stock only enough parts to keep assembly lines running for a few days. In normal times, this cuts costs and makes manufacturers more flexible. When disaster strikes, however, businesses may be more vulnerable than in the days when warehouses stocked months of supplies.The Internet, meanwhile, can magnify and spread the effects of a disaster in other ways. Rumors, even if incorrect, spread quickly on social networking sites — sometimes more rapidly than emergency services can communicate accurate information. As word of disasters like the terror attacks of Sept. 11 or the earthquake in Japan spreads globally, consumers hunker down in front of their computer screens or televisions, rather than going about their daily lives. This increases the economic effects of a crisis, even in areas far removed from the source.Howard Kunreuther, professor of decision sciences and business and public policy at Wharton, said that after the earthquake in Japan, researchers noticed an increase in sales of earthquake , even in places at little or no risk of earthquakes.“Before an event, nobody thinks something will happen to them,” he said. “After an event, people sometimes act equally irrationally.”While scientists can predict the probability — if not the exact timing or scale — of certain natural disasters, the ability to read a crystal ball may be more helpful than complex calculations in determining risks stemming from human events.Leading many forecasters’ worries is an escalation of tensions between the United States and . In addition to political turmoil, military action between the United States — or — and Iran could cause a sharp increase in oil prices, especially if the were blocked.Ed Yardeni, an independent economist in New York, lists this as one of his “four horsemen of the apocalypse” for 2012. The others, cited in a note to clients, are: a severe global squeeze stemming from the crisis in the euro zone; social upheaval in China and India; and a severe global emanating from Europe.Graham Hutchings, director of analysis at Analytica, adds to these the uncertainty caused by elections in a number of countries, including , and the United States, as well as a leadership transition in .Leadership changes can also come as a surprise, as they did to several heads of state in the Arab world last year, with a speed and suddenness that startled the experts. How the Arab Spring evolves, and how far the protests spread in the Arab world and beyond — as old assumptions about geopolitical alignments are being cast aside — are among the big uncertainties of 2012.“This is an uncharted world, one that we’re not familiar with, one that is not populated by two or three big powers and the other countries aligning themselves with one or another of those,” Mr. Hutchings said. “It is one that is marked by a dissolving of certainties, one that is more dependent on culture and context.”And, in what might turn out to be the most accurate prediction of 2012, he added, “Attempts to predict the affairs of humankind are marked by a kind of arrogance and are bound to fail.”'"

"'12-01-13,'0','To be sure, Wyoming’s oil and gas boom, which began in the 1990s, has drawn thousands of people with high-paying but dangerous jobs. In August, three workers were killed in Converse County after an explosion at an oil storage site.The report also found that nearly half of the state’s 622 deaths from 1992 to 2009 were transportation-related. Fatigue and failure to wear seat belts were factors, the report said.“I believe that we must find ways to get workers in Wyoming home safely at the end of the day,” Gov. Matt Mead said in a statement after the release of the report, which recommended that the state create a centralized system to better track data and that Wyoming’s occupational safety and health administration better promote voluntary inspections.But safety advocates say it has proven difficult to improve the situation. Oil and gas rig workers and their families are often itinerant, hold little political clout and fear that reporting safety problems could get them fired, said Laurie Goodman, a Wyoming lobbyist who has worked on occupational safety issues.Local trial lawyers also said that while Wyoming law is designed to provide workers or their families money after an injury or death, employers are legally immune so long as they comply with the state’s workers’ compensation act, much like other states.A lawsuit over Mr. Moss’s death was settled last February after his wife, Natalie, sued her husband’s direct supervisors — rare, but permissible in Wyoming — saying that they had known about the exposed cable but had done nothing, said Kristeen Hand, the Moss family’s lawyer.In 2009, Ms. Goodman and worker advocates tried unsuccessfully to get state lawmakers to pass a bill that would have made it easier for workers to file lawsuits after an accident.“We have a system where there’s no accountability, where the employer has no incentive to be responsive,” said John Vincent, a former mayor of Riverton, who has represented the families of dead and injured oil and gas workers in his law practice and has worked on the legislative effort. “People are afraid to sue. They won’t report injuries. They’ll just stay at home until they get better.”Even Dr. Ryan said that he did not feel he received full political support in producing his report and that he had grown frustrated before stepping down from his post in December.“The current Legislature is not interested in any new regulations that have to do with safety,” Dr. Ryan said. “It got to the point where I wanted to see the action that’s connected to these findings, and I decided it wasn’t happening at a pace I was comfortable with.”Wyoming’s powerful oil and gas industry says it has stepped up efforts to increase workplace safety over the past few years, but there is still considerable work to be done, said Jack Bedessem, vice president of the Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance, which was formed in 2010.The alliance has been working to improve safety awareness for supervisors and employees across the state and also trying to create more uniform training requirements, said Mr. Bedessem, chief executive of the Trihydro Corporation, a Laramie engineering company.“I think Dr. Ryan characterized the issues Wyoming is facing fairly accurately,” he said.After the workplace death report, Governor Mead said he would implement some of its recommendations and make permanent the epidemiology position to specifically study the problem.Natalie Moss said that such efforts have come too late for her, but are still critical for other families.“It seems like people die out there all the time. They’re leaving wives and children,” Ms. Moss said. “What 26-year-old should have to plan a funeral?”'"
"'12-01-13,'0','Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, saying that wages for the poorest New Yorkers had not kept up with rising consumer costs, endorsed a proposal on Thursday by the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, to increase the state’s minimum wage above the federal level of $7.25 an hour.“The genius of the free market is not always perfect,” the mayor said in his annual State of the City speech, delivered at Morris High School in the Bronx. Noting that two of New York’s neighbors had recently raised their hourly minimum wage — Connecticut to $8.25, Massachusetts to $8 — he said that he would support doing the same in New York.“While we would prefer the federal government to act to keep us competitive, this year we will join Speaker Shelly Silver in pushing for a responsible raise in the minimum wage,” he said.Mr. Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, announced his proposal in a brief speech before Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s State of the State address last week. He has not yet introduced legislation, but he is expected to call for the hourly minimum wage to be increased to at least $8.25 and be indexed to inflation.The governor, also a Democrat, has supported increasing the minimum wage in the past, but has not commented on Mr. Silver’s call for an increase this year.'"
"'12-01-13,'0','Four Cook County commissioners failed to take off some or all of the required 10 unpaid days in the fiscal year that ended Nov. 30, according to a preliminary report by the county comptroller’s office.All 17 commissioners approved the 2011 budget, which called for most of the county’s 23,700 employees to take five furlough days in addition to five county “shutdown” days in an effort to save an estimated 550 jobs. A spokeswoman for Toni Preckwinkle, the Cook County Board president, said the plan saved an estimated $23 million, $2.4 million less than was initially projected.The furlough plan proved difficult to enforce. About 10,400 county employees were exempted, said the spokeswoman, Liane Jackson, in some cases because they were deemed essential. At one point, five commissioners — William Beavers, Earlean Collins, Deborah Sims, Robert Steele and Joan Murphy — indicated they did not wish to participate.Commissioners could opt out of the plan calling for them to take 10 unpaid days each because the state constitution prohibits increasing or decreasing the salaries of sitting elected officials. The commissioners earn salaries of $85,000 a year and the unpaid days would have amounted to a pay cut of about 3.8 percent, or $3,270 .Ms. Sims, Mr. Steele and Ms. Murphy eventually participated in the furloughs. Mr. Beavers and Ms. Collins did not.Commissioners John Fritchey and Jerry Butler each took only five of the required unpaid days, according to the report, which the Chicago News Cooperative and the Better Government Association obtained through public records requests.'"
"'12-01-13,'0','Several Arab League monitors have left Syria or may do so soon because the mission has failed to halt President Bashar al-Assad’s violent crackdown on a popular revolt against his rule, a former monitor said. Anwar Malek, an Algerian who quit the monitoring team this week, said a Moroccan legal specialist, an aid worker from Djibouti and an Egyptian had left the mission. Syrian opposition groups say the monitors, who arrived in Syria on Dec. 26 to verify Syria’s compliance with an Arab peace plan, have only given Mr. Assad more time to crush the protests. The observers resumed work on Thursday, a league official said, for the first time since 11 of them were wounded by pro-Assad demonstrators in Latakia on Monday. The league’s secretary general, Nabil el-Araby, said Syria had carried out only parts of the agreement it had signed. “Neither the violence has stopped, nor the killing,” he told Al Hayat television. “The level has dropped, but it has not stopped.” The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 21 people were killed across the country on Thursday.'"
"'12-01-13,'0','Selig was a fan then, but by 1970 he was the rookie owner of the Brewers. At his first league meeting with Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, he sat nervously with two barons of the game: Philip K. Wrigley of the Chicago Cubs and Gussie Busch of the St. Louis Cardinals. His mentor, John Fetzer of the Detroit Tigers, looked on.“Bowie said, ‘I’m putting you between Mr. Wrigley and Mr. Busch,’ ” Selig recalled last April. “Mr. Fetzer was off to the side, saying, ‘It’s all right.’“Mr. Wrigley was a very quiet, really wonderful man, and I liked Mr. Busch, too.”Selig can go on and on about Williams and DiMaggio, Musial and Mays, Robinson and Koufax. He has a special fondness for his strong Brewers teams (there were a few) in the 1980s, and he watches the modern game by flipping among various television feeds every night at home.He is richly compensated for his work; various reports have said Selig earns about $18 million a year. Yet the real motivation to continue, Selig said, came from his fellow owners, the ones he has finally rallied, after decades of conflicting self-interest, to a common cause of industry growth.“I had been hearing people tell me there was a real groundswell, but one or two months ago, I hadn’t changed my mind,” Selig said. “But I guess the thing that did it was the feeling that this was in the best interests of baseball. People saying, ‘Please, you’ve got to do this’ — it was so consistent, one person after another. I guess about a week ago, I finally decided that if they really feel that way, with that much emotion and intensity, I really should think about doing this.”In 1992, when Selig took over after the ousting of Vincent, baseball generated $1.2 billion in revenue. Last year, the figure was $7 billion. Selig likes to talk about that, and advancements like the wild card, interleague play, drug testing and the World Baseball Classic.“In ’92, when I took over, things were so bleak, so abysmal,” Selig said. “And to think where we are today as a sport, between labor peace and the network and all the new ballparks, revenue sharing, the new economic system — I like to be able to dream about things, but you couldn’t have dreamed this would happen. The sport has never been healthier.”Early in Selig’s tenure, there were plenty of missteps, especially the 1994 strike and the rise of unchecked steroid use. The 1998 expansion to 30 teams, without enough truly viable markets, still stings. The Oakland Athletics and the Tampa Bay Rays have made little progress toward the ballparks they need. Selig’s committee to study the Oakland issue has been stalled for years, trying to untangle a dispute over territorial rights with the San Francisco Giants.“They just made a very objective status report,” Selig said. “I’m working with both clubs to step up the process. We’ll deal with it.”The steroids cloud continues to hover. Aaron did not test positive for performance-enhancing drugs, as Braun did, in the aftermath of his memorable home run. But Selig advocated the Mitchell report in 2007 — a painful, if incomplete, self-exam no other sport has performed — and his league is the only one in this country with blood testing for human growth hormone.It is a clever trick for a man pushing 80, turning a business once notoriously slow to adapt into an agent of change. Selig, who remembers the past so well, barrels ahead to the future.“I’m going into my on-field committee meeting now,” he said Thursday, at the end of a quick interview, “to talk about more changes.”'"
"'12-01-13,'0','The bill has bipartisan support from a majority of the House Judiciary Committee, for which Mr. Smith is chairman, and is likely to pass out of committee when Congress reconvenes late this month. Mr. Smith said there was no language in the bill that would harm American businesses.“Unless Rackspace is a foreign Web site primarily dedicated to illegal activity, it’s not going to affect them or Facebook or any of the others,” he said.Ed Black, the chief executive of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, said the bill would fundamentally change technology companies’ relationships with customers.“The harm is it ruins the business models for companies,” Mr. Black said. “We don’t want companies in a free society to act as secret police.”If the current bill passes, a plaintiff could obtain a court order without giving the defendant notice.A foreign Web site accused of breaking United States law would have 48 hours to request an appeal of the court’s decision. If it does not appeal, American companies would have five days to obey the court order or face liability for enabling illegal activity.Google and Yahoo would be required to remove hyperlinks to the accused Web site in search results, PayPal and Visa would have to stop payment transactions on the site, and Google AdWords would have to discontinue advertisements. (All of those companies oppose the bill.)Internet service providers and companies like Rackspace would be required to block American users from accessing the Web site, or, as Mr. Napier put it in his blog post, “censor their customers with little in the way of due process.”Rackspace estimates that a quarter of the business it conducts with its more than 160,000 customers is overseas. Its headquarters is in an area of San Antonio just outside Mr. Smith’s district, though he represents many of the 2,300 employees who work there.Despite the outcry, Mr. Smith stands behind the bill, which he said would protect Texans against intellectual property theft. Mr. Smith also pointed to Austin as a “ripe target” because of its thriving music and film industries.“There is an imbalance in the degree to which intellectual property rights are protected online,” said Chris Castle, a lawyer who represents musicians in Austin and supports SOPA.He said Texans would benefit from a more clearly defined set of property rights, because the bill would encourage investment in legitimate Internet businesses that can profit from legally distributing artists’ work. SOPA would force American companies and individuals to take responsibility for promoting criminal activity.The bill faces opposition from fellow conservatives in Mr. Smith’s home state and elsewhere. Gov. Rick Perry does not support the bill, nor does the conservative business advocacy group Americans for Job Security.The measure would force technology companies to divert resources they could spend on innovation, job growth and marketing for “compliance with this new regulatory regime,” said Stephen DeMaura, the president of Americans for Job Security. The extra spending on legal counsel would hurt hundreds of technology companies in Texas, he added, and especially harm start-ups and small businesses.Organizations and people opposed to SOPA say the bill would “nuke” high-tech companies in Mr. Smith’s district, and they accuse Mr. Smith of representing the interests of the entertainment industry over his constituents.According to Opensecrets.org, which is run by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit that tracks money in politics, the majority of Mr. Smith’s campaign financing, $59,300 in this year’s election cycle, has come from the entertainment industry.But Opensecrets also reports that Mr. Smith has received $392,995 from the entertainment industry and $387,440 from the technology industry since 1998 — a small difference over all.The technology industry remains convinced that its views were under-represented at a committee hearing on the bill and that pirates would find ways to evade the measure’s provisions. Federal lawmakers are trying to move the bill quickly, Mr. Black said, without conducting extensive economic studies or consulting technical experts on cybersecurity.“You would at least hope that there would be an attempt to hear out all stakeholders,” Mr. Black said, “so there could be a consensus of understanding where there’s common ground and where there are different views to try to bend.”'"
"'12-01-13,'0','“I’m quite worried about the retail sector and consumer spending,” said David Tinsley, an economist in London for BNP Paribas. He said Britain could already be in the middle of a recession or might be able to just avoid it. “It’s going to be pretty close,” he said.The retail sector is not the only industry suffering. Royal Bank of Scotland announced a new round of job cuts on Thursday, saying 3,500 positions would be eliminated at its investment banking division over the next three years to reduce costsJob vacancies in London’s financial industry fell 8 percent last year to less than half of what they were during 2007, according to recruitment firm Morgan McKinley. The firm said that job opportunities might never return to levels before the financial crisis.Not all British retailers struggled during the holiday season. Tesco’s smaller rival J Sainsbury, which owns the supermarket chain Sainsbury’s, topped some analysts’ expectations with its sales during the holiday period as customers bought more luxury food and discounted goods. Tesco said its own price cuts helped to increase sales volume but failed to lift profit.“This wasn’t the Christmas that I wanted,” Tesco’s chief executive, Philip Clarke, said in a conference call with analysts. He called the British consumer environment “challenging” and said there were early signs of more cautious behavior emerging in other markets.David McCarthy, an analyst at Evolution Securities, said Tesco was “performing weakly in a weak industry” and that profitability would be squeezed across the entire sector.Many retailers were hoping for a busy holiday sales period but instead had to cut prices early and to levels last seen in the aftermath of the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers, the British Retail Consortium said this month. About 36 percent of British consumers are spending less on clothing and footwear and 28 percent are spending less on furniture amid concerns about the crisis in the euro zone and rising unemployment, according to the group. About one in five households has had a recent reduction in disposable income as a result of unemployment, less overtime work and loss of bonuses, it said.Bankruptcies among retailers in Britain rose 11 percent, to 183 companies, last year with 42 businesses running out of money in the final quarter, Deloitte reported Jan. 9. Among the casualties of 2011 were the shoe retailer Barratts, the wine and liquor retailer Oddbins and the women’s clothing chain Jane Norman.The outdoor clothing chain Blacks Leisure and the lingerie firm La Senza almost collapsed before finding buyers.'"
"'12-01-13,'0','New York’s dairy farmers are among the biggest beneficiaries of the public’s love affair with Greek yogurt, because it takes much more milk to make Greek yogurt than regular yogurt. “This is a ‘once every two or three generations’ situation,” said Bruce Krupke, executive vice president of the Northeast Dairy Foods Association. “All of the right forces have come together to make it very attractive to build in New York state.”Data compiled by the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets shows that the state produced 368 million pounds of yogurt in 2010, nearly 40 percent more than the previous year. Over five years, production rose almost 60 percent. Much of that increase is for Greek yogurt production.And the growth is continuing. Through a combination of new plants and expansions, within a few years, the state could produce twice as much yogurt as it made in 2010.“We’re literally building as we speak to keep up with demand,” said Russell B. Evans, Fage’s director of United States marketing.Fage, based in Greece, is credited with introducing many Americans to Greek yogurt and thereby starting the boom. The company chose to open its plant in Johnstown, N.Y., in 2008 partly because it was close to New York City, where a large community of people of Greek descent made a ready market familiar with their product. But the appeal turned out to be much broader.The Johnstown plant had an initial capacity of 26 million pounds a year and last year produced 123 million pounds. Its planned expansion, which is expected to take about two years, would allow the company to make up to 352 million pounds a year.AgroFarma, founded by a Turkish immigrant, began making Greek-style yogurt under the Chobani brand name four years ago at a former Kraft Foods plant in South Edmeston, N.Y. Now the leading American maker of Greek yogurt, the company currently takes in about three million pounds of milk a day, from which it makes a million pounds of yogurt. When the current phase of expansion is done in the spring, the plant’s capacity will increase by about a third, said Mikael B. Pedersen, the chief operating officer of AgroFarma. (Chobani also recently announced plans to build a $128 million plant in Idaho, to better supply markets across the country.)The Greek yogurt boom has translated into jobs in rural areas of New York that badly need them. Chobani said it currently employed about 900 people in New York and expected to add about 100 more. Fage said it had about 240 full-time employees and expected to add about 150. The new Alpina plant in Batavia will employ about 50 people.“We went for many, many years in this state with regard to dairy manufacturing generally without seeing any remodeling of plants of any scale,” said Patrick M. Hooker, senior director of industrial development of the Empire State Development Corporation, a state-controlled economic development agency.Then came Greek yogurt. Mr. Hooker said that yogurt making was a big jobs creator, compared with many other forms of agricultural production.To make yogurt, farmers have to grow crops, “which are fed to cows, and cows need to be milked, and milk needs to be trucked and processed and cultured and made into yogurt and then trucked again and sent to consumers,” Mr. Hooker said. “It’s a huge multiplier.”What’s more, because Greek-style yogurt is strained to give it a denser texture, more milk is required to make it. Industry executives said it typically took about three pounds of milk to make one pound of Greek-style yogurt, compared with the single pound of milk needed to make a pound of traditional yogurt.“The growth in dairy manufacturing, particularly in the Greek yogurt category, has really been a fantastic boon for New York dairy farmers,” said Julie C. Suarez, director of public policy for the New York Farm Bureau, a trade group for farmers. She cited an estimate by Cornell University that New York farmers would have to increase milk production by 15 percent in the next two years to keep up with demand.Because milk prices are governed by a complex system of federal controls, there is not always a straight line between increased demand and higher prices. Milk prices across the country increased last year, after slumping badly during the recession. Still, the demand from yogurt makers in New York has contributed to higher milk prices, partly through premiums offered by processors to insure high-quality supply.Ms. Suarez said that farmers benefited from having a reliable market for their milk close by. It gives them security when they make plans to expand their herds and it reduces their transportation costs for the milk.New York may be the fastest-growing producer of yogurt, but other states have seen production rise as well. California produces more milk than any other state and is the nation’s leading yogurt producer. Yogurt production in California was 620 million pounds in 2009, the last year data was available. That was an increase of 6.5 percent from the previous year.Tennessee is another state that saw a big jump in yogurt production, partly because of the expansion of a major Yoplait plant in the state.“Stop and think,” said John Sanford, a dairy regulator with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture, discussing the reasons for the yogurt boom. “It’s nutritious. It’s safe, it’s healthy and it’s delicious. How can you be any better?”'"
"'12-01-13,'0','On Thursday, the agency dismissed the more serious allegations of anticompetitive behavior. The agency found only one violation — that one of the company’s Medicare drug plans, then called RxAmerica, misled some consumers about drug prices.“After a thorough and comprehensive review of other consumer protection and competition issues in this matter, the F.T.C. issued a letter closing the investigation,” the agency said in a news release.In a statement, CVS Caremark said that the settlement related only to the practices of RxAmerica, a subsidiary of Longs Drug Stores, that took place before CVS Caremark acquired Longs in October 2008. (While much of the incorrect pricing did occur before the purchase, the F.T.C. asserted that some continued after the acquisition.)CVS Caremark said that the subsidiary had inadvertently posted inaccurate prices for certain generic drugs on a Web site maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and that the company had rectified the pricing problem upon learning of it.“CVS Caremark is pleased to have reached an agreement with the F.T.C. that ends the investigation and enables us to continue our focus on offering unique, innovative products and services that differentiate us and benefit consumers,” said Larry Merlo, the chief executive of CVS Caremark, in the statement.This is not CVS Caremark’s first instance of incorrect pricing. In 2010, the company notified the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that from October 2009 to January 2010, a computer error had caused it to provide incorrect prices — about 4 percent lower than the actual price — for brand-name prescription drugs available through its SilverScript Medicare drug plan. The company offered to refund the price difference to customers who had paid more than they had expected. It also offered to help them switch to another plan.The F.T.C.’s decision in the current case removes a significant overhang for CVS Caremark. The company said it was currently in discussions with the attorneys general of 24 states and the District of Columbia to resolve a parallel multistate investigation.In 2006, when CVS proposed to merge with Caremark, executives pledged that the new company would put up a firewall to keep the activities of its stores separate from the benefits manager, which processes prescriptions from competing pharmacies. Thomas M. Ryan, then CVS’s chief executive, said in a conference call with investors in 2006 that the merged company would “be agnostic to where the consumer fills their prescription.”But pharmacies and consumer groups asserted in their complaints to regulators that the two divisions of the company had shared consumers’ records, steering people to the company’s retail stores and mail-order operations, which gave CVS Caremark an unfair advantage over competitors. At the time, some consumer advocates called for the merger to be dissolved.The F.T.C. mounted a sweeping investigation, involving its bureau of consumer protection, bureau of economics and bureau of competition — an unusual effort by the agency. But it ultimately cited CVS Caremark for only the RxAmerica violation.In the statement, Douglas A. Sgarro, the chief legal officer of CVS Caremark, said, “It is important to note that, at the conclusion of this comprehensive investigation, the F.T.C. made no allegations of antitrust law violations or anticompetitive behavior associated with any of our business practices, products or service offerings.”Industry analysts said the settlement represented a victory for CVS Caremark and a repudiation of the merger’s critics.“I think this should make investors comfortable that the F.T.C. is also comfortable with this new paradigm,” said Lisa Gill, an analyst at J. P. Morgan. (CVS Caremark has been a client of the investment bank within the last year).But the National Community Pharmacists Association, one of the groups that opposed the merger, said it was disappointed that the F.T.C. had not taken stronger action to protect consumers and market competition.“The union of these companies further compounds the inherent, ‘the fox is guarding the henhouse’ problem with today’s prescription drug benefit system,” B. Douglas Hoey, the chief executive of the association, said in a statement.Industry analysts said CVS Caremark’s settlement with the F.T.C. would have no bearing on the agency’s review of the proposed horizontal merger of Express Scripts and Medco Health.The F.T.C. complaint charged that from 2007 through at least November 2008, the RxAmerica plan posted on its Web site and supplied to some third-party Web sites incorrect prices for Medicare Part D prescription drugs at two pharmacy chains, CVS and Walgreens.The posted prices caused many people to choose the CVS Caremark plan and pay as much as 10 times more than they had expected, according to the F.T.C. In some cases, the higher prices unexpectedly pushed older consumers into the so-called doughnut hole — a gap in prescription drug coverage that requires people to pay out of pocket for their medicines.CVS Caremark is required to pay $5 million to reimburse consumers for the price difference and is barred from making deceptive claims about drug prices. The agency said it planned to mail checks to consumers who were deceived.But Representative Sharon Anglin Treat, a Democrat in the Maine House of Representatives who advocates reduced drug prices, said the settlement did not go far enough to compensate patients who may have forgone buying medications they needed because they could not afford the higher prices.“I don’t think this kind of mispricing is minor,” Representative Treat said.'"
"'12-01-13,'0','The Apple details came after Target described a separate program, called The Shops at Target, to open small boutiques in its stores. For the first round of the shops, which will open in May and run for six weeks, Target will showcase five local stores, like Polka Dog Bakery in Boston, which sells pet food and accessories, and The Webster in Miami, which sells clothing.Target plans to sell about 400 exclusive items that the retailers created with Target’s guidance. Prices on the first round of items range from $1 to $159.99 for a pouf (a type of ottoman) from Privet House, a Connecticut-based home-goods retailer. Target plans to repeat the program in the fall, with a different set of stores, and continue it through at least 2013, Ms. Jenkins said.Stores-within-a-store, with dedicated floor space and signs and shelves designed by a brand, have been a popular strategy for a while. Department stores have long had small boutiques for designers like Ralph Lauren or Chanel. J. C. Penney, a Target competitor, has made its stores-within-a-store — for Sephora, Call It Spring, MNG by Mango and other brands — a centerpiece of its strategy.Target also said it would continue with its designer collaborations, in which fashion designers make a low-price line for Target. When the Missoni for Target line was introduced in September, the Target Web site crashed under the huge demand and it took months for some consumers to get their orders. The next collaboration, to be sold in February, is with Jason Wu.Target made the announcement in the wake of disappointing holiday sales figures. Its December sales at stores open at least a year rose just 1.6 percent, compared with expectations of a 3.1 percent increase among analysts tracked by Thomson Reuters. And Target warned last week that its fourth-quarter profit would be lower than it had previously estimated.'"
"'12-01-13,'0','In the Bronx, Steve Owens, the owner of Able Snow Patrol, oversees a currently idle fleet of snow plows and each morning curses the forecast. “This has been a very slow start for us,” he said. “We have a lot of anxious drivers sitting at home who want to get out and make money. They get paid by the inch.”Beyond any economic fallout, there is the ineffable snow-borne lightness that many across the New York region miss. Schoolchildren — and teachers — wondering when the next snow day will come. Alternate-side-of-the-street parkers, spoiled by the 17-day suspension last winter, looking for a break. Harried residents longing for the stillness that descends with the snow.“It makes New York more magical,” said Teddy Schiff, an Upper East Side real estate developer.The winter is still young, of course. On Thursday, the rain that hit the city was mixed with snow farther north; the Adirondacks got several inches, though that was little solace for the snow-starved here, many of whom would probably be surprised to learn that even if Central Park does not see another flurry, this winter will not break any records. The 2.9 inches that fell during the October storm already surpassed the accumulation for the winter of 1972-73, which logged just 2.8 inches.Still, compared with the past 15 years, this winter is shaping up to be particularly skimpy, snow-wise. The past decade was the first, since weather records have been kept, that New York City had four consecutive years with at least 40 inches of snow. The record for annual snowfall was set in 1995-96, with 75.6 inches.“The recent past in New York City has been characterized by unusually great snowfalls, although this year things are evening out,” said Fred Gadomski, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University. “This is how we end up with averages. Some years, there’s a blockbuster amount of snow and other years, it just doesn’t happen.For city officials, the absence of snow is a balm. The Sanitation Department has a current snow-removal budget of $42.8 million, which covers the cost of salt, overtime and equipment repairs. Last winter, the city had run through half that amount by mid-January; so far this year, it has used about 5 percent.Any money left at the end of the season goes back into the general fund. “For the city, it’s a life saver,” said John J. Doherty, the sanitation commissioner. “It’s great to get a year like this once in a while.”The city has 250,000 tons of salt available in the event the weather takes a turn. Late last winter, the department made two emergency purchases of rock salt totaling $6.3 million to replenish its stores.The city’s parks are also prepared for snow when, or if, it comes. Hundreds of hay bales dot Riverside Park in Manhattan, ready to prevent sledders from crashing into lampposts and trees. And the parks department stands ready to provide its traditional free hot chocolate on snowy days — 2,500 cups, on average — in several parks.“It becomes more of a party, and we hand out extra sleds,” said John Herrold, president of the Riverside Park Fund. “I hope we have at least one snow day.”Not everyone feels that way, of course. Anne Asanovic, a secretary in Midtown who commutes 108 miles by bus daily from her home in the Poconos, has not regretted the scarcity of snow for a minute, having missed six days of work last winter. “I feel terrific that there’s no snow,” she said.Same for Tony Backos, a lawyer who lives in Greenwich, Conn. During one snow storm last year, he and his family lost power for four days. “I wouldn’t mind if we didn’t have any snow for the rest of the winter,” he said.Do not tell that to the folks at the Bronx Zoo, where staff members are eager to see their cold-loving charges — Siberian tigers, snow leopards and polar bears, to name a few — in their natural element.“Some species clearly enjoy it when it snows,” said Patrick R. Thomas, the zoo’s general curator and associate director. “Our tigers are more active and playful in the snow, and the polar bears slide across it. They just exhibit what we would consider joyful behaviors.”If joy and parking can inhabit the same space, New Yorkers who are liberated from alternate-side-of-the-street parking rules by snowfall have been there — just not this winter.The humorist Calvin Trillin wrote a novel, “Tepper Isn’t Going Out,” about a man who spends his days hunting for the perfect Manhattan parking spot. Though Mr. Trillin now enjoys the luxury of a garage, he still empathizes with the alternate-siders.Getting respite from the tyranny of alternate side, he said, “is a wonderful New York thing.” For the die-hard parkers, he added, a winter without a snow suspension would feel as if “Christmas was canceled.”'"
"'12-01-13,'0','Mr. Johnson’s novel imagines one particularly barbarous prison camp, where would-be escapees are stoned to death, and it describes lobotomies performed with a 20-centimeter nail as a “preferred method of reforming corrupted citizens” and an “autopilot” torture machine used by interrogators for “pain delivery.”An interrogator who has been assigned the case of a professor accused of “counterrevolutionary teachings” (“using an illegal radio to play South Korean pop songs to his students”), says of his craft: “We ramp up the pain to inconceivable levels, a shifting, muscular river of pain. Pain of this nature creates a rift in the identity — the person who makes it to the far shore will have little resemblance to the professor who now begins the crossing. In a few weeks, he will be a contributing member of a rural farm collective, and perhaps we can even find a widow to comfort him. There’s no way around it: to get a new life, you’ve got to trade in your old one.”The North Korean prisons here seem designed to erase identity and all that makes one human. “In Prison 33, little by little, you relinquished everything, starting with your tomorrows and all that might be,” Mr. Johnson writes. “Next went your past, and suddenly it was inconceivable that your head had ever touched a pillow, that you’d once used a spoon or a toilet, that your mouth had once known flavors and your eyes had beheld colors beyond gray and brown and the shade of black that blood took on.”As for Mr. Johnson’s hero, Jun Do, he goes from being an instrument of the state — kidnapping an assortment of people on official orders and eavesdropping on foreign radio transmissions — to becoming one of its victims. Along the way he commits terrible acts that will haunt the rest of his days, and yet he doggedly clings to the goal of survival.And then, unexpectedly, he meets and falls in love with Sun Moon, the country’s most famous actress, “the only person who could take away the pain he’d suffered.” His love for her will alter the trajectory of his story and give him the chance to commit a selfless act — inspired, weirdly, by the movie “Casablanca” — that might redeem his life.In recounting Jun Do’s peregrinations, Mr. Johnson does an agile job of combining fablelike elements with vivid emotional details to create a story that has both the boldness of a cartoon and the nuance of a deeply felt portrait. He captures the grotesque horrors that Jun Do is involved in, or witness to, even as he gives us a visceral sense of the world that his characters inhabit. It’s a world in which anyone may be an informer, and suspicion poisons relationships between parents and children, husbands and wives. Here, even love is considered a liability, an emotion that gives the government leverage over would-be defectors: one more thing it can take away.In the course of “The Orphan Master’s Son,” Jun Do travels with a delegation to America (which results in some ridiculously funny scenes set at a Texas ranch), is sent to a prison camp and later assumes the identity of Sun Moon’s husband, a national hero named Commander Ga, whom he may or may not have killed. His real evolution, however, is more significant: By the book’s end he has grown from a sort of generic Everyman — a faceless representative of the indignities a citizen in North Korea might be subject to — into a full-fledged individual for whom the reader roots and grieves.In making his hero, and the nightmare he lives through, come so thoroughly alive, Mr. Johnson has written a daring and remarkable novel, a novel that not only opens a frightening window on the mysterious kingdom of North Korea, but one that also excavates the very meaning of love and sacrifice.'"
"'12-01-13,'0','Investors have been worried that Italy and Spain, the third- and fourth-largest countries in the euro area, might be dragged into the region’s debt crisis. Greece, Ireland and Portugal have been forced to get relief from their lenders after their borrowing costs spiked to levels the countries could no longer afford.The euro rose nearly a penny against the dollar, to $1.28, as worries eased about Europe’s financial woes. The currency, which is shared by 17 European Union countries, fell to a 16-month low against the dollar the day before. An auction of 30-year United States Treasury bonds drew meager interest from investors as cash flowed back into European debt.The Dow Jones industrial average gained 21.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to end at 12,471.02. It was down most of the day, losing 64 points in the first hour of trading, following a rise in unemployment claims and a weak report on December retail sales.The S.& P. 500 finished up 3.02 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,295.50. The Nasdaq composite rose 13.94 points, 0.5 percent, to 2,724.70.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 6/32, to 100 21/32. The yield rose to 1.93 percent, from 1.91 percent late Wednesday.It was the latest day of quiet trading in the stock market. There have been six consecutive days with moves of less than 1 percent in the S.& P. 500.Ralph Fogel, investment strategist and partner at Fogel Neale Partners in New York, said the moderate moves were an encouraging sign after the steep rises and sudden declines that were typical of last summer. “This is a much healthier market than we’ve seen,” he said.Unemployment benefits spiked last week to the highest level in six weeks, mostly because companies let go of thousands of holiday hires, the government reported. Retail sales barely rose in December and were lower than analysts were expecting.Despite the mixed news on the economy, investors are starting to focus on the corporate earnings season, which got under way this week after Alcoa, the aluminum maker, predicted stronger demand for its products and surprised the market with higher revenue than analysts expected.“There’s a fair amount of pessimism out there but I also think that investors are slowly becoming immune to the bad news,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago. “As long as the stuff you can sink your teeth into, like corporate profit, is improving, I think it bodes well for the markets this year.”Chevron fell 2.6 percent after the world’s second-largest publicly traded oil company said its income would be “significantly” below its fourth-quarter results in the prior quarter because of narrower margins on refining and selling fuels.The business software company CA Inc. jumped 4.2 percent after the hedge fund Taconic Capital disclosed in a regulatory filing that it has taken a 5.1 percent stake. It also said it was pressing CA to return more cash to shareholders and increase its profit margins.'"

The Tibetan man, Gurgo Tsering, in his mid-30s, was killed on Jan. 8 in a late night raid in Achok, in Xiahe County. The new airport in Achok was approved by officials in 2009, but locals have expressed concerns because it is being built near a sacred mountain. Tibetans ransacked the Achok police station after the fatal shooting, and the riot police were called in to put down the unrest, the report said.'"
"'12-01-14,'0','Washington Mutual said that it had won court approval to send its latest reorganization plan to creditors for a vote and that it hoped to end its bankruptcy by the end of February. Once the largest savings and loan in the country, Washington Mutual expects to distribute more than $7 billion to creditors after it emerges from Chapter 11. A hearing to confirm its reorganization plan is scheduled to begin on Feb. 16. Washington Mutual won permission to send its plan to creditors when United States Bankruptcy Judge Mary F. Walrath in Wilmington, Del., this week approved its so-called disclosure statement. Some creditors sought to delay approval of the disclosure statement, so they could appeal a ruling concerning their claims to about $1.5 billion of preferred securities to another judge.'"
"'12-01-14,'0','Yet the act of desecrating an enemy’s body is as old as war, perhaps most famously described by Homer in “The Iliad,” when Achilles drags Hector’s lifeless body behind his chariot before the eyes of a shocked and despairing Troy. Nancy Sherman, a professor of philosophy at Georgetown University who has written a book about the moral implications of war on troops, “The Untold War,” said dehumanizing the enemy can be a psychological defense mechanism for the troops whose job is to kill that enemy.“Desecrating bodies is not routine, nor is it expected or condoned,” Ms. Sherman said. “But you can understand it, in complicated ways. Because war requires a very complicated moral psyche.”Mr. Exum said black humor is another coping mechanism for young troops trying to act tough beyond their years. “I remember being a young officer in Afghanistan in 2002 and standing over the body of this partially decapitated Taliban and cracking jokes,” he said. “Humor is how we cope with pretty horrific stuff. It’s almost dangerous to be too sensitive.”Alex Lemons, a Marine scout sniper during the fierce fighting in the Iraqi city of Falluja in 2004, said that on several occasions he encountered American troops who either urinated on insurgent bodies or manipulated them for photographs, like putting them in ridiculous poses. While he called such behavior disgusting, he also said it could be cathartic.“I’ve never spat on a dead body or urinated on one, but I’ve certainly screamed at a dead body because they’ve taken a friend’s life,” said Mr. Lemons, who left the Marine Corps in 2008.Snipers in both the Army and the Marine Corps are elite teams highly trained in marksmanship, surveillance and camouflage who can operate independently from larger units. They often patrol dangerous areas and get more kills, and are sometimes viewed as cowboys by regular infantry troops as a result. But Mr. Lemons and other officers said scout snipers tend to be more mature and disciplined, precisely because they are expected to face greater danger.“In sniper school, we were taught not to relish in killing,” Mr. Lemons said. “We’re professional gunmen. That’s what the other side does, not us.”Though some military blogs have been filled with reader comments supporting the Marines in the video, some of the harshest criticism against them has come from other Marines who feel that the corps, and even the entire American military, have been disgraced.“There is no excuse for what they did,” said Timothy Kudo, who served with a Marine unit in northern Helmand Province and now works for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America. “It goes against everything you’ve been trained to do as a Marine.”Michael Newton, a former Army prosecutor who now teaches at Vanderbilt Law School, said the international laws of war and the American code of military justice are intended to instill discipline in troops and set boundaries for what is acceptable in combat. Prosecuting war crimes is necessary to ensure that crossing those boundaries does not become the norm, he said.“Some people will look at this and say all Marines are animals,” he said. “But that’s not true. That instance was undisciplined and unprofessional. And that’s why it’s a war crime. The law exists to instill professionalism. But it is also there to create a humanitarian imperative, even in conflict.”Beyond court-martial or prison, the desecration of an enemy’s body could also leave psychological scars on the perpetrators, in the form of guilt, Mr. Lemons said. “Even though there are all these consequences on an international level that these guys didn’t comprehend, the worst effects are the ones they will have to come to terms with later in life,” he said. “Every memory gets stored in you. Even if it was something that just took two seconds, you’ll have revisit it at some point.”'"

"'12-01-14,'0','You deserve credit for continuing to bring attention to the antibiotic-resistance crisis and the Food and Drug Administration’s failure to limit the overuse of antibiotics in animal agriculture.The threat from overuse of antibiotics in animals is no longer debatable; even the F.D.A. recognizes that we face an urgent problem. Yet instead of confronting this issue, the agency has at best taken modest measures (like the prohibition of some extralabel use of cephalosporins).At worst, the agency has turned its back on much-needed oversight, opting for a voluntary approach to regulating industry, and essentially abrogating its mandate to protect public health.We strongly agree with you: the F.D.A. must act. Yet if this administration will not act, Congress can and should. The bipartisan Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act would ease the F.D.A.’s burden and reduce antibiotic resistance by phasing out the use of medically important antibiotics in food animals that are not sick.With more and more Americans becoming ill from bacteria that cannot be treated with commonly used antibiotics, we must end a practice that endangers the viability of these miracle drugs.The writer is chairman of Keep Antibiotics Working, a coalition to end the overuse of antibiotics in animals.'"
"'12-01-14,'0','Charles E. Merrill & Company opened for business nearly 100 years ago, and the company (along with Merrill’s current owner Bank of America, interestingly enough), resolved to serve Main Street, not Wall Street. Charlie Merrill put it this way, according to the 1994 book by my colleague Joe Nocera, “A Piece of the Action.” In it, he quotes Mr. Merrill as writing the following: “A new guild has sprung up in the [investment] banking profession which does not despise the modest sums of the thrifty.”Many brokerage firms have backed away from that sort of stance in recent years. An old saw in the industry notes that the little old lady with the diminishing balance who hounds you when her dividend checks arrive late takes up five times as much time as a 50-year-old millionaire.Besides, you make more money serving richer people. So the big firms (and thousands of smaller operations and individuals) fight hard over the 1 percent and then siphon off a small cut of their assets each year through fees and other revenue mechanisms.Everyone else ends up at Charles Schwab or Fidelity and pays roughly $1,500 to $3,000 if they want a full financial plan with advice on insurance and mortgages and other things beyond investments.A few years ago, Citi took a bold step with its myFi service that aimed to provide just that sort of holistic guidance from bank branches. But it introduced the service at one of the worst economic moments since World War II, and the bank shuttered myFi when it did not succeed quickly enough for its tastes.Nowadays, a thrifty Merrill customer with modest sums is told to use a service called Merrill Edge. And Merrill is taking its best shot at attracting and keeping them (and eventually) upgrading them to a real broker), given that it believes that there are 28 million households with $50,000 to $250,000 in assets.The people who service them are called Financial Solutions Advisors. There are more than 500 of them in bank branches and the company will hire 500 more in 2012. There are currently about 800 F.S.A.’s working in call centers as well.The company (to my great surprise) could not say how many of them were certified financial planners, the sort of people trained to look at a client’s whole life before making investment recommendations.If Merrill isn’t tracking this, it’s tempting to conclude that the company doesn’t make the credential (and holistic advice) a priority and that all it wants to do is push investments. Still, Merrill does the right thing and encourages people to earn the certification by covering classes for F.S.A.’s who want to become certified financial planners.Dean Athanasia, the executive who oversees Merrill Edge, said that any good investment advice had to be holistic by its very nature. “If you have a mortgage and debt, then you need to factor that into the consideration of your planning for the future,” he said. “You can’t just look at assets.”The Merrill Edge investment account costs a flat $125 each year if you are working with an F.S.A., though the company will also manage a portfolio for you for 1 percent of your assets annually. As for the underlying mutual fund fees, the firm collects “the appropriate fees based on our agreement with the firm and the prospectus.”Anyone working this way needs to ask their adviser for a plain-English explanation of how much money, if any, Merrill stands to collect in any way, shape or form now or in the future, based on the mutual funds it selects for you. And if any of you have asked an F.S.A. for a collection of low-cost Vanguard or similar funds, I’d be curious to hear what the reaction was.On compensation, Merrill appears to be doing the right thing, meanwhile; advisers earn a salary plus incentives based on the amount of assets they gather and manage, whether it’s in bank savings accounts or in mutual funds or other investments.The most curious thing about my conversation with Mr. Athanasia is that he didn’t once mention personal budgeting.Contrast that with LearnVest, which opened for business in late 2009 with a focus on helping younger women. The company patterns itself in part after Weight Watchers and offers content, tools and a financial dashboard that pulls information from all your various accounts. It also conducts what it calls “boot camps” for people looking to make financial changes; 280,000 people have signed up for at least one so far.LearnVest’s most intriguing offering, however, is something it introduced earlier this month: three tiers of access to financial plans of varying detail. Customers also get e-mail or phone access to live certified financial planners who can help put the plans to work. Prices range from $69 to $349 for varying levels of phone and e-mail access.“We don’t think financial planning should be a luxury to anyone,” said Alexa von Tobel, the 28-year-old founder and chief executive, who is quick to point how warped our world is when you need a plan to build wealth but need wealth to hire someone to build you a plan, given that the advice can cost well into the four figures.But you get what you pay for, and the biggest thing you do not get from LearnVest is investment advice. It’s not a registered investment adviser, so it can’t tell you what mutual funds to pick. Yet the company persists in calling its plans “core” and “complete” and mentions retirement planning when promoting one of them.Sheryl Garrett, who runs a network of financial planners who charge by the hour and says she admires what Ms. von Tobel is doing, worries that LearnVest customers may feel misled in this regard. “Those terms are really, really dangerous,” Ms. Garrett said. “I would fully anticipate that some kind of investment advice would be given when looking at these plans.”""We are confident that the language used in our marketing, terms and conditions, and disclosures clearly define what is and is not included in each plan package,” the company said in a written statement. “We have received great demand in the last week from members across the country and have not encountered any confusion.""And Ms. von Tobel, who practically bursts with ambition in person, seems set on offering investment advice one way or the other, pretty soon. Until then, the company’s disclosure efforts sure seem as if it’s trying to wash its hands of any regulatory or other responsibility for the advice it offers up. “LearnVest is not a financial adviser, planner, broker or tax adviser,” it reads. “The services are intended only to assist you in your household and financial organization.”Meanwhile, her fees are cause for suspicion; can she really pay her seven full- and part-time planners a good wage and turn out a good plan while charging such low fees? She said that she was confident enough in the profit margins she had built into the service that she was willing to take the same no-new-fee pledge (for 24 months in this case) that my friend Suze Orman agreed to in my column last week about her new prepaid debit card.That said, Ms. von Tobel reserves the right to charge more for extra services beyond what her three plans include today. LearnVest might also build additional packages that might cost more than the current $349 top rate.As for those planners, Stephany Kirkpatrick, trains all of them. And her newest hire, who is not working with customers quite yet as she’s sitting for the certified financial planner exam in two months, is Mina Black, who is 32 years old.LearnVest hired her from Merrill Edge, of all places, where she worked in the Bank of America branch closest to the Occupy Wall Street protests. “I have a lot of friends within this market,” Ms. Black said. “When they came to me as a Merrill Lynch adviser, there was only so much I could do with them.”In recent days, according to Ms. von Tobel, the company has seen keen interest from customers. But there have also been a lot of Web site visitors from other financial services companies, including Merrill itself, that might have cause to worry about their younger customers being poached.“The way we think about this is that we would love to have those clients,” she said. “Everyone is looking. We’re one big fishbowl.”'"
"'12-01-14,'0','“It’s a bit of a half-step really to say, ‘Here are the names of the factories, go look through a haystack,’ ” Ms. Gearhart said. “But it’s a start.”Steve Dowling, an Apple spokesman, declined to comment beyond the report.The calls for Apple to disclose suppliers became particularly acute after a series of deaths and accidents in recent years.In the last two years at companies supplying services to Apple, 137 employees were seriously injured after cleaning screens with n-hexane, a toxic chemical that can cause nerve damage and ; numerous workers have committed suicide, or fallen or jumped from buildings in a manner suggesting ; and in two separate explosions caused by dust from polishing iPad cases, four were killed and 77 injured.Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., posted the supplier list on its Web site on Friday as part of something it calls its supplier responsibility progress report, a document typically published in February. Apple provides aggregate statistics of audits examining labor, discrimination, worker health and safety, environmental and other practices.The list consists of 156 companies, accounting for 97 percent of what Apple says it pays to its suppliers. Apple’s tally of its suppliers includes many big-name companies like Intel and , both makers of chips for Apple’s Macintosh computers, along with other parts makers like Samsung Electronics, and . The list also includes less recognized companies like Zeniya Aluminum Engineering, Jin Li Mould Manufacturing and Unisteel Technology.But the list excludes many of the secondary suppliers — companies that provide parts to firms that directly contract with Apple. For instance, though the American glassmaker has manufactured the strengthened glass in iPhones, it does not appear on the list because it technically does not contract with Apple, but with an intermediary that finishes the glass before it is delivered to an assembly factory.Apple said 229 audits were conducted as part of this year’s supplier responsibility report, an 80 percent increase over the number the year before. The company said the facilities where repeat audits were done had shown fewer violations.In an e-mail to Apple employees, , the chief executive, said Apple had used its influence to improve living conditions for the people who make its products, including employee housing. “To meet our requirements, many suppliers have renovated their dorms or built new ones altogether,” he wrote.This is the sixth such report Apple has issued. The company began conducting audits and publishing reports after news articles in 2006 showed poor working conditions at , a Chinese manufacturer of Apple products.Apple said in the report that it recently became the first technology company to join the Fair Labor Association, a nonprofit group that aims to improve conditions in factories around the world. Apple said it would allow the association’s auditing team to gauge the performance of Apple’s suppliers against a code of conduct and publish the results.“We welcome Apple’s commitment to greater transparency and independent oversight, and we hope its participation will set a new standard for the electronics industry,” Auret van Heerden, the association’s president, said in a statement.Jeff Ballinger, a global labor activist, said he was skeptical that transparency alone would change the behavior of Apple’s suppliers, unless Apple was willing to pay more. “They can say forced overtime is a big problem, can you give Saturday afternoons off?” he said, adding that the factories’ “response is going to be raise the prices you give us.”“That they don’t want to do,” he said of Apple.'"
"'12-01-14,'0','Was it the international students who pay full freight? The public schools who do more for diversity? fomenting anger at the 1 percent?“Maybe it’s that they are tired of private school kids,” worried the mother of a senior who was deferred from Yale, echoing a common refrain. “The juniors,” she added, “are flipping out.”Spence and Brearley, both girls’ schools on the Upper East Side, declined to comment on early-admissions data, and many parents spoke on the condition of anonymity, fearful that complaining publicly might hurt their children’s chances in the regular admissions round now under way. Other schools, including Scarsdale High, in Westchester County, said they had not seen significant change, but declined to be specific.And some places saw plenty of success this season. At the Trinity School, on the Upper West Side, more than half of the seniors who applied on the early track were accepted (the school would not say where while the admissions process continues). At Saint Ann’s in Brooklyn Heights, 61 of the school’s 80 seniors applied early, and 52 were admitted — including five to Yale, three to and two to .But college counselors, teachers, tutors and parents in these rarefied circles said students had to digest a hefty dose of deferrals and outright rejections this December.“There was a lot of disappointment from kids who had prepped hard and got high scores on their tests,” said Tim Levin, founder and chief executive of Bespoke Education, a tutoring and SAT prep company.Grading early admissions can be a little like analyzing a baseball game after four innings, but it has grown in importance over the last decade, with many and other prestige campuses filling 45 percent or more of their classes in December. Generally, students may apply early to only one college, and more and more are doing so, believing it gives them a leg up.Duke got 2,700 early applications this year, up from 1,482 in 2005. The University of Chicago’s growth was even steeper: 8,698 in 2011, compared with 3,776 in 2008 and 2,774 in 2005. Early applications to Pomona College jumped 33 percent this year over last.Vincent J. Tompkins Jr., head of school at Saint Ann’s and a former deputy provost at , attributed the huge increase to “the sense that applying early enhances one’s chance of getting into a highly selective college,” though some colleges dispute that notion.While many experts say the curve has been getting steeper for several years, 2011’s math was made worse at some colleges, in part because Harvard, Princeton and the returned to the field after several years without early admissions. During those years, some other top East Coast colleges increased their number of early acceptances, presuming that some of those accepted would abandon them if they got in later to one of those three colleges. Now, places like Yale and Georgetown have cut early acceptances 10 percent, expecting more of the “yeses” to ultimately say yes back.“Because of those schools resuming early admissions, we think more of our early applicants are people who are really committed to Georgetown,” said Charles A. Deacon, dean of admissions.Whether or not they gain an advantage, the early-applicant group is shifting; along with minorities, foreigners and public school students, it now also includes more athletes, as college coaches push recruits to enter the early round as well.“Early decision historically tended to be more homogenous than the regular pool — more white, more upper-class and upper-middle-class, less international,” said Jess Lord, dean of admissions and financial aid at Haverford. “That’s changing fast.”Of the 726 students accepted to Princeton last month, 56 percent attend public high schools, up from 50 percent five years earlier, the last time it had early admissions; and 37 percent are minorities, up from 31 percent. Among Harvard’s 772 early admits, almost 20 percent are black or Hispanic, compared with 15 percent of those admitted early in 2005.Amid huge budget cuts to the vaunted system, East Coast colleges like Haverford and Duke are seeing much more interest from the West. At Harvard-Westlake, a top prep school in , 22 students applied early to the University of Chicago this year, compared with 4 in 2007, said Tamar Adegbile, an upper school dean. Eight were accepted.Foreign students have a particular appeal, and not just because many of them have sterling credentials and make for a more diverse student body. Unlike the overwhelming majority of American students, most foreigners pay full price.After years of being relatively flat, the number of undergraduates from other countries studying in the has jumped 25 percent over the last four years, hitting 291,000 last year, according to the Institute of International Education. The number from soared to 57,000 from 10,000.The change has been more pronounced in the early admissions pool, where top colleges report getting two to four times as many international applications as they did a few years ago.“It used to be that no internationals applied early,” said Mr. Deacon, the admissions dean at Georgetown. “More Asian families, particularly in China, have become able to afford education in the United States, and they focus on the elite institutions, or one tier down.”'"
"'12-01-14,'0','The two most commonly used measures are annual income — over $200,000 for an individual or $300,000 for a couple — and net worth, which was $1 million. In late December, the S.E.C. redefined how people should calculate their net worth. Per the requirements of Dodd-Frank, the commission removed the equity in a person’s primary residence from consideration. (But if the value of that house is less than the mortgage, that liability needs to be included.)“It’s an interesting question as to why this qualifies someone as sophisticated,” said Robert E. Buckholz Jr., a partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. “The income and the net worth requirements are a proxy for the ability to fend for yourself.”But also in compliance with Dodd-Frank, the S.E.C. will spend the next three years determining whether to make further changes in the accredited investor requirements. While it is hard to say what the review will produce, it is worthwhile to look at how wealth and financial expertise have been confused.WHAT THE RULE DOES In a 2009 article in The Washington University Law Review, Wallis K. Finger, now an associate at Schulte Roth & Zabel, used humor to lay out the problem of using money as a proxy for sophistication.“Paris Hilton almost certainly can purchase unregulated securities issued by hedge funds or other private investment vehicles,” Ms. Finger wrote. “Although her training and sophistication in the field of high-stakes financial transactions may be limited, the Securities and Exchange Commission would leave her to her own devices if she chose to invest in private offerings.”For comparison, she created a woman named Sheryl who has a master’s degree in business from Harvard and a doctorate in financial systems analysis. “After all of this schooling, Sheryl is long on debt and short on assets,” Ms. Finger wrote. “She has several offers to work at the nation’s most prestigious investment brokerages. But if Sheryl wants to invest in a private offering, the S.E.C. regulations will not allow it.”In other words, using money as a stand-in for financial sophistication is a fairly unsophisticated solution.When news leaked out last year that Goldman Sachs was planning to offer private shares in Facebook to its wealthiest clients, there was outrage from people who were excluded. After much media attention, the firm limited the private offering to overseas clients to be sure it complied with S.E.C. regulations. (Anyone will be able to buy shares in the initial public offering of Facebook.)In reality, most private offerings are far less glamorous and carry significant risks.Barbara Black, a professor and director of the corporate law center at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, said she was more concerned about small offerings, like a local real estate partnership, where an entrepreneur tries to raise money by promising outsize returns to investors in the community.“It may be perfectly fine, but the nature of things is that these are risky,” Ms. Black said. “You see litigation involving people who are wealthy, but you don’t think of them as super-rich — doctors, dentists, lawyers, some accountants. Are these really sophisticated investors?”DOES IT WORK? The accredited investor regulation is by design paternalistic, but its arbitrariness is what bothers people.Originally, the Securities Act of 1933 aimed to provide more information on securities to prevent investors from being manipulated. Those who were exempted from these requirements were believed to possess enough knowledge to make informed choices.Using the example of doctors and lawyers investing in a local real estate deal, Yasho Lahiri, a partner at law firm Baker Botts in New York, said investors would be better protected with more disclosures, not by their degree of wealth.“What these rules do is limit that amount of information,” he said. “If all these real estate documents were out there, you could assess the deals and compare them to others.”He added that really sophisticated investments were not marketed to accredited investors anyway. They go to qualified purchasers who have at least $5 million in assets that can be invested and qualified institutional buyers with over $100 million.If the goal, though, is to protect people from losing all of their money in an illiquid investment, the current standard fails on that count, too. Andrew Abramowitz, a lawyer in Manhattan who has worked with both buyers and sellers of private placements, said a better standard might be to limit how much of their net worth people can invest.“There could also be a prohibition on participation in a new private placement if the investor’s previous investments in illiquid securities constitute a specified share of investor’s liquid assets,” he said.At the very least, the dollar amounts have not been changed since they were put in place in 1982, and people who qualify today would not have qualified then. After all, $1 million from 1982 would be worth $2.34 million today. Indexing for inflation had been proposed for Dodd-Frank but was removed in Congressional negotiations.OTHER OPTIONS There are all sorts of alternatives to the accredited investor standard. The tough part is turning recommendations into regulations, especially since the S.E.C. faces opposition from groups that depend on a big pool of investors for private placements.Walter J. Woerheide, the vice president of academic affairs at the American College, which focuses on training financial service professionals, suggested a simple test to determine a person’s level of financial knowledge, akin to the test for a driver’s license.John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia University School of Law, said the rule should be changed to require a minimum net worth of $5 million and to set a standard for diversification so that no more than 15 to 20 percent of someone’s net worth could be in unregulated investments.He said he was particularly concerned about legislation being considered by the Senate that would eliminate the current requirement that brokers need to have an existing relationship with clients before they can try to sell them private placements.“Upper-middle-class Americans who qualify as accredited investors will soon begin receiving streams of unsolicited offers from brokers they do not know for unregistered offerings,” Mr. Coffee said. “From a consumer protection standpoint, this combination of little sophistication and even less disclosure seems troubling.”And if that happens, investors may have to become more honest in assessing what they know.'"
"'12-01-14,'0','BEIJING — The introduction of the Apple iPhone 4S in Beijing turned ugly Friday morning when Apple failed to open its flagship store and a frustrated crowd reacted by pelting the store’s gleaming glass walls with eggs.Apple said in a statement that it had temporarily suspended sales of all iPhones at its five mainland China stores out of concern for the safety of customers and employees. The phones will still be offered online, through Apple’s official partner, Unicom, and at authorized resellers. The statement did not say when Apple stores would resume selling the iPhone 4S.Demand for iPhones in China far exceeds supply, which has spawned an army of scalpers who hire migrant workers to snap up products that the scalpers then resell at much higher prices.The horde of more than 1,000 people who gathered outside the store Friday in the Sanlitun district of Beijing included organized teams of migrant workers, identifiable by matching armbands or hats. Some of the migrant workers said they were bused in and promised payment of 100 renminbi, or about $16, for purchasing a phone.Wary of unrest, police ordered the store not to open, according to one source familiar with the situation. Furious, some would-be customers threw eggs. Police dispersed the crowd and temporarily cordoned off the store.Those recruited by scalpers were particularly angry. Some said the store’s closing meant that they would get only 10 renminbi, meant as a food allowance, after standing in line all night in freezing temperatures.It was the second time in less than a year that the Sanlitun store had been forced to temporarily close while trying to offer a new product. In May, four people were injured and a glass door was smashed when a crowd waiting to buy the iPad 2 turned disorderly, according to China Daily.At Apple’s other Beijing store and three stores in Shanghai, the iPhone 4S sold out quickly, leaving some disappointed, but with no reports of incidents.'"

"'12-01-15,'0','The bills would also allow private citizens and companies to sue to stop what they believed to be theft of protected content. Those and other provisions set off fierce opposition among Internet companies, technology investors and free speech advocates, who said the bills would stifle online innovation, violate the First Amendment and even compromise national security by undermining the integrity of the Internet’s naming system.Though the Obama administration called for legislation this year that would give prosecutors and owners of intellectual property new abilities to deter overseas piracy, it also embraced the idea of “voluntary measures and best practices” to reduce piracy.Whether Congress can produce a compromise is uncertain, particularly in the House of Representatives, where Republicans have fought bitterly over the antipiracy legislation and party leaders, who control the chamber, are loath to offer further opportunities for intraparty battles.The , the Hollywood lobbying group that has been most visible in its support for the current bills, said in a statement on Saturday that it welcomed the administration’s call for antipiracy legislation. But, the trade group added, “meaningful legislation must include measured and reasonable remedies that include ad brokers, payment processors and search engines.”Hollywood and the industry have broad political support for their efforts, and the Chamber of Commerce and labor organizations have pushed for the legislation. But they often find themselves facing off against the libertarian views of leaders in the technology industry.Opponents of the House bill, the Stop Online Piracy Act, and the Senate bill, the Protect IP Act, have focused most of their attention on the proposed blocking by Internet service providers of Web sites that offer access to pirated material.In December, a group of influential technology figures, including founders of , Google and , published an open letter to lawmakers saying that the legislation would enable Internet regulation and censorship on par with the government regulation in and .That argument struck a chord with the Obama administration, which through the State Department and other channels has been pushing other countries to loosen restrictions on Internet access.In its statement Saturday, the White House said any proposed legislation “must not tamper with the technical of the Internet.” Parts of the bills that provide for filtering or blocking through the Domain Name System — the Internet’s address book — could drive users to unreliable routes through and around the blocked sites, the White House said. That would “pose a real risk to cybersecurity and yet leave contraband goods and services accessible online.”The statement did not threaten a presidential veto, but it made plain what types of piracy enforcement measures the White House would not accept.The statement was attributed to Victoria Espinel, the intellectual property enforcement coordinator at the ; Aneesh Chopra, the administration’s chief technology officer; and Howard Schmidt, a cybersecurity coordinator for the national security staff.'"
"'12-01-15,'0','Beyond his fund-raising role, Mr. Heavener has committed his own resources to the cause. He and his wife have each given the maximum $2,500 to the campaign, and he gave $45,000 to Restore Our Future, a “super PAC” run by former Romney aides to bolster his campaign. The chairman of the private equity fund that owns Full Sail University — C. Kevin Landry of TA Associates — gave $40,000 to Restore Our Future, records show.Mr. Romney has received financial support from other segments of the for-profit college industry as well, and he was quick to praise the industry as an affordable alternative to traditional colleges.With for-profit colleges under siege in Washington over accusations that they defraud students, Mr. Romney’s full-throttled endorsement puts him squarely in the middle of a political debate over them and dovetails with his strong belief in a free-market system that thrives on competition.To industry critics and some education experts, however, Mr. Romney’s stance appears at odds with much of the available evidence on the cost and performance of for-profit institutions.“Except with some rare circumstances, their prices are more expensive than community colleges and even four-year institutions,” said Donald E. Heller, dean of education at Michigan State University, who has studied for-profit colleges. “It’s hard to argue against the idea of competition, but anybody who knows the business will tell you that most of the for-profits are not competing on price.”The Romney campaign declined to comment on the financial support it has received from executives in the for-profit college industry and the candidate’s support for Full Sail University.Situated on a 191-acre campus outside Orlando, with 110 studios and production facilities, Full Sail was founded 30 years ago to train students for careers in film, music, entertainment and sports marketing and related fields, often on the production side of the business. With about 15,000 students, it boasts of a number of alumni who have gone on to win Grammys and other prestigious awards or worked with big-name performers like Madonna and Jay-Z.One focus has been recruiting both active and former military personnel, who are eligible for special federal financing for educational programs. Full Sail has generally been regarded more highly than many other institutions in the for-profit college industry as a whole, which has been the target of withering criticism in the last few years in the wake of federal investigations into fraudulent marketing practices, poor academic records and huge loans assumed by students ill-prepared for the expensive programs.Still, the school has attracted its share of criticism on Internet discussion boards and YouTube postings from its own students and alumni, with some alumni even deriding it as a “scam” because of what they described as high tuition, inadequate career training and difficulties in transferring credits to other schools.Some of Full Sail’s 37 degree programs have suffered from high loan burdens and low graduation rates, data show.The $81,000 video game art program, for instance, graduated just 14 percent of its 272 students on time and only 38 percent at all, while the students carried a median debt load of nearly $59,000 in federal and private loans in 2008, according to data that the federal Education Department now requires for-profit colleges to disclose in response to criticism of their academic records.While a number of other Full Sail programs also showed low graduation rates, some fared much better. For instance, the master’s curriculum in entertainment business, a yearlong program with a $36,245 tuition, graduated 80 percent of its students, nearly 63 percent of them on time. (Many of the school’s degree programs provided no data at all because Full Sail said students had not yet completed them.)David Halperin, who until this month ran Campus Progress, a liberal advocacy group focused on student issues, said he was mystified by Mr. Romney’s praise for Full Sail.“A school offering a program with a 14 percent on-time graduation rate is not a model for higher education in this country,” he said. He questioned whether Mr. Romney was putting the business interests of his political donors at Full Sail ahead of the interests of students.Mr. Heavener, the Full Sail chief executive, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. An assistant said he was traveling and was not available.Mr. Landry, the chairman of TA Associates, the Boston private equity company that owns Full Sail, said in an e-mail that he “had no idea” where Mr. Romney stood on for-profit colleges when he donated the $40,000 to the super PAC supporting his candidacy and that his financial support was based on other factors.”I think Mitt is highly intelligent and can make good judgments,” said Mr. Landry, who has known the candidate through both political and business dealings. He said that his company and Bain Capital, the private equity company that Mr. Romney used to run, did one deal together — the 2002 merger of Ameritrade and Datek — but that Bain Capital has no financial interest in Full Sail.Among other for-profit college executives who are supporting Mr. Romney, Todd S. Nelson, chief executive at the Education Management Corporation, also gave the campaign $2,500. His company is the target of an $11 billion Justice Department lawsuit over accusations of fraudulent marketing and recruiting practices. Education Management is partly owned by Goldman Sachs, whose individual employees represent a bigger source of campaign revenue for Mr. Romney than any other single company.Mr. Romney also just brought on Charlie Black, a prominent Washington lobbyist who has worked for for-profit colleges, as an informal campaign adviser.But the candidate’s closest industry links are clearly with Full Sail University.At an interview last month in Iowa with editors and reporters at The Ames Tribune, Mr. Romney turned the conversation to Full Sail when he was asked about the costs of higher education, and he volunteered that he had visited the school in Florida. He said he came away impressed by the school’s year-round schedule and its numerous campus production studios for training students in film, music, editing, video games and other fields.“They bring a new class in every month, so there’s a graduating class every month and they can place people” in the job market, Mr. Romney said, adding that “they hold down the cost of their education” by recognizing that they are in competition with other for-profit and traditional colleges.He said schools like Full Sail and the University of Phoenix, a much larger and better-known nationwide system, offer students an alternative.When students look at such schools, Mr. Romney said, “you’re going to find students saying: ‘You know what? That’s not a bad deal. I’m not willing to come out of college with a hundred thousand dollars in debt.’ The alternative is to say the government is going to pay for that.”He added: “I just like the fact that there’s competition. I like the fact that institutions of higher learning will compete with one another, whether they’re for-profit or not-for-profit.”The remarks appeared intended to draw a sharp divide between Mr. Romney and President Obama, whose administration has imposed tighter regulations on for-profit colleges and limited the role of private companies in student lending.At Mr. Romney’s town-hall-style appearance in New Hampshire last month, Kallie Durkit, a junior at Bowling Green State University in Ohio, pressed the candidate on his views on college tuition. She said she was troubled by his suggestion that students look to Full Sail University and for-profit colleges in general as an affordable alternative to traditional schools.“When he said that, I was just like, ‘You’re kidding,’ ” Ms. Durkit, 21, who described herself as an independent, said in an interview.After the encounter, she looked up Full Sail’s tuition rate — $40,000 a year for some programs. She said Mr. Romney’s claims about the school’s affordability reinforced her impression that he was out of touch with the realities students face.When told that Full Sail’s chief executive was a Romney fund-raiser, Ms. Durkit laughed, saying she wished she had known that during her exchange with the candidate.“I guess it just goes to show that money impresses people,” she said.'"
"'12-01-15,'0','As a condition of getting and keeping their jobs, millions of employees in the United States have signed agreements to take any disputes with their employers to arbitration rather than court. Typically, the agreements also prohibit the arbitrator from consolidating similar claims.Why employers like the agreements should be obvious: they pre-empt court challenges on workplace disputes and make it harder for employees to join forces to demand better treatment. As for why employees sign, they have no choice: their jobs require it.The good news is that this is not the end of the story.In a recent ruling, the National Labor Relations Board concluded that employees’ federal right to engage in concerted action trumps any arbitration agreement that bars group claims. It was an impressive defense of employee rights. Employers can still require arbitration, but they must also offer ways for employees to bring collective claims, either in arbitration or in court.Business lobbyists, including the Chamber of Commerce, have denounced the ruling. They say it is an invitation to vast class action lawsuits on issues that could be resolved out of court. That is an exaggeration, intended to deny employees the right — and the power — that comes from jointly pressing their concerns.Business groups are likely to appeal the board’s decision to a federal court of appeals. They may try to assert that the board’s decision should not apply in nonunion companies. But since 1935, federal law has given employees the right to join together for better pay and working conditions — with or without a union.Business groups have also argued that the labor board should follow a ruling last year in which the Supreme Court decided, 5 to 4, that federal law prevents consumers who have signed arbitration agreements from banding together in a single arbitration — a devastating blow to consumer rights. The labor board has already correctly asserted that the law governing consumers is not the same one that governs employees, and that labor law clearly gives employees the right to jointly pursue workplace grievances, including through litigation.Starting this month, the labor board has three new members. All five members — three Democrats and two Republicans — have solid backgrounds in labor law, which bodes well for bridging potential partisan divides. But as the arbitration ruling shows, business groups and their Republican allies will keep pushing back hard against employee rights. Going forward, the key will be for members to remain focused on why the labor law exists.'"
"'12-01-15,'0','What has resulted has been some flashes of potential from a deeply depleted roster, but also more than a few youthful mistakes.“We knew from the jump that we inherited one of the more unique situations in the history of college basketball,” Lavin said. “I don’t know if it will ever happen again. What are the odds that there would ever be 10 seniors at one time?”This season, the Red Storm lost early games to Northeastern and to Detroit and had to come back from 12 points behind to beat Texas-Pan American.Since the team began its Big East schedule, the assistant Mike Dunlap has had to balance teaching new players the system, monitoring their fatigue and preparing them mentally for playing in perhaps the most competitive league in the country.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” said the special assistant Gene Keady, who started coaching in N.C.A.A. Division I in 1975. “You’ve got to find a way to be patient and just keep working with them. They are pretty talented.”That raw talent was certainly on display in the team’s first conference game against Providence, which the Red Storm won, 91-67, with a parade of high-flying dunks, sharp shooting and stealthy defense. Forward Moe Harkless scored 32 points to set a record for a freshman playing his first Big East game. Afterward, Providence Coach Ed Cooley called Harkless a “face of the Big East.”But the ineligibility of Sampson, Pelle and Garrett — who has since qualified and joined the team — tempered some of the Red Storm’s preseason hype. It also drew attention to Lavin’s pursuit of some high-risk prospects who, at least initially, did not work out. Sampson and Pelle enrolled in prep schools and withdrew their commitments to St. John’s. Sampson is being recruited by Kansas, Baylor and Providence, among others. Evan Daniels, a national recruiting analyst for Scout.com, said it was doubtful that Sampson would return to play for the Red Storm.“Sometimes, you have to roll the dice,” Tim Welsh, a former Providence coach and current SNY analyst, said in a telephone interview. “When they’re not in your program, it’s a setback. But those things happen.”Lavin did not quite agree.“I don’t see it as rolling the dice,” he said. “We evaluate prospects and recognize that some may not make it. We’re very thorough in evaluating talent and character.”He added: “What’s inherent at this level of college basketball is you’re not going to bat 1.000. We inherited a situation where we have the task of signing 12 basketball players in two years on the job. That’s an anomaly.”Lindsey averaged 11.8 points in 29.6 minutes a game as the team’s starting point guard. His departure Dec. 8 left the team with six scholarship players, and Garrett’s arrival from Bridgton Academy in Maine on Dec. 20 only illustrated how desperately they needed him. He played 15 minutes in his first game shortly after being declared eligible and a week later had still not unpacked all his belongings.“It’s crazy,” Garrett said. “I was just up in Maine and all of a sudden, I’m here and playing already.”St. John’s employs an energetic 1-1-3 zone on defense and prefers to get out in transition. Dunlap’s practices have actually increased in intensity.To battle fatigue, the strength and conditioning coach Patrick Dixon monitors everything from the players’ body weight to their sleep cycles, keeping their lockers stocked with multivitamins, protein shakes and packets of a vitamin drink mix. The team also does yoga at least twice a week.Lavin said he was taking advantage of his “general manager” role, but would wait until he regained the stamina required to coach before returning. It may not be this season.“I think the first thing in terms of moving ahead is Steve Lavin,” the longtime New York recruiting analyst Tom Konchalski said in a telephone interview regarding what the effect could be on recruits.“He has got to demonstrate that he’s healthy, that he will be the coach of St. John’s and that he’s all in, he’s totally committed to it.”For now, St. John’s will have to grow up in a hurry.“There’s been a degree of tumultuous unknown to this group,” Dunlap said. “The players have handled it as business as usual.”'"
"'12-01-15,'0','Chinese security forces on Saturday fired into a crowd of Tibetans in a restive area of Sichuan Province after they tried to take away the body of a Tibetan man who had died after setting himself on fire that morning to protest Chinese policies in the Tibetan areas, according to reports from two advocacy groups and Tibetan officials in the exile government in .It appeared that at least two people had been hit by gunfire, and one of those might have been killed, said Kate Saunders, a spokeswoman for International Campaign for Tibet, which is based in . Ms. Saunders said the group had spoken to at least two sources.Another group, Free Tibet, said it had confirmed reports that a Tibetan woman was shot. There were unconfirmed reports that many others were also hit, said Stephanie Brigden, the director of the group, which is based in . Security officials in the area could not be reached for comment on Saturday night.The violence took place in the town of Aba, known in Tibetan as Ngaba, a focal point for protests against Chinese rule and the scene of civilian deaths during a widespread Tibetan uprising in 2008. Since then, it has been the site of at least 11 self-immolations, some of them fatal. Those setting themselves on fire have mainly been monks, nuns or former members of the clergy. The monks in Aba who set themselves on fire all come from the Kirti Monastery, where anger has grown over Chinese repression of religious practices.The self-immolation on Saturday was the 16th since March 2011, when Phuntsog, a monk at Kirti, set himself on fire and died. The wave of self-immolations in the past year was preceded by that of one monk from Kirti in the spring of 2009. In total, at least 12 Tibetans have died through self-immolation since 2009, if the death on Saturday is confirmed. Scholars of modern Tibet say the self-immolations represent a new and disturbing protest strategy among the clergy.Four of the self-immolations have taken place recently. There was no information on Saturday about the identity of the person who committed the latest act. Ms. Saunders said several witnesses reported that the police began beating the man after putting out his flames. “Tibetans at the scene became very distressed and angry and gathered together in what seems to be an impromptu demonstration,” she said in an e-mail.The Tibetan government-in-exile in India issued a statement on Saturday saying that 700 people had surrounded the police station after the police took away the body of the person who had set himself on fire. ""A confrontation ensued and an elderly Tibetan woman was reportedly shot dead by the police,” the statement said.'"
"'12-01-15,'0','An upbeat look at middle age? Patricia Cohen had her work cut out for her. Maybe there’s a capitalist culture somewhere that doesn’t make a blazing fetish of youthfulness and keep it stoked with huge amounts of commercial and medical hot air. If so, it’s not the one we live in. Yet nothing in the sometimes pathetic struggle of Americans over, say, 50 to claim a respectable place in the public consciousness puts Cohen in the grumpy mood she could so rightly claim after absorbing some 200 years of the history of middle age. Instead, she’s delivered a lively, well-researched chronicle of the social and scientific forces that brought midlife America to its current befuddled state — better off by most measures than any previous generation, but miserably out of fashion.Despite the fact that researchers have been studying middle age intensively for decades, the term itself seems to have no fixed definition. Nearly any span between 40 and dementia appears to qualify, depending in part on whether we’re talking about ourselves (“But I feel just the same as I did when I was 20”) or all those people who show up at our college reunions (“Everyone looks so old”). But surely the elasticity of the concept is its best feature. After all, not much follows middle age except joining the ranks of the ancients — or, as geriatric specialists now say, “the old old.” (Perhaps they don’t intend to evoke the drumbeats of doom with that repetition, but otherwise what does it mean? A life stage so nice they named it twice?)Not only is middle age hard to pin down, but Cohen, a reporter for The New York Times, points out that it didn’t even exist as a category until about halfway through the 19th century. Before then, she writes, “age was not an essential ingredient of one’s identity.” Life had markers like marriage, parenthood and physical incapacity; one’s years per se were not the measure. This changed with industrialization and the growth of cities, when age became a useful means of segmenting the population. Children who earlier studied all together in a one-room schoolhouse, for instance, were divided into grades by age. Birthday greetings became popular. By 1900, when the census began asking Americans their exact date of birth — instead of packing people into 10-year compartments — we were a nation thoroughly aware of how old we were.By that time, too, people were living longer. But Cohen argues that the increase in years wasn’t significant enough to account for the emergence of middle age as a life category. More pertinent was what was happening to women. By the turn of the 20th century, Cohen writes, “the typical mother had two or three children, less than half as many as her counterpart 100 years earlier.” After the youngest left home, she had 20 or so years, starting around age 50, in which she was free of the primary obligations that had defined female existence for thousands of years.But if there was something to celebrate in life after youth, scientists in the early 1900s quickly squashed it by deciding that aging was a cause for worry, probably even a disease. People proved astonishingly vulnerable to the idea that nature despises vigorous humans in their 50s. Trepidation about mortality, plus a large dose of vanity, turned out to be a powerful motivation for nutty behavior — especially in the male. Around the time women were cautiously deciding to bob their hair, their husbands entered the startling era of testicle transplants for rejuvenation.It began in 1918 when, Cohen reports, “a doctor at San Quentin prison . . . transplanted the testicles of an executed man into a senile 60-year-old inmate.” The result could not have been anybody’s idea of a dream date, but never mind: soon afterward a Russian surgeon showed up in the United States, claiming that he had successfully “transplanted monkey testicles into men who had lost their sexual drive.” He drew enormous crowds to his vividly illustrated lectures, where he also showed off some of his happy patients. A French doctor specializing in the same operation said hundreds of men applied to him every day, longing for monkey testicles. As he explained to The New York Times, most of his clients were eager “to complete some life work they had undertaken or see some particular enterprise through, which had not yet been crowned with success.” Ah yes, a chance at last to complete that elusive symphony. Eugen Steinach, a Viennese endocrinologist, offered vasectomies to worried or flagging men: the idea was to concentrate the hormones and thus reinvigorate the patient. (Among the gullible were Yeats and Freud.) Steinach had help for women, too — he X-rayed their ovaries, a treatment that was supposed to restore youthfulness.'"
"'12-01-15,'0','As a -based executive, you created a page that helped foment the Egyptian uprising. Your memoir, “Revolution 2.0,” recounts how you spent 11 days imprisoned during some of the most dramatic Tahrir Square protests. Major letdown, I imagine. It’s not a matter of enjoying the process as much as looking forward to the result, which is actually why most of the people went down to the streets. When I was released on Feb. 7, I saw Egyptians had managed to stand up together. I felt like I had been jailed for 11 years, but I did not feel I really missed the whole thing.As there was no clear alternative to Mubarak, was it unwise to encourage revolution? I’m fully aware of a lot of opinions that this was a very big downside of the revolution — that it had no leadership to take over after Mubarak stepped down. Only history will judge. Regardless, a lot of Egyptians are now empowered.Americans applaud democracy, but we’re also wary to see how parties like the benefit from the void. For over 30 years, the regime was oppressing us by basically telling the international community that if there is real democracy, the Muslim Brotherhood will come to power. I don’t oppose anyone who’s democratically elected. What matters is the economy: improving the life of over 40 percent of Egyptians who are living below $2 a day.Economic issues were a big driver of the revolution. Considering that ’s crucial tourism business has nosedived, are things really better now? When Mubarak stepped down, there were high expectations that came from a very simple view: He and his people were the problem and, once you remove them, the problem is solved. Which is definitely not the way things have developed. The euphoria is over. The country was governed in such a way that 0.1 percent was making decisions for the rest of the people. So there is a lack of understanding about the size of the economic problems we’re facing.Much of your rhetoric about self-determination echoes what George Bush said about . The Iraq war was deeply unpopular in Egypt, but do you feel differently now that Iraq is free?  Not at all. The war in Iraq killed so many innocent people, and it’s not something that any civilized nation should be proud of. People who live in a country are the ones to decide their destiny because they are the ones who eventually pay the price for whatever choices they make.What about ? President Assad’s forces have killed more than 4,000 people for trying to do what you did in Egypt. I support the Syrian revolution. But the international community, not just the U.S., should have a role. And it must avoid any aggressive action that would put more people at risk.'"
"'12-01-15,'0','A glamorous train station hotel with a split-personality, where rooms start at £180, or $275 at $1.53 to the pound.The St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel brings some majesty and style to the fustiest category of accommodations, the train station hotel. The original Midland Grand Hotel opened in 1873 and was shuttered in 1935; today, the vast Gothic facade of rebuilt spires and cleaned-up brickwork towers over the London terminus for the Eurostar high-speed trains. The hotel is really two hotels that share a lobby. In front you’ll find the Chambers, an imposing edifice with arched windows and cast-iron columns; it feels like a castle, with a sweeping staircase that leads up to 38 rooms with high ceilings and sumptuous architectural details. In the back there is Barlow House, a modern wing with 207 characterless rooms. The prices tell the story. Rooms in the Chambers run from £325 to £10,000, while in Barlow House they are £199 to £285, plus tax. The division is as stark as that of a plane: First Class up front, Economy Plus behind.Understandably, the photogenic hallways and rooms in the Chambers get all the attention. (It’s a favorite for fashion shoots.) But it’s jarring to be led from the buzzing lobby with a Victorian-era glass roof into a wing that has the studiously bland feel of a high-end corporate hotel. After all, it is a Marriott property.LOCATIONThe hotel and train station are on the northern edge of Central London — the British Library is across the street, and Bloomsbury is within walking distance — but it’s a somewhat remote location in this sprawling city. If you plan to see the sights, shop or eat, you’ll need to take public transport or hop in a cab.My £235 room (plus a £45 tax) was in the monotonous new wing (beige walls, whisper-quiet air circulation) that runs along the side of the train station. In fact, my room looked directly onto the steeply sloped roof of the train shed, so that the only thing visible was a wall of gray tiles so repetitive and mesmerizing it felt like an art installation. (Later, I was told that for another £50 I could have a view of the British Library — and a heavily trafficked street.) The room itself was comfortable if boxy, with a king-size bed facing a big flat-screen TV.'"

Soft bags without wheels give you nearly twice as much packing space, and when packed right, they often fit under an airline seat (avoiding the nightmare rush for overhead space).To the Editor: Emulating my travel hero, I reduced my suits to one. When crossing in front of the airport, a taxicab snagged one of my pant legs, tearing it. With Band-Aids from a flight attendant, I taped an “L” inside my suit over the tear and lived with it for three weeks. No one noticed. I traveled more than 20 years after that with two identical suits and a small roll of adhesive tape, permitting me to exchange parts in case of a “wardrobe malfunction.” Steve Adams'"

"'12-01-16,'0','In a similar vein, Joseph P. Forgas, a psychologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia, found that sad subjects were better judges of deception than happy ones. After subjects were shown a video intended to induce a happy or a sad mood, Dr. Forgas had them view deceptive or truthful interviews with people who denied committing a theft. Subjects in a sad mood were more skeptical and more accurate in detecting deceptive communication, while subjects in a positive mood were far more trusting and gullible.Findings like these may suggest some benefits to sadness, but lately they have been generalized to patients with full-blown depression. For example, Dr. Andrews and Dr. J. Anderson Thomson Jr., a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia, have proposed that the rumination of depressives is an adaptive strategy to solve a painful problem. Clinicians, on the other hand, continue to maintain that the grim outlook of depressives is evidence that their thought process is distorted and erroneous. It must be fixed, not embraced.There is strong evidence from neuropsychological and brain imaging studies that clinical depression is linked with various types of memory impairments in all age groups and at all levels of depressive severity. Challenging and changing the dysfunctional thoughts of depression are the exact aims of cognitive-behavioral therapy, one of the most empirically validated and popular forms of psychotherapy.So who’s right about depression, the evolutionary biologists or the clinicians?To start, the subjects in the above studies were normal controls whose moods were manipulated to be transiently sad. They do not really resemble people with clinical depression, whose condition can last months or even years.Indeed, as Dr. Forgas said by e-mail, “I never worked with depressives, and I do not think that the experiments we have done looking at mood effects on cognitive processes in normal populations experiencing minor, everyday mood differences can be readily generalized to depressive cognition.”Under close scrutiny, the case for depression’s adaptive benefits has problems — big ones. For one thing, the ruminative thinking of depression is often not particularly effective in solving problems. As another patient of mine once said: “I would think the same things over and over and could never decide what to do. It’s not a creative way of thinking.”More critically, depression can arise without any psychosocial stressor at all, which makes it hard to argue that depression is a response to a difficult situation or problem. Dr. David J. Kupfer, a psychiatrist at the University of Pittsburgh, has found that a major life stressor almost always precedes a first episode of depression, but that episodes recur with milder stressors, or even none at all.If depression conferred a problem-solving benefit, it should not become a chronic or autonomous condition — which it is for about half the patients.According to the World Health Organization, depression is the leading cause of disability and the fourth leading contributor to the global burden of disease, projected to reach second place by 2020. There is also strong evidence that it is an independent risk factor for heart disease, and several studies show that prolonged depression is associated with selective and possibly permanent damage to the hippocampus, a region of the brain critical to memory and learning.Add the fact that 2 percent to 12 percent of depressed people eventually commit suicide, and the “advantages” of depression suddenly don’t look so good.Why, then, does the notion persist that depression confers special insights and benefits?I got a clue recently from one depressed patient. He was an educated and articulate young man, unhappy because the world was such an awful place, he said. Because he had so many other symptoms of depression — insomnia, fatigue, low libido and poor self-esteem — I told him that he was clinically depressed and that his Hobbesian worldview was probably a result of depression, not its cause.He scoffed, but he was willing to try a course of cognitive-behavioral therapy and antidepressant medication, if only to feel better. Months later, when he had recovered, I asked him again about his worldview.The world was just as dire, he said, but he felt better. Still, he speculated wistfully that his newfound cheerfulness was not his authentic self, which he described as brooding and creative.This cuts to the heart of why depression is increasingly romanticized. What is natural, the thinking goes, is best. If we are designed to suffer depression in response to life’s ills, there must be a good reason for it, and we should allow it to take its painful and natural course.But unlike ordinary sadness, the natural course of depression can be devastating and lethal. And while sadness is useful, clinical depression signals a failure to adapt to stress or loss, because it impairs a person’s ability to solve the very dilemmas that triggered it.Even if depression is “natural” and evolved from an emotional state that might once have given us some advantage, that doesn’t make it any more desirable than other maladies. Nature offers us cancer, infections and heart disease, which we happily avoid and do our best to treat. Depression is no different.'"

"'12-01-16,'0','Ricky Gervais was asked back to host the Golden Globes on Sunday not on the condition that he mind his tongue, but that he stick it out even further.And he proved very cooperative, unleashing a spray of insults with more than the usual amount of innuendo about the sexuality of stars like Jodie Foster, Eddie Murphy and Justin Bieber. He introduced Melissa McCarthy, a star of “Bridesmaids,” as making her mark in that comedy by “defecating into a sink.” He paused a beat then added, “Amazingly, that’s still less demeaning than what most of you have done to make it in show business.”His audience didn’t seem that amused, but they didn’t look scandalized either.The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which sponsors the event, clearly didn’t enjoy being the butt of so many of Mr. Gervais’s venom-tipped jokes last year, but the members’ anger at him melted under the prospect of bigger ratings. (NBC tried to stoke expectations with promos of Mr. Gervais, giggling mischievously.) And while Mr. Gervais delivered by not holding back, it wasn’t an unpredictable or even a very seditious performance — a lot of the time his jokes felt forced and heavy-handed. Mostly, Mr. Gervais’s return as a naughty, nasty master of ceremonies — this was his third time — was a reminder that in show business, it’s all business.Under all the froth, fuss and Champagne fizz, the Golden Globes are a sideshow that has swelled by straining and striving for industry relevance. Mr. Gervais put it less delicately. The Golden Globes are to the Oscars, he said, what Kim Kardashian is to Kate Middleton, “a bit louder, a bit trashier, a bit drunker and more easily bought.”The Golden Globes are also a little like the Iowa caucuses: neither contest is a reliable harbinger, both are decided in a mystifying process by an unrepresentative group of voters, and yet merely by being first and so closely watched, both matter. So much so that eventual winners, like presidential candidates, almost always show up.'"
"'12-01-16,'0','The issue of police officers’ treatment of livery passengers emerged after Mr. Battle, 38, and Mr. Pujara, 37, came forward to relay details of separate encounters with officers that left each man shaken. In pursuing the case, the civil liberties group has been unable so far to determine, using police data, how typical those two encounters were.The problem is that while officers generally fill out a stop-and-frisk form after each encounter with a taxi passenger, there is nothing on those internal questionnaires that identifies the stop as having been conducted under the TRIP program. Under the Bloomberg administration, the number of question-and-frisk encounters mushroomed to 601,055 in 2010 from 97,296 in 2002. In the 3.9 million street stops carried out since 2004, over 80 percent of those stopped have been black or Latino.In his ruling, Judge Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court on Friday rejected the city’s argument that the stops of Mr. Battle and Mr. Pujara were isolated incidents. Rather, he said, their complaint alleges a routine practice, one they would probably face again in the future.“The pleadings suggest a widespread custom or failure to train,” wrote Judge Berman, who added that he was not yet ruling on the truth of the plaintiffs’ allegations.Celeste Koeleveld, a senior attorney for the city’s Law Department, said on Saturday that the city and the Police Department disagreed with the judge’s ruling.“The Police Department is as interested as anyone else in making the program run correctly,” Ms. Koeleveld said. “And the written policy in place complies with the law, and I think the only question raised by the lawsuit is one of practice.”To Eugene J. O’Donnell, a professor of police studies at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, the case underscores how officers sometimes struggle to articulate nuances in the laws they must apply.Law enforcement, Professor O’Donnell said, “demands that you know the law, instruct subordinates what the law is and engage in an ongoing commitment to tailor your practices to comply with statutory and case law, which constantly evolves. This has seemed to concern the department less than it should.”At its heart, the TRIP program is meant to help protect livery cab drivers, who have become targets for robberies and murder. By displaying a simple window decal bearing the words, “This vehicle may be stopped and visually inspected by the police at any time to ensure driver’s safety,” a driver consents to being pulled over by any officers seeking to check on his well-being. The plaintiffs in the suit seek to address the narrower issue of passenger treatment after the stop, not the legality of the stop itself.In their encounters, Mr. Battle and Mr. Pujara said that officers had gone too far in removing them from taxis and searching them without any reason to believe either had committed a crime.In Mr. Battle’s case, he asked officers why they were patting him down after stopping the cab he was in at 3:30 a.m. on Oct. 30, 2010, and “one officer said that it was routine,” according to the complaint.The complaint added, “He pointed to a TRIP decal on the car, which Mr. Battle had not previously noticed, and told Mr. Battle they were allowed to search him under TRIP.”Mr. Battle was returning from his work as a radio executive, to his home in Bedford-Stuyvesant, and was just outside his front door. When he became upset, the officers reiterated that his mere entry into a cab with a decal opened him to their search. And they said that “their actions were part of a routine stop under TRIP,” the complaint says.It was much the same for Mr. Pujara, a lawyer who works for a social services agency, after officers in the Bronx stopped the livery cab he was riding in just before midnight on Sept. 3, 2010. He asked the officers if they had any reason to pull him from the cab. They said they did not, according to the federal complaint.An officer, after referring to the decal on the cab, told Mr. Pujara his treatment was “part of the program,” according to the complaint. Mr. Pujara questioned the legality of the stop because he had heard about the program from a client he once represented.Neither Mr. Battle nor Mr. Pujara was charged with any offense after their encounters, and they were simply freed to go. Each filed a complaint against the officers with the city’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, which substantiated their allegations and labeled the stops an abuse of authority, sending the matter back to the department for possible discipline.The men are also seeking unspecified damages. The case is now proceeding to trial.'"
"'12-01-16,'0','Suddenly, he turned toward me and asked how I was. “Fair to middling,” I responded. “And you?” I queried.“I’m very sad that Christopher Hitchens died,” he said. “A great loss.”I nodded in agreement as he continued.“There was no one like him,” he said. He uttered a deep sigh and turned back toward the elevator door momentarily before he continued, “Well, maybe Bertrand Russell.”With that, the elevator door opened onto the first floor and we went our separate ways. As I exited and turned toward Broadway, I thought, “Only in New York.”On a very cold winter day, my wife and I decided to visit the planetarium at the Museum of Natural History. As we were getting ready to leave, we bundled up in our sweaters and coats for the frigid weather outside.On the way toward the exit I noticed a scale that would give you your weight on the moon, which has far less gravity. That made me curious, and I stepped on the scale. Then my wife, Susan, wanted to step on as well.She first handed her purse to me, then took off her coat, then proceeded to remove her sweater, at which point I asked her, “What are you doing? It’s your weight on the moon.”Her reply: “Why should I weigh more on the moon than I need to?”My sister and I were tending plants at her Manhattan community garden when a woman approached and asked whether the ashes of her recently deceased father might be spread in the garden.Before my sister had a chance to reply, the woman, clearly exasperated, handed over a rumpled paper bag, saying: “Here, please take this. His name was Abe, and I’ve had more than enough of him.”With that, she was gone.And so, with solemn respect for a man we’d never met, my sister and I carefully sprinkled Abe’s remains throughout the garden, tiny handfuls at a time, until the bag was empty.Vroom: My dad and I dash to Gravesend, Brooklyn, to grab a Spumoni Gardens pizza. Dad, double-parked, says, “Stay here; I’ll get food.”Zoom: Cop car pulls up. Panic ensues; don’t want a ticket. I peer out the window, feeling like a criminal. A police officer bolts out of the car, hand on gun, and runs into the pizzeria, fast as the Cyclone.Boom: Cop rushes out, glances both ways, and rushes back to the patrol car with 10 pizzas.Silence: I thought I was the one who was supposed to be on the run.'"
"'12-01-16,'0','Markham C. Erickson, executive director of NetCoalition, whose members include Google and Yahoo, said Sunday that it was too soon to dismiss entirely the House or Senate versions of the antipiracy bills. “I think the White House statement is very strong and it helps, but, no, I don’t think it’s dead,” Mr. Erickson said by telephone from Washington. “We will continue to have to educate as many members as possible.”He said it was still an open question whether his group would seek to kill the bills or push for major changes.Several Internet companies, including AOL, Facebook, Google and Yahoo, endorse an alternative that seeks to punish foreign Web sites that engage in copyright infringement through international trade law. That bill is co-sponsored by Representative Darrell Issa, Republican of California. Last week, Mr. Issa said that his party’s leader, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, had assured him that the Stop Online Piracy Act would not come up for a vote until there was consensus. For technology companies, that holds out the promise of returning to the drawing board. For Hollywood and other media companies challenged by piracy, it defers the prospects of antipiracy legislation.“We have a chance to reset the legislative table to find out what kind of legislation is needed,” Mr. Erickson said. “We have an opportunity to step back, recalibrate and understand what the problem is.”Several prominent Web sites and start-ups that have been among the most vocal opposition to the bills say they will not let up on their online advocacy soon.The comments by the administration’s chief technology officials was a sign that government officials were beginning to pay attention to the cries of concern from the technology industry about the bills’ ability to enable censorship and tamper with the livelihood of businesses on the Internet.“It’s encouraging that we got this far against the odds, but it’s far from over,” said Erik Martin, the general manager of Reddit.com, a social news site that has generated some of the loudest criticism of the bills. “We’re all still pretty scared that this might pass in one form or another. It’s not a battle between Hollywood and tech, its people who get the Internet and those who don’t.”Mr. Marin said that Reddit is planning a sitewide blackout on Wednesday to protest the bills — an effort joined by a number of other sites, including MoveOn, BoingBoing, a popular technology and culture blog, and the Cheezburger Network, a collection of several dozen Internet humor sites, including I Can Haz Cheezburger? and FailBlog.In New York, the New York Tech Meetup, an eight-year-old organization of nearly 20,000 people who work in the technology industry throughout the city, is planning a protest Wednesday afternoon outside the Manhattan offices of Senators Charles E. Schumer and Kirsten E. Gillibrand of New York, who co-sponsored some of the proposed legislation.The rallying of the Internet and heavyweights in the technology world was significant because it is one of the few times that the industry has united around a focal point, said Jonathan Zittrain, a professor at Harvard Law School who studies how the Internet affects society.Although certain hot button issues, like tax credits, patent policies and net neutrality, have driven industry leaders to Washington in the past, the Stop Online Piracy Act “awakened the entire tech world,” he said. “They are realizing just how big this fight was becoming.”Michael O’Leary, executive vice president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said by telephone from Washington that his group was disappointed by parts of the White House statement but hoped the Obama administration would follow through on its stated commitment to stop copyright infringement.“They believe piracy is a problem, that legislation is needed.” Mr. O’Leary said. “We take them at their word.”He said the association opposes the alternative bill sponsored by Mr. Issa and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, because it would be cumbersome. The group will continue to lobby for the existing House and Senate bills, he said. “I don’t think we need to go back to the drawing board,” he said. “What we have here is a good framework.”Several people involved in the technology industry, including Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist in New York whose firm, Union Square Ventures, has invested in a number of popular Web properties like Tumblr, Twitter and Etsy, expressed hope for a mutually beneficial outcome.“What I’d love to see happen, is that the people from the entertainment industry, those who have a lot invested in the SOPA and PIPA legislation, get together with a group of people from the technology industry who have been actively fighting against this thing and talk about the right way to solve the problem,” he said. “I’m certainly not declaring victory yet.”Pablo Chavez, a director of public policy at Google, said in a statement, “Like others, we believe Congress wants to get this right, and we know there are targeted and smart ways to shut down foreign rogue Web sites without asking U.S. companies to censor the Internet.”Mr. Martin of Reddit echoed those sentiments, saying that he would be willing to work with government officials to draft legislation that would help prevent copyright infringement without threatening the livelihood of Reddit and similar sites.“The Internet is disruptive and chaotic and it does allow things that are bad like unauthorized piracy, but the answer is not to have the federal government enforce potentially bad bureaucracy and legislation,” Mr. Martin said. “That’s not the way to actually solve anything.”'"
"'12-01-16,'0','Nigeria produces immense oil wealth, but analysts say that for decades, billions of dollars from the country’s oil earnings have been stolen by a corrupt elite while three-quarters of the country’s citizens live on about a dollar a day. Government-subsidized gasoline has been almost the only benefit from oil production to reach the wider population.Citing a desire to put public finances on a sounder footing, the government revoked the fuel subsidy on Jan. 1, a step that filled the streets of Nigerian cities with tens of thousands of protesters all last week. The police used live ammunition to disperse protests in Kano and other places; at least three people were killed, and Amnesty International denounced what it said was excessive use of force by the authorities.Some local commentators saw the protests as the beginning of a “Nigerian Spring.” But they were another headache for a country that is already faced with an insurrection by armed Islamic militants in the north, sectarian tensions in the middle and perpetual restiveness in the oil-producing south. At Iddo, Mrs. Nisi was dressed up for shopping — a shiny white blouse, embroidered black cap — after a week of closed stores and markets. But the experience was not making her sympathetic to the government’s plan. And the seed vendor was not budging from his new price. “We are just suffering here, and the people at the top are enjoying their life,” Mrs. Nisi said. “They are just making people too crazy.”Even the country’s oil workers are now threatening to strike, which could affect world energy markets if the country’s exports are crimped. One analyst said a strike lasting several weeks could push up oil prices by $10 to $20 a barrel.At the root of the trouble is a paradox that some see as emblematic of the country’s 50 years of independence: Nigeria is one of the world’s leading crude oil exporters, but it must import nearly all of its gasoline from foreign refineries because years of neglect, mismanagement and corruption have left the country’s own refineries unable to function. The government subsidies, which approached $8 billion, made up the difference between the world market price and the lower price that Nigerians had been paying at the pump, while the middlemen who imported the gasoline made huge profits.In a 2009 report, the International Monetary Fund called the removal of the fuel subsidy “an important first step.” But in a place where experts estimate that $50 billion to $100 billion in oil revenue has been lost through fraud and that 80 percent of the economic benefit from oil production has flowed to 1 percent of the population, the monetary fund’s approval of a step that hits ordinary people so hard looks provocative.At Iddo, Mabel Ekewke eyed five small baskets of onions. Before, they would have cost about 1,000 nairas (about $6.25), she said; now the vendor was asking 2,500 nairas ($15.50).“People don’t have money, and people are very hungry,” Ms. Ekewke said. “The salaries they are paying are just too small. I personally am ready to continue the strike.” That vow was echoed by Nigerian labor leaders, who held talks with the government on Sunday in Abuja, the capital. No agreement had been reached by the evening.“They’ve come into power and said they would improve infrastructure, and at the end of the day, nobody sees anything,” said Peter Esele, president general of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria. “People have just lost trust in the Nigerian government. It’s an issue of confidence. We’re not ready to give our trust. It must be earned.”Even so, for the country’s president, Goodluck Jonathan, any retreat now on the subsidy could be interpreted as a sign of weakness, which would be harmful for a leader dealing with internal unrest on many fronts. The government’s spokesman sought over the weekend to cast Mr. Jonathan’s position in the opposite light. “It’s a sign of strength for a leader to see what’s in the best interest of Nigerians,” said the spokesman, Reuben Abati. “He’s made it clear that it’s absolutely in the best interest of Nigerians to deregulate the downstream sector,” meaning the retail sale of gasoline.That logic was lost on shoppers at Iddo, though. “If he doesn’t go back, we’ll go on strike again,” Vivian Kezie said as she eyed the onions. She said she was not persuaded by government claims that the $8 billion it is saving by scrapping the subsidy would go to shoring up the country’s rickety infrastructure. “I don’t trust them,” Ms. Kezie said. “They will use it on their families. All their children are in school abroad.”The strike last week shut down much of the country’s economy; to avoid a repeat, one side will have to budge, and it seems unlikely that it will be the people in the street. “When the equation is still Hobbesian, people are not going to participate,” said Ricardo Soares de Oliveira, a lecturer at Oxford University and an expert on Nigerian oil politics, referring to the grimness of daily life in Nigeria. “People perceive this as a raid on their resources.”'"
"'12-01-16,'0','He pointed to the drama “Prime Suspect,” a conspicuous flop for NBC last fall. “At Showtime, ‘Prime Suspect’ would have been picked up in the third episode and declared a hit,” Mr. Greenblatt said.Mr. Reilly said much the same thing about the disastrous debut of the Fox drama “Lone Star” last year. “If I was still at cable, I would have gotten genius points” for that show, he said.Both “Prime Suspect” and “Lone Star” drew audiences of about three million, tiny by network standards, but substantial for cable, making it possible to declare a network failure a hit for cable.The programmers’ commitment to reshaping network strategy is most apparent in their move toward introducing series in more aggressive ways. For example, ABC’s plan for its new horror drama, “The River,” calls for its pilot episode to be shown on numerous Internet outlets, including YouTube and Hulu, as well as in movie theaters in several cities and on college campuses.“We feel strongly that presampling is a great thing to do,” Mr. Lee said. He and other network executives cited the example this season of the Fox comedy “New Girl.” That show was aggressively sampled on Web sites and proved to be such a success on iTunes — where it totaled about two million downloads — that some Fox marketing executives feared those might have undercut the ratings for its premiere on the network.Instead, the show was a breakout ratings hit.“What we have found again and again,” Mr. Lee said of ABC’s experiments in sampling, “was that the amount of buzz you create from somebody who loves the show and will talk about it on Facebook is going to give you far more audience than it takes away.”That is certainly what NBC is hoping for with its most promoted show of the year, the musical drama, “Smash.” Mr. Greenblatt tried to ease some of the pressure on “Smash” by saying, “You need four or five shows to start to turn things around. ‘Smash’ could be one of those. I hope it is one of those. If it isn’t, you know, it’s not like we’re going to go into receivership.”But he conceded that NBC, in clear need of a game-changing show, plans a “full court press” of promotion, including a heavy presence during the network’s coverage of the Super Bowl — one day before the “Smash” premiere on Feb 6.The all-out effort began with screenings of the pilot episode in 10 cities on Jan. 9. NBC also will make the pilot available on other downloading and streaming platforms starting Monday, including XFinity, iTunes, Amazon, Xbox, PlayStation, Voodoo and Samsung Media Hub. Then, a week before the premiere, NBC will start making it available for streaming on NBC.com and Hulu.“We’re doing everything we can think of to generate buzz for this show,” Mr. Greenblatt said.“Smash” also will benefit from being able to run straight through on Monday nights for 15 episodes — with no disruptive breaks filled with repeats. Several other midseason shows will do the same thing, like the sci-fi family drama “Touch” on Fox, with 13 episodes. “The River” will try to grab viewers with an eight-episode miniseason.Mr. Reilly said this scheduling — which is essentially how cable networks schedule their programs — had a chance to gain traction at the networks.“I’d like to try it,” Mr. Reilly said. “I do think we’re at a place where the 13-episode pattern is appealing. There are a lot of shows that would be better off creatively doing fewer than 22 episodes and the viewers would probably enjoy them more. When you sit down to 13 from the get-go, the end is in sight, so it feels doable.”One network, CBS, does not have a program chief who graduated from cable and has no plans for short-run, cable-style series or free giveaways of pilots. Why? CBS is sailing along, knee-deep in hits, holding to the same network course it has always followed.“The philosophy we live by is: if it ain’t broke don’t fix it,” said Nina Tassler, the president for entertainment at CBS. “We’re doing something right, and not just good enough to get by. We’re doing really well.”'"

"'12-01-17,'1','This year’s bonus season, which began in late December and will continue until February at some companies, is expected to be the worst for industry employees since 2008, as regulatory measures and economic uncertainty have cut deeply into profits and made pay pools smaller.In his annual compensation survey, a closely watched report that was sent to roughly 800 of the company’s clients in November, Mr. Johnson estimated that bonuses in the industry would fall 20 to 30 percent from last year’s levels.That would still leave employees at firms like , where the average worker took home $430,700 in total compensation in 2010, much better off than workers in other industries. But it would represent further slippage from the sector’s highs before the crisis.Bonus math in a financial downturn is a delicate art. Because the payments typically make up at least half of an employee’s yearly pay, erring on the low side can mean losing a star performer to a rival firm.“Someone on Wall Street might go apoplectic when he heard he got $3 million and another guy got $3.5 million,” Mr. Johnson said.Decades ago, banks determined bonuses according to a relatively simple formula that took into account an employee’s seniority and performance. After the financial crisis, as politicians and regulators began criticizing what they saw as eye-popping pay packages, those all-cash bonuses went out of fashion.Now, Wall Street pay packages routinely include deferred cash payments and restricted stock awards that can be redeemed only after multiyear waiting periods.The increased complexity of Wall Street compensation has been a boon for consulting businesses, which can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for advice. Goldman Sachs has used the consultancy Semler Brossy; ’s directors have relied on the Hay Group; and ’s board has used the services of Frederic W. Cook & Company, according to public filings by those banks. All three consulting companies, and all three banks, declined to comment.Some consultants are hired by banks merely to provide data on industry compensation trends, or to rubber-stamp the decisions of the banks’ internal compensation teams, while others are more directly involved in setting pay levels.“Directors don’t want to be embarrassed in the media by a compensation decision,” said Yale D. Tauber, a compensation consultant who works with the board of , among other clients. “They’re the guardians of investors’ capital.”Being a Wall Street pay specialist often means being on call for emergencies. Michael Karp, the managing partner of the Options Group, was awakened by a 4 a.m. telephone call while vacationing in . The caller, a bank executive based in , told Mr. Karp that December profits had come in below expectations. The company already planned to reduce its year-end bonuses 35 percent, and with the new numbers, it looked as if even deeper cuts would be necessary.“He wanted me to gauge what other competitors were doing,” said Mr. Karp, who immediately began using his BlackBerry to e-mail his contacts in the industry.For the Options Group, which is primarily an executive search business, one advantage of interviewing thousands of Wall Street employees a year is accumulating extensive salary information. That information is used to estimate for clients what, for example, a crude oil trader with five years of experience should be paid, Mr. Karp said.“The big question is: how do you pay people fairly, but in line with their peers?” he said. “If everyone’s pay is down 35 percent, and your firm’s pay is down 25 percent, people may not be happy about it, but they’ll accept it.”To come up with a recent recommendation for a hedge fund executive who wanted to figure out how much to pay one of his senior employees, Mr. Karp made calls and used the Option Group’s compensation guide, a detailed annual report that sells for $11,000 a copy. He told the executive that a reasonable bonus for the employee, given the probable pay levels of rival firms, would be $650,000 to $800,000. That put the executive’s proposed bonus of about $750,000 squarely within range.Mr. Johnson, whose business does not do executive search, relies on public filings, analysts’ reports and information from industry insiders to compile his compensation data. He says that although he has been responsible for helping firms devise extravagant pay packages — in one case, a single package worth about $100 million — he does so only because the competitive market requires it.“From my personal political standpoint, I wish people got paid less,” Mr. Johnson said of his Wall Street clients. “But my guiding star is not my political belief.”Predictions about this year’s dismal bonuses have no doubt disappointed financiers on Wall Street, who often complain that they are underpaid even when all evidence points to the contrary. But for a compensation consultant, breaking bad news to people unaccustomed to hearing it is often part of the job.“I take no glee in saying that things are going to be bad,” Mr. Johnson said. “Up is better for everybody. But people need the facts.”'"

The streaky, 59th-ranked Cirstea controlled rallies throughout the match with her flat, powerful forehand, closing points at the net with deft volleys.Stosur had been placed under enormous pressure to do well at Melbourne in the months leading to the tournament, and she seemed to have struggled under the added expectations. She had lost early at two warmup tournaments, falling in the second round in Brisbane and the first in Sydney.Cirstea needed four match points in the final game to seal the victory, finishing the upset with a strong return that prompted a Stosur forehand to float long.'"

"'12-01-17,'1','“I try to do my best,” she added. “But sometimes, I just can’t.”In the raging debate over , almost all sides have come to agree on tougher enforcement at the border. But nearly unnoticed, frustration is focusing locally on border-crossers who are not illegal immigrants but young American citizens, whose families have returned to Mexico yet want their children to attend American schools.Called “transfronterizos,” these students migrate between two cultures, two languages and two nations every day, straining the resources of public school districts and sparking debate among educators and sociologists over whether it is in American interests that they be taught in the United States. Although some Mexican families pay the steep tuition required of out-of-district students, most do not, and many that pay out of their paychecks do not pay the property taxes that support public services.Some of the students’ parents are American citizens and some are Mexican.Students like Martha fly under the radar in some school districts, while other districts assign truancy officers to find who they are. They live with the anxiety of potentially having to lie about their residency and the very real possibility that the prize they are after — a decent education — will be taken from them. Though their exact numbers are unknown, their presence reflects the daily complexities of border life — among them, economic and educational disparities between the United States and Mexico and families splintered by deportation and unemployment.Transfronterizos can be found from Calexico, Calif., to , where violence in neighboring Cuidad , Mexico, has led to the creation of a designated lane for 800 to 1,400 students daily, including American citizens who attend El Paso schools.In Tijuana, Martha and a half-dozen high school seniors let a reporter accompany them on their daily commute and discussed their identity conflicts and criticisms by their American counterparts. Students, their parents and some teachers spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to jeopardize their enrollment.Martha’s mother, a seamstress, never got beyond ninth grade. Several days a week, she rises at 2 a.m. to claim a place for her daughter in line — a border mom, instead of a soccer or a tiger mom. Martha’s family pitches in on the for a Chula Vista house, where members of the extended family live, and pays utilities to establish residency.Other Tijuana families rent apartments, “borrow” fake addresses from friends or create a post office box. Sometimes a relative in the district is appointed their child’s legal guardian.“It’s stressful,” Martha says of the house that is not really her home. “You can get found out and kicked out of school. Sometimes I feel bad for lying. But I’m just going to school.”In so many ways, they are simply teenagers, wearing sneakers and the ubiquitous white buds in their ears. In the border line, the chit-chat about hangovers and how strict their parents are could be that of young people anywhere waiting to get into a movie.Except for the narcotic detector dogs, the Customs and Border Patrol officers and the sign that says, “Welcome to the United States.”Luis, a wiry high school senior with gleaming braces, was born in and lived there as a freshman, spending the week in his uncle’s home and weekends visiting his family in Tijuana. Homesick, he finally moved to Mexico.“I felt bad alone,” he said. “It’s tiring, but this way I can see my family all the days.”Now he and his 16-year-old sister get up at 3 a.m. to drive to the border with their father, a landscaper who has a green card. The teens touch down for a shower at a studio apartment the family rents in the Chula Vista school district, and they walk two and a half miles to school. Luis’s younger sister cannot join them — she was born in Mexico. So were most of Luis’s friends.“They say, ‘Oh man, it’s too hard to wake up at 3 in the morning,’ ” Luis said, sitting in his bedroom in Tijuana, which is decorated with posters of Piccadilly Circus, a place he has yet to visit. “On the other hand,” he said, “they are jealous that I can cross and they can’t.”Although educational outcomes have greatly improved in Mexico, low high school graduation rates and high attrition rates in the northern industrial states of and Chihuahua “hinder development of a highly educated work force,” concluded a 1997 study by the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego.“The gap between the U.S. and Mexican sides is great enough that people have a strong incentive” to cross, said David Shirk, the institute’s director.Ana Sánchez, a Tijuana resident who works for a nonprofit organization in and pays United States income tax (although not property tax), wanted her two children to be fluent in English and enrolled them in a public school close to her job. “I know that in the future it’s going to be a plus for them,” she said.Initially, “trying to be honest,” Mrs. Sánchez told the district that her daughter lived in Tijuana. But when told she would have to pay $800 a month in tuition, “that’s when I got added to the electric bill at a friend’s address,” she explained.For educators, determining whether a student meets residency requirements can be a thorny task, with rules varying from district to district and state to state. In San Ysidro, families must provide a mortgage or rental agreement and show utility bills in their name. Over the past two years the district has sent “letters of exclusion” to more than 20 families. In some cases, fraudulent documents were discovered. Manuel H. Paul, the superintendent, said educators were attuned to “red flags” like a phone call from a school nurse that reaches a disconnected number.“The student will say, ‘We live in Tijuana,’ ” Mr. Paul said. “Children most of the time don’t lie.”In 1982, the established that schools cannot inquire about a family’s immigration status. Ed Brand, superintendent of the Sweetwater Union High School District in Chula Vista, says an American citizen living outside the county would pay tuition of $7,162.“We’re not the I.N.S.,” he added, referring to the former Immigration and Naturalization Service. “Can one get by us? I imagine one can.”In nearby Calexico, a truant officer was dispatched to photograph students crossing the border, but the practice was deemed “an exercise in futility” and discontinued, said Richard Fragale, the superintendent of schools. He estimates that between 100 and 200 students cross each day, most not paying tuition. Ultimately, there are painful decisions for the district. Recently, he said, two parents were deported, leaving two children, both American citizens, in limbo.“What do we do with these youngsters?” he said. “Philosophically, as an educator, if a young person comes to the door, we should educate them.”In Ajo, Ariz., the state education office fined the district $1.2 million in May 2010, for the cost of educating 105 students crossing over from Mexico. The district has since tightened its residency requirements.The issue is fairness, whether a student lives in Mexico or just outside a preferred school district in the United States, argues Steven A. Camarota, the research director for the Center for Immigration Studies in , which favors limits on immigration. The possibility that these individuals could “pay enough in taxes to cover the costs of consumption of public services is basically zero,” he said.Martha and her friends view classmates who live in the district as coddled couch potatoes. They don’t have to deal with jeering workers at the border cursing them for cutting in line. Or say “wake me up” to the Tijuana taxi driver who drives them home after dark.Jesús travels 20 miles from Tijuana, on a twisting road known for robberies. He plans to study gastronomy. “I am just trying to get ahead and become someone important in life,” he says. “It’s a big responsibility making sure you get to school.” Five tardys can mean four hours of Saturday school and an F in citizenship.“You can kill their future,” says one of Jesús’s teachers, who does not mark him late when he knocks shyly on the classroom door 10 minutes into first period.Martha has crossed the border on and off since she was 5. Her life has its own ebb and flow, as well as the occasional undertow. In Tijuana, “sometimes people think we’re higher than them,” she says, because she attends an American high school. But as a Mexican in San Diego, “they look you up and down.” Divulging the particulars of their lives can be tricky business. “You can’t really rely on most people,” Martha says.Rising at 3 a.m., Luis will sometimes fall asleep in his sixth-period world history class. “The teacher gets super-angry,” he said. ‘”You don’t tell those kind of teachers you cross.”He shares his story sparingly with a few trusted Latino teachers. “Some of them crossed, like you. They want things to be better for you. But,” he allows, “that is not true of everyone. Some think we’re tax.”One teacher in Chula Vista, whose name was withheld to protect students in his class, including Martha, said, “I can’t draw all I want from her. Her intelligence is hidden away by her tiredness.”Yet teachers and guidance counselors say that despite the academic challenges, students who get up at 4 a.m. to be at school show signs of becoming resilient leaders. “They know who are they are and what they want,” the teacher observed. “They’re not going to be working at Jack in the Box. They’re go-getters.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','In December, an 80-year-old Jewish woman in the Sheepshead Bay area of Brooklyn received several phone calls in which the caller made anti-Semitic threats. On Thursday, a 78-year-old Jewish woman living nearby received a similar call.Last week, in the Penn South co-op complex in Chelsea, home to many elderly Jews, several residents found swastikas on their apartment doors. Another resident there received an angry phone call.The police said Monday that they had charged David Haddad, 56, of Penn South with aggravated harassment as a hate crime in connection with those acts. The police said that Mr. Haddad is himself Jewish, and that he knew all the victims, at least two of whom are his relatives.The police are also investigating whether Mr. Haddad painted swastikas on buildings over the weekend in Midwood, Brooklyn, where the police said Mr. Haddad has family, too.The threats appear to be the latest incidents among a number of anti-Semitic acts attributed to people whose true motives may not have been to harm Jews.'"
"'12-01-17,'1','This year’s bonus season, which began in late December and will continue until February at some companies, is expected to be the worst for industry employees since 2008, as regulatory measures and economic uncertainty have cut deeply into profits and made pay pools smaller.In his annual compensation survey, a closely watched report that was sent to roughly 800 of the company’s clients in November, Mr. Johnson estimated that bonuses in the industry would fall 20 to 30 percent from last year’s levels.That would still leave employees at firms like , where the average worker took home $430,700 in total compensation in 2010, much better off than workers in other industries. But it would represent further slippage from the sector’s highs before the crisis.Bonus math in a financial downturn is a delicate art. Because the payments typically make up at least half of an employee’s yearly pay, erring on the low side can mean losing a star performer to a rival firm.“Someone on Wall Street might go apoplectic when he heard he got $3 million and another guy got $3.5 million,” Mr. Johnson said.Decades ago, banks determined bonuses according to a relatively simple formula that took into account an employee’s seniority and performance. After the financial crisis, as politicians and regulators began criticizing what they saw as eye-popping pay packages, those all-cash bonuses went out of fashion.Now, Wall Street pay packages routinely include deferred cash payments and restricted stock awards that can be redeemed only after multiyear waiting periods.The increased complexity of Wall Street compensation has been a boon for consulting businesses, which can charge hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for advice. Goldman Sachs has used the consultancy Semler Brossy; ’s directors have relied on the Hay Group; and ’s board has used the services of Frederic W. Cook & Company, according to public filings by those banks. All three consulting companies, and all three banks, declined to comment.Some consultants are hired by banks merely to provide data on industry compensation trends, or to rubber-stamp the decisions of the banks’ internal compensation teams, while others are more directly involved in setting pay levels.“Directors don’t want to be embarrassed in the media by a compensation decision,” said Yale D. Tauber, a compensation consultant who works with the board of , among other clients. “They’re the guardians of investors’ capital.”Being a Wall Street pay specialist often means being on call for emergencies. Michael Karp, the managing partner of the Options Group, was awakened by a 4 a.m. telephone call while vacationing in . The caller, a bank executive based in , told Mr. Karp that December profits had come in below expectations. The company already planned to reduce its year-end bonuses 35 percent, and with the new numbers, it looked as if even deeper cuts would be necessary.“He wanted me to gauge what other competitors were doing,” said Mr. Karp, who immediately began using his BlackBerry to e-mail his contacts in the industry.For the Options Group, which is primarily an executive search business, one advantage of interviewing thousands of Wall Street employees a year is accumulating extensive salary information. That information is used to estimate for clients what, for example, a crude oil trader with five years of experience should be paid, Mr. Karp said.“The big question is: how do you pay people fairly, but in line with their peers?” he said. “If everyone’s pay is down 35 percent, and your firm’s pay is down 25 percent, people may not be happy about it, but they’ll accept it.”To come up with a recent recommendation for a hedge fund executive who wanted to figure out how much to pay one of his senior employees, Mr. Karp made calls and used the Option Group’s compensation guide, a detailed annual report that sells for $11,000 a copy. He told the executive that a reasonable bonus for the employee, given the probable pay levels of rival firms, would be $650,000 to $800,000. That put the executive’s proposed bonus of about $750,000 squarely within range.Mr. Johnson, whose business does not do executive search, relies on public filings, analysts’ reports and information from industry insiders to compile his compensation data. He says that although he has been responsible for helping firms devise extravagant pay packages — in one case, a single package worth about $100 million — he does so only because the competitive market requires it.“From my personal political standpoint, I wish people got paid less,” Mr. Johnson said of his Wall Street clients. “But my guiding star is not my political belief.”Predictions about this year’s dismal bonuses have no doubt disappointed financiers on Wall Street, who often complain that they are underpaid even when all evidence points to the contrary. But for a compensation consultant, breaking bad news to people unaccustomed to hearing it is often part of the job.“I take no glee in saying that things are going to be bad,” Mr. Johnson said. “Up is better for everybody. But people need the facts.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','In recent months, members of both the Senate and the House have introduced eight bills to stimulate travel to the United States.In an interview, Deputy Secretary of State Thomas R. Nides said the correlation between visa issuance and spending is undisputed. “We’re very much focused on an ongoing dialogue” that would facilitate legitimate travel and job growth, he said. “But it is a balancing act.” Every decision “has to be made in light of national security,” he added.But despite increased demand — visa processing jumped 48 percent in China and 63 percent in Brazil in the last three months of 2011 compared with the period a year earlier — the waiting time for visa interviews has decreased. In the meantime, other countries are aggressively courting travelers from countries not part of the waiver program. In July, Canada introduced 10-year multiple entry visas for all countries that require a visa, including Brazil and China, and in August announced the opening of three new visa application centers in Brazil, according to the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, a trade group. “Previous policies were based on our views of the 20th century world and need to evolve,” said David F. Goldstein, president and chief executive.Shane Downey, director of public policy for the Global Business Travel Association, said a speech at the group’s recent annual convention in Denver that included discussion of visa reform touched a nerve. “We immediately started receiving e-mails” about members’ frustrations, he said.Steven Hacker, president of the International Association of Exhibitions and Events, said: “When international buyers and sellers try to come and can’t, they go to other countries,” he said. “Ten years ago emerging countries like China, Brazil and India were not nearly as sophisticated as they are today, so there wasn’t much demand.”He told of a recent exhibition of the Association of Equipment Manufacturers, an event for the construction industry held every three years, when the visa application for one person in a large group was rejected at the last minute, so the whole group was unable to attend.Gary Shapiro, president of the Consumer Electronics Association, said his organization also loses many visitors at its annual show from markets like China. “I believe the U.S. consulates and embassy in China have been responsive but are understaffed and under-resourced,” he said. “Still, we hear of many visa denials for unknown reasons.”Christopher Nassetta, president of Hilton Worldwide, had a similar story about the company’s global conference in 2010 in Orlando, Fla., for thousands of owners from around the world representing the 10 Hilton Worldwide brands. “But we had some cases where we could not get owners into the country,” he said. “You can’t throw the baby out with the bath water,” he said, referring to security after the Sept. 11 attacks. “We need jobs. We need economic growth.”Compromising security is a major concern, said Bruce McIndoe, president of iJET Intelligent Risk Systems, a travel risk management company. “There is always some trade-off. But processes can be put into place to minimize any security risk.”A bigger issue may be that people from nonwaiver countries will overstay their visa and remain in the United States, he said. Videoconferencing “would be a good service and help facilitate the process,” he added, but document verification, background investigations to ensure that visitors return home, and database checks to identify people with legal problems or known terrorists will still be the most critical measures.Despite the steps to streamline things, which include sharply increased staff in high-demand areas and drastically increased capacity by providing more windows at offices and extending hours of operation, Mr. Nides said challenges remain. For example, hiring and training consular officers with the proper language abilities and skills to ensure that the “right people, for the right reasons” are issued visas is a sophisticated process that takes time. And the department does not support videoconferencing for security and efficiency reasons.“But the reality is, as of today, we are at or above pre-9/11 levels,” Mr. Nides said. “We’re continually trying to figure out where the efficient models are. One of the things that is very clear to me is that every visa decision is a national security decision, which is why we take it so seriously. We will set ourselves back if we get it wrong.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','The Koobface gang’s freedom underscores how hard it is to apprehend international computer criminals, even when identities are known. These groups tend to operate in countries where they can work unmolested by the local authorities, and where cooperation with United States and European law enforcement agencies is poor. Meanwhile, Western law enforcement is awash in computer crime and lacks the resources and skilled manpower to tackle it effectively, especially when evidence putting individuals’ fingers on keyboards must be collected abroad.On Tuesday, Facebook plans to announce that it will begin sharing information about the group and how to fight them with security researchers and other Internet companies. It believes public namings can make it harder for such groups to operate and send a message to the criminal underground.None of the men have been charged with a crime and no law enforcement agencies have confirmed they are under investigation.The group investigators have identified has adopted the tongue-in-cheek name, Ali Baba & 4: Anton Korotchenko, who uses the online nickname “KrotReal”; Stanislav Avdeyko, known as “leDed”; Svyatoslav E. Polichuck, who goes by “PsViat” and “PsycoMan”; Roman P. Koturbach, who uses the online moniker “PoMuc”; and Alexander Koltyshev, or “Floppy.” )Efforts to contact members of the group for comment have been unsuccessful.Weeks after early versions of the Koobface worm began appearing on Facebook, investigators inside the company were able to trace the attacks to those responsible. “We’ve had a picture of one of the guys in a scuba mask on our wall since 2008,” said Ryan McGeehan, manager of investigations and incident response at Facebook.Since then, Facebook and several independent security researchers have provided law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with information and evidence. Most notably, Jan Droemer, a 32-year-old independent researcher in Germany, has provided important information and leads, including a password-free view inside Koobface’s command-and-control system, known as the “Mothership.” Mr. Droemer spent nights and weekends for four months in late 2009 and early 2010 unmasking the gang members using only information available publicly on the Internet.That computer crime pays is fueling a boom that is leaving few Internet users and businesses unscathed. The toll on consumers alone is estimated at $114 billion annually worldwide, according to a September 2011 study by the security software maker Symantec.Russia, in particular, has a reputation as a hacker haven, although it has pursued several prominent cases against spammers recently. The Soviet education system’s emphasis on math and science combined with post-Communist economic collapse and weak private industry meant there were many highly trained engineers, but few legitimate outlets for their skills, said Vsevolod Gunitskiy, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto.“Russia is sort of a perfect storm for cybercrime,” he said. The proliferation of organized crime and official corruption created “this very strong legacy of contempt for the laws and general culture of criminality.”The Russian Embassy in Washington said it does not have any information regarding this group and that American law enforcement officials had never contacted the embassy on this issue.The men investigators believe are behind Koobface look a lot like ordinary software enthusiasts, albeit with more tattoos and an outlaw persona. Mr. Avdeyko, who is two decades older than the other men and has been tied to an infamous spyware program dating to 2003 called CoolWebSearch, appears to hold a leadership role.He and at least two of the other men have worked in the world of online pornography, said Mr. Droemer. Mr. Korotchenko and several of the other men apparently tried to run a legitimate mobile software and services business, colorfully named MobSoft Ltd. They did not reply to e-mails requesting interviews.Mr. Droemer said the gang’s success was more attributable to workaday persistence and willingness to adapt than technical sophistication. They could have spread Koobface to many more PCs, he said. “They could have done a lot more technical things to make it more perfect, more marvelous. But there was just no need to do it. They were just investing as much to get the revenue they wanted to get.”The group cleverly harnessed the infrastructures of powerful online services — from Facebook and Twitter to Google’s search engine and Blogger — to do the heavy lifting, and may have run its enterprise with just a few computers.Koobface will probably earn its place in history for pioneering and leading the criminal exploitation of social networks, rather than the size of its profits. Data found in the botnet’s command-and-control system suggests the group has earned at least $2 million a year for the 3 1/2 years of its existence, although the actual total is very likely higher, Mr. Droemer said.Experts say the gang could have further enriched itself through identity fraud, since it has had access to millions of PCs and social-network profiles, but that there is no evidence it has done so.Indeed, in a 2009 Christmas e-card to security researchers left inside victim computers, the gang vowed it would never steal credit card or banking information. It called viruses “something awful.” Its tactics have been less ruthless than those of many other hacker groups, experts said. For instance, it has never deployed malicious programs that install automatically, and rather has required its victims to make several unwise clicks.While the Koobface gang operates freely, Facebook has focused on building elaborate defenses against the worm, which relentlessly struck the site again and again until disappearing in March. The gang abandoned the site after Facebook mounted a major counteroffensive, which included an effort to dismantle the command-and-control system of the botnet and a simultaneous push to scrub its network of the worm and clean up infections in users’ PCs.“We fired all the different guns at the same time,” said Joe Sullivan, chief security officer at Facebook. “If we could literally shut down the command-and-control, all the infections, and just make them have to start over from scratch in all contexts, we figured they might decide to move on.” He hoped they would conclude Facebook was unprofitable, he said.But Facebook’s effort and two earlier takedown efforts by security researchers — including one by the Bulgarian researcher Dancho Danchev, who revealed the name of one Koobface member on his blog last week — have failed put an end to Koobface, and smaller sites continue to suffer.“People who engage in this type of stuff need to know that their name and real identity are going to come out eventually and they’re going to get arrested and they’re going to be targeted,” Mr. Sullivan said. “People are fighting back.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','Charles H. Price II, a former United States ambassador to Britain who helped sustain warm relations between President Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, died on Thursday at his home in Indian Wells, Calif. He was 80.His death was confirmed by his wife, Carol Swanson Price.Mr. Price took over as ambassador to the Court of St. James’s in November 1983, a moment of unease between the two nations. Mrs. Thatcher was upset because she had not been notified before the United States invasion of Grenada the previous month, and many British elected officials opposed a plan to station American cruise missiles in Britain.During his five years as ambassador, Mr. Price participated in talks between the British and the Irish Republican Army and helped Mrs. Thatcher defuse protests after the United States used British bases to carry out attacks on Libya in 1986. He also deployed his sense of humor and Midwestern humility to try easing the anti-American sentiment that Reagan’s policies had stoked among many Britons: he hosted elaborate receptions for members of government and the royal family, became a familiar face on television news and talk shows and, on occasion, made widely publicized visits to pubs to hear the viewpoints of working-class citizens.When a terrorist bomb brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in December 1988, killing all 259 people aboard, Mr. Price and his wife were at the scene within hours. He later accompanied Mrs. Thatcher during a tour of the wreckage and was praised for the compassion he showed for Lockerbie residents, 11 of whom were killed by falling debris.Shortly before Mr. Price left his post in 1989, The Times of London hailed him as “the most energetic, engaging and popular American ambassador in many years.”Mr. Price was involved in a variety of philanthropic causes and was active on an assortment of corporate boards, including those of Texaco, British Airways, Hansen P.L.C. and Sprint. He was named to the board of The New York Times Company in 1989 and served until 2002.'"
"'12-01-17,'1','There is no cure or treatment for Ebola infection beyond supportive care. Nor do scientists fully understand how the virus infects its hosts.But in work published in the journal Nature, researchers from several institutions have identified a protein in host cells that appears to be essential for infection. Cells that lacked the protein remained unharmed after exposure to the virus in the laboratory.More strikingly, mice that were even partly deficient in the protein (as a result of genetic manipulation) became sick with Ebola but mostly did not die.This is the first time scientists have shown that a genetically manipulated animal can survive an Ebola infection, said Judith White, a cell biologist and virologist at the University of Virginia School of Medicine who was not involved in the research. She called it an “astounding result.”The studies greatly advance researchers’ understanding of how this horrendous virus enters cells and wreaks havoc. They also suggest a possible target that may someday be used to develop drugs, said Dr. White.Researchers at Harvard Medical School, the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., and Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York cast their nets wide to identify the new target. They began with a large collection of cells, introduced random mutations and then exposed the cells to a virus designed to mimic Ebola.This virus, called rVSV-GP-EboV, carries a protein from Ebola on its surface, but it is not deadly and so can be studied in less secure laboratories. “We asked the virus to find us cells it couldn’t infect,” said Kartik Chandran, an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.Probing these resistant cells, Dr. Chandran and his colleagues homed in on a protein, called NPC1, that appeared to be missing.Under normal circumstances, NPC1, found within a cellular compartment called the endosome, helps bring cholesterol into the cell’s cytoplasm, where it is necessary for healthy function. People whose cells lack the protein typically develop a disease called Niemann-Pick, in which cholesterol and other lipids build up in the liver, spleen and brain.The researchers took cells from patients with Niemann-Pick disease and exposed them to the Ebola-like virus in the laboratory. The cells survived, further indicating that Ebola relies on NPC1 to enter cells.The academics then reached out to government scientists who could conduct tests with the real virus.“I’m always a little skeptical” of such requests, said John Dye, a research scientist at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Indeed, for at least 10 years scientists have tried to pinpoint how Ebola penetrates a host cell.They have proposed a few candidate molecules, but “none has turned out to be essential,” said Erica Ollmann Saphire of the Scripps Research Institute. One theory held that the virus is “promiscuous,” latching onto different receptors on different cells, or different molecules on the same cell, she said.Dr. Dye and his team verified that when cells without the NPC1 protein were exposed to Ebola, they did not become infected. In addition, mice engineered to produce half the usual amount of NPC1 appeared to be protected as well: They got sick with the virus, but remarkably, most survived. Cells or mice infected with Marburg virus, Ebola’s close cousin, also survived if they lacked or were low in NPC1, the researchers found.Meanwhile, more evidence was discovered that Ebola needs this protein to wreak havoc. Scientists led by Dr. James Cunningham of Harvard Medical School and Dr. Chandran conducted a broad search for small molecules that might prevent Ebola from entering and killing cells. After screening roughly 40,000 compounds, they zeroed in on one that seemed likely to work by blocking the interaction between the virus and NPC1.Ebola, like many other viruses, first enters a cell’s endosome. To replicate and cause havoc, though, the virus must make its way into the cytoplasm, the main compartment of the cell. “If it stays in the endosome, there’s no infection,” said Dr. Ollmann Saphire.Small molecules that interfere with NPC1 might help to ward off an infection or make it less severe, the researchers say.One of the Nature papers described a molecule and a derivative that seemed to thwart Ebola’s entry into cells by interacting with NPC1. The other showed that an antidepressant called imipramine, which was known to block NPC1, seemed to prevent infection as well. None of these compounds has been tested against the virus in mice, let alone in primates. But that day may be coming.“Scientists never like to say something is definitively it, because a new discovery always comes along,” said Dr. Ollmann Saphire. “But NPC1 is the most convincing target we’ve seen yet for Ebola.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf, elected in late 2005 and the only woman in Africa serving as president, overwhelmingly won the runoff election with 90.8 percent of the vote after failing to reach 50 percent in the first round of voting in October, when 16 candidates ran.While international observers praised the election as free and fair, turn out in the runoff dropped by half. The day before the vote, Mr. Tubman’s supporters clashed with the police, who responded with tear gas and gunfire. At least one person died and several others were injured.Despite the violence and boycott, Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf, 73, said the election showed that Liberia, founded by freed American slaves in 1847, had “turned the corner” and earned “our rightful place as a beacon of democracy.”She appealed for all sides to set aside political differences in order to rebuild an impoverished country of nearly four million still shattered by the civil war that ended in 2003. She also emphasized that this would be her last term, an indirect but clear acknowledgement that she broke a campaign pledge to serve only one.“Patriots freely and openly and even passionately disagree about what is best for the nation they love,” she said. “Patriots acknowledge that those who may not embrace their particular views are nonetheless acting out of their own understanding of what is best for their country.”Mr. Tubman previously vowed to neither recognize nor cooperate with the new administration, so his attendance appeared to be a step away from confrontation, if not yet real reconciliation.Mrs. Clinton attended the inauguration at the start of a two-day trip to West Africa that will also include a stop in Ivory Coast, where a disputed election led to violence. She will also visit Togo and Cape Verde. She was joined by Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, and Gen. Carter F. Ham, the commander of the United States Africa Command.“There has to be a recognition that in elections sometimes you win and sometimes you lose,” Mrs. Clinton said, praising Mrs. Johnson Sirleaf’s outreach in remarks to employees at the new American Embassy here. “I happen to know that for a fact. I have done both of them.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','BRUSSELS — BASF, the German chemical group, has abandoned efforts to sell genetically modified products in Europe, including its Amflora potato, because of overwhelming opposition to the technology, the company said Monday.“There is still a lack of acceptance for this technology in many parts of Europe — from the majority of consumers, farmers and politicians,” said Stefan Marcinowski, a board member with responsibilities for plant biotechnology. “Therefore, it does not make business sense to continue investing in products exclusively for cultivation in this market.”The company has instead decided to focus on “attractive markets” in the Americas and in Asia, he said.The withdrawal of the potato leaves a type of corn produced by Monsanto as the only biotech crop grown in Europe.A total of 140 jobs will be cut in Europe from the company’s plant science unit, which was responsible for developing the Amflora potato, mainly for use in the paper industry, BASF said. Many of those jobs will be moved to the company’s new plant science headquarters near Raleigh, North Carolina, and to other sites in Berlin and Belgium.'"
"'12-01-17,'1','On the collaborative blog MathOverflow, mathematicians earn reputation points for contributing to solutions; in another math experiment dubbed the Polymath Project, mathematicians commenting on the Fields medalist Timothy Gower’s blog in 2009 found a new proof for a particularly complicated theorem in just six weeks.And a social networking site called ResearchGate — where scientists can answer one another’s questions, share papers and find collaborators — is rapidly gaining popularity.Editors of traditional journals say open science sounds good, in theory. In practice, “the scientific community itself is quite conservative,” said Maxine Clarke, executive editor of the commercial journal Nature, who added that the traditional published paper is still viewed as “a unit to award grants or assess jobs and tenure.”Dr. Nielsen, 38, who left a successful science career to write “Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science,” agreed that scientists have been “very inhibited and slow to adopt a lot of online tools.” But he added that open science was coalescing into “a bit of a movement.”On Thursday, 450 bloggers, journalists, students, scientists, librarians and programmers will converge on (and thousands more will join in online) for the sixth annual ScienceOnline conference. Science is moving to a collaborative model, said Bora Zivkovic, a chronobiology blogger who is a founder of the conference, “because it works better in the current ecosystem, in the Web-connected world.”Indeed, he said, scientists who attend the conference should not be seen as competing with one another. “ is our competitor,” he continued. “We have to get her off the screen and get science there instead.”“I want to make science more open. I want to change this,” said Ijad Madisch, 31, the Harvard-trained virologist and computer scientist behind ResearchGate, the social networking site for scientists.Started in 2008 with few features, it was reshaped with feedback from scientists. Its membership has mushroomed to more than 1.3 million, Dr. Madisch said, and it has attracted several million dollars in from some of the original investors of , and Facebook.A year ago, ResearchGate had 12 employees. Now it has 70 and is hiring. The company, based in , is modeled after Silicon Valley startups. Lunch, drinks and fruit are free, and every employee owns part of the company.The Web site is a sort of mash-up of Facebook, Twitter and , with profile pages, comments, groups, job listings, and “like” and “follow” buttons (but without baby photos, cat videos and thinly veiled self-praise). Only scientists are invited to pose and answer questions — a rule that should not be hard to enforce, with discussion threads about topics like polymerase chain reactions that only a scientist could love.Scientists populate their ResearchGate profiles with their real names, professional details and publications — data that the site uses to suggest connections with other members. Users can create public or private discussion groups, and share papers and lecture materials. ResearchGate is also developing a “reputation score” to reward members for online contributions.ResearchGate offers a simple yet effective end run around restrictive journal access with its “self-archiving repository.” Since most journals allow scientists to link to their submitted papers on their own Web sites, Dr. Madisch encourages his users to do so on their ResearchGate profiles. In addition to housing 350,000 papers (and counting), the platform provides a way to search 40 million abstracts and papers from other science databases.In 2011, ResearchGate reports, 1,620,849 connections were made, 12,342 questions answered and 842,179 publications shared. Greg Phelan, chairman of the chemistry department at the , Cortland, used it to find new collaborators, get expert advice and read journal articles not available through his small university. Now he spends up to two hours a day, five days a week, on the site.Dr. Rajiv Gupta, a radiology instructor who supervised Dr. Madisch at Harvard and was one of ResearchGate’s first investors, called it “a great site for serious research and research collaboration,” adding that he hoped it would never be contaminated “with pop culture and chit-chat.”Dr. Gupta called Dr. Madisch the “quintessential networking guy — if there’s a of the science world, it would be him.”Dr. Sönke H. Bartling, a researcher at the German Research Center who is editing a book on “Science 2.0,” wrote that for scientists to move away from what is currently “a highly integrated and controlled process,” a new system for assessing the value of research is needed. If open access is to be achieved through blogs, what good is it, he asked, “if one does not get reputation and money from them?”Changing the status quo — opening data, papers, research ideas and partial solutions to anyone and everyone — is still far more idea than reality. As the established journals argue, they provide a critical service that does not come cheap.“I would love for it to be free,” said Alan Leshner, executive publisher of the journal Science, but “we have to cover the costs.” Those costs hover around $40 million a year to produce his nonprofit flagship journal, with its more than 25 editors and writers, sales and production staff, and offices in , and , not to mention print and distribution expenses. (Like other media organizations, Science has responded to the decline in advertising revenue by enhancing its Web offerings, and most of its growth comes from online subscriptions.)Similarly, Nature employs a large editorial staff to manage the peer-review process and to select and polish “startling and new” papers for publication, said Dr. Clarke, its editor. And it costs money to screen for plagiarism and spot-check data “to make sure they haven’t been manipulated.”Peer-reviewed open-access journals, like Nature Communications and PLoS One, charge their authors publication fees — $5,000 and $1,350, respectively — to defray their more modest expenses.The largest journal publisher, , whose products include , and the subscription-based online archive ScienceDirect, has drawn considerable criticism from open-access advocates and librarians, who are especially incensed by its support for the Research Works Act, introduced in Congress last month, which seeks to protect publishers’ rights by effectively restricting access to research papers and data.In an Op-Ed article in The New York Times last week, Michael B. Eisen, a molecular biologist at the , and a founder of the Public Library of Science, wrote that if the bill passes, “taxpayers who already paid for the research would have to pay again to read the results.”In an e-mail interview, Alicia Wise, director of universal access at Elsevier, wrote that “professional curation and preservation of data is, like professional publishing, neither easy nor inexpensive.” And Tom Reller, a spokesman for Elsevier, commented on Dr. Eisen’s blog, “Government mandates that require private-sector information products to be made freely available undermine the industry’s ability to recoup these .”Mr. Zivkovic, the ScienceOnline co-founder and a blog editor for Scientific American, which is owned by Nature, was somewhat sympathetic to the big journals’ plight. “They have shareholders,” he said. “They have to move the ship slowly.”Still, he added: “Nature is not digging in. They know it’s happening. They’re preparing for it.”Scott Aaronson, a quantum computing theorist at the , has refused to conduct peer review for or submit papers to commercial journals. “I got tired of giving free labor,” he said, to “these very rich for-profit companies.”Dr. Aaronson is also an active member of online science communities like MathOverflow, where he has earned enough reputation points to edit others’ posts. “We’re not talking about new technologies that have to be invented,” he said. “Things are moving in that direction. Journals seem noticeably less important than 10 years ago.”Dr. Leshner, the publisher of Science, agrees that things are moving. “Will the model of science magazines be the same 10 years from now? I highly doubt it,” he said. “I believe in evolution.“When a better system comes into being that has quality and trustability, it will happen. That’s how science progresses, by doing scientific experiments. We should be doing that with scientific publishing as well.”Matt Cohler, the former vice president of product management at Facebook who now represents Benchmark Capital on ResearchGate’s board, sees a vast untapped market in online science.“It’s one of the last areas on the Internet where there really isn’t anything yet that addresses core needs for this group of people,” he said, adding that “trillions” are spent each year on global scientific research. Investors are betting that a successful site catering to scientists could shave at least a sliver off that enormous pie.Dr. Madisch, of ResearchGate, acknowledged that he might never reach many of the established scientists for whom social networking can seem like a foreign language or a waste of time. But wait, he said, until younger scientists weaned on social media and open-source collaboration start running their own labs.“If you said years ago, ‘One day you will be on Facebook sharing all your photos and personal information with people,’ they wouldn’t believe you,” he said. “We’re just at the beginning. The change is coming.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','BANGKOK — Thai police units on Monday seized what they said was a large stash of two chemicals that could be used to make rudimentary bombs, as a murky case that put the country on alert for a terrorist attack took a confusing turn.A top Bangkok police official said the chemicals, ammonium nitrate and urea, were found in a commercial building on the outskirts of Bangkok. They were meant to be shipped out of the country, the official said, allaying fears of a pending attack on Thai soil.The Thai prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, said: “The situation is under control — no problem. And I can guarantee the safety of our citizens and foreign tourists.”But the United States Embassy said it stood by its emergency message issued Friday, saying terrorists might be planning attacks against “tourist areas in Bangkok in the near future.”The case appears to center on a Lebanese man, identified as Atris Hussein, who was arrested at Bangkok’s main airport on Thursday evening as he tried to leave the country. The Thai authorities said his arrest came after a tip from Israeli intelligence agents, who warned that a group of people who appeared to be from Hezbollah were planning to strike tourist sites in Bangkok in mid-January.Thai officials said Mr. Hussein was himself a member of Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group based in Lebanon that the United States and Israel consider a terrorist organization. Hezbollah denied that he was a member.'"
"'12-01-17,'1','PARIS — Stocks edged up in Europe on Monday, showing a muted reaction to Standard & Poor’s downgrade late Friday of nine European countries, including France and Italy.Market activity was subdued, with Wall Street closed in observance of Martin Luther King’s Birthday. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed up 1 percent, and the FTSE 100 index in London rose 0.4 percent. The DAX index in Germany rose 1.25 percent. Indexes rose in France and Italy and were little changed in Spain. The euro held steady against the dollar.As for the S.& P. ratings cut last week, the agency cited a deteriorating economic situation and disappointment with leaders’ efforts to address the euro crisis. On Monday, S.& P. also lowered by one notch its rating on the euro zone’s main bailout vehicle, to AA+ from AAA, in a widely anticipated move.President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, in his first public comments since S.& P. cut the country’s rating, said Monday that “in the final analysis, this doesn’t change anything.”Speaking in Madrid at a news conference with the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, Mr. Sarkozy said France and the other European countries that were downgraded “must cut our deficits, cut spending and improve the competitiveness of our economies to return to growth.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','As the world was transfixed by the Titanic-like imagery of the partly submerged Costa Concordia and the frantic efforts to save the fuel-laden vessel in rough seas off the coast, questions swirled on Monday about the enormous line industry, which operates without much regulation.The ship’s detained captain, Francesco Schettino, was accused by his bosses of deviating from a fixed, computerized course to show off his beautiful $563 million boat, carrying more than 4,200 passengers and crew members, to the people of Giglio Island on a still Friday night, crashing it on a reef.But as shares in the ship’s parent company — of , the world’s biggest cruise line operator — slid by nearly a fifth and the owners and insurers tried to add up the cost of the disaster, there were more troubling issues raised about how the cruise industry is supervised and controlled.Those issues included how much safety information and training are required for the crew and passengers, and how much discretion a captain has to alter routes, especially in an age when electronic radar, charts, GPS and other guidance systems are supposed to keep these large, sleek ships on course.“There are legitimate questions as these vessels have substantially evolved in recent years,” said Helen Kearns, a spokeswoman for Siim Kallas, the transportation commissioner. “The boats have gotten a lot bigger, as it’s economically advantageous to have more passengers,” she said. “But the way these vessels have grown in size does mean finding the right balance to make sure regulations are stringent enough to ensure there are procedures like safe evacuations.”More than 72 hours after the accident killed at least six people, confusion still reigned over how many were missing. ’s coast guard abruptly raised the total to 29 late Monday after having said 16, including 2 Americans, remained unaccounted for. Worries also grew that the ship’s half-million gallons of fuel could leak into a marine wildlife sanctuary.While airline pilots are directed and guided by controllers on the ground, sea captains are considered to be in complete control. “It’s not like the aircraft industry, where you file a flight plan,” said Peter Wild, a cruise industry consultant at G. P. Wild (International) Limited, a consultancy outside . Rather, at most cruise lines, company directors determine the routes, which are then transmitted to the captain and a navigating officer, who scrutinize the charted course but are meant to follow it.Captain Schettino’s boss, Pier Luigi Foschi, insisted that a safe route had been programmed into the navigating computers and that alarms would have sounded for any deviation. “This route was put in correctly,” said Mr. Foschi, who is chairman of Costa Crociere S.p.A.“The fact that it left from this course is due solely to a maneuver by the commander that was unapproved, unauthorized and unknown to Costa,” he said at an emotional press conference in . “He wanted to show the ship, to go nearby this island of Giglio, so he decided to change the course of the ship,” Mr. Foschi said, admitting that the ship had done a similar but approved maneuver last summer for a festival.The captain, who may face criminal charges of manslaughter, failure to offer assistance and abandonment of the ship, had said he struck an uncharted rock.But an Italian prosecutor, Francesco Verusio, had harsh words on Monday. “We are struck by the unscrupulousness of the reckless maneuver that the commander of the Costa Concordia made near the island of Giglio,” he told reporters. “It was inexcusable.”For many years, the global cruise line industry has operated under a loosely defined system that tends to escape scrutiny by courts and regulators. Cruise line instances of crime, pollution and safety and health violations have often gone unpoliced because no single authority is in charge.A agency, the International Maritime Organization, oversees maritime safety through international conventions, including one for the Safety of Life at Sea, known as Solas, adopted in 1914, which grew out of the global anger that stemmed from the loss of the Titanic in 1912. But the agency has no policing powers.Ships themselves are certified and inspected by independent classification societies, like Lloyd’s Register Group and the Italian RINA S.p.A., Mr. Wild said, that perform annual checks of ship safety conditions, lifeboats and the like. They approve vital components like fire protection, navigation, radio communication equipment, deck gear, cables and anchors.While electronic systems are standard on ships like the Costa Concordia, all ships are also required to carry paper charts, said Angus Menzies, a retired British Navy commodore who is now chief executive of the Honorable Company of Master Mariners, a professional association in London for qualified sea captains.“But I’d suspect that on a modern cruise liner like that he’d be using electronic charts,” Mr. Menzies said. To hit an uncharted rock “nowadays that’s unlikely, but it’s possible,” he said. “The other possibility is that they were just a shower of turkeys — incompetent — on the bridge.”But the captain is king on his ship, Mr. Menzies said. “The man on the bridge decides everything.”Michael Bruno, dean of the engineering school at the Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, N.J., and chairman of the Marine Board of the , said that if there were obstacles on the charts, electronic or paper, the crew should have seen them. “There are probably many people in the field who would say that you don’t need an electronic chart to tell you you’re close to rocks,” he said.“One of the things to keep in mind is the accuracy of all of these systems,” Mr. Bruno added. Even with GPS, he said, “accuracy is measured in yards, sometimes tens of feet. The difference between hitting a submerged obstacle and not hitting it can sometimes be a matter of feet.”Questions also loomed about why the Costa Concordia listed so badly after the crash, as the captain tried to bring it closer to the island. Modern ships are built to sink levelly, Mr. Menzies said, by the use of bulkhead doors and pumps that are supposed to be able to be operated remotely. “The worst-case scenario is trying to get non-seafarers off a ship that is capsizing.”That was certainly the case on board the Costa Concordia Friday night. Passengers described delays and confusion, with unclear instructions and inexperienced crew members. Emily Lau, 27, and her husband, Benji Smith, 34, an American honeymoon couple on board, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that “it was every man for himself,” Ms. Lau said. “The main thing is no one knew how to help because they were never trained. That is the cruise ship’s fault.”Cruise passengers are supposed to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of boarding. “We have never had any drills,” Ms. Lau said. “We were asked to go for a safety meeting, and it was nothing but a sales pitch for excursions.”The accident and the constantly televised images of the elegant ship lying grotesquely will hurt the cruise industry at a crucial period, when global economic uncertainty is rampant and summer bookings are at a peak, analysts said. Carnival and other companies had already dropped prices in the face of weaker demand, especially in , which provides 40 percent of its business. About one-third of all cruise bookings are made in the wintry first quarter of the year.Investors jettisoned the of cruise operators on Monday. Shares of Carnival, which trades in London, dropped about 17 percent, the most in a decade. ( markets were closed Monday in observance of Day.)The company estimated the financial impact of the disaster to be as much as $95 million, with the ship out of service for the rest of 2012. But the impact is bound to be much more, said James Rollo, a leisure-industry analyst at , who said that the Costa subsidiary is 17 percent of Carnival’s capacity.“Cruising is a safer way to travel than air, but the investigation may take time, the story is getting global publicity, and people are unlikely to book until confidence returns,” Mr. Rollo said.Insurers, too, are expected to take a short-term hit. Nick Johnson, an analyst at Numis, a London research firm, estimated total losses of at least $600 million. In a note to clients, he forecast stricter risk assessments because of what he called “the psychological impact of seeing the unthinkable happen.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','But in resource-rich countries like Nigeria, with its enormous gap between rich and poor, subsidized gas is one of the few benefits trickling down from an infamously corrupt government that has pocketed billions of dollars in oil profits, with little to show for it.For the poor — and three-fourths of this country’s population lives on about a dollar a day — the fuel subsidy means a cheap ride to the market. It means lower prices for the food they buy there. And it means some sense of ownership in a national resource, oil, in which roughly 80 percent of the economic benefit has flowed to 1 percent of the population, according to some estimates.“It’s one of the few ways the urban and rural poor feel they benefit from this strategic resource,” said Michael J. Watts, an expert on the politics of oil at the University of California, Berkeley. “The fuel subsidy is experienced as one of the few things they get.”That sentiment was strongly in evidence as the protests dwindled here on Monday. Under the rollback union leaders agreed to, gas in Nigeria will drop to about $2.27 a gallon from about $3.50 — higher than the $1.70 price before Jan. 1, but low enough to end the strike.Still, many Nigerians were disappointed that Mr. Jonathan had not dropped the price all the way back down.“We are not benefitting from this oil!” shouted Ali Mohammed, a motorcycle-taxi driver. “No lights, no roads, no hospitals. Make him reduce the price. We are suffering in this country.”Hundreds of other young men milled about close by in what has been a center of the protest here: the New Afrika Shrine nightclub of the Afro-beat star Femi Kuti, son of the Nigerian musician and dissident Fela Kuti.In a speech Monday morning, Mr. Kuti both incited and calmed the crowd listening at his feet amid clouds of marijuana smoke, expressing disgust with Nigeria’s institutions from his rickety wooden stage as supporters murmured their approval.Later in his office, Mr. Kuti shouted at his television as he watched the labor leaders announce the end of the strike. “I told you those people would back down,” he said to his aides, looking up from the screen. As for the government, he said, “They prosecute people for being gay, but there is no law against stealing 14 million.”Nigeria has seen similar tumult over the issue in the past, and it is hardly alone. In Bolivia, protesters burned photos of President Evo Morales and vandalized government buildings in December 2010, forcing Mr. Morales to withdraw his subsidy-cutting measure only days after introducing it.In Venezuela, before the rise of Hugo Chávez, days of riots and hundreds of deaths followed a fuel price rise in 1989. President Chávez now controls one of the world’s most generous fuel subsidies, despite being critical of it.In Jordan, an announcement last year that subsidies would be lifted helped inspire antigovernment demonstrations that forced a reversal. In Indonesia, a 30 percent increase in fuel prices in 2008 led to bloody rioting. Economists nonetheless praise that country for doing what others often do not: sweetening subsidy removal with cash programs that aid the poor.Iran has employed a similar strategy, eliminating subsidized prices for fuel but cushioning the blow with cash payments of roughly $45 a month. The approach “was critical in preventing the kind of thing that we’re seeing happening in Nigeria,” said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, adding that other Middle East countries shouldering subsidies they can ill afford, most notably Egypt, are looking at Iran’s plan as a possible model.The International Monetary Fund and other global financial institutions do not like fuel subsidies, pointing out that the biggest benefits do not even go to the poor, but rather to the owners of large cars and big generators.Yet it was not the wealthy in Nigeria, or even the small middle class, that forced Mr. Jonathan to back down most of the way.“Even though most fuel subsidies go to the nonpoor, the fraction of their income that goes to fuel is much greater,” said Shanta Devarajan, the World Bank’s chief economist for Africa. “That’s why they feel the elimination of subsidies much more.”On Monday in Lagos, the government appeared to be anticipating trouble, with army checkpoints on major roads, which were uncharacteristically deserted because of the strike.In the end the day was calm, though a feeling of anger at the unions for calling off the strike, and at the government for not restoring the full subsidy, permeated Mr. Kuti’s hangarlike nightclub.The protest movement here, though brief, came to encompass frustrations broader than the sudden rise in fuel prices, and some of the young men milling about on Monday wore “Occupy Nigeria” T-shirts.The protesters made it clear that the fuel subsidy removal — abrupt and unaccompanied by any palliative measures — was seen as one more act of insensitivity by a government they criticized for favoring the wealthy.“We are the people, but they are not listening to us,” said Tayo Sola, an unemployed university graduate. “So what is the meaning of democracy? You are not ready to listen. So how can you govern?”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','A new study has found that among immigrants, younger age at the time of migration predicts a higher incidence of psychotic disorders.The study, published last month in The American Journal of Psychiatry, was conducted from 1997 to 2005 in The Hague, Netherlands, where there are detailed records on almost everyone who has sought care for a possible psychotic disorder. The researchers found 273 immigrants, 119 second-generation citizens and 226 Dutch citizens who fit the criteria.In four groups — people from Suriname, the Netherlands Antilles, Turkey and Morocco — the risk of psychosis was highest among those who immigrated before age 4. There was no association of psychosis with age among Western immigrants.The researchers, led by Dr. Wim Veling of the Parnassia Psychiatric Institute, investigated various possible explanations — that social factors are involved, that people migrate because they are prone to psychosis, and that a decision to migrate is influenced by early appearance of psychosis, among others. But the correlation persisted.“We don’t know the reason,” said Dr. Ezra Susser, the senior author and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University, “but it might be related to early social context, which we know has an important influence on later health and mental health.”'"
"'12-01-17,'1','Too much vitamin D may be just as bad as too little, a recent study suggests.Vitamin D supplements reduce blood levels of C-reactive protein, or CRP, an indicator of inflammation that is linked to cardiovascular disease. But supplements help only up to a point.In a study of more than 15,000 adults ages 18 to 85, researchers at Johns Hopkins University found that after blood levels exceeded 21 nanograms per milliliter — the lower end of what is usually considered normal — any additional vitamin D led to an increase in CRP.The association held after the researchers accounted for the effects of factors like obesity, smoking, cholesterol and high blood pressure. There was also a dose-response relationship: Above 21 units, each 10-unit increase in vitamin D was accompanied by an increase of 0.06 milligrams per deciliter in CRP.“Vitamin D is good to a certain level,” said the lead author, Dr. Muhammad Amer, an assistant professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins. “But don’t just keep on taking it. Have your blood drawn and your levels checked.”Previous studies of vitamin D supplementation have produced inconsistent results, with some trials showing a decrease in inflammatory markers and others showing no effect. The finding that the benefit is apparent only at lower levels of vitamin D, the authors write, may help explain these conflicting findings.The study was published online in The American Journal of Cardiology.'"

The court ordered the trial judge to rule by Feb. 3 on claims that the Congressional districts violated the State Constitution because they were not drawn compactly. The ruling invalidating the State Senate districts said a plan submitted by a special panel of judges violated the State Constitution by dividing Jackson and Greene Counties into too many districts. That redistricting process must over again, with Gov. Jay Nixon appointing a new bipartisan citizens’ commission to draw the boundaries. Missouri is dropping from nine House seats to eight this year, and the Republican-controlled Legislature enacted its Congressional redistricting map last year after overriding a veto by Mr. Nixon, a Democrat.'"
"'12-01-18,'1','On Tuesday, Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware commuted the death sentence of Robert Gattis to life without parole. In doing so, he said he gave “great weight” to the careful decision of the state board of pardons to recommend that the sentence be commuted, the first such recommendation the board has made since the death penalty was reinstated there in 1974. As a condition of the commutation, which is supported by a long list of former judges and prosecutors, Mr. Gattis is expected to waive all legal challenges and live out his life in prison.Mr. Gattis killed his girlfriend in 1990 after an angry quarrel. The pardons board wrote that before the murder, “Mr. Gattis complained to medical professionals of mental illness and involuntary violent impulses” from the extreme and continuous sexual abuse he suffered as a child. The governor called this background “among the most troubling I have encountered.” Mr. Gattis’s lawyers failed to submit much of the ample proof about his mental illness and its devastating effects. The board was able to take full account of that mitigating factor.Even though state law does not require a unanimous jury vote on death, four members of the pardons board were troubled by the jury’s 10-to-2 split on the penalty because they believe such verdicts should be unanimous.Some board members also noted the great disparity in sentences among serious murder cases. The difference in penalties for other murders in domestic disputes and Mr. Gattis’s sentence “offends a moral sense of proportionality,” the board said in its recommendation.For one board member, the rationale for life without parole is more basic. “When the taking of life is not required as a matter of self-defense,” he explained, “one cannot ethically or morally take that act.” Commuting Mr. Gattis’s sentence meets the imperative of justice. Imposing the death penalty in his case, as in any case, would have been grossly unjust.'"

Clyburn of South Carolina, who likened the approach on Tuesday to a modern version of the Republican “Southern strategy” to win over disaffected white voters in the South when the Democrats embraced the civil rights movement.“It tends to equate the president of the with dependency, with a lack of status, or tends to try to lower the president,” Mr. Clyburn said in an interview. “And I believe it’s another way to separate his presidency from the presidencies of all the others before him.”Yet Mr. Gingrich spoke for many Republicans who have publicly worried that Mr. Obama’s supporters will unfairly cast necessary policy arguments in terms of race. As Mr. Gingrich said in the debate, “I know among the politically correct, you’re not supposed to use facts that are uncomfortable.”In an interview, Mr. Williams said he questioned Mr. Gingrich about his “food stamp president” comments and his suggestions that poor children lacked a work ethic and should be put to work as janitors because he found the remarks to be “racially charged.”“That’s more than a dog whistle,” Mr. Williams said. “It’s a hoot and a holler.”Mr. Williams added, “I think there is a real issue here for Republicans.”Mr. Gingrich drew a standing ovation when he responded that a historically high number of Americans were on food stamps under Mr. Obama, and defiantly declared, “I believe every American of every background has been endowed by their creator with the right to pursue happiness, and if that makes liberals unhappy, I’m going to continue to find ways to help poor people learn how to get a job, learn how to get a better job and learn someday to own the job.”Mr. Gingrich is correct that food stamp program participation is at record levels but he ignores the depth of the inherited by Mr. Obama when he took office.Some Republicans here, while not necessarily embracing Mr. Gingrich’s language, said his reception at the debate showed that voters were ready to have a substantive discussion about minorities and entitlement programs without getting tied up in the enduring legacy of racial injustice.“If anything, they’re the ones who are race baiting,” said Glenn McCall, the South Carolina committeeman to the , who is African-American, speaking of liberals. Noting that the economic hardship is disproportionately falling upon “people of color — my people,” he said, “I wish they would hold the president’s feet to the fire in the black caucus to do more — not through handouts but in ways that lift people up.”Former Gov. , a Democrat, said it was an old-fashioned debate that will not engage voters. “Years ago you would hear those sorts of discussions, but I’ve got to say that was a long time ago,” Mr. Hodges said. “If we’ve seen anything from recent history it is that voters — whether Republican or Democratic voters in our state — want to hear about how we’re going to make their lives better.”'"
"'12-01-18,'1','“It is something that has to be considered in the light of expectations about the degree of the participation to be achieved,” Mr. Papademos said. “It cannot be excluded. It is contingent on the percentage.”The prime minister is a former vice president of the , a nonpolitician brought in to lead an interim government with a mandate to secure new bailout funding as part of a new agreement.His comments came after talks broke down last week between Greece and its creditors over the terms of a “voluntary” default, in which the private bondholders will agree to a 50 percent reduction or more in the value of their holdings. The so-called troika — comprising the European Central Bank, the and the — has demanded such a deal as a condition to extending more aid.Many private investors, like hedge funds, pension funds and , would just as soon see an involuntary default, because much of their holdings are insured through .But European leaders are dead set against such a “ event,” which could ignite a chain reaction with unpredictable and potentially catastrophic results for the world financial system.However, the prime minister said he expected the talks to be completed successfully. “The talks are not straightforward, because they aim at a voluntary restructuring of public debt, and to achieve a number of objectives simultaneously, objectives that involve trade-offs,” Mr. Papademos said. “Taking into account the complexity of the exercise, I would say that we are very close to reaching an agreement.”There is a growing sense in that a Greek default cannot be avoided, if not now then perhaps in March, when a bond comes due that the country cannot pay without more financing from the troika. “I am aware of that,” Mr. Papademos said, adding that he thought the new financing would be approved. “I think the facts reveal that the European partners have taken extraordinary measures to help Greece address its problems.”In conversation Mr. Papademos, who lived in and served as a vice president of the European Central Bank from 2002 until his in 2010, is a true technocrat — quiet, polite, measured, rational. Unlike his technocratic counterpart, Prime Minister of , who has acute political instincts and appears to thrive in the Italian political circus, Mr. Papademos is clearly ill at ease with the thrust and parry of political life.He has not yet held a news conference in Greece, and was taken aback by a reporter’s questions about how the crisis had affected his friends and family or where he kept his personal savings.“I have moved absolutely nothing out of Greece,” he said.He bristled at the suggestion that he was out of touch. “I am fully aware of the adjustments that are needed and of the sacrifices being made by the people. You don’t only have to look at the numbers, the fact that the unemployment rate is 18 percent. You can walk in the city and see.”He asked Greeks to put their sacrifices in perspective. If all goes well, he said, they could expect “an end to austerity” next year. He added that the tough measures were aimed at ensuring Greek wage stability in the future, including for low-income wage earners.Mr. Papademos has not gotten a lot of help from his own government, which so far has failed to pass or carry out legislation required by the troika in exchange for more financing. But experts say that Mr. Papademos is doing his best considering the situation he inherited.“I’m not suggesting there has been a revolution, but I think there’s a slow change,” said Loukas Tsoukalis, the president of the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy, an Athens research institute. “Greece is showing enormous difficulty and reluctance in going ahead with reforms, and very often reluctance in implementing what has already been passed — but it is moving slowly.”But timing is everything. Mr. Papademos said his mandate was to secure a new bailout and new loan agreement, not to solve all of Greece’s problems, and that his government would be short-lived.“I would say the baseline scenario is for elections to be held sometime in April,” he said.Until then, he added: “I am confident that we can overcome this crisis, provided that we remain united in our effort to address our debt and competitiveness problems. And I think that the Greek people are united; it’s important also that the political forces are united in line with the will of the Greek people.”'"
"'12-01-18,'1','Interviewed by phone and e-mail, Mr. Connerly, 72, acknowledged that his group had had financial difficulties, but said its board had not responded to the letter because “90 percent” of it was false. He portrayed Ms. Gratz as a “disgruntled former employee” trying to “besmirch me personally” because she wanted to replace him.The letter was written by Ms. Gratz’s lawyer, Robert N. Driscoll, a former deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights in the administration of George W. Bush. In a statement, through him, she said: “I thought it was important to make sure all board members were aware of what was going on even if doing so was unfortunate, sad and uncomfortable and even though it meant that I had to resign from a position within a cause that I will always hold near and dear.”“I’m sorry to hear this because I’m a great admirer of both of them,” said Roger Clegg, the president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, which also opposes affirmative action. “She is a courageous, smart person — and Ward is also a courageous, smart person.”A businessman and a former University of California regent, Mr. Connerly rose to fame in 1996 as the backer of a successful ballot initiative barring public institutions in California from taking race or gender into account. He later founded the institute and a related advocacy group and continued to call for “colorblind government” in matters like contracting and college admissions.Ms. Gratz’s letter alleges a series of financial irregularities, starting with Mr. Connerly’s pay.Late last summer, the institute belatedly filed disclosure forms for tax years ending in June 2008, 2009, and 2010. (The I.R.S. that summer had revoked the tax-exempt status of its related advocacy group for failing to file such forms.) They showed that his annual pay was between $1.2 million and $1.5 million each year — more than half its revenue.Because charitable donations are tax deductible, according to I.R.S. rules no employee may get excessive compensation. Two other nonprofit groups opposing affirmative action, the Center for Equal Opportunity and the Center for Individual Rights, pay their leaders about $144,000 and $250,000, respectively.Mr. Connerly said that “every penny which I receive is directly related to our mission,” and that he used some of his salary to pay others for research and legal work. He also said the group had reduced his pay to $850,000.One reason Mr. Connerly has been a particularly effective advocate is that he is black. Mr. Clegg said there were “few people who can do or would do what he does,” adding that it is hard to set a salary on a job that requires enduring racially charged name-calling from fellow blacks.A major financial supporter is the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation. Its president, Michael W. Grebe, said he was “very comfortable” that its donations to Mr. Connerly’s group were “being spent for public education programs.”Ms. Gratz’s letter contends that the group has been “in financial crisis since March 2010” in part because of Mr. Connerly’s salary and legal fees related to the tax investigations, and has “ceased almost entirely” doing projects furthering its mission since June 2011.Her letter also says the group has had trouble making payroll and “knowingly” under-reported what it paid employees on payroll tax forms — “irregularities” that “partly result from disruptions in revenue” but that “also appear to be designed to facilitate Mr. Connerly’s high salary.”Mr. Connerly denied such allegations as “speculation and conjecture,” saying Ms. Gratz was not privy to administrative details. He also said educational activities by him and his group were “instrumental” in passing an anti-affirmative action initiative in Arizona in November 2010, and in laying the groundwork for a vote on a similar measure in Oklahoma set for fall 2012.Ms. Gratz’s letter said five of the group’s eight employees “are family members” or have “personal or nonprofessional relationships with Mr. Connerly,” and raised questions about its “contracts for services and leases.”For example, the letter said, the group contracted with a former longtime employee of Mr. Connerly’s profit-making firm to create a report on Oklahoma, for up to 120 hours at $60 an hour; it “consisted mainly of printouts from Wikipedia.”While the letter did not explain its reference to “leases,” the group’s recent tax filings show that its rent tripled, to just under $70,000, after it moved to a different building about four years ago. Records show a group employee purchased the building in February 2008 for about $444,000.Mr. Connerly said hiring people he knew was appropriate, given his group’s “controversial” mission. He also said he had instructed the employee to find new offices because they needed more room, and he approved the arrangement she had made.Despite his salary, Mr. Connerly acknowledged that he had had financial difficulties; public records show that in 2010 and 2011, several hundred thousand dollars in liens for unpaid taxes were leveled against him. He said he was working on paying what he owed. In addition, a disclosure form filed with the IRS says the institute discovered last year that Mr. Connerly had submitted “unsubstantiated” business expenses from his credit card and cellphone bills. He had paid back $10,000 as of September, but still owed about $24,000.Ms. Gratz was once Mr. Connerly’s defender. In 2008, when anti-affirmative action initiatives were on the ballot in Colorado and Nebraska, a liberal group ran ads portraying him as supporting such measures so he could pocket “nonprofit slush funds.”Ms. Gratz made a video denouncing the ads as character assassination. But, her letter said, she subsequently realized that Mr. Connerly’s group had “not been adequate stewards of the resources the donors entrusted to the organization,” adding that she “will cooperate with any government investigation.”'"
"'12-01-18,'1','Jim Caldwell was Peyton Manning’s quarterbacks coach for seven years before he became the head coach of the Indianapolis Colts two years ago and promptly led the team to the Super Bowl.But the Colts collapsed this season playing without Manning, who was out with a neck injury, and when next season starts, he may no longer be with the team. Caldwell is already gone. He was fired Tuesday as part of a shakeup that had already cost Bill and Chris Polian their jobs as the team’s top front-office executives.The new general manager, Ryan Grigson, indicated Tuesday that the Colts were a long way from making a decision about whether Manning would return. The Colts are expected to use the first overall pick in the spring draft, which they earned by going 2-14, on Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck. But Grigson said the team still needed significant medical information about Manning’s recovery from his third neck operation before making a decision about his future.“We’re not even there yet,” Grigson said.Even if Manning returns, the Colts will be a much different franchise. The decision to fire Caldwell was not unexpected. Fans clamored for his removal for at least the second half of the season, and it is unusual for a team not to allow a new general manager to hire his own coach. Caldwell won his first 14 games as coach, but the Colts lost the Super Bowl after the 2009 season to the New Orleans Saints.In 2010, they overcame an avalanche of injuries to make the playoffs, an effort the team’s owner, Jim Irsay, felt Caldwell had not gotten enough credit for. But without Manning, the Colts began 2011 with 13 straight losses.Grigson was hired last week, and Irsay wanted to give him time to evaluate Caldwell. Grigson said he spent seven hours with Caldwell and called him “a class act, period.”'"
"'12-01-18,'1','Meredith’s interest in my condition is not, of course, limited to her work as a writer. After the manic episode landed me in the Johns Hopkins hospital years ago, Meredith stayed with me at home for a week to help me get back to the regular simplicity of sleeping and waking. One of the first things they tell you about the condition is that sleep really is the “chief nourisher in life’s feast,” as Macbeth put it. I have a mild case, so sleep, and lithium under the care of a doctor, have helped me stay healthy ever since.My sister knows my back pages well, and while writing the script, she asked me about that spell of several sunny October days. Dormant memories awakened: I was a reporter for The Baltimore Sun, and I was filing stories in the newsroom faster than ever before. It’s strangely fitting that I worked in journalism, which at its best also has its share of frenetic late nights, deadlines and homing in on people. As a reporter at The Sun once said to me, “This is a manic-depressive business.”Didn’t I know it. A “hypomanic” state, which precedes an episode of mania, is in fact an enhanced, alert, productive mood where one can feel exhilarated and immune to life’s dangers. I seemed to see into people’s hearts when I smiled at them. My speech sped up so much few could understand me.I ran around Baltimore’s Inner Harbor at high speed, exulting in all my energy. For several days, I woke up at dawn to see the sunrise and take pictures of it. I felt sure something big was going to happen soon in Baltimore and only I could foresee it.Similarly, a haunted Carrie is convinced that a big terrorist attack is looming large. Her furious focus on her quarry under time pressure leads to sleepless nights and reckless risks, behavior that is both symptom and contributing cause of bipolar illness. Her elevated mood cycles higher and higher, and she falls rapturously in love with the married Marine who she thinks is working for Al Qaeda, played with minute precision by Damian Lewis. Viewers can’t totally dismiss her visions — but then again, she’s not rational. In the hospital ward, she demands a green pen to write everything down, her voice racing faster and faster. Meredith had bottled my mercurial emotions so exactly it hurt.Bipolar extremes can be truly hard to watch, excruciating even in memory. To see that experience depicted so intensely by Ms. Danes was like peering at a portrait gallery of my own psyche.As I recovered, I found comfort in company. My colleagues could not have been more gracious. But at the end of the show’s first season (spoiler alert), poor Carrie has lost her job and appears left in a lonely place, about to undergo electroconvulsive therapy.However, contrary to widespread belief, electroconvulsive therapy is extremely effective. A family friend, Dr. Leon Rosenberg, a geneticist and former dean of Yale Medical School, has the same malady. As a patient overwhelmed by suicidal depression, he made remarkable progress after electroconvulsive therapy. As a doctor, he described his own case in a medical journal and discusses his descent and recovery with students.Yes, the show cuts close to home at points, but it gets the lead character’s story right. How rare to see a sparkling and spirited representation of what it’s actually like to walk through life with bipolar disorder. So let a thousand conversations bloom. Secrets held up to light and air lose their power in the public square. Spies know it as keepers, and writers know it as tellers.'"

"'12-01-18,'1','Of the $11.8 billion in commercial loans in Manhattan that were classified as troubled since 2008, just $3.4 billion, or 29 percent, remains in distress, said Ben Carlos Thypin, the director of market analysis for Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm. About $3.5 billion in loans — covering 14 buildings, including 666 Fifth Avenue, 3 Columbus Circle and 280 Park Avenue — have been restructured.Borrowers who default are in a much better position today than they would have been in the last downturn, when regulators forced banks to take their losses and swiftly dispose of their troubled loans, said Alexander Goldfarb, a managing director at the brokerage firm Sandler O’Neill. During the last cycle, loans for large office buildings were packaged into securities and sold on Wall Street. Now, the bondholders have a strong incentive to modify their loan terms, often with existing borrowers.“In the early ’90s, people knew that real estate was going to be purged at so many cents on the dollar,” Mr. Goldfarb said. “This time around, the borrowers know the regulators and the government are on their side, so they can put up a substantial fight.” In states like New York, a foreclosure risks being tied up in the courts for years.In the recent restructuring of 666 Fifth Avenue, Kushner and Vornado promised not to contest a foreclosure in the event of another default.“The good news about our capital structure is that the loan is in place till 2019, and we have over $100 million that we can spend,” said Jared Kushner, the 31-year-old chief executive of Kushner. “We’ve put ourselves in a position where we can be competitive to attract tenants.”In the near term, office tenants may not be easy to find. Brokers say large financial institutions are reluctant to make long-term commitments right now because of uncertainty over the European debt crisis and the lingering economic downturn. “We’re in a period of anxiety,” said Mitchell S. Steir, chief executive of Studley, a brokerage firm that represents tenants.Though 666 Fifth Avenue has some of the most lucrative retail space in the world, the restructuring applies only to the office building. In 2008, Kushner sold a 49 percent stake for $525 million in the building’s retail space — which became a separate condo — to the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, and Crown Acquisitions. Some of the proceeds were used to pay off Kushner’s $355 million mezzanine loan, thereby enabling the company to hold on to the building.“It was a very savvy move,” said Howard L. Michaels, the chairman of Carlton Advisory Services and the adviser on the retail sale. In 2010, the Japanese retailer Uniqlo agreed to open a flagship store at 666 Fifth for an eye-popping rent of $20 million a year.Last year, the partners in the retail space sold one piece of it to the retailer Zara for $324 million, or $8,300 a square foot. Some of those proceeds were used to pay down a separate mortgage they had obtained for the retail condo.But while the value of the retail space was soaring, the office tower was losing tenants because of its precarious financial situation. Attempts to get the loan restructured began well before the loan was transferred to the special servicer, said Mr. Kushner, who is also the publisher of The New York Observer. He has been the public face of Kushner Companies, since his father, Charles, was released from federal prison in 2006 after pleading guilty to witness tampering and other charges.The lengthy restructuring process may have worked to Kushner’s advantage. “The deal they cut now is probably better than the deal they could have cut two years ago,” said Manus Clancy, the senior managing director of Trepp, another New York research company.Under its terms, the existing $1.215 billion office loan was divided into two pieces — a senior loan of $1.1 billion, representing the current value of the building at $835 a square foot, and a subordinate loan for $115 million. These subordinate loans are called “hope” notes since they may never be repaid.Vornado, which received a 49.5 percent interest in the building, and Kushner agreed to invest $110 million to provide incentives for tenants, pay brokers’ commissions and refurbish obsolete space. Kushner’s $30 million share will come from a modified “air and light” agreement pertaining to a planned hotel for 53rd Street; the hotel’s developers will no longer be blocked from using their own air rights to build extra stories on 53rd Street.In exchange for putting fresh cash into 666 Fifth Avenue, Vornado and Kushner will have the right to recoup this money (with interest, in Vornado’s case) before the subordinate loan is repaid. “By all appearances, it seems like a fantastic deal for Vornado,” said Robert M. White Jr., the chief executive of Real Capital Analytics.Vornado has taken an ownership stake in several troubled Manhattan properties. But the 666 Fifth deal raised some eyebrows because Vornado is also a part-owner of the special servicer on the loan, LNR Partners of Miami Beach. Vornado did not respond to a request for an interview.Kushner was advised by Robert Verrone, who was known as Large Loan Verrone at Wachovia Bank because he financed such large deals as the $5.4 billion purchase of Stuyvesant Town-Peter Cooper Village, the giant housing complex in Manhattan. Mr. Verrone has a new business, Iron Hound Management, and has done $5.5 billion worth of recapitalization and restructuring deals, he said.Though the 666 Fifth bondholders are worse off now, because the principal is smaller and some interest payments will not be made, they too benefitted from the restructuring, said Frank Innaurato, a managing director at Morningstar. “This mitigates the longer-term loss potential for the deal,” he said. “The lenders are not losing as much as they could have.”'"
"'12-01-18,'1','The residency program at the Here Arts Center in the South Village encourages composers, choreographers, playwrights, video artists and even puppeteers to get into one another’s business and to create freewheeling hybrids. It is an ideal home for a musician like Kamala Sankaram.As a singer Ms. Sankaram is remarkably flexible: she seems as completely at home in a soaring operatic style as she does in the music of Philip Glass, Phil Kline, John Zorn and Anthony Braxton. And as a composer she has an ear for so many styles — and the magpie instincts to draw on them all — that her music seems tailor-made for Here’s genre-disdaining audience.Ms. Sankaram’s new opera, “Miranda,” which is running at Here through Saturday (I caught the Monday evening performance), is a mash-up of so many elements, popular and classical, that you are bound to miss a few on a single hearing. For starters, it’s a murder mystery that satirizes the justice system, reality TV and the glamour industry. Nick Francone’s sets, Jacci Jaye’s costumes and Matt Tennie’s video couch the production in partly retro, partly futuristic steampunk style (a science-fiction conceit that proposes a universe in which modern technologies were invented during the era of steam power).Ms. Sankaram’s score embraces electronica, beefy 1950s pop riffs, Baroque string figuration, lush Romantic texturing, Hindustani classical music, R&B vocals, tango and direct quotations from rock songs. (The halting chord progression of Led Zeppelin’s “Kashmir” is prominent at the start and end of the work, and Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust” makes a cameo.) And the choreography, by Lauren Yalango and Christopher Grant, mashes up elegant classical touches, 1960s dance-floor moves and unclassifiably stylized gestures.Yet for all that, “Miranda” is strikingly original, mainly because its principal vocal lines, which Ms. Sankaram sings in the title role, are inventively shaped, full of character and emotionally direct and authentic. That is as it should be: though the work is comic on its surface it is woven around the murder of Miranda Wright, a diet-pill heiress, and a trial that is meant to determine whether her killer was her fiancé, Cor Prater; her father, Izzy Wright; or her mother, Anjana Challapattee Wright. In her arias Miranda sorts out her fraught relationships with them all.Granted, the courtroom is a game show (“The Whole Truth”), presided over by D.A.V.E., a digital judge, with an M.C. as the bailiff and the audience as the jury. Not that the audience members’ (very mixed) response, when asked for their verdict, has any effect: the libretto, which Ms. Sankaram wrote with the show’s director, Rob Reese, is not interactive.'"
"'12-01-18,'1','In a report released last month, an investigative panel appointed by Olympus, which makes digital cameras and the medical optical devices like endoscopes, had been critical of the auditors’ role, saying the firms had not done enough to expose wrongdoing.But a separate panel of lawyers hired by Olympus to investigate the roles of the two auditors found that the firms had not violated their fiduciary duties, Olympus said in a statement. That report, released Tuesday, said that Olympus’s executives had so cleverly buried the losses that external auditors could not have uncovered them.The report instead blamed five former and current Olympus internal auditors for allowing the company to misstate its finances. The five internal auditors are responsible for a total of 8.4 billion yen ($109 million) in costs related to the cover-up, Olympus said.Minoru Ota, a former internal auditor who had headed the company’s accounting unit, is to blame for almost half of that cost, the statement said.“The masterminds in this case hid their illegal acts through artful manipulation of expert opinion,” the report said.Olympus did not make Mr. Ota available for comment, and calls to a registered number under that name in Tokyo went unanswered.The company said later Tuesday that it had filed a lawsuit against all five of the internal auditors, demanding 500 million yen from each.Olympus has admitted that a handful of former and current executives set up a scheme to obscure losses by illicitly keeping unprofitable assets off its books. The company later tried to settle those losses in payments masked as merger-and-acquisition fees.Last week, the company sued 19 current and former executives, including the current president, Shuichi Takayama, over their roles in concealing the losses. The scandal has led to investigations by the authorities on three continents, and Olympus shares remain on watch for possible delisting on the Tokyo exchange.But a person with close knowledge of various investigations relating to Olympus said that not only was Olympus adept at hiding its losses, but that the company might have received help from its banks misstate its financial position.KPMG received confirmation statements from Société Générale and Commerzbank that, with hindsight, were clearly misleading, the person said on condition of anonymity, saying he was not authorized to speak to the media.Those inaccurate statements have been submitted by KPMG to Japanese regulators to aid in their inquiry, and the authorities have begun a broader review that is likely to include the conduct of Olympus’s banks, the person said.“Société Générale’s policy is to fully and strictly comply with all regulations and laws in the countries where it operates,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement. “As always, Société Générale will cooperate with the relevant authorities if needed.” Commerzbank did not respond to calls seeking comment. Olympus’s third European bank, LGT of Liechtenstein, has not been linked to misleading statements.'"

"'12-01-19,'1','In each case, News Group also agreed to pay the complainant’s legal costs, any of which could easily have run into six figures. One complainant, speaking on the condition on anonymity, said that his came to more than $300,000 — an amount that does not include News International’s fees.But perhaps more damaging to the company than the financial penalties was a statement from lawyers for the hacking victims.“News Group has agreed to compensation being assessed on the basis that senior employees and directors of N.G.N. knew about the wrongdoing and sought to conceal it by deliberately deceiving investigators and destroying evidence,” the statement said, referring to News Group Newspapers.The lawyers also said they had obtained, through nine disclosure orders from the court, “documents relating to the nature and scale of the conspiracy, a cover-up and the destruction of evidence/e-mail archives by News Group.”In a statement, News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch’s global empire and the parent company of News Group, said it had “made no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by N.G.N. or sought to conceal it.” It added, “However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, N.G.N. agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case.”Lawyers said, however, that it was unlikely that the company would have agreed to calculate settlements on the basis that there was a cover-up if there were in fact no cover-up.Until the end of 2010, News International denied that The News of the World engaged in any phone hacking and vehemently vowed to fight any legal claims. After that, it admitted that some of its reporters and editors knew about the hacking. Now it has acknowledged that hacking was pervasive, and with hundreds of potential victims still left to deal with, it recently set up a Web page where people who believe their phones were hacked can file claims electronically.More than 20 people have been arrested on suspicion of phone hacking or illegally paying the police for information. No criminal charges have been filed yet.Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said in a statement that the latest disclosures represented “a devastating indictment not only of the corrupt journalistic practices at The News of the World but of the calculated cover-up which apparently followed.”The cases also extended beyond the one newspaper. Mr. Law said he had been hacked not only by The News of the World but also by , another Murdoch tabloid.The hearing took on an almost ritualistic tone as each victim’s statement, its wording carefully vetted and approved by News Group, was read out to the court. Each reading was immediately followed by Mr. Silverleaf’s confirmation of the victim’s account and a statement that the company acknowledged “that the information should never have been obtained or used in this manner.”News Group also admitted outright for the first time that it had hacked into an e-mail account in pursuit of a story. Mr. Silverleaf confirmed the account of Christopher Shipman, the son of a notorious British serial killer, that The News of the World had “unlawfully obtained the confidential access to details to the claimant’s e-mail account, including his password, and had accessed his in-box.”The victims’ statements had similar narrative arcs. At some point in the early or mid-2000’s, most said, they had become suspicious about personal information that was appearing in The News of the World. Some said they experienced odd problems with their voice mail, like being unable to gain access to it because it was busy.Then, the victims said, they were shown evidence by the police of what The News of the World had done. Mr. Law’s statement said the police had played him messages he had left for his children’s nanny five years earlier.The statements detail the victims’ distress and confusion. “Although the articles would often only contain a small piece of accurate information,” said Mark Thomson, the lawyer for Ms. Frost, Mr. Law’s ex-wife, it was enough for Ms. Frost “to suspect everyone close to her and for the claimant and Mr. Law to suspect each other.”, the private investigator who worked for The News of the World, was News Group’s co-defendant in the lawsuits. But his lawyer said Mr. Mulcaire, who was jailed for phone hacking in 2007 and faces new criminal charges, had not admitted to wrongdoing.Even for some of those who had settled, the matter was not over. “This is still only Act Four, Scene Four, of a five-act play,” said Chris Bryant, a member of Parliament, who was awarded about $46,000 after his phone was hacked.Tamsin Allen, a lawyer representing a number of the victims, said that it was their perseverance, even when News Group was aggressively denying that it had ever hacked anyone, that had led to the settlement.“It is a to them, the claimants, that they kept on,” she said, “because we have now discovered a massive conspiracy involving criminal activity and a cover-up.”'"
"'12-01-19,'1','According to one senior government official involved in the negotiations, Greece will present an offer to creditors this week that includes an interest rate or coupon on new bonds received in exchange for the old bonds that is less than the 4 percent private creditors have been pushing for — and they will be forced to accept it whether they like it or not.“This is crunch time for us. The time for niceties has expired,” said the person, who was not authorized to talk publicly. “These guys will have to accept everything.”The surprise collapse last week of the talks in raised the prospect that Greece might not receive a crucial 30 billion euro payment and might miss a make-or-break 14.5 billion euro bond payment on March 20 — throwing the country into default and jeopardizing its membership in the .Talks between the two sides picked back up on Wednesday evening in Athens when Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance, who represents private sector bondholders, met with Prime Minister of Greece and his deputies.While both sides have tried to adopt a conciliatory tone, the threat of a disorderly default and the spread of contagion to other vulnerable countries like remains pronounced.“In my opinion, it is unlikely that this is the last restructuring we go through in Europe,” said Hans Humes, a veteran of numerous debt restructurings and the president and chief executive of Greylock Capital, the only hedge fund on the private sector steering committee, which is taking the lead in the Greek negotiations.“The private sector has come a long way. We hope that the other parties agree that it is more constructive to reach a voluntary agreement than the alternative.”At the root of the dispute is a growing insistence on the part of and the that as Greece’s economy continues to collapse, its debt — now about 140 percent of its gross domestic product — needs to be reduced as rapidly as possible.Those two powerful actors — which control the purse strings for current and future Greek bailouts — have pressured Greece to adopt a more aggressive tone toward its creditors. As a result, Greece has demanded that bondholders accept not only a 50 percent loss on their new bonds but also a lower interest rate on them. That is a tough pill for investors to swallow, given the already steep losses they face, and one that would be likely to increase the cumulative haircut to between 60 and 70 percent.The lower interest rate would help Greece by reducing the punitive amounts of interest it pays on its debt, making it easier to cut its budget deficit.To increase Greece’s leverage, the country’s negotiators have said they could attach collective action clauses to the outstanding bonds, a step that would give them the legal right to saddle all bondholders with a loss. This would particularly be aimed at the so-called free riders — speculators who have said they will not agree to a haircut and are betting that when Greece receives its aid bundle in March, their bonds will be repaid in full.If the collective action clause is used — and Greek officials say it could become law next week — these investors, who bought their bonds at around 40 cents on the dollar, are likely to suffer a loss.That, in turn, could prompt suits from investors claiming in the Court of Human Rights that their property rights had been violated.“Because Greece is changing the bond contract retroactively, this can become an issue in a human rights court,” said Mathias Audit, a professor of international law at the University of Ouest.Not all funds are pursuing such a strategy. Such a case would take years and would have to run its course in Greece before being heard by human rights judges in , .But with their considerable financial resources, some funds may be willing to pursue such a route, and they point to similar cases won by hedge funds in Latin America. While the prospect of Greece paying an investor any time soon is slim, the country wants to avoid a parade of lawsuits across Europe, which would restrict its ability to raise money in international markets., which defaulted on its debts in 2002, still faces legal claims from investors that have made it nearly impossible for the country to tap global debt markets.“It cannot be that decides who suffers losses,” said one aggrieved investor who was considering legal action and did not want to be identified for that reason. “What Europe is forgetting is that there needs to be respect for contract rights.”It is not just the legal cudgel that investors are threatening to use. Some hedge funds have discussed among themselves the possibility of demanding a side payment, as they describe it, as a price Europe and Greece must pay if the two want the funds to participate in the agreement.With the stakes so high, a compromise may well be reached. Germany and the I.M.F. may realize that if the private sector is pushed too hard, the deal will collapse and they will have to pay even more money to keep Greece afloat in the coming years.Eager to put the issue behind them, private sector creditors may accept a larger loss and exchange their nearly worthless Greek bonds for more valuable securities that would also offer enhanced protection if Greece had to restructure in the future.As for the holdouts, they could run up millions of dollars in legal bills chasing after Greece in European courts.But beyond all the byzantine wrangling, a crucial question is how this would benefit Greece. Even with the deal, Greece’s debt would be no less than 120 percent of G.D.P. in 2020 — which seems to be slight progress given the austerity and pain its citizens must endure during this period.“The real issue is not who participates in the deal,” said Jeromin Zettelmeyer, the deputy chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and an authority on sovereign debt. “The question is whether there is enough debt relief for Greece, and there may not be, because the fiscal and growth situation in Greece is quite dire.”'"

"'12-01-19,'1','If this was his last game at the Garden as a visiting player, it was some finale.“It’s no secret,” Nash said. “This is the basketball capital of the world. I live here in the summer, I have a lot of friends here, my former coach and teammate play here, so it’s a homecoming in some ways for me and it’s always fun to play here.”He added: “With this condensed season, I put all my focus into preparing to play every day. It’s tough to go to Chicago and get in at 3 or 4 in the morning, and play tonight and to recover. It takes more than a couple cold beers and a nap in the afternoon. So I’m working hard every day just to get right every night and feel fit.”Ever cerebral, Nash dominated the first quarter, sinking five of six shots, then turned distributor. He mixed the rudimentary passes that moved the ball to the open man with a lookaway feed in transition and a pass that zipped past Stoudemire to become the foundation of a 5-point offensive trip late in the first half. Those 5 points gave the Suns a 6-point lead, 43-37.In the second half, Nash’s ability to find spot-up shooters and to push the ball quickly in transition allowed the Suns to fend off the Knicks.“I think you can see,” Suns Coach Alvin Gentry said, “that you watch Steve play, and I don’t see where he’s missed a beat. I think he’s playing as well as he did when he was the M.V.P. of the league. He’s the guy that we count on to do almost everything for us offensively.”Entering the game, Nash was tied for the N.B.A. lead by averaging 10.0 assists and led all guards with five double-doubles. And after making 9 of 12 shots Wednesday, he improved his shooting percentage to a career-high 55.2.“Kobe calls him the best shooter in the league,” Gentry said. “I think if you give him an open shot, the chances are that it’s going to go in. The thing we’d like to see him do is be even more aggressive offensively. His whole thing is he likes to get people involved in the game offensively. You know, when we need him the most though, he’s come through for us a lot of the times.”The question of whether Nash will continue coming through for the Suns for much longer remains to be seen.“In the summer, we’ll deal with free agency,” Nash said. “But at this point I’m a hundred percent committed to the Suns and I’m not looking forward.”The Knicks, who are struggling on offense while waiting for the injured Baron Davis to join the active roster, may be casting covetous glances at Nash. But when Nash kept visiting the foul line late in Wednesday’s game, a hoarse-throated Knicks fan wanted no part of him, yelling, “Anybody but Nash!”'"
"'12-01-19,'1','CHICAGO — David Axelrod, the longtime political strategist for Barack Obama, is already making plans for after the 2012 election, and they do not involve another candidate or another trip to Iowa. Mr. Axelrod says he plans to lead a new, nonpartisan Institute of Politics at the University of Chicago aimed at helping students seeking careers in public and social service.“This is my last campaign,” Mr. Axelrod said, laying out his plans for the Institute of Politics, which is to be formally announced on Thursday at the University of Chicago, from which Mr. Axelrod received his bachelor’s degree in 1976. “My goal now is to help encourage young people who are going to be the David Axelrods — and better — in the future so that we’ll have a new generation of people who will be active in politics and public life.”Officials from the university said the new institute, which Mr. Axelrod likened to similar programs at Harvard University and elsewhere, would bring in fellows each quarter from the world of politics. It will also operate an internship program that will place students in campaigns and public service positions around the nation, and organize lectures about policy and political life. The institute’s announcement itself was expected to come during an early glimpse of one such lecture, a discussion of the 2012 election that is to include Mayor Rahm Emanuel and others.Mr. Axelrod, a former journalist, will serve as the institute’s inaugural director and said it would lean toward a focus on urban politics, in part because of the city around it.The institute, to be financed by the university, will begin operating in earnest early next year, after the presidential race is over. Mr. Axelrod said that he did not intend to spend a great deal of time working on it until then. “I have one more assignment that’s rather important to me,” he said, “and I’m devoting myself to that 100 percent.”'"

"'12-01-19,'1','After waves of layoffs and threatened departures by the plane makers, there is a growing fear that this city, like so many other manufacturing centers, is at risk of losing its identity as one of those American places where people make things and are paid well for it.David Robertson, who has worked at Boeing for 35 of his 54 years, following his father into the business, said he suspected that when the jobs head elsewhere his employer will miss the commitment and expertise built through company clans like his.“What did we talk about at supper?” Mr. Robertson asked. “We talked about planes. You go to a place where people don’t have that history, where people haven’t been doing it for generations, and to them it’s just a job.”This was a fading cow town when a few eyes-to-the-skies businessmen helped transform Wichita into the largest city in Kansas and a major aviation manufacturing hub. Cessna, Beech and Lear are a few whose names still grace planes made here. The city still makes almost half the general aviation airplanes in the world. And Wichita is where goes for a tuneup.Some believe the departure of Boeing will be damaging only symbolically because the company sold off its much larger commercial division here, now called Spirit Aerosystems. But others, worried about an eroding identity and a declining share of the market, ask whether this time is different.“This is not a cyclical thing,” said Bob Brewer, president of the local chapter of the aerospace engineering union. “This isn’t Boeing cycling down. This is Boeing cycling out.”Boeing, which is based in , anchored itself to the community when it took over the local Stearman Aircraft Company in 1929. With a focus on building larger planes for commercial travel and military use, as opposed to the small-plane makers that dominate here, Boeing gained a reputation for generous compensation and opportunities for career growth.Today, a typical airplane worker here earns about $71,000 a year, about 80 percent higher than the average income in the city, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City.A Boeing employee for four decades, Steve Rooney, who runs the local machinists’ union, joined the company just like his father and grandfather. His daughter worked at Boeing as well, until she was laid off several years ago.“How can you tell people, ‘Learn the trade, get involved, there is a future here’?” Mr. Rooney asked. “Is there?” He nodded his head and let the question linger.This scene — a major local airplane maker departing while citing costs — almost played out a year ago. Hawker Beechcraft was on the verge of moving to before the company agreed to take a smaller incentive package to remain for at least a decade, embracing what the company calls “the stay and make it work strategy.”W. W. Boisture Jr., the chairman and chief executive of the company, which cut its local work force by nearly half, said the decision was between “a very attractive economic offer” and “a multigenerational work force that has been committed to this company for decades.” He did not pretend that the decision was easy.Though employment in airplane manufacturing here dropped to 29,000 from 42,000 in 2008 — accounting for more than half the lost jobs during that period — there are some positive signs. , the European rival to Boeing, expanded the office it opened here. Spirit has been increasing production. Last week Aerospace announced it was expanding its Learjet site. But it is Boeing’s departure that dominates the conversation.For residents, the message seemed unequivocal before the $35 billion contract to build aerial refueling tankers was secured. “Tanker Win Would Bring 7,500 Jobs, $388 Million to Kansas,” one Boeing press release declared.But when the company concluded that it was prohibitively expensive to stay in the enormous facility — which includes 97 buildings — executives deflected charges of deceit by saying that the issues had not been anticipated.Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican who is investigating whether the company planned to close the factory even as it assured the jobs were headed here — as union leaders have charged — dismissed the explanation as “incomprehensible.”Mr. Roberts, also a Republican and a part of the Congressional delegation that fought for the contract, called the episode a bitter lesson. “They broke their promise not just to me but to the men and women who have worked for them for 80 years,” he said.A Boeing spokesman, Jarrod Bartlett, said executives would not discuss the departure because, “We’re still trying to work through everything.” The company has emphasized that it spent $3.2 billion with 475 Kansas suppliers last year and that those relationships would be continuing.As shift workers streamed out of aviation factories here last week, Debbie Humble, 46, who has survived her own layoffs over the years, said that even though her job at Spirit felt secure she had been unnerved by the recent developments.“You never thought you’d see Boeing leave,” Ms. Humble said. “They were the biggest thing out here.”'"
"'12-01-19,'1','Republicans voted Wednesday to fine Democratic state representatives $1,000 a day if they stay away from full sessions in a boycott aimed at delaying action on proposed right-to-work legislation. Democrats held a rally in the House rotunda on Wednesday instead of attending the legislative session, leaving it short of the numbers needed to conduct regular business. The House minority leader, B. Patrick Bauer, said Democrats planned to fight the fines in court. Democrats are still fighting fines imposed last year when they left Indiana for five weeks over similar labor issues. Republicans, who hold a 60-to-40 majority in the House and also control the Senate and governor’s office, have proposed legislation to make Indiana the first state in the industrial heartland to adopt a right-to-work law. Under the proposals, workers at union-represented workplaces would not be required to pay union dues. Supporters say the move would attract jobs to Indiana, while opponents call it union-busting.'"
"'12-01-19,'1','Much of the fun in watching Mr. Spacey in this production — which also features Haydn Gwynne as the one character, and performer, who can stand up to him — comes from seeing how far he’s willing to push Richard’s dissembling ways, as he makes nice with (and even makes love to) people of use to him. It’s as if he’s testing how outlandish he can be in feigning piety, patriotism, familial solicitude and courtly love before his onstage audience of dupes catches on.That people seldom do catch on at first only confirms his belief that he’s the smartest guy in the room — a notion that affords him both great glee and, more surprising, great pain. More even than usual you feel that Richard’s humpback (which Mr. Spacey wears like a label flaunter in the latest Prada) has blessed him with an outsider’s perspective, steeped in an acuteness that scalds.After successfully wooing the newly widowed Lady Anne (Annabel Scholey), who well knows Richard has just slain her husband, Mr. Spacey roars out his triumph as much in disgust as delight. “Was ever woman in this humor wooed?” — Richard’s question to the audience — becomes in this version a withering indictment of human frailty, a darker, more fatalistic echo of Puck’s “Lord, what fools these mortals be.”Richard’s relationship with his pigeons could be said to be paralleled by Mr. Spacey’s with his audience. Just how much spicy ham are we willing to digest? This “Richard III” is basically an occasion for a star to practice the fine old art of going over the top in a style that combines high artistry with the primal urge to show off.Mr. Spacey — the artistic director at the Old Vic theater in London, where this production originated — dares to evoke the barnstorming actor-managers of a century ago. And though I’m just as happy that this tradition has died out, it’s a hoot to watch someone of Mr. Spacey’s skill revive it with such blazing brazenness and force of will.Say what you will about his performance, it is consistent in its excesses, shaped by a sustained point of view. I can’t say the same of this production, which is the final offering from Mr. Mendes’s three-year-old Bridge Project, which mixes British and American actors.Designed by Tom Piper (scenery), Catherine Zuber (costumes) and Paul Pyant (lighting), this “Richard” takes place in a chic, 1930s-flavored twilight, as did Richard Eyre’s 1990 production for the National Theater, starring Ian McKellen. (A scene here in which a conference table is turned into a barricade is borrowed directly from Mr. Eyre’s version.) But the show’s visual gimmicks, quotations and steals come from postmodern Shakespeare productions of the past several decades, and they are slapped on like flashy decals on a motorbike.There is both scratchy black-and-white newsreel footage and living-color video simulcasts (of which Mr. Spacey, admittedly, makes amusing use); photo-op hand-shaking moments; scene-announcing projected titles; a drum-beating chorus of ghosts; a banquet of the dead; and an omniscient avenging angel in the form of the mad, old Queen Margaret (Gemma Jones), who here stalks the stage throughout, marking X’s on the multi-doored set as characters die off.Some devices generate immediate theatrical impact, but they don’t cohere into an interpretive pattern. Just as Mr. Spacey’s Richard is eternally restless, afraid he’ll lose his grip on the reins of power, so Mr. Mendes seems afraid of losing the audience’s attention. Given the lackluster supporting cast, this is not a misplaced fear.Chuk Iwuji is fine as a media-savvy Duke of Buckingham in the play’s first half (though he fades into anonymity in the second), and Maureen Anderman is child-warpingly glacial as Richard’s mother, the Duchess of York. But basically the ensemble is only scenery for Mr. Spacey to gnaw upon.The exception is Ms. Gwynne (a Tony nominee for “Billy Elliot”), whose Queen Elizabeth (Richard’s sister-in-law) resembles the severely soignée Wallis Simpson and is a similarly canny operator. In the great climactic showdown between Richard and Elizabeth, in which he tries to persuade her to give him her daughter in marriage, Ms. Haydn and her character hold their own against the raging onslaught that is Mr. Spacey.As Elizabeth parries Richard’s pleas and commands with a wit of steel, Mr. Spacey’s performance reaches new heights of feverishness, which is saying something. You get the feeling that he’s got to wear this woman down, somehow, some way. That the battle ends in a draw is a tribute to Ms. Gwynne’s immense stamina, talent and technique.Trust Mr. Spacey to have the last word, though. This production has arranged it (in ways that I won’t disclose) so that even Richard’s stone-cold corpse is a scene stealer that makes you forget anybody else is onstage.By William Shakespeare; directed by Sam Mendes; sets by Tom Piper; costumes by Catherine Zuber; lighting by Paul Pyant; projection by Jon Driscoll; sound by Gareth Fry; music by Mark Bennett; music coordination and direction by Curtis Moore; fight director, Terry King; artistic associate, Gaye Taylor Upchurch.

"'12-01-19,'1','In a courtyard between two housing complexes in Upper Manhattan, an 8-year-old boy would sometimes steer a line of customers toward an enclosed area called the Pit.There, for $10 a bag, customers would buy crushed mint leaves laced with the hallucinogen PCP, the police said. The spot drew hundreds of customers each day, and some traveled from as far away as Vermont for their inexpensive fix.On Sunday, one of those customers, Hilda Santiago, 38, made a purchase and walked a block away, looking for a place to smoke the leaves with her niece. In the sixth-floor hallway of a nearby apartment building, she accidentally lit herself on fire while getting high — possibly when the aerosol spray in her hair ignited — and burned to death, the authorities said. Her niece, Krystle Ortiz, 26, was slightly burned and was charged with trespassing, the police said.On Wednesday, law enforcement officials announced the indictment of 35 people charged in the drug-dealing enterprise, which they said they had been investigating for 15 months as part of a program called Operation Kings of Dust. Most of the suspects had been arrested by Wednesday, officials said.The crew, based near the Milbank-Frawley public housing complex, sold up to a thousand bags of PCP a day, to hundreds of daily customers from New York City, New Jersey, Long Island and New England. A search warrant turned up two and a half gallons of liquid PCP, stored in Hawaiian Punch bottles.'"
"'12-01-19,'1','For months, it seemed as if Congress would pass an online antipiracy bill, even though its main weapons — cutting off the financing of pirate Web sites and making them harder to find — risk censoring legitimate speech and undermining the security of the Internet. But the unmovable corporations behind those bills have run into an unstoppable force: an outcry by Internet companies led by Google and Wikipedia that culminated in an extraordinary online protest on Wednesday.Lawmakers have begun peeling away from the bills, notably Senators Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who cosponsored the Senate version, and John Cornyn, the powerful Texas conservative. They dropped out after Wikipedia’s English language site went dark and Google put a black bar on its homepage on Wednesday.The Protect I.P. Act would have easily passed the Senate last summer if not for a hold placed by Senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat of Oregon. The Stop Online Piracy Act, introduced in the House in October, has also lost some of its initial backers. And on Saturday, the White House released a statement warning that it would “not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.”Though we are encouraged by legislators’ newfound caution about the potential consequences of the bills, Congress must keep working on ways to curtail the growing business of foreign rogue Web sites trafficking in counterfeit goods and stolen intellectual property.The Internet industry was pitted against some of the best-honed lobbying groups, including Hollywood and the recording studios, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. The industry has made a good case that some of the definitions of wrongdoing — like “facilitating” intellectual property infringement — were overly broad. They said allowing property rights owners to direct payment companies like Visa and ad networks like Google’s to stop doing business with sites they deemed infringing — with no penalties if they were proved wrong— could stymie legitimate online expression.They made the case that the proposal to make infringing Web sites “disappear” from the Internet by forbidding search engines from finding them or redirecting their Web addresses to other Internet domains was easy to get around and could potentially undermine efforts to stop hackers from doing exactly the same thing.'"
"'12-01-19,'1','A newly minted Roman Catholic priest has been removed from his parish in Orange County, N.Y., by church officials for secretly fathering a child while he was attending seminary.The priest, the Rev. Casmir Manyonyi Mung’aho, 34, was ordained in May after graduating from St. Joseph’s Seminary in Yonkers. He had not told his superiors that he had fathered a child in a consensual relationship with an adult woman, “which he certainly should have done,” Bishop Dominick J. Lagonegro, the regional bishop, told parishioners in a statement read at Mass on Jan. 7 and 8.Roman Catholic priests make promises to be celibate, and the church also expects its seminarians and pending applicants to be celibate.“The fact that he is the father of a child was not known to us at the time of his ordination nine months ago,” the bishop said, adding that Father Mung’aho was being removed to “address this matter and reflect upon his responsibilities in a very serious way.”Bishop Lagonegro initially told the parish that church officials believed that the child was born before Father Mung’aho entered St. Joseph’s, but then informed the parish a few days later that officials had just learned that the child was born during his first year of seminary.'"

"'12-01-19,'1','According to one senior government official involved in the negotiations, Greece will present an offer to creditors this week that includes an interest rate or coupon on new bonds received in exchange for the old bonds that is less than the 4 percent private creditors have been pushing for — and they will be forced to accept it whether they like it or not.“This is crunch time for us. The time for niceties has expired,” said the person, who was not authorized to talk publicly. “These guys will have to accept everything.”The surprise collapse last week of the talks in raised the prospect that Greece might not receive a crucial 30 billion euro payment and might miss a make-or-break 14.5 billion euro bond payment on March 20 — throwing the country into default and jeopardizing its membership in the .Talks between the two sides picked back up on Wednesday evening in Athens when Charles Dallara of the Institute of International Finance, who represents private sector bondholders, met with Prime Minister of Greece and his deputies.While both sides have tried to adopt a conciliatory tone, the threat of a disorderly default and the spread of contagion to other vulnerable countries like remains pronounced.“In my opinion, it is unlikely that this is the last restructuring we go through in Europe,” said Hans Humes, a veteran of numerous debt restructurings and the president and chief executive of Greylock Capital, the only hedge fund on the private sector steering committee, which is taking the lead in the Greek negotiations.“The private sector has come a long way. We hope that the other parties agree that it is more constructive to reach a voluntary agreement than the alternative.”At the root of the dispute is a growing insistence on the part of and the that as Greece’s economy continues to collapse, its debt — now about 140 percent of its gross domestic product — needs to be reduced as rapidly as possible.Those two powerful actors — which control the purse strings for current and future Greek bailouts — have pressured Greece to adopt a more aggressive tone toward its creditors. As a result, Greece has demanded that bondholders accept not only a 50 percent loss on their new bonds but also a lower interest rate on them. That is a tough pill for investors to swallow, given the already steep losses they face, and one that would be likely to increase the cumulative haircut to between 60 and 70 percent.The lower interest rate would help Greece by reducing the punitive amounts of interest it pays on its debt, making it easier to cut its budget deficit.To increase Greece’s leverage, the country’s negotiators have said they could attach collective action clauses to the outstanding bonds, a step that would give them the legal right to saddle all bondholders with a loss. This would particularly be aimed at the so-called free riders — speculators who have said they will not agree to a haircut and are betting that when Greece receives its aid bundle in March, their bonds will be repaid in full.If the collective action clause is used — and Greek officials say it could become law next week — these investors, who bought their bonds at around 40 cents on the dollar, are likely to suffer a loss.That, in turn, could prompt suits from investors claiming in the Court of Human Rights that their property rights had been violated.“Because Greece is changing the bond contract retroactively, this can become an issue in a human rights court,” said Mathias Audit, a professor of international law at the University of Ouest.Not all funds are pursuing such a strategy. Such a case would take years and would have to run its course in Greece before being heard by human rights judges in , .But with their considerable financial resources, some funds may be willing to pursue such a route, and they point to similar cases won by hedge funds in Latin America. While the prospect of Greece paying an investor any time soon is slim, the country wants to avoid a parade of lawsuits across Europe, which would restrict its ability to raise money in international markets., which defaulted on its debts in 2002, still faces legal claims from investors that have made it nearly impossible for the country to tap global debt markets.“It cannot be that decides who suffers losses,” said one aggrieved investor who was considering legal action and did not want to be identified for that reason. “What Europe is forgetting is that there needs to be respect for contract rights.”It is not just the legal cudgel that investors are threatening to use. Some hedge funds have discussed among themselves the possibility of demanding a side payment, as they describe it, as a price Europe and Greece must pay if the two want the funds to participate in the agreement.With the stakes so high, a compromise may well be reached. Germany and the I.M.F. may realize that if the private sector is pushed too hard, the deal will collapse and they will have to pay even more money to keep Greece afloat in the coming years.Eager to put the issue behind them, private sector creditors may accept a larger loss and exchange their nearly worthless Greek bonds for more valuable securities that would also offer enhanced protection if Greece had to restructure in the future.As for the holdouts, they could run up millions of dollars in legal bills chasing after Greece in European courts.But beyond all the byzantine wrangling, a crucial question is how this would benefit Greece. Even with the deal, Greece’s debt would be no less than 120 percent of G.D.P. in 2020 — which seems to be slight progress given the austerity and pain its citizens must endure during this period.“The real issue is not who participates in the deal,” said Jeromin Zettelmeyer, the deputy chief economist at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and an authority on sovereign debt. “The question is whether there is enough debt relief for Greece, and there may not be, because the fiscal and growth situation in Greece is quite dire.”'"
"'12-01-19,'1','Yu Jie, a prominent writer of 11 books and a critic of the Chinese Communist Party, said Wednesday in a news conference in Washington that he and his family had left China on Jan. 11 after more than a year of harassment and house arrest. Mr. Yu said his ordeal began Oct. 13, 2010, when he was placed under house arrest after the announcement that his close friend Liu Xiaobo, an imprisoned writer, had won the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize. That December, Mr. Yu said, he was detained for four days and tortured nearly to death. He said security officers criticized him for planning to write a biography of Mr. Liu and for writing “China’s Best Actor: Wen Jiabao,” a scathing critique of the prime minister. Mr. Yu was then kept under house arrest, with a travel ban, until this month.'"
"'12-01-19,'1','There’s a revealing image late in “Grey Matter”: a lingering close-up of wind chimes made from keys and shards of green glass. Shortly before, the glass was part of a bottle, shattered by a young man as a means to slit his own throat. From despair, art.That image has further significance in this acutely probing (if somewhat static and indulgent) film by the Rwandan director Kivu Ruhorahoza. “Grey Matter” is itself a collection of cinematic shards. It begins with Balthazar (Hervé Kimenyi) seeking to raise money to make a movie, but a government agency tells him that the subject is too small and downbeat. We can judge for ourselves; sections of that movie are the center of “Grey Matter.”In that film within the film two siblings grapple with codependency and post-traumatic stress disorder after the 1994 Rwandan genocide. There are no emotional fireworks here, just smoldering, quiet, lonely agony. Ruth Shanel Nirere is especially compelling as the resourceful and tough caretaker sister, Justine. As she hopes, the salvation of her shattered brother, Yvan (Ramadhan Shami Bizimana), is his work as an artist, the eventual wind chimes.In the film’s movement among realities (including the brother’s false reality, with sounds of gunfire and visions of burning bodies) art is also the apparent salvation of the filmmaker Balthazar. In the final scene the camera pulls slowly back from a close-up of a singer to reveal moviemaking apparatus and a crew. A single hand rests on Balthazar’s shoulder, seeming to comfort him as he creates. This subtle moment has a softness, a heart, that lifts the film beyond any narrative tricks.Those in the audience can pull back even further, in their minds, to see a wider view of Yvan, Balthazar and “Grey Matter”: all sorts of shards can seem of a piece when illuminated.'"
"'12-01-19,'1','“It doesn’t mean I need to win a Grand Slam this year, but I want to know at the end of this season that I gave myself 100 percent with everything that I did, whether it was doing boring exercises in the gym or having a tough workout out on court,” she said. “You know there’s going to be matches out there where you’re not feeling good and where you have to mentally battle through and find solutions to win them, and I actually want to have those moments as well and live them fully, be mindful, very mindful.”Clijsters is in a reflective mood these days, speaking often and touchingly of her father, Leo, who died three years ago, and casting a nostalgic eye on Australia, which has embraced her since she was engaged to Lleyton Hewitt years ago. But Clijsters is quick to point out that this is a business trip.“I’m not here because it might be the last time I’m going to be in Melbourne, and I want to go visit the penguins,” she said. “I’m here with my focus on tennis 100 percent.”That seems prudent considering that she has played so little competitive tennis in the last seven months and that her half of the draw includes Li Na, whom she beat in last year’s final here; top-ranked Caroline Wozniacki; No. 3 Victoria Azarenka; and No. 8 Agnieszka Radwanska.But first Clijsters must get past her close friend Daniela Hantuchova in the third round. Clijsters was 9-0 against Hantuchova as a professional until they faced each other in the semifinals in Brisbane in the first week of this season. Clijsters was unable to finish the match after injuring her hip.So it has gone too often of late. Clijsters played only nine events last year, and not because of the prioritizing that comes with being a working mother. After winning the Australian Open last year and soon returning to No. 1, she appeared set to restore some coherence to the top of the women’s game, but her body did not cooperate.Pain drove her out of the sport the first time in 2007 at age 24. Last year, there were shoulder, wrist and ankle injuries. Short on matches, she lost in the second round at the French Open, and later withdrew from Wimbledon and the United States Open.“When you come back and work hard, you want to at least be able to play or feel good out on the court,” Clijsters said. “It doesn’t mean you always have to play perfect tennis. That’s a different story, but I wanted to at least feel like I was able to move freely and hit without worrying about my shoulder or my hip or my foot, those kind of things. And at one point, I couldn’t even do that anymore, and that was frustrating, especially with the type of tennis that I play. It’s physical.”She is hardly the only one playing that way in this muscular era, but she retains an unmistakable presence on a tennis court. Clijsters is a smooth technician whose bludgeoning power rarely seems forced. She moves laterally with remarkable grace, although she wants to avoid using her trademark splits after the Brisbane injury.“I think it would be a smart thing,” said her coach, Carl Maes.Maes first coached Clijsters when she was 11 and brought her up to the professional ranks before becoming head of women’s tennis for the British Lawn Tennis Association. But last year, after her disappointing French Open, Clijsters asked him to rejoin her team, and he is now the head coach after Wim Fissette’s resignation in September.Maes said he did believe this would be her last year.“But having said that, if I look at her tennis — the body is the most tricky part of it — but if I look at her tennis, she could very easily go for two, three, four more years on the tour,” he added.Asked why she feels the need to set an end date, most likely after the United States Open in September, Clijsters thought for a while.“It’s for myself, for my husband,” she said. “We want to have that normal life, and he has been very supportive of my career. I was able to support him for those two years when I was at home, and I feel very comfortable in that position. I love my life at home and taking care of Jada and my husband, and we want to have more kids.”Her husband, Brian Lynch, an American who played basketball at Villanova University, is now coaching the semiprofessional basketball team Cuva Houthalen in one of Belgium’s lower divisions. He is back in Melbourne with Clijsters.Jada, who will turn 4 in February, has traveled the world since infancy, toddling around on court during victory ceremonies but expressing little interest in playing the sport.“She’s never been big into tennis,” Clijsters said. “And yesterday out of the blue, she’s like, ‘Mommy, I want to play tennis, like you!’ So I was like, ‘Wow, O.K.’“And my husband looked at me and was like, ‘Ohhhhh.’ And he goes, ‘Do you want to travel and then we watch you play?’ And Jada’s like, ‘Yeah.’ ”Clijsters, chuckling as she told the tale, remembered very well what she said to her daughter next: “Please no.”'"
"'12-01-19,'1','Legislation that just weeks ago had overwhelming bipartisan support and had provoked little scrutiny generated a grass-roots coalition on the left and the right. made its English-language content unavailable, replaced with a warning: “Right now, the U.S. Congress is considering legislation that could fatally damage the free and open Internet.” Visitors to Reddit found the site offline in protest. ’s home page was scarred by a black swatch that covered the search engine’s label.Phone calls and e-mail messages poured in to Congressional offices against the Stop Online Piracy Act in the House and the Protect I.P. Act in the Senate. One by one, prominent backers of the bills dropped off.First, Senator of , a rising Republican star, took to , one of the vehicles for promoting opposition, to renounce a bill he had co-sponsored. Senator of , who leads the ’s Senate campaign efforts, used Facebook to urge his colleagues to slow the bill down. Senator , Republican of and a favorite, announced his opposition on , which was already boiling over with anti-#SOPA and #PIPA .Then trickle turned to flood — adding Senators of and of , and Representatives Lee Terry of and of . At least 10 senators and nearly twice that many House members announced their opposition.“Thanks for all the calls, e-mails, and tweets. I will be opposing #SOPA and #PIPA,” Senator , Democrat of , wrote in a Twitter message. Late Wednesday, Senator of , the senior Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, withdrew his support for a bill he helped write.The existing bill “needs more due diligence, analysis and substantial changes,” he said in a statement.Few lawmakers even now question the need to combat pirates at Web sites in , and elsewhere who have offered free American movies, television shows, music and books almost as soon as they are released. Heavyweights like the secured the support of senators and representatives before the Web companies were even aware the legislation existed.“A lot of people are pitching this as Hollywood versus Google. It’s so much more than that,” said Maura Corbett, spokeswoman for NetCoalition, which represents Google, , , and other Web companies. “I would love to say we’re so fabulous, we’re just that good, but we’re not. The Internet responded the way only the Internet could.”For the more traditional media industry, the moment was menacing. Supporters of the legislation accused the Web companies of willfully lying about the legislation’s flaws, stirring fear to protect ill-gotten profits from illegal Web sites.Mr. Dodd said Internet companies might well change Washington, but not necessarily for the better with their ability to spread their message globally, without regulation or fact-checking.Citing two longtime liberal champions of the First Amendment, Senator and Representative of , Mr. Dodd fumed, “No one can seriously believe Pat Leahy and John Conyers can be backing legislation to block free speech or break the Internet.”For at least four years, Hollywood studios, recording industry and major publishing houses have pressed Congress to act against offshore Web sites that have been giving away U.S. movies, music and books as fast as the artists can make them. Few lawmakers would deny the threat posed by piracy to industries that have long been powerful symbols of American culture and have become engines of the export economy. The says its industry brings back more export income than aerospace, automobiles or agriculture, and that piracy costs the country as many as 100,000 jobs.The House response, SOPA, was drafted by a conservative Republican, Representative of Texas, with the backing of 30 co-sponsors, from Representative of Florida, the chairwoman of the , to mainline Republican Peter King of New York. The Senate’s version, written by Mr. Leahy, the Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, attracted 40 co-sponsors from across the political spectrum and cleared his committee unanimously.Then the Web rose up. Activists said the legislation would censor the Web, force search engines to play policemen for a law they hate and cripple innovation in one of the most vibrant sectors of the American economy.Mr. Smith, the House Republican author, said opposition Web sites were spreading “fear rather than fact.”“When the opposition is based upon misinformation, I have confidence in the facts and confidence that the facts will ultimately prevail,” Mr. Smith said.Google, Facebook and Twitter have political muscle of their own, with in-house lobbying shops and trade associations just like traditional media’s. Facebook has hired the former Clinton White House press secretary . Google’s Washington operations are headed by Pablo Chavez, a former counsel to Senator , Republican of Arizona, and a veteran of the Senate Commerce Committee.And for all the campaign contributions, Washington parties and high-priced lobbyists the old economy could muster, nothing could compare to the tentacles the new economy can reach into Americans’ everyday lives through sites like Wikipedia. Aides to Senator , the majority leader, say he will press forward with a vote Tuesday to open debate on the Protect I.P. bill. Negotiators from both parties are scrambling for new language that could assuage the concerns of the Internet community, but expectations are that the bill will now fail to get the 60 votes to move forward — a significant setback.“The problem for the content industry is they just don’t know how to mobilize people,” said John P. Feehery, a former House Republican leadership aide who previously worked at the motion picture association. “They have a small group of content makers, a few unions, whereas the Internet world, the social media world especially, can reach people in ways we never dreamed of before.”'"
"'12-01-19,'1','MELBOURNE, Australia — No. 8 Mardy Fish, the top-ranked American, became the first top 10 player to fall in the men’s draw when he lost in the second round to the 71st-ranked Alejandro Falla of Colombia, 7-6 (4), 6-3, 7-6 (6), in three hours Wednesday.Fish had trouble controlling both his forehand and his backhand, hitting 58 unforced errors to Falla’s 34. But he also had trouble controlling his temper.Down by two sets to none, Fish appeared distracted and aggravated by the treatments Falla received for cramping. He complained to the chair umpire, Enric Molina, and sarcastically questioned a tournament referee about rules for cramping treatments.Fish grew increasingly chippy as momentum shifted throughout the third set. Several times, he unfurled a series of loud profanities after unforced errors.“When you think someone is cramping or ailing physically, you sort of change your game a tiny bit,” Fish said, using air quotes to underline his skepticism of Falla’s condition. “I thought he was having some physical issues. But then in between every point, you know, he was totally fine.”The second-round loss abbreviated what was an uncharacteristically cantankerous month for Fish in Australia. During losses in singles and mixed doubles at the Hopman Cup in Perth two weeks ago, Fish exchanged words with the Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov. At one point he needed to be separated from the 20-year-old Dimitrov by a tournament official.'"

"'12-01-20,'1','“When I see something like that, I get frightened,” said Ms. Rabinovich, who survived Auschwitz and the infamous death march. “Because that was the beginning of something.”Despite an arrest Monday of a 56-year-old Jewish man in connection with some of the crimes, the acts set off anxiety and disbelief among Ms. Rabinovich’s group that it could happen in the United States. In Brooklyn.There were approximately 33,000 Holocaust survivors in New York City in 2010, according to the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty, and about 20,500 were living in Brooklyn.Nachas, one of several Jewish organizations that offer counseling for survivors, and at times financial support, started the groups for men and for women eight years ago.Since Monday, the women have been buzzing about the news.“It started as a discussion: ‘Did you see what happened? Did you hear?’ ” said Frumie Cisner, the 38-year-old group counselor, whose grandmother is a survivor. “Their reactions are ranging from outrage to having the security blanket pulled out from them. Their nightmares are so intense.”Katherine Frommer recalled her father’s walk home from synagogue one day in Budapest: “I just felt like I was in Europe again. They beat him; he came home all bloody. That’s how it started.”On Wednesday, the women shared their stories of survival in the concentration camps, although some, visibly upset, had to leave the discussion. Later, they talked with Mrs. Cisner about the week’s Torah portion in Yiddish, and ate pizza. A few women carefully, subtly, wrapped the slices in napkins and stashed them in their purses. Most of the women are in their 80s. Many are widowed and live on meager monthly reparations from the German government. Nachas — which in Yiddish means “joy” or “pride” — sustains them.“This is what we live for,” Edith Kohn said. “We can’t always live with the thoughts of Auschwitz, the crematorium, the smell.”But those thoughts have come flooding back as news of the anti-Semitic crimes — not all of which were related — has been broadcast on television and printed in newspapers.In Flatbush in November, four cars were burned, two painted with swastikas, two emblazoned with “KKK.” The police are investigating it as a possible case of insurance fraud. In December, a sign for the Avenue J subway line was spray-painted to read “Avenue Jew.” This month, swastikas were scrawled on four storefronts on Avenue of the Americas.Last weekend, a residential garage near Avenue L and outdoor staircases to a nearby religious school were painted with swastikas. Elderly residents in Manhattan and in Sheepshead Bay have received threatening phone calls.On Monday, the police arrested David Haddad, charging him with aggravated harassment as a hate crime involving several acts. Mr. Haddad is the suspect in 10 harassing phone calls, said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman. Mr. Haddad is also suspected of painting swastikas in the building in which he lives, Mr. Browne said, and painting four swastikas near Avenue L and East Fifth Street in Brooklyn.The police said that he had a business dispute with the victims, and was related to two of them.“I don’t care if the person is Jewish,” said Wolf Sender, the district manager for Community Board 12 in Brooklyn, which includes Borough Park. “Hate is hate.”Of 119 anti-Semitic acts of vandalism, verbal and physical assaults, anti-Semitic graffiti, and other related incidents in 2011, 39 were in Brooklyn, according to the Anti-Defamation League. In 2010, 53 of the 133 occurred in Brooklyn.Last year, the Police Department investigated 104 anti-Semitic cases, compared with 134 in 2010, Mr. Browne said.“These people want attention,” Shoshanah Katz said as she left Wednesday’s meeting. “But we don’t take it in this country.”'"
"'12-01-20,'1','Many in the industry say the legislation began to stir suspicion as early as September, with respected venture capitalists like Fred Wilson and Paul Graham calling attention to it in e-mails and on the Web.But the cause gained visibility on Nov. 16 when Tumblr added a feature that “censored” the dashboard users see when they log into the site, and pointed them to information about the bills.The idea for the feature came out of a three-hour meeting the weekend before, organized by people who opposed the legislation, including members of Fight for the Future; Brad Burnham, a partner at Union Square Ventures; and David Segal, executive director for Demand Progress, a non-profit group.John Maloney, the president of Tumblr, said the company volunteered its offices in Manhattan for the meeting, which included roughly 40 people in the room and another 40 or so on speakerphone. Employees of well-known sites like Kickstarter and Reddit were there.“They told us why it was flawed and asked us to think about it as an industry and a group,” said Mr. Maloney, who added that David Karp, Tumblr’s founder, “was very quick to raise his hand and say ‘We’re in.’ ”“I looked at David and he had a spark in his eye,” Mr. Maloney said.Mr. Maloney said a team of people at Tumblr worked late into that evening and returned early on Sunday. That Wednesday morning they posted their work, sat back and watched it come to life and spread around the Web.Tumblr plays host to 40 million blogs, including the official blogs of start-ups and the personal sites of many tech types, and the alert caught their eye.“For Tumblr, a New York company with a very solid reputation, to take such a vocal stance on an issue woke people up,” said Nate Westheimer, executive director of the New York Tech Meetup, which organized a rally in Manhattan on Wednesday to protest the bills.Mr. Westheimer said Tumblr’s alert was the first he had heard of SOPA, and it was enough to prompt him to collaborate on the protest, which attracted close to a thousand people. He said Reddit played an equally important role in feeding the dissent.Reddit, a site where users share links and chat about tech topics, funny photos and everything else, became a hive of organizational activity in November.A link to a petition about the Stop Online Privacy Act surfaced on a Reddit discussion board and caught the attention of James Maw, a 20-year-old living in Yorkshire, England, who provides tech support for a bank. On Nov. 16 he created a separate forum on Reddit dedicated to discussion of the legislation.“It was not at all well known then,” he said. The chatter on that board started out as a trickle before turning into a flood, and it attracted 2.5 million visitors a day at its peak.“You wouldn’t think that a piece of U.S. legislation would affect people outside of the United States,” Mr. Maw said. “But I use Reddit and that could be affected by this.”Reddit members began rooting out supporters of SOPA, zeroing in on Go Daddy, the domain name seller, and urging its customers to take their business elsewhere. The response was so great that Go Daddy rescinded its support of the bill. Reddit was also one of the first sites to commit to a protest shutdown.Clay Shirky, a scholar of Internet culture who teaches at New York University’s Interactive Telecommunications Program, said that unlike other protests that are inflection points for a society, the SOPA-related outcry didn’t have one turning point when a switch flipped in the public consciousness. Instead, he said, it was a 21st-century version of a phone tree.“It pervaded people’s consciousness more and more as time went on,” Mr. Shirky said. It wasn’t long, he said, before “a disorganized group of people online became a coordinated group of people taking action.”Twitter played a role in keeping the momentum moving — particularly since there was little coverage of the bills in major media outlets until recently. There were nearly 200,000 Twitter posts mentioning SOPA on Monday, more than 450,000 on Tuesday and about 3.9 million on Wednesday.And although the decision by Wikipedia and Google to join the protest was instrumental in drawing attention to the dissent, they “did not lead this effort,” Mr. Shirky said. “They followed it.”Supporters of the legislation say that the response to it has been overblown. Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who drafted SOPA, said its opponents were spreading “fear rather than fact.”But those who helped mobilize the protests disagree.“The real question is, ‘Are they overreacting to the scale of the problem?’ ” said Mr. Burnham of Union Square Ventures.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','The Colorado affiliate of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. showed admirable understanding, and taught its young members a valuable lesson, when it said that it welcomes youngsters who were born male but identify as a girl and have a family that “presents her as a girl.” The group clarified its policy after the mother of a 7-year-old was mistakenly told that her child could not join a troop because he has “boy parts” and she publicly complained. The Scouts contacted the mother, but the child has not enrolled.Unfortunately, not all Girl Scout troops share the Girl Scouts’ fundamental value of inclusion. Three troops at a Christian school in Louisiana disbanded to protest Colorado’s policy, which is supported by the national Girl Scouts organization.And the controversy erupted again a few days ago thanks to an eight-minute video that was posted on the YouTube channel of Honest Girl Scouts, a group that regularly attacks Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. for abandoning “traditional values” — whatever that is supposed to mean.In the video, a 14-year-old girl scout from California reads a script criticizing Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. for accepting transgender members and calling for a boycott of Girl Scout cookies. The video received 387,000 hits before the group marked the video “private,” blocking viewing by the general public. A portion of the video is still available elsewhere on YouTube.Happily, it seems the video’s main effect so far has been to draw wide expressions of support for the Girl Scouts’ policy. The national and Colorado offices of the organization say that they do not expect a drop in sales and that many people may buy more boxes than usual to show they stand with the Girl Scouts and against bigotry. We hope so. And, for the record, our favorite is the Thin Mint.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','MOSCOW — Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin will meet Friday with former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger to discuss world affairs, including elections in Russia and the United States, said Mr. Putin’s press secretary, Dmitri S. Peskov.Mr. Peskov said Mr. Kissinger requested the meeting in late November or early December. The two men are “old friends” who have met 8 or 10 times over the years, once dining at Mr. Kissinger’s home in New York, he said. Mr. Peskov said Mr. Putin was interested in Mr. Kissinger’s counsel about domestic politics, among other subjects.“He values everyone’s point of view, and especially such a wise man as Henry Kissinger,” Mr. Peskov said.The meeting comes six weeks before Russia’s presidential election and amid accusations that the United States was behind a series of street protests that began after Dec. 4 parliamentary elections that were widely dismissed as fraudulent.On Tuesday, a report on state-controlled television accused the new American ambassador, Michael A. McFaul, of working to provoke revolution. Russian camera crews had followed human rights activists and opposition politicians invited to the American Embassy for meetings with Mr. McFaul and a visiting deputy secretary of state, and the images were broadcast on the evening news.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, stung by widespread doubts about his support for the privately financed construction of the country’s largest convention center at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, offered a full-throated defense of the proposal on Thursday, saying the only cost to the state if the project failed would be “an empty building.”Dismissing concerns about the weak economic health of the convention business, Mr. Cuomo promised that the Queens project would “cost the State of New York bubkes,” while freeing up for development the valuable land underneath the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.In an interview with editors and writers for The New York Times, Mr. Cuomo sounded frustrated about the skeptical reaction to the convention center idea, which he proposed during his State of the State address on Jan. 4. He said the proposed development — which would include hotels, restaurants and expanded gambling, as well as the convention center — combined with the redevelopment of Manhattan’s Far West Side, would generate jobs and significant tax revenues. And he voiced confidence in Genting, the Malaysian company that runs a gambling hall at Aqueduct and proposes to spend $4 billion on the convention center.“What happens if they go bust?” Mr. Cuomo asked. “First, I say, you want government to second-guess the private sector? They’ve had a masterful track record, masterful. This is what they do. They do it all over the world.”He added that the state would not offer Genting any tax-free bonds to support the project, and he said the company would have to reimburse the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the full cost of improving subway access to the new convention center.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','Spain’s highly autonomous regions have spent recklessly in recent years — on generous public services and expensive capital projects, some of which look ridiculous in hindsight. Two regions, for instance, have built large airports, though virtually no one uses them.And the regions’ failure to pay their creditors is now endangering many small enterprises, which are the backbone of the Spanish economy, already suffering from more than 22 percent unemployment, the highest in Europe.Despite pressure from Madrid to rein in their budgets, many regions failed to meet their budget goals this year — a huge factor in Spain’s failure to meet its targets.Just a few weeks ago, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy announced a new $19.3 billion package of tax increases and budget cuts — intended to offset the impact of the unexpected jump in the 2011 public deficit to 8 percent from the 6 percent originally forecast.Mr. Rajoy, who took office in December, quickly identified the regional government spending as a major problem that has to be dealt with. But he seemed to strike a more conciliatory tone this week as the government moved to help regions.“We are all the state, and the Spanish government cannot remove itself from what is happening to the regional governments,” Mr. Rajoy said Tuesday, adding that he would not allow any regional government to go bankrupt as long as it met its budget goals.Markets seemed to react positively to Mr. Rajoy’s new measures.Spain was able to sell $8.5 billion in bonds on Thursday — more than expected, and at a better price. The sale suggested that markets had shrugged off the country’s downgrade last week by Standard & Poor’s.Yields that the country pays on 10-year bonds fell to 5.4 percent on Thursday, down from a high of 7 percent in November.Spain’s system of autonomous regions was developed in the aftermath of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. After years of repression, regions pressed successfully for as much freedom as possible.They are generally in charge of administering schools, universities, health and social services, culture, development and, in some cases, policing. And the central government has until now had little ability to interfere.But in recent years, the regions have been faced with some intractable problems. Education and health care have been particularly problematic, because those costs have been growing. At the same time, some main sources of financing — taxes on real estate sales and building permit fees — have dried up with the collapse of the housing boom.For that reason, some regions may actually want the central government to take back some responsibilities, as was suggested in July by officials from the regions of Murcia, Valencia and Aragón.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','Welcome back the Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, heroes of the “Fullmetal Alchemist” franchise. You may not know them, but plenty of anime fanatics do: a manga that began in 2001, the property later became two television series (one still on the Cartoon Network) and later a feature. (“The Sacred Star of Milos” is the sequel.)You’ll find only eye-blink references to their origins in “Sacred Star” (devotees only, I’m afraid). So, for the uninitiated: when Ed and Al’s mother died, Ed used the forbidden practice of human alchemy to bring her back, but at a dear price. He lost an arm and a leg, and Al lost his body. Now Al inhabits a robotic frame (resembling a shorter, spiked cousin of the title character in “The Iron Giant”), and Ed uses high-tech prostheses. The two seek a philosopher’s stone (not to be confused with the British title to the first Harry Potter book) that will enable them to reclaim their bodies.And where are they now? In a vast canyon housing the Milos, poor people oppressed by the Cretans, who live above. There the brothers join forces with the Milos, as well as with Julia, a budding alchemist, and her mysterious brother, Ashleigh. Let the animated phantasmagoria begin: explosions, bolts of enchantment and colorful conflagrations signifying little to this viewer.That said, early steampunk flavorings, including the Black Bats — flying female antagonists in Art Deco regalia — have charm. And the widescreen canvas is an improvement over television’s limited expanse. But if you’re not among the indoctrinated, don’t bother.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','Mitt Romney’s great-great-grandfather Miles was a member of the church in Nauvoo, Ill., and spent years building a temple there. Even after Joseph Smith was killed by a mob and most of the Mormons fled, Miles stayed to finish his temple.Then, in 1844, as the great work was being completed, mobs burned it to the ground and forced Miles and his family to head West. Most Mormons made the trek to , but the Romneys could not afford an ox cart. They were part of a small, malnourished band that took four years of struggle to make it the 1,300 miles west.Mitt’s great-grandfather, also Miles, made the trek starting at age 7. He was married in 1862, but a month after his marriage Brigham Young told him to leave his wife, Hannah, and become a missionary for three years in . Hannah supported herself by taking in other people’s washing.Miles returned in 1867 and bought a two-room house. Young commanded him to take another wife, and Hannah had to prepare the room for the woman who would be her rival. “I used to walk the floor and shed tears of sorrow,” she recounted in her own private memoir.Then they were commanded to leave family and friends and build a new settlement in the desert 300 miles south of Salt Lake City. Living at first in primitive huts, they built a community, and Miles prospered. Then came a new command to move 400 miles across the wilderness to settle a desert patch in .Again the Romneys were thrown back into primeval hardship. Miles, his three wives and their many children lived in a small wooden house and survived on bread, beans and gravy. There, as elsewhere, the locals detested the Mormons for their , for their religion and for the fact that the Mormons tended to outwork them. The local newspaper said Miles should be hung for polygamy, so two of his wives were sent to hide in cornfields and the mountains of .They were compelled to move again. Romney left his family to build a colony in . It was 1885, and he was living out of a wagon. Hannah led eight children through the Arizona mountains to join him. In Mexico, they lived in a house with a dirt roof, so mud dropped down when it rained. Eventually, all the wives and the 21 children were reunited. Miles and his son Gaskell, Mitt’s grandfather, built a successful community, with brick homes, churches and wealth.George Romney, Mitt’s father, was born in Mexico. But when he was 5, in 1912, Mexican revolutionaries confiscated their property and threw them out. Most of the Romneys fled back to the U.S. Within days, they went from owning a large Mexican ranch to being penniless once again, drifting from to to , where again they built a fortune.Mitt Romney can’t talk about his family history on the campaign trail. Mormonism is an uncomfortable subject. But he must have been affected by it.It is a story of relentless effort, of recovery and of being despised (in their eyes) because of their own success. Romney himself experienced none of this hardship, of course, but Jews who didn’t live through the Exodus are still shaped by it.Romney seems to share his family’s remorseless drive to rise — whether it’s trying to persuade the French to give up wine and join his church, or building a business, or being willing to withstand heaps of abuse in pursuit of the presidency. He may have character flaws, but he does not have the character flaws normally associated with great wealth. His signature is focus and persistence. The wealth issue is a sideshow.'"

"'12-01-20,'1','Re “U.S. Seeks Rollback of a Health Insurer’s ‘Excessive’ Rate Increase” (news article, Jan. 13): As a freelance writer and editor, I’ve paid my own health insurance costs since 1986. Even when I’ve been given staff jobs, my employers have insisted that I work part time so they won’t have to pay benefits.When my old insurer wanted to raise my premium by 33 percent to more than $1,000 — even though I have no pre-existing conditions, diseases or other health problems — I shopped around and found a much more affordable plan. Then last year, this company also raised my premium by 33 percent.While the new health care law will require insurers to justify rates of more than 10 percent, my insurer has already scored a major slam dunk. If my premium goes up much more, I may have to join the uninsured and wait for Medicare to kick in five years from now.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','“Israeli Women Core of Debate on Orthodoxy” (front page, Jan. 15) points out the challenges faced by Israel in balancing the principles of democracy and pluralism. Though the examples cited are serious, they are peripheral to the lives of the vast majority of Israeli women, who enjoy full and equal rights unrivaled anywhere in the Middle East — indeed, in most of the world.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly and categorically condemned any discrimination against women. “In the State of Israel, in which women sit in the cockpit, women can sit in any place,” he recently told a graduating class of air force pilots that included five women.Any threat to women’s rights in Israel will be resisted by Israel’s leaders, among them the three government ministers, 24 members of Parliament, the heads of Israel’s two main opposition parties, a general on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the chief justice of the Supreme Court, all of whom are women.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','The hamlet of Woodstock, N.Y., has harbored an unusual number of artists at least since 1902, when the nearby Byrdcliffe Arts Colony was founded by a group led by the ceramists Ralph Radcliffe Whitehead and his wife, Jane Byrd McCall. The location was unbeatable. New York City was within easy striking distance; land was cheap; the scenery beautiful. Artists have spent time there ever since.This pleasantly jumbled exhibition, chockablock with names unfamiliar to most gallery denizens, concentrates on works made in Woodstock during the 1920s and ’30s, and, according to the catalog essay, proposes to demonstrate how artists there absorbed the avant-garde influences of the 1913 Armory Show. This isn’t always evident, although two wonderfully messy landscapes from the early 1920s by George Bellows suggest that the exposure to European innovation shifted his emphasis from narrative to paint as material.Nonetheless, a quiet, slightly bucolic tumult of representational styles prevails, as painters like George Ault, Emil Ganso, Doris Lee and Ernest Fiene sift through possible combinations of Precisionism, folk art, realism and Impressionism. Konrad Cramer’s siftings, both on canvas and in several assured photographs, are especially interesting. One photo captures the peeling white hull of the Ida, the Saugerties night boat that ferried people down the Hudson to New York, which is also portrayed on canvas by Charles Rosen. River traffic is also the subject of a rare photograph by the painter Yasuo Kuniyoshi, from 1938, showing rusting junk on a boat docked at Kingston, N.Y.In three dimensions, the sleekly stylized animals and fowl of H. Hunt Diederich frolic on weathervanes, a fire screen and ceramic chargers. Carl Walters does more inherently robust and playful things with clay in a vase glazed with sailboats; a plate featuring a hippo and dragonflies; and a small sculpture of a lion tamer.This last piece and a painted papier-mâché figure of a genie by Eugenie Gershoy suggest that Alexander Calder’s was not the only sense of humor in early modern American sculpture. The Whiteheads are also here, represented by two refined vases and two large, relieflike grids of glaze samples that look almost exactly like art now.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','“We were negative 4 percent, and they still missed,” he said.In an interview, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, Peter S. Klein, said the decline in Windows sales was the result of problems in the consumer market, not purchases of PCs by businesses, which continued to grow during the quarter. He said the sales of the inexpensive laptops known as netbooks were especially bad, falling to 2 percent of worldwide consumer PC shipments in the quarter, from 8 percent a year earlier.Worldwide shipments of PCs fell 0.2 percent during the fourth quarter from the year-earlier period, while PC shipments in the United States fell 5 percent for all of 2011, the worst showing since 2001, according to the International Data Corporation. IDC attributed the anemic results to weak economic conditions and shortages of hard disks caused by flooding in Thailand, a manufacturing center for those devices.The weakness in Microsoft’s report also reflects competition from cellphones and tablets like Apple’s iPad.After stumbling in mobile phones and tablets in recent years, Microsoft finally has software products for these devices that are winning positive early reviews. But Microsoft’s tablet and cellphone plans have not yet begun to produce big sales.The company released its redesigned mobile operating system, Windows Phone, in fall 2010, but the first smartphones that used the software were lackluster and had tepid support from wireless carriers. Microsoft is betting that a partnership with Nokia, the Finnish cellphone maker, will help turn around its mobile business. The first devices from their collaboration went on sale only recently.Meanwhile, Apple’s iPhone and smartphones based on Google’s Android operating system are devouring most of the market. During the fourth quarter, Android phones accounted for 51.7 percent of the smartphones acquired by United States consumers within three months, while the iPhone accounted for 37 percent, according to estimates by Nielsen. Phones running Microsoft software, including an older operating system it is no longer developing, accounted for 3.8 percent, Nielsen said.Microsoft is also developing a new version of its flagship operating system, Windows 8, to run tablet computers. Early test versions of the software have been praised by developers and technophiles. The software is not expected to go on sale until late this year, though.Other parts of Microsoft’s business are performing well, especially its entertainment and devices division, dominated by sales of the Xbox video game system and related products. Revenue from that division grew 15 percent to $4.24 billion from the year-earlier period, reflecting strong sales of the Xbox 360 console, the Kinect game sensor and the Xbox Live online game service.Another standout was Microsoft’s server and tools division, which sells databases and other software to businesses. That division’s sales rose 11 percent, to $4.77 billion.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','Intel’s profit rose only 6 percent in the fourth quarter, the company said Thursday, as the impact of last year’s catastrophic flooding in Thailand, which devastated hard-drive production, began to affect PC sales.The company posted net income of $3.4 billion, or 64 cents a share, up from $3.2 billion, or 56 cents a share, in the same quarter a year ago.Intel’s revenue increased 21 percent to $13.9 billion, from $11.5 billion in the year-earlier period.Intel warned analysts on Dec. 12 that revenue would be weaker than they had predicted.After the announcement in December, Wall Street analysts lowered their average forecast to 61 cents a share, from 69 cents, on $13.72 billion in revenue.Intel’s chief executive, Paul S. Otellini, said 2011 was an exceptional year. “The company performed superbly, growing revenue by more than $10 billion and eclipsing all annual revenue and earnings records,” he said in a news release. Intel has said that overall PC demand remains strong in the long term. The company expects the impact of the hard-drive shortage on PC sales to decline by the end of the year.'"
"'12-01-20,'1','On Thursday, Cuche said he had been wrestling with the idea for more than a year and made the decision Monday as he drove from Switzerland to Kitzbühel.“I celebrated my first victory here in Kitzbühel, and that marked the beginning of my career,” he said, referring to his first World Cup win in 1998. “Kitzbühel remains the downhill mecca in ski racing, and yes, perhaps this explains why I decided this week to announce my retirement in a place that is so important and meaningful for me.”Cuche began this season with a victory in the opening speed event at Lake Louise, Alberta, in November, making him the oldest Alpine skier to win a World Cup race. The next day, he placed second in the super-G.But his momentum waned, and he has not placed in the top three since November.Beat Feuz, a 24-year-old Swiss, has recently overshadowed Cuche. Feuz has reached the podium in seven of this season’s speed events, including a win last weekend in Wengen, Switzerland. Cuche rejected the notion that his retirement was hastened by Feuz’s emergence.“No, this decision has been maturing over a long period and this is quite simply the right moment for me to announce it,” he said. “I’m happy and proud of my wonderful career.”Cuche may be Switzerland’s biggest sports star; he even has his own signature move — kicking off his right ski and catching it before bringing it to his lips for a kiss. He is popular among his competitors, coaches and teammates.“His tenure has been amazing,” the American downhiller Marco Sullivan said. “The fact that he seems to get better with age has been incredible and inspiring for all of us racers to watch.”Cuche is the favorite to win the downhill Saturday, and a fifth victory in Kitzbühel would set a record.While tears flowed at the news conference, Cuche expressed relief at having made his decision.“My focus is now exclusively on the races on Friday and Saturday,” he said. “Now that I am freed from other thoughts, I can give them full throttle.”'"
"'12-01-20,'1','In each case, News Group also agreed to pay the complainant’s legal costs, any of which could easily have run into six figures. One complainant, speaking on the condition on anonymity, said that his came to more than $300,000 — an amount that does not include News International’s fees.But perhaps more damaging to the company than the financial penalties was a statement from lawyers for the hacking victims.“News Group has agreed to compensation being assessed on the basis that senior employees and directors of N.G.N. knew about the wrongdoing and sought to conceal it by deliberately deceiving investigators and destroying evidence,” the statement said, referring to News Group Newspapers.The lawyers also said they had obtained, through nine disclosure orders from the court, “documents relating to the nature and scale of the conspiracy, a cover-up and the destruction of evidence/e-mail archives by News Group.”In a statement, News International, the British newspaper arm of Mr. Murdoch’s global empire and the parent company of News Group, said it had “made no admission as part of these settlements that directors or senior employees knew about the wrongdoing by N.G.N. or sought to conceal it.” It added, “However, for the purpose of reaching these settlements only, N.G.N. agreed that the damages to be paid to claimants should be assessed as if this was the case.”Lawyers said, however, that it was unlikely that the company would have agreed to calculate settlements on the basis that there was a cover-up if there were in fact no cover-up.Until the end of 2010, News International denied that The News of the World engaged in any phone hacking and vehemently vowed to fight any legal claims. After that, it admitted that some of its reporters and editors knew about the hacking. Now it has acknowledged that hacking was pervasive, and with hundreds of potential victims still left to deal with, it recently set up a Web page where people who believe their phones were hacked can file claims electronically.More than 20 people have been arrested on suspicion of phone hacking or illegally paying the police for information. No criminal charges have been filed yet.Steven Barnett, a professor of communications at the University of Westminster, said in a statement that the latest disclosures represented “a devastating indictment not only of the corrupt journalistic practices at The News of the World but of the calculated cover-up which apparently followed.”The cases also extended beyond the one newspaper. Mr. Law said he had been hacked not only by The News of the World but also by , another Murdoch tabloid.The hearing took on an almost ritualistic tone as each victim’s statement, its wording carefully vetted and approved by News Group, was read out to the court. Each reading was immediately followed by Mr. Silverleaf’s confirmation of the victim’s account and a statement that the company acknowledged “that the information should never have been obtained or used in this manner.”News Group also admitted outright for the first time that it had hacked into an e-mail account in pursuit of a story. Mr. Silverleaf confirmed the account of Christopher Shipman, the son of a notorious British serial killer, that The News of the World had “unlawfully obtained the confidential access to details to the claimant’s e-mail account, including his password, and had accessed his in-box.”The victims’ statements had similar narrative arcs. At some point in the early or mid-2000’s, most said, they had become suspicious about personal information that was appearing in The News of the World. Some said they experienced odd problems with their voice mail, like being unable to gain access to it because it was busy.Then, the victims said, they were shown evidence by the police of what The News of the World had done. Mr. Law’s statement said the police had played him messages he had left for his children’s nanny five years earlier.The statements detail the victims’ distress and confusion. “Although the articles would often only contain a small piece of accurate information,” said Mark Thomson, the lawyer for Ms. Frost, Mr. Law’s ex-wife, it was enough for Ms. Frost “to suspect everyone close to her and for the claimant and Mr. Law to suspect each other.”, the private investigator who worked for The News of the World, was News Group’s co-defendant in the lawsuits. But his lawyer said Mr. Mulcaire, who was jailed for phone hacking in 2007 and faces new criminal charges, had not admitted to wrongdoing.Even for some of those who had settled, the matter was not over. “This is still only Act Four, Scene Four, of a five-act play,” said Chris Bryant, a member of Parliament, who was awarded about $46,000 after his phone was hacked.Tamsin Allen, a lawyer representing a number of the victims, said that it was their perseverance, even when News Group was aggressively denying that it had ever hacked anyone, that had led to the settlement.“It is a to them, the claimants, that they kept on,” she said, “because we have now discovered a massive conspiracy involving criminal activity and a cover-up.”'"

The decision by Cambodia’s Supreme Council of the Magistracy not to appoint Laurent Kasper-Ansermet as a joint investigating judge was “a matter of serious concern,” a United Nations statement said, and was a breach of a 2003 agreement between Cambodia and the United Nations on prosecuting former Khmer Rouge officials.

Chevron inherited the case when it bought Texaco a decade ago. The appeal argues that the lower courts violated Ecuador’s Constitution by refusing to take corrective action in response to what Chevron calls “extensive fraud and corruption” committed by the plaintiffs’ lawyers and representatives. The plaintiffs have responded by citing Chevron’s own test data in documenting the pollution and arguing that Chevron could be sued for damages by third parties. In related litigation in New York, the plaintiffs also accused the company of mishandling soil and water samples during the trial by maintaining two different laboratories, based on testimony from a Chevron expert.'"
"'12-01-21,'0','“Unfortunately I’m not surprised with these results,” said Neil Ellington, executive vice president of Consumer Education Services, a credit counseling agency in Raleigh, N.C. “The same underlying issues that created the problem in mortgage lending, with minorities paying higher interest rates than their white counterparts having the same loan qualifications, are present in all financial fields.”The findings, which will be published in The Journal of Empirical Legal Studies later this year, did not suggest that there was any obvious evidence of discrimination in the bankruptcy process. “I don’t think there is any overt conspiracy,” Professor Lawless said. “But when you have a complex system, these biases can play out and the people within the system don’t see the pattern because nobody is in charge of looking at these big issues.”Changes in the bankruptcy law in 2005 were intended to force more debtors to file under Chapter 13 and repay some of their debts, but that has not been the effect. In fact, the rate of Chapter 13 filings has remained relatively steady, at about 30 percent. Last year, overall bankruptcy filings were 1.4 million.Chapter 13 is not always an inferior choice. Many distressed borrowers go that route because they may be able to save their homes from foreclosure. But even that does not explain away the difference: among blacks who did not own their homes, the rate of filing for Chapter 13 was still twice as high as the rate for other races. And the trend persists across the country, beyond regions like the South where Chapter 13 tends to be a more popular option among all debtors (perhaps, in part, because Chapter 13 originated in the South).If a debtor chooses an inappropriate chapter, there can be serious implications. Chapter 13 plans, for instance, are more likely to fail than a Chapter 7. Nearly two of every three Chapter 13 plans are not completed, which means the filers’ remaining debts are not discharged, leaving them right where they started. One bankruptcy judge, who sees filers once they can no longer make the required payments in the plans, said the debtors usually do not have enough income to stick with the budget.“They thought they could cut back on this or that, and you might be able to do that for three or four months,” said the judge, C. Ray Mullins, chief judge for the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Northern District of Georgia. “But in a Chapter 13, it will be either three or five years. There are certain things you can’t anticipate — a spike in gas prices.”The study has two parts. One used data from actual bankruptcy cases from the Consumer Bankruptcy Project, the most detailed trove of information on filers currently available. The project surveyed 2,400 households nationwide who filed for bankruptcy in 2007.Results from the second part of the study, which illustrated the lawyer’s influence in determining which bankruptcy chapter to choose, came from a survey sent to lawyers asking them questions based on fictitious couples who were seeking bankruptcy protection. When the couple was named “Reggie and Latisha,” who attended an African Methodist Episcopal Church — as opposed to a white couple, “Todd and Allison,” who were members of a United Methodist Church — the lawyers were more likely to recommend a Chapter 13, even though the two couples’ financial circumstances were identical.Even though the attorneys’ fees for the more labor-intensive Chapter 13 are more than double the charge for a Chapter 7, some truly distressed debtors will pursue a Chapter 13 anyway, several bankruptcy experts said. That is because they can pay the fee over time, unlike in a Chapter 7, which typically requires a payment before the case is filed. If blacks are perceived as less likely to have the resources — or a family with resources — to come up with a lump sum, some lawyers may be inclined to suggest a Chapter 13, these experts suggested.But Professor Lawless said he and the other researchers accounted for this possibility in their results. As to the possibility that unscrupulous attorneys could push Chapter 13 filings in an attempt to get higher fees, Professor Lawless said that effect should be apparent across all races.He said the study has no information about whether other players in the process — judges and bankruptcy trustees, among others — were contributing to the difference in filings rates.William E. Brewer Jr., president of the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, and a practicing lawyer in Raleigh, N.C., disputed the premise of the study that Chapter 13 was always more burdensome and always required debtors to pay more to their creditors. “The study does not adequately control for the numerous complex factors that dictate chapter choice,” he said. “Having said this, Nacba intends to present the study to its members for discussion and self-reflection.”Other, more limited studies have also shown the higher incidence of Chapter 13 among blacks. In Chicago, the Woodstock Institute, a research and policy group, reported last May that in mostly black communities in Cook County, nearly half the cases from 2006 to 2010 were filed under Chapter 13, compared with 32.8 percent of all cases filed in the county. “For people of color, who historically have fewer assets, preservation of assets is a top priority,” said Tom Feltner, vice president at Woodstock, who added that lawyers often have a financial incentive to push Chapter 13 filings. “It is possible that the higher levels of Chapter 13 in communities of color can be explained by a combination of higher attorney’s fees and a filer’s desire, or advice that elevates a filer’s desire, to preserve as many assets as possible.”Henry E. Hildebrand III, who has served as a Chapter 13 trustee in Tennessee for 30 years, said he had noticed that blacks and other minorities appeared to be overrepresented in Chapter 13 cases. “We should focus not on picking apart the conclusions,” Mr. Hildebrand said, “but use this study as an indication that we should be attempting to fix what has become a complex, expensive, unproductive system.”'"
"'12-01-21,'0','But supporters say that landmark protection will ensure that religious buildings as well as others are not torn down or drastically altered, which they contend has almost happened to the cathedral and the synagogue. Elisabeth de Bourbon, a spokeswoman for the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission, which is working to establish the historic district, acknowledged that landmark status might add cost and time but said critics were exaggerating the consequences.A hint of the stakes involved was on display this week when the commission voted to designate a smaller piece of the East Village as a historic district, just one block of 26 quaint row houses and tenements along East 10th Street on the north side of Tompkins Square Park. The commission, though, moved too slowly to block a developer who wants to build on the roof of 315 East 10th Street, a row house dating to 1847. Critics had argued that a taller structure would ruin the streetscape’s aesthetic line, but the developer received a building permit just in time.The larger district would stretch in zigzag fashion from St. Mark’s Place to Second Street and from Avenue A almost to the Bowery, and take in 330 buildings, including the houses of worship. A proposal to designate the enclave has not yet been placed on the commission’s calendar, but a hearing could be held in the next few months. Preservationists worry that developers could make alterations in the meantime, as has happened with at least four buildings the commission did not protect.The only other historic district in the East Village is a small enclave around St. Mark’s Church in-the-Bowery that was approved in 1969 and embraces buildings on Stuyvesant and East 10th Streets.Preservationists worry about the steady appetite for development in magnetic Manhattan neighborhoods, which the East Village has certainly become. Several years ago, the cathedral considered a proposal to build an apartment house that would rise six stories above the rear of the church, though the idea was abandoned because many parishioners were opposed.Meanwhile at the synagogue, Adas Le Israel Anshei Meseritz, which was built in 1910 on a tenement-size lot on East Sixth Street in what was then still part of the Lower East Side, the two dozen remaining members have talked to developers about tearing down the current structure, retaining only the neo-Classical-style facade. The developers want to replace it with an apartment building that will give the congregation worship space. That plan, members say, would allow the congregation to survive.“They want it to be a museum, but we want to save it,” Sandy Ackerman, son of the longtime rabbi, Pesach Ackerman, said of the preservationists. “If they keep it this way, it will die out.”The synagogue, one of the last of the roughly 500 that dotted the East Village and Lower East Side, is barely holding on and cannot afford the upkeep. One reason it has been able to survive is the octogenarian rabbi’s willingness to work without salary for 42 years.The current controversy was born of an effort to honor the East Village’s offbeat history. Beatniks like Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs and writers like Norman Mailer and W. H. Auden, lived in its low-rent tenements and row houses. In the 1960s, flower children like Hoffman and Jerry Rubin flocked to the neighborhood, and Bill Graham’s Fillmore East on Second Avenue, formerly a Yiddish theater, became a showcase for bands like Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead.Gina Stritch’s memories start later, when young people like her began finding hippies too conventional. She would travel to the East Village from Perth Amboy, N.J., to hunt for black spandex pants, black leather jackets and stiletto heels in the punk-fashion shops and take in the Ramones at CBGB. It was precisely the neighborhood’s anarchic, rough edges that attracted her.“It was kind of seedy and rundown and dangerous,” said Ms. Stritch, 53, who ended up living for a time on East Fifth Street and has recently published a memoir, “CBGB Was My High School.” “There was nothing like it in Perth Amboy.”But the neighborhood’s significant history goes back more than a century before Ms. Stritch, when German immigrants called it Kleindeutschland and Jewish immigrants turned Second Avenue into the Broadway of the Yiddish theater. The influx, later supplanted by Ukrainians and Puerto Ricans, led developers to add floors to single-family row houses that had been as elegant as those lining Washington Square. Tenements with a range of styles cropped up as well, and together they gave the East Village its scattershot ambience.Some German social halls are still there serving other purposes, and the Yiddish theaters now offer movies or entertainment like “Stomp.” Indeed, Second Avenue for several blocks below Sixth Street has essentially the same streetscape of a hundred years ago.The proposed landmark district would include gems like the Aschenbroedel Verein, a society of German musicians that became the LaMama Experimental Theater Club; the headquarters of Dorothy Day’s Catholic Worker newspaper; the Hebrew Actors’ Union building, constructed in 1925 and a still functioning labor organization; and McSorley’s Old Ale House, opened in 1854 and still serving beer.Andrew Berman, executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, said neighborhood buildings had already disappeared, among them St. Ann’s Armenian Rite Catholic Cathedral on East 12th Street and the Variety Theater, a surviving nickelodeon-era playhouse, on Third Avenue.“Buildings are being lost as we speak,” he said.Just outside the proposed district is the headquarters of the Hells Angels, on East Third Street — another symbol of the East Village’s untamed days. Why was it not included?“Regulation of that would have been an interesting challenge,” he said, only half joking.'"
"'12-01-21,'0','Federal prosecutors seem to have thrown the book at Megaupload. The indictment asserts that the company’s business model depended on people violating copyright and that it gave them incentives to do so, while charging subscription fees for watching video and placing ads in front of material it did not own.When asked to remove copyrighted works, the indictment says, Megaupload at best removed a particular version but left copies elsewhere in its system.Federal prosecutors assert that although the site claimed to be protected under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or D.M.C.A., the business was in fact a sham that made $175 million off $500 million in copyrighted goods. Web sites that operate in the United States are typically offered “safe harbor” for copyright violations under the D.M.C.A., as long as they do not profit from the illegitimate material and immediately take it down once contacted.But the act treats violations “very much as a ‘you know it when you see it’ rule,” said Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box.net, a popular online storage company. “You look at how they make money, and you look at how they treat D.M.C.A. requests to take down material.”Megaupload waved the D.M.C.A. flag even though it was based in Hong Kong and many of its executives were in New Zealand. It was a juicy federal target for its sheer size. The site accounted for roughly 1 percent of total Internet traffic in North America, nearly 2 percent of traffic in the Asia-Pacific region and more than 11 percent in Brazil, according to Sandvine, a Canadian company that provides equipment to monitor Internet traffic. The indictment contends that Megaupload has over 180 million registered users and, at one point, was the 30th-most-visited site on the Web.Ira P. Rothken, a lawyer for Megaupload, said on Thursday, “Megaupload believes the government is wrong on the facts, wrong on the law.”Mr. Levie of Box.net noted that his company and Dropbox, as well as the services from Google and Microsoft, were less likely prosecution targets because they depended to a large extent on legitimate corporate purchases of their storage. These services are more focused on sharing within organizations and small groups. While this can make it more difficult for an outsider or the authorities to see who is storing what, it makes it less likely that huge copyright violations are taking place.Lori Shen, a spokesman for YouSendIt, said any comparison between that site and Megaupload would be inaccurate.“YouSendIt is a private and secure business collaboration tool for business users. It provides a secure vehicle to share, send, sign and sync business content online,” Ms. Shen said.Megaupload had its fans in the workplace, too. A study published Thursday by the security firm Palo Alto Networks indicated that the use of Megaupload on corporate networks was greater than the combined use of Box.net, Dropbox and YouSendIt, as measured by the amount of data transferred. Of course, it is not clear how much of that data was work-related and how much was for the purpose of in-cubicle entertainment.After the indictment, a number of Megaupload users took to Twitter to complain that they had used it to back up personal files, to share files with clients and as a collaboration tool.When asked about the Megaupload case, RapidShare, Minus and several other consumer-oriented storage sites offered statements saying that they respected copyright and complied with requests to take down material.The Megaupload indictment came amid a battle in Washington over antipiracy legislation. Some of the recent concern among those in the tech industry about the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, was that it would permit the rapid shutdown of any site that had even a small amount of unauthorized copyrighted material on it, a big risk for sites that accept uploads from users. Backers of the legislation, which has been shelved for now, say it was aimed only at foreign sites that were primarily about piracy.As online storage businesses go, Mr. Levie said, Megaupload was more lucrative than most. “I looked at the list of cars Kim Dotcom owned and wondered if I was in the wrong business,” he said, a reference to the company’s founder.He added: “Then again, I’m not in jail.”'"
"'12-01-21,'0','South Carolina is probably not the ideal state in which to be accused of breaking the matrimonial , then smashing them and jumping up and down on them until they’re just a pile of marital powdery dust. But Newt has framed his sexual history — the parts he isn’t totally denying — in terms of a redemption story. (“I’ve had to go to God for forgiveness.”) Everybody likes a story of the fallen man who rejects his wicked ways and starts a new life. Remember how well did with the one about renouncing alcohol on his 40th birthday? There is, however, a lot of difference between giving up drinking on the eve of middle age and giving up adultery at about the time you’re qualifying for . Cynics might suggest that Newt didn’t so much reform as poop out.Still, he has several things working in his favor, one of which has got to be the public’s lack of appetite for thinking about Newt Gingrich’s sex life at all.Another is that his hound dog persona is old news. Marianne even told the break-up story to Esquire a while back. That version included the memorable description of how Newt had explained that she was a Jaguar, while he needed a , like his squeeze, Callista.This would appear to be a Newtian version of “it’s not you, it’s me.”Conservative Gingrich fans lined up to argue that his bedroom behavior made no difference. Dr. Keith Ablow, a psychiatrist “and member of the Fox News Medical A-Team” opined on the Fox Web site that it actually made Newt a better candidate: “So, as far as I can tell, judging from the psychological data, we have only one real risk to America from his marital history if Newt Gingrich were to become president: We would need to worry that another nation, perhaps a little younger than ours, would be so taken by Mr. Gingrich that it would seduce him into marrying it and becoming its president.”Voters very seldom penalize politicians for sexual misbehavior — unless it’s of a type that suggests the pol in question is a little ... off. (See: sexting pictures of your underwear, having tickling parties with your young male aides, telling your staff you’re going on a and then flying to see your girlfriend in . Really, when you look back, we have been through a lot.)Beyond the hypocrisy of this sort of behavior from a guy who wants to protect the sanctity of holy matrimony from gay couples, there also seems to be a streak of almost crazed self-absorption that runs through the Newt saga. Who would ditch a spouse of 18 years in a phone call? Shortly after she was diagnosed with ? And, of course, he broke up with his first wife while she was battling . Do you see a theme developing here? This is the same guy who proudly announced “I think grandiose thoughts” during the last debate.Campaigning after the ABC News interview broke, Gingrich said: “Callista and I have a wonderful relationship. We knew we’d get beaten up. We knew we’d get lied about. We knew we’d get smeared. We knew there would be nasty attack ads. And we decided the country was worth the pain.”The country is so grateful for your sacrifice.'"

"'12-01-21,'0','It was like something out of a fever dream: Donald Trump air-kissing both of Julie Andrews’s cheeks on the stage of Carnegie Hall, just a few feet from the piano Vladimir Horowitz played for more than 40 years.The occasion for this improbable scene was a benefit concert held on Thursday evening for the American Cancer Society, which honored Mr. Trump and Ms. Andrews for their philanthropy. Titled “A Tribute to Horowitz,” the concert featured, at the great master’s beloved Steinway, Lola Astanova, a 26-year-old native of Uzbekistan who wore slinky, shimmery gowns; spike heels; and $850,000 in jewels borrowed from Tiffany, which sponsored the evening.Ms. Astanova has built an online following with videos of her in tight-fitting outfits, playing the febrile Eastern European Romantic works she has said she prefers. One exception is a video of Ms. Astanova playing her own furious transcription of Rihanna’s “Don’t Stop the Music,” which has been viewed almost 1.5 million times.“Beautiful and talented,” a commenter on her YouTube channel wrote. “A winning combination.”Ms. Astanova arrived at Carnegie with a program featuring standards by Chopin, Rachmaninoff and Scriabin, the composers she has favored on YouTube. With the exception of Chopin’s “Funeral March” Sonata, the works were preludes, études, nocturnes, scherzos: the kind of shorter, dazzlingly colorful, crowd-pleasing pieces that Horowitz, too, used to stuff his programs.Though Ms. Astanova has secure technique, the most memorable part of her recital was her physical performance. She likes to throw back her arms at the end of sections, as if she were doing an arduous pectoral workout, and she finishes most pieces in one of two ways: with her hands cupping her face or her upper body tossed back, ecstatic and spent. As she finished Chopin’s “Ocean” Étude (Op. 25, No. 12) on Thursday, she gasped loudly.Many pianists have succeeded with an arsenal of broad gestures, though Ms. Astanova’s are more exaggerated than most. She seems to be trying to evoke the grandiose, generous spirit of 19th-century pianism, with its heart-on-sleeve emotionalism and aching soulfulness, its valorization of feeling over cool precision.'"
"'12-01-21,'0','TOKYO — The Tokyo Stock Exchange said Friday that it would allow Olympus, the Japanese camera maker that has admitted hiding $1.7 billion in losses, to remain listed after paying a small fine for its false accounting.A delisting probably would have destroyed its share price, which has fallen by half since the scandal began. The decision also makes the company less vulnerable to being dismantled and sold for its parts.Still, the move to keep the company listed brings into sharp relief the inconsistent way Japanese authorities and financial institutions have policed and censured white-collar crime in recent years. Analysts have warned that the inconsistencies are confusing foreign investors and undermining confidence in Japanese equities.The Tokyo exchange, which exercises considerable leeway in deciding whether to keep a troubled stock listed, said that the fraud at Olympus had been “the sole work of a number of participants” and that their actions “had no direct relation to the core business.” The exchange “cannot deem that investor judgment was considerably distorted to the extent of warranting delisting,” it said.Olympus, which also makes medical and industrial endoscopes, will be fined 10 million yen, or $130,000, the maximum penalty set by the exchange. The company will also be placed on a “security on alert” list and will be required to report to the Tokyo exchange, over a period of three years, ways that it is improving its corporate governance.'"
"'12-01-21,'0','“The objective here is to protect the interest of the lender,” said Vik Jain, managing director of Wingspan Insurance Services, which alerts banks when insurance lapses on the mortgages it monitors. “The only way to do that is to force-place that coverage. The lender cannot just call State Farm and renew the policy.”That is certainly true. But banks often outsource this work to vendors that don’t always communicate with each other. While his company tracks loans and alerts the banks, Mr. Jain said, other servicing companies notify the customers that they do not have insurance and actually buy the insurance for the property. Since these servicing companies profit from the sale of the insurance, they are the ones that lose money if homeowners succeed in having the force-placed insurance removed from their accounts.While there are at least a half-dozen pending class-action suits against banks over force-placed insurance practices, relief for consumers is slow in coming and is unlikely to cover all the charges homeowners have incurred.Kai Richter, a lawyer at Nichols Kaster, an employment and consumer rights law firm in Minneapolis, said his firm recently won a $9.65 million class-action suit, Hofstetter v. Chase Home Finance. In that case, Chase had to stop both taking commissions from selling force-placed insurance and requiring insurance above the loan balances. But the only customers who won relief were the 40,000 who were part of the suit, and even then, Mr. Richter said, the award was only enough to refund about two-thirds of their money.Suits like this may prevail and states like New York may succeed in wringing more concessions from banks. But such resolutions take time. What are homeowners doing today as they battle banks’ force-placed insurance, and what should you do if you find yourself in a similar situation?PAY UP The sad truth is that most homeowners will give up before they win a battle against a bank, particularly one that holds the mortgage on their home. Homeowners are at a disadvantage, even if they believe they are right.“When you fight the mortgage company, the mortgage company is going to hold all the cards,” said Keith Crocker, professor of insurance and risk management at Pennsylvania State University who won his own battle over force-placed insurance against Wells Fargo. “If they say you need it, you’ve got to go get it so they don’t force-place with even more expensive coverage. Then you fight them on it.”If this seems to be capitulating, it is. But doing so saves time and may prevent you from falling into the labyrinth of unanswered messages, lost paperwork and mounting fees.DON’T IGNORE IT The initial letters from many banks about the need for insurance are computer-generated and easy to ignore. Homeowners may think they already have the coverage or do not need what is suggested. That may be true, but not making that clear to the bank has serious ramifications.James Yates, a professor of education at the University of Texas, Austin, said his home on Lake Travis was fully paid for when he borrowed $200,000 against it to buy a condominium closer to his office. He had lived in the house for 21 years without being asked to have flood insurance. So when CitiMortgage began requiring it, he sent the company a letter explaining the situation and kept making his mortgage payments.Now, three years later, Citi is threatening to foreclose on the lake house, worth over $1 million in Mr. Yates’s estimate, to satisfy $8,000 in fees he accrued, including the $2,250 a year for force-placed flood insurance he has not paid. (He bought his own policy for $346 a year in October 2010 but said that did not satisfy the bank.) Now, he receives a letter each month saying Citi is going to foreclose on his house.“It’s always kind of in the back of your mind that someone is going to foreclose on your house,” he said. “This house out here was free and clear.”But his greatest frustration, he said, is how hard it is to get someone on the phone to answer his lawyer’s inquiries. Mark Rodgers, a spokesman for Citibank, disputed Mr. Yates’s claims that the bank had not been responsive and said that the home was in a special flood hazard area and so was required to have flood insurance.Don Staton is in an equally vexing situation. In 2008, when Wells Fargo took over Wachovia, which held the mortgage on his home in Boca Raton, Fla., he said he heard talk that Wells Fargo no longer required windstorm insurance, so he let his lapse in 2010. He figured if it was not true the bank would send him a letter telling him to buy it. When none arrived, he said, he thought he had saved himself $2,500 that year.Then in July 2011, he received a letter telling him to buy windstorm insurance for that year, which he did, and another one saying that since he had allowed it to lapse the year before, Wells Fargo was going to retroactively force-place insurance on his home. The cost for the retroactive insurance was $11,784.“They sent me a policy in September 2011 that was for July 2010 to July 2011,” Mr. Staton said. “I offered to settle with them for the $2,500 it would have cost, but they refused to entertain any settlement.”He continues to fight the extra $982 the bank tacked on to his mortgage. Vickee Adams, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, said in an e-mail, “We looked into our customer’s hazard, flood and wind insurance obligations and have determined a way to work with him and satisfy his concerns.”EMBRACE THE ABSURDITY Rick Pullen, who edits an insurance magazine called Leader’s Edge, accepted the force-placed flood policy on a condo he owns at the beach in Fort Myers, Fla., because it was a requirement of his mortgage. He also figured that it would take him hundreds of phone calls to get the $1,500 annual charge removed.“It’s expensive enough that it hurts, but inexpensive enough that you don’t want to take the time to fight it,” he said. “It’s some clerk, some lawyer in the bank saying this is one more way we can protect ourselves.”He said he did not think he needed it since the condo was on the seventh floor. He also said that he would never be able to collect on the policy because it insured the bank’s collateral, not the contents of his condo. (The private insurance policy he could get was so small that it did not satisfy his bank.)Professor Crocker said that no matter how absurd the bank’s stance may seem, homeowners have to fight it.“You’ve got to stop them before they force-place the insurance,” he said. “Once they write the policy, you’re stuck.”'"
"'12-01-21,'0','Speaker , talking with reporters Friday in , where House Republicans held their annual retreat, called the bill “well meaning,” but said it needed “more consensus.”Supporters of the shelved bills as well as opponents pushing an alternative backed by the Internet giants and said differences could be bridged. But privately, Congressional aides and lobbyists say the pressures of an election year make action this year unlikely. Lawmakers will not be eager to brave another firestorm incited by Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other popular Web sites.Senator , Democrat of and a key opponent of the bills, said lawmakers had collected more than 14 million names — more than 10 million of them voters — who contacted them to protest the once-obscure legislation.“It’s going to be a new day in the Senate,” said Mr. Wyden, who is the co-author with Representative , Republican of , of an alternative bill that seeks to choke off money flows to Internet pirates. “The way citizens communicate with their government is never going to be the same.”Mr. Wyden spoke briefly to Senator , the Democrat who was the author of the shelved bill, and both men said they pledged to find a way forward.But Mr. Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made it clear that proponents of his bill, the Protect I.P. Act, felt burned by Internet companies that they said misled citizens into believing the bill would cripple the Internet. The opposition turned illegal on Thursday when the online hacker group brought down the Department of Justice’s Web site.“Assuming everyone’s telling the truth, that they want to stop the theft of property, that they want to stop endangering people with counterfeit goods, then we ought to be able to find common ground,” Mr. Leahy said. “I hope people, when they’re dealing, will deal honestly with you.”The Protect I.P. Act and its counterpart in the House, the Stop Online Piracy Act, had broad bipartisan support when they were drafted by Mr. Smith and Senator Leahy. The bills were pushed hard by the Hollywood studios, recording industry, book publishing world and as antidotes to rampant piracy of American cultural wares by offshore Web sites.But many Internet companies, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, saw the bills as a threat, and said they would stifle creativity on the Internet while forcing search engines and social media to become police officers for the Department of Justice. Other outlets, such as Wikipedia, objected to any proposed laws that could crimp the free flow of information on the Internet.The Internet giants rallied their troops to rise up against such Washington stalwarts as the and the . What had started as a nonpartisan issue began turning to Republican advantage, as Republicans led the flight away from the bill.By Thursday night, senior Republican staff members were boasting that the remaining supporters of the bills were largely Democrats, even though members of both parties had helped draft them.Mr. Leahy went along with Mr. Reid’s decision to back off but made it clear that he was doing so reluctantly.“More time will pass with jobs lost and economies hurt by foreign criminals who are stealing American intellectual property and selling it back to American consumers,” he said in a statement.“The day will come when the senators who forced this move will look back and realize they made a knee-jerk reaction to a monumental problem,” he added. “Somewhere in today, in today, and in many other countries that do not respect American intellectual property, criminals who do nothing but peddle in counterfeit products and stolen American content are smugly watching how the decided it was not even worth debating how to stop the overseas criminals from draining our economy.”'"
"'12-01-21,'0','A strong outlook from I.B.M. and decent results from Intel and Microsoft on Thursday after the market closed signaled that corporate leaders were shaking off nervousness about economic growth and increasing technology spending. Microsoft shares were up 5.7 percent, and Intel edged up 2.9 percent. I.B.M. gained 4.4 percent.“For the time being, investors are pretty much taking earnings in stride,” said Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vt. He added that investors seemed to feel stocks were “very undervalued at these levels, even given the marginal misses they’re making in earnings.”Indeed, investors in recent weeks have been heartened by improving economic data, even though progress has been uneven. Reflecting improved economic sentiment, the Dow Jones Transportation Average, an indicator of the economy’s strength has gained about 2 percent in each of the last two weeks.The Treasury’s 10-year note fell 12/32, to 99 25/32. The yield rose to 2.03 percent, from 1.98 percent late Thursday.In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50, an index of euro zone blue chips, closed down 0.3 percent. The DAX in Germany fell 0.2 percent and the CAC 40 in France was off the same. The FTSE 100 of leading British companies was down 0.2 percent.“Economic news has been a little better than expected and we’ve had a lack of bad news from Europe, so investor interest has been buoyed by a little more optimism in terms of investor acceleration, but today just looks like a consolidation day,” Mr. Dickson said.Improving economic data in the United States along with signs of euro zone stability has helped push the S.& P. 500 up 4.6 percent to start the year.In economic news in the United States, home sales hit an 11-month high in December and the number of properties on the market was the fewest in nearly seven years, pointing to a nascent recovery in the housing sector.The National Association of Realtors said on Friday that existing-home sales increased 5 percent to an annual rate of 4.61 million units, with all four of the nation’s regions recording gains. Sales of both multifamily and single-family homes rose.But a glut of unsold properties that is weighing down on prices and stringent lending practices by banks is likely to make progress painfully slow. There were 2.38 million unsold homes on the market last month, the fewest since March 2005. That represented a 6.2-month supply at December’s sales pace, the lowest since April 2006 and down from a 7.2-month supply in November.The Realtors group noted, however, that the inventory of unsold homes tended to decline in winter.'"
"'12-01-21,'0','G.E. reported that its operating earnings rose 6 percent to $4.1 billion, which excludes the previous year’s contribution from NBC Universal. G.E. had owned NBC Universal but sold a majority stake to Comcast.Net earnings attributable to the company fell 18 percent, to $3.7 billion, largely because the year-ago quarter included the proceeds of the sale of BAC Credomatic GECF, a lending company in Central America. Profit in the 2011 fourth quarter was also reduced by a one-time charge for provisions for loan losses on a Japanese consumer finance business; G.E. sold the business in 2008 but continues to hold liabilities. The company’s operating earnings per share rose 11 percent, to 39 cents a share. The result partly reflects fewer shares outstanding than the year-earlier quarter, because the company bought back shares, and was just above analysts’ average estimate of 38 cents a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue for the quarter declined 8 percent, to $38 billion. That was below Wall Street’s forecast of $40 billion. Part of the falloff is explained by the absence of the NBC Universal revenue in 2011; revenue from continuing operations rose 4 percent. But the loss of NBC Universal was accounted for in analysts’ calculations. The revenue result not only disappointed analysts but also came in about $1 billion below the company’s internal forecasts a month or so ago, mainly because some anticipated industrial equipment sales were delayed and because demand weakened in Europe, Keith S. Sherin, chief financial officer, said in an interview.Most of G.E.’s profit growth continues to come from GE Capital, the business seen as the company’s Achilles’ heel when the financial crisis hit in 2008. Before the credit crisis, the unit had grown well beyond its traditional business of financing sales of the company’s industrial equipment into home mortgages in Britain and consumer finance in Japan. In the boom years, the big finance arm contributed as much as half of corporate earnings.But in 2009, General Electric was forced to slash its dividend, the first such cut since the Great Depression. And GE Capital began the lengthy process of shedding bad loans and trimming the finance business.Today, GE Capital is smaller but healthier. Its revenue declined 9 percent to $10.7 billion, but its operating profits rose 58 percent to $1.6 billion, as earnings rebounded from depressed levels earlier.But future gains in profits will have to come from G.E. industrial businesses, which now contribute nearly three-fourths of total profits. In a conference call. Jeffrey R. Immelt, G.E.’s chief executive, said that the company’s top priority was to “grow industrial earnings by more than 10 percent.”Revenue in industrial businesses as diverse as jet engines, power generators, medical-imaging equipment and windmills rose 10 percent to $26.8 billion. The result was helped by strong sales of jet engines and gas turbines in the Middle East. G.E.’s backlog of industrial orders rose to a record $200 billion, up from $175 billion last year.Operating profits grew by 2 percent, to $4.3 billion. Profits were held down by weaknesses in some businesses like wind turbines and household appliances, which are included in the industrial group. Competitive price pressure has also trimmed margins in energy businesses, including power generators and oil and gas equipment.Ripples from the financial turmoil in Europe are hurting sales of some industrial products, like medical equipment, which were down 13 percent in Europe. “We’re preparing for a recession in Europe and that’s what we expect,” Mr. Immelt said.Despite uncertainties, G.E. emphasized that it would continue to make long-term investments, including last year’s 16 percent increase in research and development spending. Partly as a result, the company says it plans to introduce 800 new products this year.G.E.’s finance business is now regulated like a bank, by the Federal Reserve. For six months, the Fed has been reviewing G.E.’s books to determine if it is healthy enough to restore its previous practice of paying about 45 percent of its earnings to the parent company. If that approval comes, the parent company would receive $3.2 billion in 2012, to raise dividend payments to shareholders or other uses, estimates Richard Tortoriello, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.'"
"'12-01-21,'0','“By the end of the year, HDD price could come back to preflood level for certain drives,” said Fang Zhang, an analyst at IHS iSuppli, a market forecasting company based in the United States. He used the acronym for hard disk drives.John Coyne, the president and chief executive of Western Digital, which makes about one-third of the world’s hard drives, said this past week that production in the company’s factories in Thailand would not return to preflood levels until September. About 60 other companies that produce hard drives and components were flooded, he said.The challenges facing all flood-affected companies in Thailand are apparent during a drive through the Nava Nakorn industrial zone. Rotting furniture and rusted file cabinets are strewn outside a Panasonic factory. Workers brought in from Cambodia are cleaning up — dredging filthy drainage ditches and cleaning up trash in front of a JVC facility. But more than a month after the last puddles of floodwater dried in the tropical sun, parts of Nava Nakorn, which means “new city,” still resemble a municipal dump. Large piles of garbage bags sit beside roads fissured and potholed by the floods.Many buildings bear the telltale scar of the floodwaters — a high water mark about two meters above street level.For most factories, the hopes of recovering machinery seems to have been dashed by the prolonged exposure to corrosive, polluted water — in some cases two months.One manager at a factory that produces components for television sets described his machinery as “100 percent killed in action.” Mr. Nipit estimates that about 60 percent of machinery will be thrown away.As they rebuild, many foreign investors seem anxious and uncertain whether the Thai government is taking enough measures to prevent another round of flooding during future monsoons.On Friday, factory managers attended a presentation about future flood prevention measures. By August, the Nava Nakorn industrial zone is to resemble a fortress, with a giant flood wall around the perimeter and sealable aluminum flood barriers across entrance points.But the audience at the presentation peppered the managers of the industrial zone with skeptical questions about the timetable of rehabilitation and the reliability of future flood forecasting.Mr. Coyne, the Western Digital president, also delivered a relatively frank message to the Thai government at a separate meeting earlier in the week. Thailand needs “a credible plan, well executed with measurable milestones along the way,” he said. “And we need to define those milestone quickly.” He urged the government to speed up flood prevention measures. “We have to ensure that we have no self-inflicted wounds in 2012,” he said. The monsoon season begins in May.Before the floods last year, the concentration of hard-drive manufacturing in Thailand kept prices down because of economies of scale and the proximity of suppliers to one another. But the floods showed how risky this arrangement was.Mr. Coyne said Thailand’s reputation was on the line. The No. 1 expectation of customers was that hard drives are available when they need them, he said.“We need to work together to restore that guarantee of uninterrupted, predictable supply so that our customers will continue to believe in us — and believe in Thailand,” he said.On Friday, the Thai prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, presented a plan to mitigate future flooding that includes reforestation, better coordination of the release of water from hydroelectric dams and a streamlining of decision-making when the risk of flooding arises.“We will see how we can manage effectively to drain the water to the ocean and the canals as soon as possible,” she said.Ms. Yingluck’s government, which came to power last August just as the flooding was intensifying, has been widely criticized for disseminating inconsistent and inaccurate reports during the floods.“The information that we obtained from the government was useless,” Mr. Nipit said. “It was all misinformation.”As reconstruction grinds on, Mr. Nipit and his colleagues are beseeching foreign factory managers for patience.Prajak Visuttakul, another manager of the Nava Nakorn industrial zone, told the representatives of dozens of companies that water supplies would not be fully restored until May.A former major general in the Thai Army, Mr. Prajak bowed to the audience made up of largely Japanese managers.“We are sorry for this inconvenience,” he said. “This is the fastest we can do.”'"

"'12-01-22,'0','Beyond the town of Hull, Mr. Delahunt’s clients include at least three others who received millions of dollars in federal aid with his direct assistance while he was in Congress, records show.Mr. Delahunt declined repeated requests for an interview last week. In a statement released through his office on Friday, he also declined to respond to specific questions about his work, but said: “I want to be clear — I have no federal lobbying relationship with any past or current client. I have not lobbied anyone in Washington since leaving Congress.“Further, while in Congress, I had no conversations with anybody regarding any future consulting contract,” he said, “and I am extremely proud of our work and the assistance we were able to bring to many communities throughout our district.” Federal law prohibits former congressmen from lobbying some ex-colleagues for one year after leaving office.Mr. Delahunt was a natural choice for the job, said Philip E. Lemnios, town manager for Hull, because he was familiar with the stalled project and did impressive work getting the seed money for it while in Congress. The town now hopes to get $60 million or more in federal, state and private funds for four offshore wind turbines that might someday power the entire town and serve as a model for other towns.“Obviously he’s got connections into the federal government that we don’t have,” Mr. Lemnios said in an interview. “We’re hoping he can open doors at the federal level that we could never open.”An affable New Englander known for close ties with Republicans as well as fellow Democrats, Mr. Delahunt, 70, has quickly established himself as a go-to lobbyist in the Boston-Washington corridor.He has capitalized on relationships he developed with many Massachusetts groups in his 14 years representing one of the state’s most affluent districts, which includes Cape Cod and Martha’s Vineyard.The Mashpee Wampanoag tribe, for instance, paid the Delahunt Group at least $40,000 to lobby for approval of a casino. Mr. Delahunt had secured Congressional earmarks for the tribe totaling $400,000 in 2008 and 2009 for a substance abuse program and other projects, the records show.The city of Quincy, Mass., meanwhile, brought on Mr. Delahunt last year to help deal with federal officials on a downtown redevelopment program. In 2008, Mr. Delahunt secured nearly $2.4 million in earmarks for the city on a separate tidal restoration project.And a fishermen’s group on the elbow of Cape Cod hired Mr. Delahunt to navigate regulatory issues; he had helped the group get a low-interest, $500,000 federal loan in 2010, records show. The group, which thanked Mr. Delahunt, then a congressman, for his help getting the loan, used the money to renovate a historic coastal home as its headquarters.“Bill was an ally of small boat fishermen in Massachusetts, absolutely,” said John Pappalardo, chief executive of the group, the Cape Cod Commercial Hook Fishermen’s Association.After Mr. Delahunt left Congress, the fishermen’s group hired him “to get the lay of the land politically” about possible changes in federal and regional fishing policies, Mr. Pappalardo said. The group paid the Delahunt Group $14,000 last year for its work, according to lobbying records filed in Massachusetts.“He was sort of like an emissary,” Mr. Pappalardo said in an interview.With nearly 400 former members of Congress hired as lobbyists or corporate “consultants” in the last decade, it has become commonplace for ex-members to work for groups or industries that they had helped get financing while in office.For example, former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who is seeking the Republican nomination for president, has drawn criticism over possible conflicts stemming from his earmarks. After leaving the Senate, he was paid $65,000 in consulting fees from a lobbying shop that represented clients he had helped with earmarks.Mr. Delahunt’s financial connections to the energy project are much more direct, however.“That’s not something I’ve ever heard of,” Kenneth A. Gross, a Washington lawyer who specializes in political ethics issues, said when asked about a former congressman receiving fees from earmarks he appropriated.Several issues could influence whether the unusual arrangement was considered illegal or unethical, Mr. Gross and other ethics lawyers said.Questions include whether Mr. Delahunt knew that he might go work for the town at the time he requested the earmarks; whether federal funds were being used to “lobby” Congress in violation of federal restrictions; which federal officials Mr. Delahunt’s firm contacted as part of its work; and whether those contacts fell within the one-year “cooling off” period.Barney Keller, communications director for the Club for Growth, an influential conservative group in Washington that tracks earmarks, said: “I cannot recall such an obvious example of a member of Congress allocating money that went directly into his own pocket. It speaks to why members of Congress shouldn’t be using earmarks.”Mr. Delahunt, a former district attorney who was known in Congress for embracing liberal causes, also became known over his time in Washington for bringing home federal money. He was particularly active in 2009, ranking in the top fifth of all House members, with more than $46 million in earmarks, including the Hull and Mashpee tribe grants, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit research group in Washington.On retiring in early 2011, he told home-state reporters that he was hesitant to go the typical route of lobbying. But within a few months he did just that, starting the Delahunt Group, where he serves as chairman. He brought in three top congressional aides to help lead it and set up four offices in Massachusetts and Washington, and joined with a national law firm and another lobbying shop as well.“This is nowhere as stressful as being a congressman,” he told The Cape Cod Times last June as he showed off the firm’s new office on the cape.But he rejected any suggestion that he was cashing in on his time in Congress. “To say that former members wouldn’t use the skill set they developed, particularly if they are passionate about the interests of their clients, I really think is wrong-headed,” he told the newspaper.But concerns about possible financial conflicts have already slowed the Delahunt Group’s work on the wind energy project in Hull.Executives at Mr. Delahunt’s firm have been working informally on the energy project for several months, attending meetings and offering guidance, and they are expected to meet with “key federal and state officials” and provide advice on securing grants for the project, according to a draft of the $15,000-a-month contract.But the town and the Delahunt Group have delayed signing a formal contract for at least a few weeks. They want to first make certain that Energy Department officials have no concerns about Mr. Delahunt’s unusual dual roles in earmarking the money for the project and now getting paid as a consultant to work on it, according to Mr. Lemnios, the Hull town manager, and Mark Forest, the Delahunt Group’s executive director.“So far, they don’t have an issue with it,” Mr. Lemnios said. “But it would be a natural thing for people to think there might be a conflict of interest, and if people do have questions about a conflict, we want to be able to address that.”'"
"'12-01-22,'0','Six months after barely closing a $712 million deficit, Chicago Public Schools officials have spent nearly $10 million that has not yet been budgeted in their aggressive push to lengthen the school day.Fifty schools have gone to a longer day this year. With the entire city school system moving to a seven-and-a-half-hour school day next year, parents and community members are questioning how the cash-strapped district plans to pay for the extended time at more than 675 schools.Becky Carroll, the school district’s spokeswoman, said that cuts would need to be made elsewhere to allow the costs of a longer day to fit into the district’s nearly $6 billion budget.“A budget is about priorities, and you invest in what your priorities are,” she said. “At the end of the day, this is a critical priority.”The schools that have already extended their hours have added 90 minutes to their day in exchange for staff bonuses and financial incentives of up to $150,000 per school. The district announced last week that it would award $100,000 grants to 30 more schools that develop innovative ways to use the additional time.'"
"'12-01-22,'0','“The people who have been unable to switch off of heating oil will be increasingly penalized in the coming years,” said Jay Hakes, a former administrator of the Energy Information Administration and now the director of the Library and Museum. “There’s going to be a continuing incentive to get off heating oil, because every day the headlines and experts say that over the foreseeable future, we will have natural gas at attractive prices.”Nationwide, the average household using oil spent $2,298 on heat last year, compared with $724 spent by gas users and $957 spent by electricity users, according to the Energy Department.This year, heating oil users are expected to spend 3.7 percent more than last year, while natural gas customers are expected to spend 7.3 percent less and electricity users will spend 2.4 percent less, according to the department.Cheap natural gas was part of the appeal for Gus Kontoudakis, who spent about $3,000 to switch from oil at the home he rents out in Plainfield, Conn. The boiler was due for replacement anyway, he said. He already had gas at his restaurant, Gus’s Pub and Pizzarama. “I checked the bill and saw the difference and convinced myself to change it and give a break to my tenants,” he said, adding that the oil heat was costing him about double what he now paid Yankee Gas.But many oil users — living in places like , Maine and even affluent parts of — do not have that option. Some are simply too far from a pipeline. For others, converting to natural gas is unaffordable, with costs that can run to tens of thousands of dollars for each home. As a result, they are trapped in a cycle of spending more and more for heat while those who use natural gas and electricity are generally spending less and less.That dynamic is at work in households across the economic spectrum, but the cost gap looms as a crisis for the poor, experts warn, since the federal government has cut financing for energy assistance programs.“We’re concerned about a public health problem if there isn’t additional money found,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors’ Association. “We’ve really never been in a situation before where we’re going into the winter with very high prices” for heating oil, he said, adding that the highest prices tended to come near the middle or end of the season.The use of heating oil, which rose after as a replacement for , has been on a long decline. As the use of virtually every other fuel has increased, the number of households that use heating oil has dropped from about 20 percent in 1975 to roughly 7 percent today, spurred by new home construction and population shifts to the West and South, closer to natural gas fields and pipelines. Government incentives for installing insulation also cut consumption of heating oil.For decades, the prices of oil and gas moved virtually in tandem, but in recent years, vast increases in American gas supplies have made gas decisively cheaper.Meanwhile, heating oil could grow more scarce in the Northeast this winter, the Energy Department warned last month. Companies have been closing refineries that produce heating oil because of declining profit margins. and recently announced the idling of two major refineries in Pennsylvania, and a third refinery owned by Sunoco may close next summer.Encouraged by the low prices for natural gas and government and utility incentives, more oil customers have been looking to make the switch.Thomas Dziki of Richmond Hill, , said it was a $750 bill to fill up his 150-gallon oil tank last winter that prompted him to call National Grid to convert. He spent about $8,500 to switch his three-story home to gas. Now, his monthly bills are in the $30 to $50 range — so low, he said, that “you almost want to call and say, ‘Sorry, you’re not billing me enough.’ ”For larger buildings in , there is increased pressure to switch because of a new pollution regulation that will phase out the use of the heavier heating oils.But conversion costs can be prohibitive, in part because Con Edison, the local utility, has to rip up the street to run pipes larger than those used for cooking gas.“As a consumer, I’m very frustrated,” said Nancy T. Schmitt, an energy-sector whose Upper East Side co-op burns the densest form of oil. Her complex of about 50 units is weighing whether to switch to natural gas or to a lighter fuel to meet the new rules. “I’m paying a high price for a dirty fuel, and I’ve got a cleaner fuel available and I want to see it happen,” said Ms. Schmitt, who was trained as an environmental engineer.But by one estimate, she said, it would cost $2 million to connect her complex to the existing lines. Con Ed has been working to help organize buildings into clusters for conversion, to lower costs and diminish the inconvenience.Ultimately, heating oil faces a grim future, said Bob LaFlamme, who took over Crowley Fuel in North Brookfield from his wife’s family 23 years ago.“People are looking for alternatives,” he said, adding, “Even one of my own employees switched over, so that’s telling you something.”'"
"'12-01-22,'0','Gas and oil prices used to run in tandem, and gas prices were at times extremely volatile. But since 2003, even as heating oil use, heavily concentrated in the Northeast, has declined, its price has risen sharply above gas, a gap that is expected to continue widening.'"
"'12-01-22,'0','Mr. Romney’s own time in the private equity business, at Bain Capital, has provoked fierce attacks from Republican rivals and others. It has also prompted a lot of questions, including the big one: What good is this business, anyway? Detractors say private equity has enriched a handful of financiers at the expense of ordinary Americans. The deal makers, this line goes, buy companies and then bleed the life out of them. Jobs are often among the casualties.Whether there’s truth to such claims depends on whom you ask. Private equity executives, as well as Mr. Romney, who left Bain in 1999, say the industry fixes troubled companies and ultimately creates jobs. Whatever the case, three decades after this sort of deal-making burst onto the scene in the merger mania of the 1980s, there are surprisingly few solid answers from either side.What is certain is that buyout specialists upended the old order and made vast fortunes for themselves. Fueled by easy money from banks, and from endowments and pension funds, these private investors were able to buy companies with borrowed money and put down relatively little of their own cash.Today, many of these private kingdoms rival the nation’s mightiest public companies. In all, the private equity industry oversees $3 trillion in global assets, according to Preqin, the research firm. Buyout kings control more than 14,000 American companies, including brands like Hilton Hotels and Burger King.BUT financiers weren’t the only ones to embrace private equity. On the campaign trail, Rick Perry called private equity artists “vulture capitalists.” But as governor of Texas, he blessed the largest corporate buyout in history — the $44.4 billion takeover of the utility TXU by several investment firms in 2007. Indeed, as in many other places nationwide, public pension funds in Texas used public money to bet on private equity, in hopes of generating the investment returns they needed to pay retirees.Against this backdrop, the story of Marc Leder might seem a footnote in the nation’s economic ledger. But it is a story worth knowing. That’s because, in many ways, Mr. Leder personifies the debates now swirling around this lucrative corner of finance.To his critics, he represents everything that’s wrong with this setup. In recent years, a large number of the companies that Sun Capital has acquired have run into serious trouble, eliminated jobs or both. Since 2008, some 25 of its companies — roughly one of every five it owns — have filed for bankruptcy.Among the losers was Friendly’s, the restaurant chain known for its Jim Dandy sundaes and Fribble shakes. (Sun Capital was accused by a federal agency of pushing Friendly’s into bankruptcy last year to avoid paying pensions to the chain’s employees; Sun disputes that contention.) Another company that sank into bankruptcy was Real Mex, owner of the Chevy’s restaurant chain. In that case, Mr. Leder lost money for his investors not once, but twice.Yet Mr. Leder doesn’t seem to be suffering too much himself. In fact, he is living so large that he can’t avoid the limelight. Last July, he used part of his personal fortune to join a group of investors in buying the Philadelphia 76ers. In December, he was spotted on St. Bart’s with Russell Simmons, of Def Jam and Phat Farm fame, and Rachel Zoe, the celebrity stylist. That again landed him in The New York Post, which dubbed him a “private equity party boy.”Mr. Leder says that characterization couldn’t be further from the truth. He focuses on what are known as “scratch and dent” deals, which typically involve companies that are struggling to begin with. One-third of the companies Sun Capital has bought are losing money. It’s a tricky game in good times, and downright dangerous in bad ones. Mr. Leder and his defenders say Sun Capital has saved many companies and, with them, many, many jobs.“I think the portrayal of me as having wild and crazy parties is absolutely incorrect,” Mr. Leder said during a wide-ranging interview in Sun Capital’s offices in Midtown Manhattan. “I spend a small percentage throwing some parties, attending some parties. I like music. I like to dance. But rather than reporting on how I spend 340 days and nights of my year, the media likes to report on the other 25.”Paul Jones, chief executive of the Midwest retailer ShopKo, which Sun Capital acquired in 2005, said Mr. Leder has kept a close eye on his company. “I get e-mails from him, usually on Sunday mornings, in which he’s says we had an impressive week or sometimes it’s just to give our team an ‘attaboy,’ ” Mr. Jones said.FOR more than 28 years, Helen Smolak worked at the Friendly’s in Denham, Mass. Day in and day out, she served Big Beef Burgers and Fribbles, collected tips and made a decent living.All that changed one evening last October. That was when Ms. Smolak’s supervisor called to tell her the restaurant was shutting down — immediately.“It was my family. That was my home,” said Ms. Smolak, 56. “Friendly’s always came first. I was supposed to retire with these people and with this company.”What went wrong? Sun Capital acquired Friendly’s in 2007 for $395 million — an 8 percent premium based on Friendly’s stock price at the time. But now Sun was saying the weak economy and the rising prices of milk and other ingredients had pushed Friendly’s, a 76-year-old chain, to the brink.The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency that helps safeguard corporate pensions, wasn’t so sure. It accused Sun Capital in bankruptcy court filings of using the bankruptcy to shift Friendly’s pension burden onto the agency.“That’s absolutely not true,” Mr. Leder said. Friendly’s pension fund, he said, was underfunded well before Sun Capital bought the company. The outcome, he added, is simply the way the bankruptcy process works.“We don’t make the rules,” he said with a shrug. He said the matter was settled with the agency for a “nominal” sum.Bankruptcy is never pretty. But, in this case, Sun Capital was particularly adept at getting what it wanted. Only months after Friendly’s went bankrupt, Mr. Leder has already regained control of the company. It was a calculated move, and one that is potentially lucrative for Sun Capital and its investors. In filing for bankruptcy, Friendly’s also cut hundreds of jobs, closed dozens of restaurants and bought some time to regroup. Now, if Sun Capital can turn around Friendly’s, it might eventually be able to sell the chain at a profit.And profit, after all, is what private equity is really about. Among the Sun Capital investors that stand to benefit from all of this are the New York State Teachers’ Retirement System, the Indiana State Teachers’ Retirement Fund and the Ford Foundation.Jeffrey States is the investment officer for the Nebraska Investment Council, another Sun Capital investor. He said some private equity firms do provide information about how their dealings might affect things like jobs. But not all investors ask for such details.Mr. Leder, for his part, has never been shy about turning a profit. He and another banker, Rodger R. Krouse, were working at Lehman Brothers when they saw the huge money-making potential of private equity. They hatched their plan to get into the business one April afternoon in 1995, after a meeting at Mr. Romney’s Bain Capital in Boston.The executives at Bain had been grousing about a deal in which Bain had doubled its money. But the Bain executives were lamenting that if they had sold sooner, they could have made much more.On the plane back to New York, Mr. Leder and Mr. Krouse sat stunned.“We’re looking at each other saying, ‘This is an industry where double your money is not that good of a deal?’ ” Mr. Leder recalls.At 10 the next morning, Mr. Leder and Mr. Krouse marched into their bosses’ offices and quit. They then decided to base their new private equity firm in Boca Raton, and became its co-chief executives, believing the location would give them an edge in spotting potential acquisitions in the Southeast before their rivals in New York and Boston. But competitors kept outbidding them for companies.It took 20 months, but they finally got their foot in the door. Friends and family members invested in their first dozen deals. Mr. Romney also invested personally in some early transactions, including an acquisition of a company that made speakers for computers and another that made carbon paper.Sun Capital soon carved a niche in doing turnarounds. In 1997, it acquired a majority stake in a maker of injection-molded polypropylene panels. By 2002, that company had more than doubled its sales.One success led to another. Mr. Leder and Mr. Krouse invested $1.5 million in a company that supplied parts for Corvettes and walked away with $20 million. Two Sun investors were so tickled that they bought each man a red Corvette.Such successes aside, Mr. Leder and Mr. Krouse make something of an odd couple. Mr. Krouse has the quiet demeanor of an accountant and tends to shift in his seat when conversations turn to his private life. (Former associates say he is a family man who likes to spend his spare time reading.)Mr. Leder, by contrast, is bigger than life. He storms into a room and seems to suck out all of the air. Several former colleagues say he appears to have a photographic memory. He speaks rapidly and rarely holds back.In a conversation about his business dealings, he segued into how his father wanted him to be a doctor but that he opted for other pursuits because he hated dissecting frogs in biology class. And he mentioned how he used crushed graham crackers as the secret ingredient in the pancakes he used to make for his youngest daughter.He also said he started reading The Wall Street Journal when he was 12, and that in high school he delivered chickens and started a D. J. business. And he said that he typically sleeps for two to three hours at a time at night before waking up to answer e-mails.AS word got out about Sun Capital’s early investment successes, pension funds and endowments were soon clamoring to get into its funds. Sun Capital raised fund after fund, each bigger than the last. In 2007, it raised $6 billion for a single fund. Sun Capital had hit the big time.Then the Great Recession struck. The private equity boom turned bust fast.By early 2009, numerous companies that Sun Capital had acquired were struggling to survive. Sun was racked by internal dissent. And Mr. Leder’s personal life had hit a rough patch.By that spring, several Sun companies, including Drug Fair, Big 10 Tires and Mark IV Industries, had spiraled into bankruptcy. The firm had already taken losses on a large deal, a hostile takeover of the fashion company Kellwood, which Sun Capital had acquired without the usual due diligence.Then came other, more personal blows. Mr. Leder and Mr. Krouse both lost money that they had personally invested with Bernard L. Madoff. Mr. Leder and his wife of 22 years, Lisa, began to go through a messy divorce. She demanded half of his total wealth, which she contended was more than $400 million at the time. The two eventually settled for an undisclosed amount.Its business in retreat, Sun Capital laid off a number of its own employees. Those who stayed were told they would receive no cash bonuses. Instead, everyone was given a bigger slice of the portfolio of companies that, at that time, was losing value every day.Angry employees fired off a list of dozens of pointed questions to Mr. Leder and Mr. Krouse, asking how much money the two co-founders had been paid and how much they had taken out of Sun Capital. The employees wanted to know how a firm that had just raised a $6 billion fund, and which was collecting about $120 million a year in management fees alone, could possibly be running low on cash.Mr. Leder and Mr. Krouse had, in fact, already paid themselves handsomely for their giant fund. As 50-50 partners, they kept the first year’s fees, in cash, for themselves, according to former employees. A spokesman for Sun Capital declined to comment.Mr. Leder said that even during its worst year, Sun Capital booked a small profit. He denied that his decisions were driven by his own financial interests. And Sun Capital paid its employees cash bonuses early for 2009 , he said, because “we realized we had pulled in the reins a little too hard.”To critics who say that Sun Capital grew too big, too fast, Mr. Leder pointed to ShopKo, which it bought for $1.2 billion. Sun brought in new management, freshened up stores and plans to merge it with another Midwest retailer, Pamida. Sun Capital has already paid itself a dividend on that deal, and Mr. Leder says he expects it will generate big returns.In a smaller deal, Sun Capital bought the Midwest retailer Gordmans for $56 million in 2008. It doubled its returns through two dividend payments and proceeds from the Gordmans initial public offering in 2010.When asked if private equity could withstand the heat of election-year politics, Mr. Leder seems unfazed. He is among the top contributors to the political action committee Restore Our Future, a so-called super-PAC created to help Mr. Romney. He insists his business isn’t politics — it’s private equity.“I don’t worry about what I can’t affect,” he said.'"
"'12-01-22,'0','Last month, the Obama administration issued important guidance to colleges and universities on how to increase racial diversity on campuses, explaining ways to navigate the narrow legal channel charted by the . The benefits of diversity, the said, contribute to “the educational, economic and civic life of this nation.” The administration’s support for such efforts stands in stark contrast to the policy of the to discourage them. That difference has played out between the political parties for decades, as it will in this presidential election.Race-conscious programs in education — affirmative action in college admissions and voluntary integration of public schools — have been embattled for more than 40 years. Since the 1970s, the Supreme Court has restricted the approaches available to remedy racial disparities, but has left room for institutions to consider race in achieving certain broader aims.The war has not ended, however, and three notable lawsuits around the country show the continuing controversy. In March, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit will reconsider ’s ban on affirmative action in public university admissions, which a three-judge panel of the court struck down last summer. By prohibiting race-conscious admissions under the Michigan Constitution, the court said, the ban “reorders the political process in Michigan to place special burdens on minority interests.”In the Fifth Circuit, a three-judge panel a year ago upheld the use of race as a factor in admissions at the University of Texas at Austin. Four-fifths of students there are admitted as graduates in the top 10 percent of their high school classes. But one-fifth are admitted based on individual assessments, including race as a factor, and this program is being challenged. The university is waiting to hear whether the Supreme Court will review that decision.In the Ninth Circuit next month, a three-judge panel will hear an appeal from a district court decision to dismiss a challenge to ’s Proposition 209, which outlawed race-conscious admissions in 1996.Any or all of these cases could end up before the Supreme Court, on which four conservatives have made clear that they would make illegal even narrowly tailored diversity programs. Jr. spoke for himself and Justices , and in 2007 when he wrote in an opinion, “The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.”'"
"'12-01-22,'0','Clint Dempsey became the first American to score a hat trick in England’s Premier League in Fulham’s 5-2 win over Newcastle on Saturday.The 28-year-old Dempsey scored three goals in a 30-minute span in the second half.“We never found our rhythm in the first half, but we began to get into their penalty area in the second half,” Dempsey said. “Luckily, the ball kept going in.”Dempsey scored his first goal to make it 2-1 for the Cottagers in the 59th.Six minutes later, he slotted in a right-footed shot from 10 yards. Then he split two defenders, heading the ball down to himself, and two touches later scored in the 89th minute on a shot from 12 yards.Dempsey has scored a career-best 15 goals this season, including 9 in the Premier League. He scored his first hat trick in England on Jan. 7, against Charlton in the third round of the F.A. Cup.“He is doing what he does best,” Fulham Manager Martin Jol said. “Clint scores goals.

"'12-01-22,'0','Still, some designers caution that most brides will still choose a strapless style. “It’s the most universally flattering,” said Judd Waddell, a wedding dress designer.As noted by Darcy Miller, editorial director of Martha Stewart Weddings magazine, ready-to-wear designers continue to enter the bridal market.Last year, for example, Dennis Basso showed his first collection of wedding gowns for Kleinfeld, and Matthew Williamson, following a collaboration with Net-a-Porter in 2010, introduced his independent bridal line, pushing innovation and creativity and adding an array of styles and silhouettes previously unavailable. Bebe will begin selling a bridal collection, Rami Kashou for Bebe, in March. Among the fashion-inspired details that buyers saw on recent runways were peplums (Lela Rose), leg slits (Angel Sanchez), high-low hems (Monique Lhuillier), one-shoulder silhouettes (Oleg Cassini) and men’s-wear references.Regarding the latter, Oscar de la Renta showed pants, and Theia had a tuxedo-inspired jumpsuit, while Bhldn plans to offer cigarette pants, a vest and lace shorts in its next spring collection. “I was thinking of the sophisticated girl, who is just as cool and just as chic, and wouldn’t be caught dead in a dress,” Don O’Neill, Theia’s creative director, said of his tuxedo look.Juli Alvarez, fashion and beauty director of colincowieweddings.com, commented on the jumpsuit look. “I think that the trend of jumpsuits for brides might be a bit of a stretch,” she wrote in an e-mail. “Maybe it’s more of a second- or third-wedding look.”A black wedding dress? Vera Wang’s latest bridal collection included several. “She was clearly making a fashion statement,” said Mark Ingram, whose eponymous boutique in Manhattan stocks Ms. Wang’s and other upscale bridal collections. “It shows the range of choice that a bride has.”Ms. Wang was not alone in pushing the color envelope. Oscar de la Renta, who first showed a hint of color on his bridal runway in 2006, whipped up creations in palest blue and petal pink; Claire Pettibone sent a blue-toile lace trumpet gown down her spring runway. Ms. Pettibone first used color in her 2007 collection, but wrote in an e-mail that she has become bolder in the use of color over the years.“First you’d see color in the trims — a sash or some embroidery — but now it’s really the dress,” said Ms. Alvarez, who added that her favorite new bridal-gown color is peach because it’s not such a departure from white and ivory, and favors a lot of different skin tones.Prints are also filtering into the mainstream. Dan Rentillo, design director for David’s Bridal, said that dresses that the company made in a soft watercolor fabric for key stores sold so well last year that they will be sold in all of its retail locations. “We didn’t expect the response to be that overwhelming,” Mr. Rentillo said.The royal wedding and the Kardashian spectacle did share one thing: white bridesmaid dresses. Pippa Middleton’s white cowl-neck dress and the Kardashian sisters’ strapless ivory mermaid numbers gave a boost to another rule-breaking concept: the all-white bridal party.David’s Bridal and Bhldn report an uptick in sales of white and ivory attendant dresses. “All white is fine for a bridesmaid as long as the silhouette and the drape is very understated, so the attention remains on the bride,” said Jacqueline Weppner, a New York bridal stylist and blogger.The veil is no longer de rigueur, and while many brides still choose one (overlong ones were seen swishing down recent bridal runways), those who do often wear veils just for the ceremony. “The new trend is to wear it quickly as you can for the ceremony, then switch to a fascinator or a comb for the reception,” Ms. Weppner said.The options don’t end there. “Ten years ago when my friends were getting married, it was if you didn’t wear a tiara, you didn’t wear anything,” said Jennifer Behr, an accessories designer whose bridal collection includes ethereal crystal head wraps, hand-pressed silk flowers and feathered headbands. “Now the field is wide open.”Thanks in part to Ms. Kardashian and Ms. Bush, across-the-forehead headpieces have made a small comeback, as have birdcage veils. (Janie Bryant, the “Mad Men” costume designer, wore one for her wedding last fall.)And even tiaras — yet another royal influence.'"
"'12-01-22,'0','AFTER midnight, when most college students are cavorting or cramming, Jeremy Gleick is just settling into his “learning hour.” He occasionally curses when the hour looms so late, but he still does it.For two and a half years, Mr. Gleick, a sophomore majoring in bioengineering at the University of California, Los Angeles, has devoted an hour a day to learning something new. His rule: It can’t be related to schoolwork, or merely reading a novel. Even if he’s sleeping at a friend’s house, he squeezes in his hour. “At some point in the evening, I just excuse myself and go do it.” He recently passed his 1,000th hour of self-study, most of it done online.It all began junior year at Berkeley High with the philosophizing that came with the run-up to college applications. “I was spending a lot of time asking, ‘Why are we here, and to what end?’ ” Mr. Gleick says. He concluded that learning was what mattered most. He sat down and watched a documentary on gamma ray bursts. A few days later, he did some reading on transhumanism, and then spent an hour two days in a row trying to become ambidextrous. After a month straight, he missed a day, which somehow felt off. Since then he’s kept up a perfect streak.The topics, neatly logged on an enormous spreadsheet, organized by category and subcategories, jump from left brain to right, through civilizations, from astrophysics and alchemy to the Zulu. His chart tally reveals he has spent a total of 17 hours on art history, 39 on the Civil War period and 14 on weaponry. On the lighter side, he has tackled juggling, glass blowing, banjo and mandolin.Most material he finds, for free, on iTunes U, including full courses from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford lasting 20 to 30 days, though he doesn’t always do them consecutively. He often has no topic in mind, and trips over something on the home page. For how-to learning (card tricks, juggling), his go-to site is YouTube. He has used Internet Sacred Text Archive to source myths, and Fora for conference lectures on the Hubble Space Telescope and psychology of lying.'"
"'12-01-22,'0','In the years since, friends and family may not have pegged him as lonely, but “he wasn’t as happy as it seemed he could be,” said his oldest child, Alexander Weiss. “Over the past couple years, he’s been looking a decade older than he should.”In 2007, while Mr. Weiss was helping one of his daughters do research online about Roma children, for a school project, he kept coming across a name that, for decades, he often thought of but never spoke aloud: Leslie Hawke.Ms. Hawke, 59, lives in Bucharest and is a founder of Ovidiu Rom, a Romanian organization that works to provide early education to Roma children. In 2005, she received an Outstanding Citizen Award from the United States Agency for International Development.“Her success rates are unusually high, and I think it’s because normal hurdles don’t daunt Leslie,” said her friend Isabel Fonseca, author of “Bury Me Standing: The Gypsies and Their Journey,” which deals with the Roma community. “She’s taken a very practical approach and can navigate both the highest echelons of bureaucratic government and the slums. She’s incredibly devoted and incredibly cheerful.”Ms. Hawke first went to Romania in 2000, when, in a moment of caprice, she joined the Peace Corps at age 48.“She makes all the pivotal decisions of her life on a whim, and I think her batting average is pretty good,” Mr. Hawke said.One such hasty decision was marrying his father, Jim Hawke, when she was 17.“I was so young, so idealistic,” she said. “And I wasn’t even pregnant.” The couple had been high school sweethearts in Fort Worth.They were on their honeymoon in New York in 1969 when she first met Mr. Weiss, who was a close friend of her husband at Cornell, where both had studied math.Mr. Weiss and Ms. Hawke have a photo of themselves sitting on a railing in Madison Square Park hours after their introduction, looking in opposite directions, a decorous six inches between them. It was taken by another college friend, Dan Schumm.“David was always very serious,” Mr. Schumm said. “An intellectual. He liked talking about ideas and art and philosophy and literature. And Leslie was open and lighthearted and delightful. There was a vibe between them, but no one discussed it.”The following year, Ethan was born. But while her son was still a toddler, Ms. Hawke found herself drawn to Mr. Weiss.“There was something very Henry Jamesian about it,” Ms. Hawke said. “He knew. I knew. Friends may have surmised. But it was never acted on, or even fully verbalized.”Mr. Weiss was still living in Ithaca, N.Y. He then moved to Cambridge, Mass., where he attended Harvard Law School. But he frequently visited Leslie and Jim Hawke in Texas, where they lived.“The situation was always a little awkward,” Mr. Weiss said. “Nothing ever happened, but there was always tension.”She didn’t think he was particularly handsome, “but that wasn’t what it was about,” she said. “He was just extremely intense and interesting. I didn’t like it when he left the room.”In conversations with his college friend, Mr. Weiss always avoided any discussion of Ms. Hawke.“I found her to be just so funny and strong — someone who sees things as they are,” he said.They wrote letters. “But you could read those letters now and you’ve no idea what the subtext was,” he said. “There was this difficulty in the air about it all, and we were trying to do what was best for everybody.”When the Hawkes divorced in 1974, Mr. Weiss decided to sever connections with both friends.“I felt things were just too complicated,” he said. “But I still thought she was pretty spectacular.”In 1995, three years following the end of her second marriage, which lasted a decade, Ms. Hawke tracked down Mr. Weiss online and called him at his office.“I think I expected that sooner or later, he would show up on my doorstep, but he never did,” she said. “Over time, I came to the conclusion that my attraction had just been a goofy infatuation.”On the phone, he was cold. He was still married.“He said he had six home-schooled kids and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ He seemed back-to-nature-y,” she said. “I said something like ‘Maybe you know that Ethan became an actor,’ and he was like, ‘I don’t go to movies.’ ”That was partly a lie. “In truth, I had done all I could to avoid seeing Ethan’s movies or reading his books, for the same reason that I’d avoided being friendly to his mother when she called,” Mr. Weiss said. “I had this young family that was important to me. I couldn’t afford thoughts of Leslie.”Then late last summer, one week after his youngest child left for college, Mr. Weiss went back to the Web page he had mentally bookmarked four years earlier, and followed links until he found an address for the Alex Fund, a New York nonprofit group that Ms. Hawke had started to help finance education programs for disadvantaged Romanians.He wrote a letter to her in care of the Alex Fund, which arrived during one of her trips to New York to visit her four grandchildren.“I saw the handwriting and the name in the corner and I thought ‘Oh. My. God,’ ” she said. “I was dumbfounded. All he wrote was that he’d like to be back in touch.”She showed it to her son. “I said, ‘You read it, what is he really saying? Give me the guy’s point of view,’ ” she recalled. He confirmed her hunch. “He’s interested,” he said.The couple began exchanging e-mails in August. Two weeks in, he said, “If this continues, I’m going to fall in love with you all over again,” she recalled.She was stunned. “He’d never admitted he loved me to begin with,” she said.They tried to talk on the phone, but their one attempt was disastrous, she said, adding, “Neither of us had the courage to suggest Skype.”But then he started writing her poetry. She was giddy and forwarded it to her son.“You really are in love, aren’t you, Mom?” he wrote back.“My only concern is one I always have when someone falls in love — just don’t fall,” Mr. Hawke wrote. “Stay standing. Be patient. Move slowly. Use what you’ve learned. Move forward the way you would advise your granddaughters to move.”Ms. Hawke suggested to Mr. Weiss that it would be sensible to meet in person. They decided on London in early October. She arrived at the May Fair Hotel in a cab that, by happy coincidence, was wrapped in a Tiffany advertisement that made it look like a tied-up blue box. When Mr. Weiss went to Romania to visit her for another long weekend in November, they began discussing marrying and growing old together.The moment he got home after Thanksgiving, he told his children about their plans.“It seemed really precipitous to us,” said his son, Alexander. “From our perspective, it’s a thing of a couple of months, but they have this long history that we knew nothing about. I haven’t seen him this happy in a long time. In the past weeks, he’s seemed to shed years.”For now, they will have a long-distance marriage, meeting every month or two. She plans to return to the United States in 2020; if he retires before then, he will leave his home in Marlborough, Mass., and join her in Romania.She did not see his house until their honeymoon; she met his children on the eve of the wedding, which was attended by their combined seven children and three of their five grandchildren, as well as three dozen friends.“His daughters were wonderfully open to the idea of their father being in love,” she said. “But I think the reality was a little more challenging. One commented that it was weird to have a father start acting like a teen, constantly checking his phone for messages.”“I can barely manage my own life, let alone give an opinion on what’s right for her,” he said. “We’ll see how long the marriage lasts. I’m not saying I have doubts. It’s just that none of us can know the future.”But he said he likes to imagine it will be a bright one.“I’ve never seen her happier than she has been in these last 10 years,” Mr. Hawke said. “She’s found herself and her happiness, and this seems a natural extension of that.”Rabbi Chava E. Koster officiated at a ceremony at the Village Temple in New York. Mr. Hawke, who was the host of the reception at his Chelsea apartment, read W. H. Auden’s “As I Walked Out One Evening.” His friend Jonathan Marc Sherman read Gregory Corso’s long poem “Marriage,” which years ago Ms. Hawke read to her son at bedtime.It’s just that I see love as odd as wearing shoes —I never wanted to marry a girl who was like my motherAnd Ingrid Bergman was always impossibleAnd there’s maybe a girl now but she’s already married“It’s like they’re living out a lifelong fantasy,” said Mr. Schumm, whose photograph of the couple’s first meeting appeared on the cover of the ceremony’s program.Ms. Hawke said: “It would make more sense to wait, but it wouldn’t be nearly as much fun. It just feels like this is my life, this is what’s happening, and it would be artificial to not go with it.“We’re certainly not being cautious. We’re in an altered state. People are goofy when they’re in love.”'"
"'12-01-22,'0','The characters began to accrue. First the boy reporter Tintin, with his plus fours and unflappable tuft of hair; and his dog, Snowy (Milou in French, the nickname of a former girlfriend of Remi’s). And then the rest of the cast: the mercurial and sozzled but stalwart Captain Haddock, the brilliant (but hard of hearing) Professor Calculus, the archfiend Roberto Rastapopoulos and others. Even as a child, Hergé had been a skilled mimic, and that talent animates his creations. At the same time, the characters are oddly detached: except for Captain Haddock, no one has much of a back story. Tintin has none at all, and although he is a reporter, we see him write only one article in the course of the entire canon.What’s most distinctive about Tintin is the artwork. Hergé’s trademark ligne claire style, which developed gradually, dispensed with shading and relied on inked lines of uniform weight. To accentuate that line — “the true backbone,” Hergé would insist — colors were restricted to a range of relatively soft tones. Although the characters were cartoon figures, the backgrounds were realistic, even elegant. Hergé did a vast amount of research into cars, ships, airplanes, animals. His pacing and composition owed much to movies.Benoît Peeters knew Hergé and interviewed him on several occasions toward the end of his life. (He died in 1983.) Peeters also interviewed many of Hergé’s friends and associates, and both of his wives. At one point, Peeters was allowed to explore the drawers and filing cabinets at Hergé Studios, in Brussels. “He had a lot of talent but also a lot of luck,” Hergé’s first wife, Germaine, told Peeters. “Let’s not make a Michelangelo out of him!” Hergé’s writing and drawing evolved mainly through trial and error. He suffered from chronic depression, which worsened as he grew older, but his capacity for work was always prodigious, and at times he thought of little else. He was a pioneer in merchandising and promotion, though an overture to Walt Disney was rebuffed. Like most cartoonists, he was alert to the technique of others, past and present; he especially admired the way George McManus (“Bringing Up Father”) handled noses.As cartoonists often do, Hergé worked his life and preoccupations into his stories. His father and uncle — twins who dressed identically — inspired the hapless detectives Dupont and Dupond (in English, Thomson and Thompson). Tintin himself was modeled on Hergé’s younger brother, Paul. Strangely, Hergé had no particular fondness for children (and had none of his own). Tintin was his progeny, and rarely out of mind. He continually jotted notes to himself on scraps of paper:Tintin is transmitted to all of theA plane is ready to take off.Some passages in “Hergé, Son of Tintin” seem directed at the cognoscenti. The excursions into prewar Belgian politics are not for everyone, even Belgians, and passing references to arcane debates among Tintinologists will mystify many. The biographer of Derrida cannot avoid the occasional nod to “orality” and “sublimation.” Yet Peeters squarely faces two issues that hang over Hergé’s career: his resort to ethnic and racial stereotypes, mainly in the early stories, and his record of accommodation in German-occupied Belgium.The issues can’t be avoided. In both word and picture, the depiction of Africans in “Tintin in the Congo” makes your jaw drop. (“It’s very nice of these blacks to bear us triumphantly to our hotel!”) The villainous financier in “The Shooting Star” has a hooked nose and has been given the name Blumenstein. Some of this work was later revised, imperfectly. And “Tintin in the Congo” has been gingerly treated by publishers and libraries. As for accommodation, Hergé published “Tintin” throughout the war in the collaborationist newspaper Le Soir. Peeters doesn’t excuse any of this (who would?), though he does try to put it in context. He observes that Hergé’s prejudices were those of his time and place, and notes that the cartoonist, as he matured, acquired a more enlightened sensibility. In “The Blue Lotus,” Chinese ideograms on signs in the background say things like “Abolish unfair treaties!” and “Down with imperialism!” (These were drawn by an influential assistant, a French-speaking native of Shanghai named Zhang Chong Ren.) Hergé was not in essence a political man, publishing in Le Soir because collaborationist newspapers were the only ones allowed to exist.At best, he was naïve. More likely, in Peeters’s telling, he just didn’t care about the most consequential moral conflict of the century: it had left him alone. After the liberation, Hergé maintained he had done nothing wrong but seems to have struggled privately with shame and guilt. He was spared the fate of others in Belgium whose records were no different from his — the authorities proved, as Peeters puts it, “overridingly indulgent.” Hergé was protected by nothing less than Tintin’s popularity.And that, in the end, is Peeters’s larger point. In many ways Georges Remi vanished into the work of Hergé. “What if I told you that I put my whole life into Tintin?” he asked Peeters shortly before his death. That seems to be exactly what he did. A flawed and not terribly happy man grew a modest talent into something vastly greater than himself. I don’t know what a semiotician would make of that. A layman might call it art.'"
"'12-01-22,'0','Most books about contemporary politics are designed for quick obsolescence. A notable exception to the rule is the work of Thomas Byrne Edsall, whose five careful books, starting with “The New Politics of Inequality” in 1984, are still found on the shelves and in the footnotes of everyone who writes about politics — left and right, academics and journalists alike. Edsall’s distinctive method combines his own reporting with rigorous use of data from across the social sciences, including psychology and anthropology. Though his previous book, “Building Red America,” seemed poorly timed when it appeared in 2006 just as Karl Rove’s quest for permanent Republican dominance collapsed, its insights into conservative attitudes about authority and autonomy remain as useful as anything written more recently about the Tea Party and the right-wing resurgence.The great topic of Edsall’s life’s work is the breakdown of the New Deal-era liberal coalition at the intersection of race, resentment and inequality. While analysts often sharply distinguish economic from social issues, Edsall sees a “chain reaction,” to use the title of his 1991 book, in which race, economics and highly emotional topics like immigration interact to crush any real hope of a new progressive coalition. When minorities acquire new rights or benefits, it comes at a cost, real or perceived, for established white voters.This story reads very differently in 2012 than it would have in 1984, when the “Reagan Democrats” defected from the New Deal coalition. Now it’s the children and even the grandchildren of the Reagan Democrats who make up the middle of the voting population, and a Rising American Electorate (in the pollster Stan Greenberg’s phrase) made up of professionals, unmarried women and young voters as well as blacks, Hispanics and Asians threatens to outnumber the old resentful whites. More than threatens — the Rising American Electorate won a presidential race in 2008, giving the Democratic candidate a majority of the vote for the first time since 1976. Edsall, a regular contributor to The New York Times’s “Campaign Stops” election blog, warns Democrats that this might have been a one-time-only event — and, indeed, the traditional American electorate made itself heard in 2010. The newer voters are more difficult to mobilize than older whites, and conservatives have become adept at activating the gut reactions of their voters. The buttons they push are those of race and immigration, and increasingly those of economics, which is now depicted in terms of absolutely incompatible worldviews. Consider Mitt Romney’s claim that President Obama believes in “equality of outcomes,” while real Americans believe in “equality of opportunity.”One day we’ll look back and find such polarizing language strange, given the broad consensus in favor of a mixed economy with some regulation and a social safety net. It is scarcity, Edsall contends, that turns modest policy differences into zero-sum showdowns between his “haves” and aspiring “have-nots.” Drawing on predictions that the economist Lester Thurow made following an earlier “era of limits,” the late 1970s, he sees a long and ugly period of zero-sum conflict over immigration, education and programs that serve primarily low-income people or minorities, like disability benefits. Edsall’s “haves” are not the rich, but older conservatives who have “income from savings, which they do not want more heavily taxed, and their Medicare coverage and Social Security benefits, which they do not want diverted to ‘ObamaCare’ or any venture transferring tax dollars to those with lower incomes.” In Edsall’s framework, it no longer seems paradoxical that Republicans can simultaneously attack a government health program, propose to gut Medicare for those under 55, and pledge to protect that same program faithfully against Democratic cuts. In a climate of austerity and limits, struggling older voters cling all the more desperately to what they have, and are all the more willing to see that same thing denied to those who are not them or don’t look like them.It’s not always clear, though, exactly what limits Edsall is talking about. That ambivalence is visible right on the cover: The title is “The Age of Austerity,” but the subtitle refers to “scarcity.” Throughout, Edsall uses the two words, scarcity and austerity, interchangeably. But they are not synonyms. Scarcity is a grim reality. Austerity, particularly fiscal austerity on the part of government, is a choice. Sometimes austerity is the appropriate response to scarcity, but sometimes, as in a recession, it’s not.Edsall concentrates most of his attention on elective austerity, like cuts in programs for people with disabilities. These lend themselves well to his analysis, but they are not examples of actual scarcity. He attributes the “scarce supply” of tax dollars for public programs to the federal budget deficit, but in an extraordinarily wealthy nation with effective tax rates at their lowest level in decades and interest rates approaching zero, the decision to cut services rather than raise taxes or borrow is simply a choice not to spend available resources on those services.'"
"'12-01-22,'0','Mike O’Brien is what might be called Web nouveau: he’s earnest rather than snarky and seems genuinely baffled by meme culture. Yet O’Brien, who didn’t even have a account until September, has become famous — at least on the Internet — as the host of “7 Minutes in Heaven,” an extremely funny Web show based on the adolescent make-out game.O’Brien, who writes for “ ,” first conceived the project this summer with his colleague Rob Klein. The original plan had him mainly interviewing (and then kissing) his own friends in a friend of a friend’s closet. But after financing from the production company of , executive producer of “S.N.L.,” gave the show a modest budget, started booking celebrity guests. “I was very surprised and thrilled,” O’Brien recalls, “that a couple months later, I was in a closet with .”O’Brien, 35, has already kissed, among others, , Ty Burrell, Hoda Kotb and Seth Meyers (well, sort of) on the lips. He has kissed and on the cheek, on the head and on the nostril. He has also full-on sucked face with . O’Brien’s biggest rejection occurred when Shaggy 2 Dope, of Insane Clown Posse, told him firmly, “I can’t do it, man.” O’Brien backed off.“7 Minutes” has all the right elements to make the Internet swoon: famous people, chaste potential for love connections and a run time of less than five minutes. It is beloved as much for being an unconventional take on the celebrity interview (much like ’s interview series “Between Two Ferns”) as for O’Brien’s goofy likability (“I’m more of an amicable awkward,” he says), which soothes a situation that might otherwise be considered creepy.O’Brien, who credits much of his comedic talent as a host to nearly a decade at ’s iO and Second City theaters (in addition to a stint working at a ), is aware of the limits of Internet fame. The most popular episode of “7 Minutes,” which features , has some 470,000 hits.

"'12-01-23,'0','I have always believed that the story of the dissident artist Ai Weiwei is not about how censorship stifles creativity, but rather how one artist is able to work around such obstacles.  It’s not about the system crushing individual expression, but about the power of an individual in the face of forces greater than himself. One thing is clear — Ai Weiwei’s story could not be possible without the Internet. We cannot imagine an Ai Weiwei without the megaphone of blogs and Twitter, without the ability to communicate instantaneously and connect to like-minded netizens around China and the globe.Ai Weiwei told me recently that he thinks the government’s decision to detain him for 81 days last year and keep him under strict bail conditions ever since is completely related to his effective use of the Internet to communicate his views and exchange ideas with others.He told me: “If not for my use of the Internet, I would just be an artist trying to put up a canvas in a gallery or a museum, which has almost no influence for the majority of society. It’s only because I acted on the Internet that the pressure comes.  It made a lot of people feel scared, because they can never really stop my influence on the netizens.”That’s why I made my first feature documentary, “Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry” — to record what happens when someone makes the choice to speak openly and provocatively and face down the consequences, as Ai Weiwei and so many other human rights lawyers, writers, activists and young netizens do every day in China. I hope to inspire new discussions about the role of art, social media, underground documentary and creative forms of resistance in our interconnected world.'"
"'12-01-23,'0','At World last week, announced new executive orders to speed up visas for foreign tourists to the . The measure, a priority for the travel industry, was one of several sensible recommendations made in the last year by Mr. Obama’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a 27-member panel of corporate executives, academics, investors and labor leaders. The White House has carried out 17 others so far.Increasingly, however, the council’s recommendations have resembled not so much expert advice as a corporate wish list. In a report last October, the council’s sound proposals for job-creating public works projects were overshadowed by its unfounded claim that antifraud provisions put in place in 2002 in response to are an impediment to growth and hiring, and should be ended.Its latest report, issued last week, went so far in the direction of the Republican political agenda that it was endorsed by House Speaker for its emphasis on lower rates and less regulation. The report drew the ire of the panel’s two union members, , president of the , and Joseph Hansen, chairman of the . After the false premises and false fixes that have dominated the job creation debate, the dispute is healthy.Mr. Trumka wrote a dissent in which he agreed that the United States has fallen behind other countries in in infrastructure, manufacturing, education, job skills and alternative energy. What he rightly objected to was the idea that less regulation, lower corporate tax rates and other demands on the business agenda are the key to restoring competitiveness and creating jobs. “Without timely action by government on a large scale,” he wrote, “solutions will continue to elude us as a nation.”For example, the report’s recommendations for improving education focused in large part on ensuring that schools meet the needs of corporations. It is important to ensure that Americans have the right skills — and opportunities to acquire new skills. The urgent and fundamental need, however, is to support, improve and sustain a strong public education system. That means more, not less, federal aid for states and localities to hire and retain teachers and for students to attend college, and for additional services to help poor and disadvantaged children to succeed academically, including meals and health care.It is also crucially important to recognize that unemployment today is not primarily driven by a skills gap — as the council’s report would lead you to believe — but by lack of jobs. If all of the job openings in America were filled tomorrow, nearly 10 million of the nation’s 13.1 million unemployed workers would still be out of work. That shortage requires more federal aid to bolster demand, not a focus on a less pressing skills gap.All of this would require more tax revenue, but the report discusses corporate tax reform that would not raise more money and would make it easier for American multinational corporations to avoid United States tax on foreign profits. The report claims the changes are needed to improve competitiveness and create jobs. Mr. Trumka pointed out that such changes could do the opposite, leaving the nation financially unable to meet its challenges, while disadvantaging companies without a foreign presence.'"

"'12-01-23,'0','“New Rules on Swaps Will Protect Big Traders” (DealBook column, Business Day, Jan. 12) points out how once again consumers get short-changed while banks get away without a scratch.Interest-rate swaps have been touted as a means for companies to keep costs down in the event of rising interest rates. But rates eventually fall. Governments and public entities are dealing with this now, and the 99 percent is again paying for deals created for and to benefit the 1 percent (a k a the big banks).This sounds nice, but the best way to protect money is to allow public entities to renegotiate or cancel deals without penalty. Instead of saving money, swap deals are liabilities, redirecting money that could maintain essential services, create good jobs and close budget gaps.It’s time for a different approach. Banks should pay their fair share so that the rest of us don’t have to cover their bill.The writer is city coordinator for UnitedNY, Fight for a Fair Economy, a nonprofit group.'"
"'12-01-23,'0','Ten years ago, videoconferencing systems were complicated and erratic, and ran on expensive, closed high-speed phone lines. Over the last decade, videoconferencing — like everything else — migrated to the Internet. Now, most businesses use Internet protocol videoconferencing — a souped-up version of Skype — to connect with colleagues and customers. Most of these new systems were designed with visual and audio clarity — not security — in mind.Rapid7 discovered that hundreds of thousands of businesses were investing in top-quality videoconferencing units, but were setting them up on the cheap. At last count, companies spent an estimated $693 million on group videoconferencing from July to September of last year, according to Wainhouse Research.The most popular units, sold by Polycom and Cisco, can cost as much as $25,000 and feature encryption, high-definition video capture, and audio that can pick up the sound of a door opening 300 feet away. But administrators are setting them up outside the firewall and are configuring them with a false sense of security that hackers can use against them.Whether real hackers are exploiting this vulnerability is unknown; no company has announced that it has been hacked. (Nor would one, and most would never know in any case.) But with videoconference systems so ubiquitous, they make for an easy target.It certainly would not be the first time hackers had exploited holes in office hardware. After a security breach at the United States Chamber of Commerce last year, the Chamber discovered that its office printer, and even a thermostat in a Chamber-owned apartment, had been communicating with an Internet address in China.But with videoconferencing, companies have seemingly gone out of their way to make themselves vulnerable. In many cases, they are not only putting their systems on the Internet, but setting them up in a way that allows anyone to listen in unnoticed.New systems are outfitted with a feature that automatically accepts inbound calls so users do not have to press an “accept” button every time someone dials into their videoconference. The effect is that anyone can dial in and look around a room, and the only sign of their presence is a tiny light on a console unit, or the silent swing of a video camera.Two months ago, Mr. Moore wrote a computer program that scanned the Internet for videoconference systems that were outside the firewall and configured to automatically answer calls. In less than two hours, he had scanned 3 percent of the Internet.In that sliver, he discovered 5,000 wide-open conference rooms at law firms, pharmaceutical companies, oil refineries, universities and medical centers. He stumbled into a lawyer-inmate meeting room at a prison, an operating room at a university medical center, and a venture capital pitch meeting where a company’s financials were being projected on a screen. Among the vendors that popped up in Mr. Moore’s scan were Polycom, Cisco, LifeSize, Sony and others. Of those, Polycom — which leads the videoconferencing market in units sold — was the only manufacturer that ships its equipment — from its low-end ViewStation models to its high-end HDX products — with the auto-answer feature enabled by default.In an e-mail, Shawn Dainas, a Polycom spokesman, said the auto-answer feature had several safety elements built in that could be activated by a customer, including password protections, auto-mute and camera control lockup, adding that Polycom also offered a camera lens cover. He said the “security levels have been designed to make it easy for our customers to enable security that is appropriate to their business.”Of the Polycom videoconference systems that popped up in Mr. Moore’s scan, none blocked control of the camera, asked for a password or muted sound.“Many Polycom systems are sold, installed and maintained without any level of access security, with auto-answer enabled by default,” Mr. Moore says. “It boils down to whether organizations are aware of the risk, and our research indicates that many, even well-heeled venture capital firms, were not aware and do not implement even the most basic of security measures.”Mr. Tuchen of Rapid7 said that as a short cut, businesses put their videoconference systems outside the firewall, allowing them to receive calls from other companies without having to do any complex network configuration. The safer way to receive calls from other companies, Mr. Tuchen said, is to install a “gatekeeper” that securely connects calls from outside the firewall. But, this process “is complex to configure properly,” he said, and “is often skipped.”Ira M. Weinstein, a senior analyst at Wainhouse Research, a market research firm that specializes in media conferencing, disputed the notion that most companies keep their systems outside the firewall. “The companies that really have to worry about breaches — the Department of Defense, banks — put their systems behind the firewall,” Mr. Weinstein said.“That doesn’t mean there aren’t exceptions. If you talk to outside companies, you need to decide if you want to be accessible or totally secure. I could never leave my house and be secure. But I want to be accessible. It’s a choice people make.”But in some cases, Mr. Moore discovered he could leap from one open system into its address book and dial into the conference rooms of other companies, even those companies that put their system behind the firewall.That was the case with Goldman Sachs. The bank’s boardroom did not show up in Mr. Moore’s initial scan but an entry labeled “Goldman Sachs Board Room” popped up in the directory of a law firm that Goldman Sachs videoconferences with. Mr. Moore did not disclose the name of the law firm and said that because he was afraid of “crossing a line,” he did not dial into Goldman Sachs.Said Mr. Tuchen, “Any reasonably computer literate 6-year-old can try this at home.”'"
"'12-01-23,'0','In capturing their first A.F.C. title since the 2007 season, the Patriots will play the Giants in a Super Bowl rematch on Feb. 5 in Indianapolis in what will be their fifth Super Bowl appearance in 11 years.After a final kneeldown by Tom Brady, who tied his idol, Joe Montana, for most postseason victories with 16, confetti spewed from cannons. The Patriots’ owner, Robert K. Kraft, held aloft the Lamar Hunt Trophy and pointed toward the heavens, a tribute to his wife, Myra, who died of cancer in July.“I’m so excited that we’re going to the big game,” Kraft said. “I still pinch myself thinking about it, and I think of my sweetheart.”As the Patriots rejoiced in their locker room, the Ravens dressed in silence, having endured perhaps the most devastating loss since the franchise moved to Baltimore. With Indianapolis down and Pittsburgh out, this was the Ravens’ chance.They committed fewer turnovers (one to three). They gained more yards (398 to 330). They held Brady, who shredded the Denver Broncos for six passing touchdowns in the divisional round, without one and limited him to a 57.5 quarterback rating. They could not keep him out of the end zone, yielding his 1-yard touchdown run — on fourth down — with 11 minutes 29 seconds remaining to fall behind, 23-20. And still.“If you listen to everybody, we weren’t even supposed to be in this game,” said Ray Lewis, who added that he would return for a 17th season.The Patriots dismantled opponents during their nine-game winning streak, prevailing by an average of 18.7 points, but one question persisted: was their dominance a function of outstanding play, or merely the inferiority of their opposition?Until New England did so this season, no team in the Super Bowl era had reached its conference championship without beating a team with a winning record, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. In one sense, then, the Ravens were the ultimate test: they won all seven games against playoff-bound teams.The Ravens’ loss overshadowed an excellent game by Joe Flacco, who outshone Brady and completed 22 of 36 passes for 306 yards and 2 touchdowns and an interception. He engineered a brilliant 11-play, 78-yard drive in the third quarter that culminated in a 29-yard touchdown catch by Torrey Smith, who broke a tackle by Sterling Moore at the 25 and sprinted down the sideline. But the Ravens could only produce a field goal after recovering a fumble on the ensuing kickoff.With New England trailing, 20-16, late in the third quarter, Brady did what he had done so many times before: put the Patriots ahead to stay. He capped a 59-yard drive with a dive over his linemen. Brady acknowledged that he had played poorly, and afterward said to Kraft, “I promise you I’m going to play a lot better in two weeks.”The ferocity of the Ravens’ defense did not startle Brady, whose 55.9 completion percentage in five previous games was his lowest against one team. Baltimore moved Brady around the pocket and stymied him in the red zone, allowing three field goals.At halftime, then, the most surprising element involved not the score — Patriots 13, Ravens 10 — but the disparity between the quarterbacks. Flacco had completed a higher percentage of his passes, thrown for more yards, amassed a better rating and committed fewer turnovers.Such precision must have looked unfamiliar to the Patriots. The quarterbacks they had toppled in nine games since Eli Manning won here on Nov. 6 included Tyler Palko, Dan Orlovsky, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Rex Grossman. Flacco outclassed them all.When the Ravens took over at their 21 with 1:44 left, Flacco guided them to the New England 14. On second-and-1, Moore dislodged what would have been a touchdown catch by Lee Evans. “I feel I let everybody down,” Evans said, and Baltimore did not gain another yard. Or score another point.“I expected him to make it,” Moore said of Cundiff’s attempt, as did Vince Wilfork, who smiled and answered in the affirmative when asked the same question. Moore did not watch, but, he added, “then everybody started running, so I started running.”They ran and ran, celebrating what they had hoped for, what they had envisioned, after the last three seasons ended in despair, in two playoff losses at Gillette Stadium and an empty postseason altogether. Now the Patriots are back. They are in the Super Bowl again, just not the way they would have figured.'"
"'12-01-23,'0','The Open Pairs on Jan. 13 at the District 3 Winter Regional in Rye Brook, N.Y., was an A/X event. That meant there were two flights: A for players with more than 5,000 master points and X for those with fewer points.The X winners were a married couple, Steve and Rona Levine of New York City.They led the entire field after the first session with a 66.7 percent game. And they finished nine places ahead of second in X, Ruth Zowader of Madison, N.J., and Lawrence Samuels of Fairfield, N.J.The winners did well on the diagramed deal, Board 24 of the first session.Over West’s one-diamond opening East made a disciplined pass. Now Steve Levine (South) had three imperfect choices. Passing might have been best, in particular if the opponents had missed a good spade fit. One no-trump would have been a slight underbid, usually indicating 11 to 14 points. His actual takeout double was dangerous with only a doubleton spade. He hoped to be able to rebid one no-trump over a one-spade advance by his partner.Here, though, West rebid two clubs, and Rona Levine (North) bid two spades. Now South bid two no-trump to show his hand strength and type. Then North judged well to pass. With two aces and a five-card suit, many would have raised.West led the club king, and East discouraged with the three. When South ducked, West cashed his diamond ace and continued with another diamond, on which East discarded a heart.'"

"'12-01-23,'0','Carlos Henriquez stood front and center with his bass throughout “The Music of Cachao,” Jazz at Lincoln Center’s tribute to the pioneering Cuban bassist and composer Israel Cachao López on Friday night at the Rose Theater. This was, as Mr. Henriquez noted with a chuckle in the concert’s second half, a departure from his usual station near the back of the stage. But it made perfect sense: the tumbaos that boomed from Mr. Henriquez’s bass, in patterns more or less invented by Cachao, gave the music its flexible spine — along with a strong heartbeat, steady in its syncopations.Cachao, who died in 2008 at 89, was a traditionalist with the soul of an explorer, which helps explain how he adapted the courtly, elegant Cuban danzón to 20th-century usage and then laid much of the groundwork for mambo. “The Music of Cachao” presented this history for inspection without letting too much earnest pedagogy get in the way. The repertory, historical but vibrant, made its case even without the benefit of a dance floor.Mr. Henriquez, 32, served not only as the concert’s stand-in for Cachao — an imposing job, handled with commendable skill — but also as its musical director, bandleader-arranger and master of ceremonies. In other words he filled the multitasking role usually held by Wynton Marsalis. This wasn’t the first time he has been handed the keys to the Cadillac; he was an integral part of Jazz at Lincoln Center’s recent exchange with Cuba, for starters. But the stated focus of this tribute, and the absence of Mr. Marsalis, intensified his spotlight and amplified his achievement.He divided the concert into two segments, the first featuring a band stocked with Cachao alumni, including the tres player Nelson González, the flutist Gerardo Peña and the pianist Alfredo Valdés Jr. The percussion section was no less accomplished, with Charlie Santiago on timbales, Tony Rosa on congas and Anthony Carrillo on bongos and guiro. A string quartet brought the right balance of astringent sweetness to a couple of respectful danzóns, notably “El Estío” which elicited a soulful, piping flute solo from Mr. Peña.Another standout soloist, the trumpeter Michael Rodriguez, opened the concert with a fanfare, which led naturally into “Estudio en Trompeta,” with a call and response between vocals and horn. Mr. Rodriguez later played a gorgeously restrained duet with Mr. Henriquez, projecting brightly but softly, with a pristine and gallant sound.There was room for a more fiery trumpet showcase in the concert’s second half: “Escucha Dos Trompetas,” which hinged on a competitive back and forth between Mr. Rodriguez and Marcus Printup, a regular ace in the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. From here on out the orchestra augmented the first set’s personnel, playing Mr. Henriquez’s efficient big-band enlargements of Cachao tunes: “A Gozar Timbero,” rumbling and dramatic; “A Gozar con Mi Combo,” with just enough grit; and “Descarga Cubana,” featuring a lot of internal combustion among the horns.'"

Sweat coated his legs and clung to his dark hair as he conjured spectacular running forehands, cast sideways glances in the direction of his uncle and coach, Toni Nadal, and eventually whipped and willed his way past Tomas Berdych, who is developing a harder edge at 26.Federer required 1 hour 59 minutes to win his match against del Potro. Nadal and Berdych required 2:26 just to split sets, with Berdych winning the first tiebreaker and Nadal wresting the second after Berdych failed to make a forehand volley that might have changed his luck after nine straight losses to Nadal.On they scrapped in the match of the tournament so far. In the end, Nadal’s increased ability to attack the seventh-seeded Berdych’s serve and to turn defense into offense in a heartbeat made the difference as he won, 6-7 (5), 7-6 (6), 6-4, 6-3, in 4:16.“The level is very positive, much, much better than the end of the season,” Nadal said. “The character on the court, the way to win the points. Everything was much more positive. So I’m very happy.”Federer was not happy the last time he faced Nadal here. He lost the 2009 final in five sets, muttering, “God, it’s killing me,” in the award ceremony and breaking down in tears with Nadal putting an arm around him. Long the friendliest of archrivals in public, there have been signs of estrangement of late with disagreements over tour politics. Nadal even criticized Federer sharply in a pretournament news conference for not speaking out and for letting other players take the flak.But Nadal backed down the next day, and Federer said there was no extra edge to this match because of the comments. But that does not mean there will be no added meaning to the 27th chapter in their rivalry.“I’d like to get a chance to play him again here,” Federer said, speaking before Nadal’s latest Melbourne marathon was done.With the dry heat making conditions relatively quick at Melbourne Park, it was a day when aggression often trumped defense. Kim Clijsters and Victoria Azarenka won their quarterfinals in the women’s tournament and will meet in the semifinals.Clijsters required no great escape this time. After saving four match points against Li Na in the fourth round, Clijsters saved herself at least some of the suspense against top-seeded Caroline Wozniacki.Dominating from the baseline for much of the match and showing no visible effects from the twisted ankle sustained against Li, Clijsters prevailed, 6-3, 7-6 (4).Closing proved difficult. Clijsters, the reigning Australian Open champion, dropped three straight games after taking a 5-2 lead in the final set and struggled with her timing. But she ultimately kept enough of her cool on this stifling day when the temperature soared.“One of the toughest conditions I’ve ever played in,” Clijsters said. “But it was good to win that in two sets at the end.”Down by 3-4 in the second-set tie breaker, she reeled off four consecutive points to advance in what she insists is her final Australian Open. At 28 and the mother of a 3-year-old daughter, Clijsters has said she wants to raise a larger family and allow her husband, Brian Lynch, a former professional basketball player turned coach, the freedom to focus on his career.Clijsters, seeded just 11th, has played little in the last six months because of injuries, missing Wimbledon and the United States Open. She spent much of Sunday and Monday icing her injured ankle but said that she did not even bother to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan.“I refused; I already had a scan on my neck a couple days ago,” she said. “I said: ‘No more. Whatever it is, it is. I’m going to try to make the best out of it. Then we’ll see when I get home how I’m feeling.’“I have seen more hospitals these last six months than anything, so no more for me.”Azarenka eventually slugged (and shrieked) her way free of the traps laid by Agnieszka Radwanska, the feather-footed Polish counterpuncher. Azarenka won, 6-7 (0), 6-0, 6-2, in a match in which service breaks were the rule.As a result of her defeat, Wozniacki, an outgoing 21-year-old from Denmark, will not be No. 1 much longer. Wozniacki has yet to win a Grand Slam singles title, and has not even reached a Grand Slam final since 2009. But in an unsettled era in women’s tennis, she has taken mathematical advantage by remaining healthy and winning consistently, if not when it matters most.Present and former players, including Martina Navratilova, have said that they do not view Wozniacki as the true No. 1. And after holding the top ranking for 67 of the last 68 weeks, Wozniacki is now guaranteed to lose the spot the Monday after the Australian Open ends.“To be honest, I don’t really think about it,” Wozniacki said. “I have been there for a long time already. I finished No. 1 two years in a row. In the end of the year, we will see who played the best. We are just in January.“I will get it back eventually,” she added, “so I’m not worried.”1028 2012-01-24 The extent to which the ambitious public policy goals of the Annenbergs will come to life — think visiting presidents sleeping in the Annenbergs’ canary yellow master bedroom, with its floor-to-ceiling windows and speakers piping in bird chirps from the feeder outside — will become clear in the months ahead. The Annenbergs’ considerable connections (not to mention the $300 million endowment) bodes well for its success, and three summit meetings have been scheduled for the spring, including one on relations between the United States and Mexico that involves 22 policy leaders and officials from both countries.“We have had a number of discussions with the White House, State Department and Congressional leadership,” said Geoffrey Cowan, the president of the Annenberg Foundation Trust at Sunnylands, emphasizing that the estate will be made available to leaders from all political parties.At the same time, the public is going to be able to get a glimpse of a world that was once shut off from all but the most high-powered of world leaders and the cream of Palm Springs celebrity society — Bing Crosby, Sammy Davis Jr., Bob Hope, Truman Capote, Gregory Peck, Ginger Rogers, Fred Astaire and Clark Gable — and the titans, most of them Republican, who were part of the Annenberg world.Sunnylands is about 10 miles from Palm Springs here in the Coachella Valley, a place better known these days for its annual music festival, in a neighborhood of streets that hark back to its Rat Pack past: Bob Hope Drive, Gerald Ford Drive, Frank Sinatra Drive and Dinah Shore Drive.During a tour of the property that included guest cottages, the art collection and archival material from the glory years, the bustle of construction and last-minute tidying-up suggested the imminence of the official opening. It was late afternoon, and the sun was setting over the San Jacinto Mountains, casting the grounds in shadows and ever-changing desert hues.“Now you are going behind the pink wall,” Mr. Cowan said as a golf cart bounced along a dirt road and over the hills of the nine-hole golf course that surrounds the home. At that moment, passing the gates to the grounds, the rest of the world disappears. There is no sign of life or development, “just lush green lawns stretching to the desert in the east, and the stunning San Jacinto Mountains in the west,” Ms. Annenberg noted.The estate fills 200 acres, its golf course spotted with 850 olive trees, 11 artificial lakes and a scattering of sculptures. There are precisely two palms, a reluctant ambassadorial bow to the iconic tree of Southern California. As for the estate’s first couple, well, they never really left: their remains rest in a pink mausoleum on a hillside. Mr. Annenberg died in 2002, and Mrs. Annenberg died seven years later.The 25,000-square-foot house, designed by A. Quincy Jones, includes soaring ceilings and clean lines and a vast open living room where every window seems to spill onto the lawn and gardens. There are 22 bedrooms for guests, plus the Annenberg suite, reserved for visiting presidents and heads of state. Most of the art collection that lavished the walls of this home — works by Picasso, Van Gogh, Andrew Wyeth, Monet — was donated to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York upon Mr. Annenberg’s death. Digital reproductions now hang in their place.The estate fairly glows with history, as was evident during a leisurely tour of the rooms of the main house, the guest wings and other cottages. President George Bush used to leave a fishing pole by his bedroom window for early morning excursions to a lake, stocked with bass, outside his room. “The reason he liked to stay in this room is because he liked to fish,” said Mary Perry, who heads community relations for Sunnylands.Reagan used to play golf on his weekends. “My first memories of going there was for their New Year’s Eve parties: I played golf with President Reagan there on the 31st of December,” said George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state, who will be here for the opening. “It was fantastic. That became an annual event.”“The guest list was really exciting and lots of fun — listening to Bob Hope tell jokes and Dolores Hope sing,” Mr. Shultz said. “The Annenbergs made a point of somehow causing interesting conversations to take place.”A wall in the Room of Memories — it will be on the tour — is dedicated to a collection of Christmas cards from Queen Elizabeth. Next stop: the Game Room. “Walter and Frank Sinatra would share movies that came in from Hollywood with their friends here,” said Geoffrey Baum, Sunnylands’ communications director, motioning to an old-fashioned projector behind a wall. “The screen would come down in front of the window.”Nixon, who appointed Mr. Annenberg to the Court of St. James, came here in disgrace, escaping the reporters who followed him after he left Washington. His sentiments about Sunnylands and its owner were clear in the notation that he wrote in the guest book: “When you’re down,” he wrote, “you find out who your real friends are.”1029 2012-01-24 Andy Mattes, another former Siemens executive who once supervised Mr. Heins, sat with him on the company’s senior executive board for its communications unit. He said that Mr. Heins was charged with “finding a graceful way to exit the business.”Mr. Heins moved on to become chief technology officer of the communications unit and in 2005 the handset business was sold to BenQ, a Taiwanese electronics maker. The sale to BenQ, in which Mr. Heins was apparently not directly involved, did not end well. BenQ put the German phone operation into bankruptcy a year later, angering union leaders and politicians in Germany.His profile is low in Germany where he worked at a variety of positions at Siemens since 1984, when he joined the company as a junior manager.“I really can’t say I know much about him or remember him at all,” said Theo Kitz, an analyst who has covered Siemens for 20 years at Merck Finck, a private bank in Munich where Siemens is also based. “He didn’t leave a lasting impression here and never rose to the top ranks of the company.”Mr. Mattes, the former Siemens executive, said that like all managers at the company, Mr. Heins was moved through a variety of jobs to give him a variety of skills over about 10 years. In the case of Mr. Heins, that included a spell with the company’s wireless communications unit in the United States in 1996.“All of us who grew up there had very broad training,” said Mr. Mattes, who later became a senior executive with Hewlett-Packard in the United States and who is now a corporate adviser.Siemens, however, did shield its managers from the investment community, Mr. Mattes said, unlike his experience at H.P. and very unlike what Mr. Heins now faces at RIM.“Dealing with shareholders, dealing with the Street, these are all things he will have to come up to speed on very quickly,” Mr. Mattes said, noting that they have not been in touch in recent years. “He’s a really great guy. I have only good things to say about him. Whether he can deal with the Street, the pressures from shareholders and analysts, I don’t know.”In a note to investors Monday, Mike Abramsky, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets in Toronto, wrote that Mr. Heins “while a seasoned network executive, has never been a public company C.E.O., and lacks deep consumer marketing and software experience.” That, combined with Mr. Hein’s commitment to his predecessors’ plans, Mr. Abramsky wrote, means that it is not clear if he will be able to alter the “vision and direction of the company in light of rapidly changing competitive conditions and correct RIM’s seeming inability to navigate these challenges.”Given that RIM was unable, or unwilling, to bring in an outsider as chief executive, Mr. Gelblum said the company’s directors should have made Mr. Heins interim chief executive pending the results of a talent hunt in which he would be publicly declared to be the preferred candidate.Not all analysts were disappointed on Monday by RIM’s change. Michael Gartenberg, a technology analyst with the Gartner Group, welcomed Mr. Heins’s announcement that he would look for a new chief marketing officer for RIM. “RIM’s consumer marketing has, at times, left something to be desired,” Mr. Gartenberg said.He said that it would take time for RIM to reverse its sliding market share in the United States. Mr. Gartenberg said that he would be looking for changes in operations and management over the next month to three months.1030 2012-01-24 “Now that Paterno is deceased, this charge will have to stand only on the report by McQueary,” said Geoff Moulton, a former federal prosecutor and an associate professor at Widener School of Law. “With respect to Victim 2 and the charges against Curley and Schultz, McQueary’s testimony, which has always been critical, is even more so.”Paterno’s grand jury testimony is inadmissible, according to several lawyers, because he was not cross-examined in that proceeding. The Sixth Amendment’s confrontation clause guarantees criminal defendants the right to confront the witnesses against them.Wick Sollers, who was Paterno’s lawyer, said in an e-mail that Paterno’s statements before the grand jury constituted his only under-oath testimony in the case. With Paterno’s death, the lawyers for Curley and Schultz no longer have the opportunity to challenge his credibility.Curley and Schultz were also charged with lying to the grand jury, but it appears from the grand jury report that those charges stem only from their account that McQueary did not tell them that the incident was sexual in nature. That would mean Paterno’s inability to take the stand is perhaps not as critical in prosecuting the perjury charges.But his absence could have some effect.“Why would he have told it to Paterno and not told them?” said Howard Bruce Klein, a former federal prosecutor who is a criminal defense lawyer in Philadelphia. “McQueary becomes more credible when you hear Paterno tell his version of it. On the perjury charge, I would say Paterno would be a corroborating witness.”It is unknown whether the Pennsylvania attorney general has uncovered additional evidence that would bolster the case against Curley and Schultz. A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said that there would be no comment about the case.Sandusky, a former Penn State defensive coordinator, has been charged with more than 50 counts of sexual abuse against boys. Paterno’s failure to report to the authorities what he knew about the 2002 incident contributed to the Board of Trustees’ decision to fire him Nov. 9, in his 46th season as the coach. He was not charged in the case.There will be public viewings of Paterno, who died of lung cancer, on Tuesday and Wednesday at the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center, to which he and his wife made a significant financial contribution in 1998. He will be buried Wednesday, and there will be a public memorial service Thursday at Penn State’s 16,000-seat Bryce Jordan Center.1031 2012-01-24 The unrest in Syria, home to more Iraqi refugees than any other country, has added another layer of delay to the visa process, which had already slowed substantially because of new security checks put in place last year after two Iraqis were arrested in Kentucky on charges of aiding the insurgency in Iraq. Homeland Security officials visited Syria between January and March last year but have not been back because of the security situation.“I think we should really be worried about another refugee crisis,” said Yasir Imad, an Iraqi who was recently allowed entry to the United States after living in Syria for almost four years. Interviewed recently by this reporter at a coffee shop in Brooklyn, Mr. Imad said that Iraqis in Syria — many of whom have not put down roots and have kept their bags packed for years — were increasingly anxious. Some have joined pro-government rallies to avoid deportation, he said. Few want to go back to Iraq.“The general feeling in Syria is that it is still better to be in Syria than Iraq,” Mr. Imad said.Many Iraqis who escaped to Syria at the height of the sectarian violence here have chosen to stay there even as the rebellion against President Bashar al-Assad’s government turns more violent. But the stakes are higher now in the wake of the American troop departure from Iraq, as a political crisis in Iraq borne of unresolved sectarian conflicts has pushed the country closer to civil war.Both the stringent new security checks and the popular revolt in Syria have substantially reduced the number of Iraqi refugees entering the United States.In 2011, fewer Iraqis were admitted than at any time since 2007. In the 2011 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 31, 9,388 Iraqi refugees were admitted to the United States, compared with more than 18,000 the previous year. Nearly 3,000 Iraqi refugees entered the United States from Syria last year, the most of any country, including Iraq. And nearly 20,000 Iraqis in Syria are in various stages of applying for visas to enter the United States.In response to the backlog of cases in Syria, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which conducts the initial processing of refugees and had designated many of the Iraqis as eligible for visas, has stopped referring new cases to the United States. Some Iraqis have moved on to find new lives in countries like Jordan and Lebanon. “This has created a huge amount of uncertainty in the refugee community,” said Paul Stromberg, deputy representative of the agency in Syria. “We do have Iraqis asking us, ‘Please transfer my file to another country.’ ”Many have also chosen to stay in Syria because returning to Iraq would probably mean giving up a chance for a United States visa. Immigration officials say that Iraqis who leave third countries and return home could be penalized because their return would undercut their claims of being at risk of persecution.Many Iraqis cannot return because their lives would be in danger, and some have lived in limbo for years in Syria as they navigated the byzantine visa process to immigrate to the United States. They include refugees who are particularly vulnerable because of medical conditions or who face threats to their lives because they worked for the American military during the war.They now are facing many more months, or even years, of waiting. In Syria, they are barred from working legally, although many earn money at odd jobs or by opening shops not registered with the government.For some, problems from Iraq have followed them, including the settling of vendettas through murder or kidnapping for ransom, according to Mr. Stromberg. Others have passed their medical exams and security clearances as required to immigrate to America, only to have the one-year validity of those procedures lapse because of canceled flights and other last-minute delays, forcing them essentially to begin the process anew.“We’ve seen some really tragic cases,” Mr. Stromberg said.Ms. Heller, of the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project, said she knew of a case in which two orphans, ages 9 and 5, were rejected because of the new security clearances.During the war, more Iraqis fled to Syria than to any other country. The United Nations agency has registered nearly 140,000 Iraqi refugees in Syria, although some estimate that there tens of thousands more who are not listed on official refugee rosters.The situation is unlikely to ease anytime soon. Previously, 85 to 90 percent of Iraqi refugees who reached the final stages of security checks were eventually approved. Now, the rejection rate could reach 30 percent or more, Ms. Heller said.“No one really knows, because most of the cases are on hold,” she said. “There are a huge slew of rejections that are going to come down the pipeline.”1032 2012-01-24 Amnesty International said Monday that three antigovernment protesters held without charge for 52 days were released last week, hours after the human rights group identified them as prisoners of conscience. They were released Friday, a day after a hunger-striking dissident died, prompting condemnation from dissidents and human rights groups. The freed dissidents — Ivonne Malleza Galano, Ignacio Martínez Montejo and Isabel Haydee Álvarez — were threatened with “harsh sentences” if they did not stop their anti-government actions, Amnesty said.1033 2012-01-24 Re “Depression Defies the Rush to Find an Evolutionary Upside” (Essay, Jan. 17): Asking if diseases are or are not adaptations is the most elementary mistake in evolutionary medicine. The correct questions are: What are the evolutionary origins and functions of the capacity for normal mood variation? And why are the mechanisms that regulate mood so vulnerable to failure? Answers to these questions will provide important foundations for better understanding mood disorders. Randolph M. Nesse, M.D.Emotional states like pervasive sadness (“depression”) or joy (“hypermania”) have been misleadingly incorporated into the medical model as pathologies requiring diagnosis and treatment. What is unhealthy is a physician value judgment, and often treated by drugs. Depression is an experience, often painful, in lives that are humanly complex, and it warrants respect and patient understanding when consultation is sought.I applaud Dr. Richard A. Friedman’s lucid debunking of the myth that clinically significant depression is “adaptive.” Whereas there is some correlation between bipolar disorder and creativity, most patients who suffer with severe, recurrent unipolar major depression report that their creativity is diminished or extinguished while they are depressed. If they are able to draw meaning and inspiration from their experience, it is usually after the depressive bout has abated.1034 2012-01-24 A destroyed house filled with the signatures and well-wishes of thousands of the volunteers who came to Joplin to help with the recovery after the deadly tornado last spring will be preserved, city leaders announced Monday. The house and the messages within had been decaying under the elements because the walls and roof were stripped off by the storm. A makeshift roof was erected to protect the building, which will be sealed on Tuesday with a type of shrink wrap to protect the messages from eroding further, said Patrick Tuttle, director of the Joplin Convention and Visitors Bureau. The house, he said, will soon be moved out of the rebuilding neighborhood and to a city-owned storage area until it can be incorporated into a museum or other public display.1035 2012-01-24 Walking around with an iPod or an MP3 player plugged into your ears may seem harmless, but a new study suggests that the habit has its dangers.After examining statistics from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System and other databases, researchers at the University of Maryland found 116 accidents from 2004 to 2011 in which pedestrians wearing headphones or ear buds were injured by vehicles. More than half the accidents involved trains, and there were 81 deaths and 24 cases with life-threatening injuries.More than a third of those injured or killed were younger than 18, and two-thirds were under 30.“I’m not suggesting that pedestrians wearing headphones be pulled over,” said Dr. Richard Lichenstein, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland. “But wearing them at the gym is different from using them wherever you’re walking around. You’re distracted, and you can’t hear the surrounding environment.”The study, published online last week in Injury Prevention, has some major limitations. It relies in part on news accounts, in which severe accidents may be overly represented while nonfatal cases are underreported. And the study is retrospective, so conclusions about causation and correlation are impossible to establish.1036 2012-01-24 About 40 percent of in vitro fertilizations in the United States involve the transfer of three or more embryos, and more than 20 percent of pregnancies from IVF procedures result in multiple births. The health risks and expenses of these pregnancies are enormous.Now a British study, published online Jan. 12 in The Lancet, has found that the number of live births does not increase with the transfer of more than two embryos, but that the risk of harm does.Researchers looked at 124,148 IVF procedures that resulted in 33,514 live births. Among all women, the transfer of two embryos resulted in more live births than the transfer of one. But in those under age 40, transferring three embryos produced a lower rate of live birth than transferring two. In older women, transferring three embryos instead of two made no difference in the rate.The transfer of three or more embryos in any age group, however, was associated with a significantly higher risk of complications, including preterm birth and low birth weight.Scott M. Nelson, an author of the study and the chairman of obstetrics at the University of Glasgow, said the United States was one of the few countries in which more than two embryos may still routinely be transferred.“The study clearly shows that transferring three or more is not beneficial,” he said.1037 2012-01-24 But five justices also discussed their discomfort with the government’s use of or access to various modern technologies, including video surveillance in public places, automatic toll collection systems on highways, devices that allow motorists to signal for roadside assistance, location data from cellphone towers and records kept by online merchants.The case concerned Antoine Jones, who was the owner of a Washington nightclub when the police came to suspect him of being part of a cocaine-selling operation. They placed a tracking device on his without a valid warrant, tracked his movements for a month and used the evidence they gathered to convict him of conspiring to sell cocaine. He was sentenced to life in prison.The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned his conviction, saying the sheer amount of information that had been collected violated the Fourth Amendment, which bars unreasonable searches. “Repeated visits to a church, a gym, a bar or a bookie tell a story not told by any single visit, as does one’s not visiting any of those places in the course of a month,” Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg wrote for the appeals court panel.The Supreme Court affirmed that decision, but on a different ground. “We hold that the government’s installation of a GPS device on a target’s vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle’s movements, constitutes a ‘search,’ ” Justice wrote for the majority. Chief Justice and Justices , and joined the majority opinion.“It is important to be clear about what occurred in this case,” Justice Scalia went on. “The government physically occupied private property for the purpose of obtaining information. We have no doubt that such a physical intrusion would have been considered a ‘search’ within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when it was adopted.”When the case was argued in November, a lawyer for the federal government said the number of times the federal authorities used GPS devices to track suspects was “in the low thousands annually.”Vernon Herron, a former state trooper now on the staff of the ’s Center for Health and Homeland Security, said state and local law enforcement officials used GPS and similar devices “all the time,” adding that “this type of technology is very useful for narcotics and terrorism investigations.”Monday’s decision thus places a significant burden on widely used law enforcement surveillance techniques, though the authorities remain free to seek warrants from judges authorizing the surveillance.In a concurrence for four justices, Justice faulted the majority for trying to apply 18th-century legal concepts to 21st-century technologies. What should matter, he said, is the contemporary reasonable expectation of privacy.“The use of longer-term GPS monitoring in investigations of most offenses,” Justice Alito wrote, “impinges on expectations of privacy.” Justices , and joined the concurrence.“We need not identify with precision the point at which the tracking of this vehicle became a search, for the line was surely crossed before the four-week mark,” Justice Alito wrote. “Other cases may present more difficult questions.”Justice Scalia said the majority did not mean to suggest that its property-rights theory of the Fourth Amendment displaced the one focused on expectations of privacy.“It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question,” he wrote.Justice Sotomayor joined the majority opinion, agreeing that many questions could be left for another day “because the government’s physical intrusion on Jones’s supplies a narrower basis for decision.”But she left little doubt that she would have joined Justice Alito’s analysis had the issue he addressed been the exclusive one presented in the case.“Physical intrusion is now unnecessary to many forms of surveillance,” Justice Sotomayor wrote.She added that “it may be necessary to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties.”“People disclose the phone numbers that they dial or text to their cellular providers; the URLs that they visit and the e-mail addresses with which they correspond to their Internet service providers; and the books, groceries and medications they purchase to online retailers,” she wrote. “I, for one, doubt that people would accept without complaint the warrantless disclosure to the government of a list of every Web site they had visited in the last week, or month, or year.”Justice Alito listed other “new devices that permit the monitoring of a person’s movements” that fit uneasily with traditional Fourth Amendment privacy analysis.“In some locales,” he wrote, “closed-circuit television video monitoring is becoming ubiquitous. On toll roads, automatic toll collection systems create a precise record of the movements of motorists who choose to make use of that convenience. Many motorists purchase cars that are equipped with devices that permit a central station to ascertain the car’s location at any time so that roadside assistance may be provided if needed and the car may be found if it is stolen.”1038 2012-01-24 Free Tibet identified the slain protester as Norpa Yonten, a 49-year-old layman. The International Campaign for Tibet, a rights group based in Washington, said that he was the brother of a reincarnated lama.Ms. Brigden said the group had the names of 31 more people with gunshot wounds. She said other people had been shot and injured but their names were not immediately available.Kate Saunders, a spokeswoman for the International Campaign for Tibet, said in a telephone interview that three people, including Mr. Yonten, had been killed and that 49 people had sought treatment for injuries at a clinic operated by monks. Of the 49, 9 had gunshot wounds and 40 had various injuries from beatings and other causes, she said.People in China wounded by gunshots are often leery of going to hospitals, fearing that they will face questioning and possibly retaliation by the authorities.The Tibetan exile government in India said in a statement on its Web site that it had confirmed one death in the Luhuo shooting but that it had heard other reports that as many as six people had been killed.“The Tibetan Parliament is deeply aggrieved by the incidents and condemns the Chinese authorities for resorting to such drastic acts of force and repression,” the exile government said.In addition to those Tibetans who have been shot and killed, 17 Tibetans have set themselves on fire since last March 16.There were varied reports on Monday regarding the cause of the violence in Luhuo, including one that the protesters may have sought the release of people detained for distributing leaflets calling for greater freedom for Tibetans, or that the protest was part of a local boycott against Chinese celebrations of the Lunar New Year.Tibetans traditionally celebrate the arrival of the new year a month later.Anticipating further protests during Tibetan new year celebrations or on the fourth anniversary of violent protests in March 2008, the Chinese government informed travel agencies last week that foreigners would not be allowed to travel in Tibet from Feb. 20 to March 31.Luhuo lies in Ganzi Prefecture, known in Tibetan as the Kandze Prefecture. The prefecture has been one of the most turbulent areas of ethnic Tibetan unrest for the past four years. On March 24, 2008, a monk was shot and killed as police officers fired on a crowd.1039 2012-01-24 SHANGHAI - Jack Ma, the chairman of the Chinese Internet giant Alibaba, surprised investors last May when he acknowledged that he had transferred the assets of the company's online payment platform to a private company that he controlled.

(AP) — Fifteen Muslims won conditional dismissals on Tuesday of charges stemming from an amusement park disturbance that started when women were told they could not wear religious headscarves on some rides.A Rye Town Court judge told the defendants that their cases would be dropped if they stayed out of trouble for two months. Most had been charged only with disorderly conduct, but the charges ranged up to second-degree assault.Some of the defendants said after the court session that they planned to file a civil rights lawsuit against Westchester County, alleging police brutality and racism in the disturbance. The county owns Playland park in Rye, a national landmark, where the disturbance occurred.Lamis Deek, a defense lawyer, said the defendants could have gone to trial and won acquittals, but trials would have been inconvenient because none of the defendants live in Westchester.“It’s unfortunately more convenient to accept this offer, not have to enter a plea of guilty, move on with their lives and pursue this matter in a civil courtroom,” Ms. Deek said.1076 2012-01-25 Fielder, 27, returns to the city where his father, Cecil, rose to stardom in the early 1990s. Prince was 12 when the Tigers traded his father to the Yankees, but by then, he was already launching home runs in batting practice at old Tiger Stadium. Now he hits homers for a living, belting 230 in his first seven seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers.The Fielders have been estranged in recent years, and although Cecil told SiriusXM on Tuesday that he and Prince are “doing a lot better than we were,” this is not a classic feel-good tale. It is mainly about Ilitch’s passion and Boras’s strategy of shopping his best clients directly to owners, persuading them to exceed their stated budgets.Just last week, Tigers General Manager Dave Dombrowski said that even after Martinez’s injury, Fielder did not fit for the Tigers because he wanted a long-term deal. But Ilitch has surprised Dombrowski before.After the 2007 season, Dombrowski doubted he could trade for Miguel Cabrera because of salary constraints. Then Ilitch called Dombrowski at home around Thanksgiving, imploring him to explore the move. Soon enough, Cabrera was a Tiger, with a contract for eight years and $152.3 million.Cabrera has delivered in the first four years of that deal, with 139 home runs and a .974 on base-plus-slugging percentage. Only two other players in those years have hit that many homers with a .900 O.P.S.: Albert Pujols and Fielder.Pujols signed with the Los Angeles Angels in December for 10 years and $240 million. Boras took weeks to find a comparable deal for Fielder, but he cautioned Saturday that the delay had nothing to do with Fielder’s value in the marketplace. He was right.Contracts this rich often spring from desperation; the Pujols deal was the Angels’ reaction to the Texas Rangers’ rise, and their own need for a star on their cable broadcasts. Other suitors for Fielder, notably the Washington Nationals, were less motivated than Ilitch to give Fielder the contract his talent demands.Now Manager Jim Leyland must fit two hulking first basemen — and, eventually, Martinez, who is signed through 2014 — into his defense. Designated hitter is an option, but Cabrera is only 28 and has made more than 700 career starts at third base or the outfield. Fielder has never played another defensive position.The Tigers could easily run away with the A.L. Central again, with a rotation led by the league’s most valuable player, Justin Verlander. The right-hander Doug Fister sparkled after a July trade and will be with Detroit all season. Max Scherzer and Rick Porcello, two more Boras clients, are just coming into their primes.Fielder is an improvement over Martinez, but perhaps not by much. Martinez hit .330 with 103 runs batted in last season, producing roughly three more wins than a typical replacement, according to Baseball-Reference.com. Fielder hit .299 with 120 R.B.I., with a wins-above-replacement figure of 5.2. In other words, advanced statistics say Fielder is worth only about two more victories than Martinez.The big difference is power — Fielder hit 38 homers last season, Martinez 12 — and presence. The Cabrera-Fielder pairing is even more imposing than the Ryan Braun-Fielder tandem that rampaged through National League pitching the past few seasons.The Brewers, who could lose Braun for the first 50 games after his positive drug test, have added the slugging third baseman Aramis Ramirez and re-signed reliever Francisco Rodriguez. All their starting pitchers return, and the team will get 2 of the first 40 picks in this year’s draft as compensation for losing Fielder.The N.L., as a whole, will get nothing. It has won the last two World Series and All-Star Games, but the three players who changed teams for the most money this off-season — Pujols, Fielder and Yu Darvish, the Japanese starter who cost the Rangers $111.7 million — will all play in the American League.1077 2012-01-25 The issue of how to deal with Wall Street firms that repeatedly violate securities laws has come into focus in recent months as the S.E.C. has stepped up its efforts to bring cases related to the financial crisis. Many of those cases involve financial companies that have violated the same laws many times before.A New York Times analysis of S.E.C. enforcement actions over the last 15 years, published in November, found at least 51 cases in which the S.E.C. concluded that Wall Street firms had broken antifraud laws that, as part of settlements of earlier fraud cases, they had pledged never to breach. The 51 cases spanned 19 firms, including nearly all of the biggest financial companies — Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase & Company and Bank of America among them.Mr. Obama first outlined his plans to crack down on repeat offenders in an economic speech in December in Osawatomie, Kan. “Too often, we’ve seen Wall Street firms violating major antifraud laws because the penalties are too weak and there’s no price for being a repeat offender,” Mr. Obama said. “No more. I’ll be calling for legislation that makes those penalties count so that firms don’t see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of doing business.”Mary Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C., similarly called on Congress in November to raise the maximum penalties the commission could assess for securities laws violations, and to allow it to assess greater fines for repeat violations of antifraud statutes.Currently, the S.E.C. can try to bring contempt charges only if a company has broken previous vows not to violate the law. In a letter to members of the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Schapiro said that enhancing the S.E.C.’s ability to crack down on repeat offenders would “substantially enhance the effectiveness of the commission’s enforcement program by addressing existing limitations that have resulted in criticism regarding the adequacy of commission actions against those who violate the securities laws.”The S.E.C. has also been criticized recently for its practice of allowing companies to settle allegations of securities fraud while neither admitting nor denying the charges. That is a standard practice used for years by the S.E.C. as well as other regulatory agencies, but it has come under increasing scrutiny since the financial crisis.Most recently, Judge Jed S. Rakoff of the Federal District Court in Manhattan rejected a proposed $285 million settlement in a case between the S.E.C. and Citigroup over a complex mortgage security that it marketed in 2007, as the housing market was beginning to crumble.In his opinion, Judge Rakoff said the settlement’s “neither admit nor deny” terms left him with no conclusive evidence with which to determine whether the proposed punishment was just.Judge Rakoff said such settlements, which often involve penalties of tens or hundreds of millions of dollars, were frequently viewed by the settling companies “as a cost of doing business imposed by having to maintain a working relationship with a regulatory agency, rather than as any indication of where the real truth lies.”In the State of the Union address, Mr. Obama said that banks and financial companies should be held accountable for their actions and should face the same type of consequences as anyone else who has been charged with breaking the law.1078 2012-01-25 Ghana, the four-time champion, narrowly held on for a 1-0 win in its first game at the African Cup of Nations, defeating a Botswana team that was in its first major tournament. Later, Mali scored a 1-0 win over Guinea.¶ This summer’s M.L.S. All-Star Game was awarded to the Philadelphia Union. The opponent for the league All-Stars has yet to be determined, but Commissioner Don Garber said an answer should come in the next two months. Last year’s game was held at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J., and pitted top Major League Soccer players against Manchester United. (AP)¶ A stunning goal by 37-year-old Alessandro Del Piero helped host Juventus to a 3-0 win over 10-man Roma in the Italian Cup quarterfinals.1079 2012-01-25 The supporting act in Apple’s product lineup — the iPad — also had a record quarter, with the company selling 15.4 million of its tablet devices over the holidays, more than double the number it sold during the same period the year before.After watching competitors stumble for the last two years, Apple faced its first credible competition in the tablet computer category this fall when Amazon introduced the Kindle Fire. The $199 device from the Internet retailer is significantly cheaper than the $499 starting price for the iPad and is closely linked to various Amazon online offerings including its e-book store, movie and music services.Mr. Cook said Apple’s iPad sales were not hurt by Amazon’s Kindle products, which have less computing power and are missing features like cameras for now. “Customers will buy those and they’ll sell a fair number of units,” he said. “But I don’t think people who want iPads will settle for limited functions.”The rosy results sent Apple shares soaring more than 7 percent in after-hours trading to more than $450 each. The jump increased the total value of Apple’s shares to more than $426 billion, pushing its market value past that of Exxon Mobil and making it the most highly valued company.Apple, which is based in Cupertino, Calif., said its net income for the period rose 118 percent to $13.06 billion, or $13.87 a share, compared with net income of $6 billion, or $6.43 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 73 percent to $46.33 billion, from $26.74 billion a year ago. Apple’s results were inflated slightly because its 2011 holiday quarter included 14 weeks of sales, rather than the 13 weeks in 2010, because of a change by the company.The results were better than the $10.08 a share in earnings and $38.85 billion in revenue expected by analysts, according to a poll by Thomson Reuters. Apple had forecast earnings of $9.30 a share and $37 billion for the quarter.“It almost defies words in terms of the strength across all products,” said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. “Everything about it eclipsed even the wildest expectations of analysts.”Apple said it sold 5.2 million Macintoshes during the holiday quarter, 26 percent more than it did a year earlier.The performance of Apple’s iPhone business underscores how the company has thrived in the mobile phone market, even as Google steadily nibbled away at the iPhone’s share of smartphones in recent years with handsets based on the Android operating system.Not only are Android phones made by a wide array of manufacturers, they have had wider distribution on carrier networks. The iPhone was initially limited to AT&T’s network in the United States and exclusive relationships with other carriers elsewhere in the world.But the iPhone is now available on the three largest wireless networks in the United States, with the addition of Sprint in the fall. And after it introduced the iPhone 4S, Apple also made its older iPhone 4 available for $99 and iPhone 3GS free with contracts through wireless carriers. Analysts say they think the move expanded the audience of potential iPhone buyers beyond people willing to spend $199 for Apple’s latest model of smartphone.There are signs that Apple’s strategy helped narrow Android’s lead in the market over the holidays. Nielsen, the audience measurement firm, said in a recent report that 61.6 percent of United States smartphone consumers surveyed in October said they had gotten an Android phone within the last three months, while only 25.1 percent got an iPhone.By December, though, Android’s lead among people who had acquired a smartphone recently had narrowed to 46.9 percent while 44.5 percent of consumers said they had bought an iPhone, Nielsen said. About 57 percent of iPhone owners in December said they got the new iPhone 4S, while the rest, 43 percent, got older iPhones.The iPhone 4S was initially derided by some critics for offering little improvement on the iPhone 4, with none of the bold outward design changes that make it easy for cellphone users to brag about owning the latest Apple gizmo. On the inside, though, the product has a better camera, faster microprocessor and a virtual assistant called Siri that lets people dictate texts and do Web searches with voice commands.Apple said it expects to report earnings of $8.50 a share and revenue of about $32.5 billion during the fiscal second quarter.Apple’s cash and securities ballooned to nearly $100 billion, an eye-popping sum that is likely to revive calls for Apple to return some of the hoard to investors in the form of stock buybacks and dividends. Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, told analysts that the company and its board of directors are “actively discussing” uses of the cash, including potential acquisitions and further investments in the company’s supply chain.“We’re not letting it burn a hole in our pockets,” he said.1080 2012-01-25 Yahoo increased its operating income 10 percent from the same quarter a year ago, but reported declining revenue and profit for the second consecutive quarter. The company’s net income in the fourth quarter dropped 5 percent, to $296 million, or 24 cents a share, from the year-ago quarter. Revenue fell 3 percent, to $1.17 billion, excluding commissions paid to Yahoo’s partners. Wall Street analysts had expected 24 cents a share, but slightly higher revenue of $1.19 million, according to a survey of analysts by Zacks Investment Research.The company has been trying to cut costs and build on its strength in online editorial content. With 702 million monthly users, Yahoo remains the most trafficked news site online. But, as Mr. Thompson acknowledged Tuesday, “the sheer number of users will not get us to where we need to be. We need to improve the quality of customer experiences.”To that end, the company announced a partnership with ABC to feature ABC News content on the Yahoo home page in October. But the biggest element of that turnaround effort, Yahoo’s display advertising business, fell 4 percent, to $546 million, compared with the same quarter a year ago. Meanwhile, the overall market for display advertising in the United States grew 23.5 percent, to $9.2 billion last quarter, according to eMarketer.Display advertising had traditionally been one of the company’s bright spots, but Yahoo continues to lose share to Facebook and Google. Yahoo’s share of the online ad market declined 11 percent last year, down from 13.3 percent in 2010. While Google’s share grew to 40.8 percent, from 38.5 percent, and Facebook’s share reached 6.4 percent, from 4.6 percent for the same period, according to eMarketer.“Getting our display advertising business on the right course is what I spend all my waking moments thinking about,” Mr. Thompson said in the call, though he did not offer any specifics.Yahoo’s search business also contracted for the quarter. It is operated by Microsoft under an agreement that extends to March 2013. Revenue from search, after payments to Microsoft and others, fell 3 percent, to $376 million.Mr. Thompson hinted that much of the company’s future innovation might come from the wealth of data it has on its 702 million users.“The data is very, very impressive,” he said. “If you believe data and great technology and great technologists can begin to predict what’s in a user’s mind, having that data to start from is a huge advantage. You’ll see some interesting, data-oriented experiences coming out sooner versus later.”Yahoo’s board has faced mounting pressure from activist investors, like Daniel Loeb of Third Point, to unlock shareholder value. The board had initially considered selling a minority stake to private equity suitors. It is now leaning toward a tax-efficient sale of its Asian assets to refocus on its core media assets in the United States where it has long suffered from declining revenue and an exodus of senior sales employees. Yahoo owns a 40 percent stake in Alibaba and a 35 percent stake in Yahoo Japan, valued at approximately $17 billion. Yahoo’s total market value is only slightly bigger at $19.5 billion.The company is looking to sell its interests in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan in a complicated “cash-rich split” tax deal in which these companies would buy some other operating businesses and trade them to Yahoo in exchange for their own stock.1081 2012-01-25 There is great debate in the scientific and public health community about what should be done regarding recent experiments in which scientists mutated H5N1 bird flu strains so that they could spread readily between ferrets.Ferrets are the best model for predicting human flu transmission, so the assumption should be that this new strain would spread among humans, perhaps as easily as seasonal flu.Both sides in the debate deeply value public health and are seeking to diminish the dangers of bird flu. The question is whether these new experiments increase or decrease the dangers of a bird flu pandemic.Naturally occurring H5N1 bird flu has killed nearly 60 percent of the 583 cases confirmed by the World Health Organization since 2003. Fortunately, it has not spread effectively among people. If this engineered transmissible H5N1 strain were to escape the lab by accident or intentional act, and if it maintained high lethality while spreading as effectively as seasonal flu, it could kill tens or hundreds of millions of people worldwide.Those in favor of the work have argued that it will improve bird flu surveillance and vaccine development efforts. But it seems unlikely that bird flu surveillance and control programs will be substantially changed based on this research. And developing vaccines against H5N1 strains that are actually emerging in nature does not require this kind of research.1082 2012-01-25 The I.M.F. cited continued high financing costs for European countries and weakness in European banks as two risks that had the capability to intensify each other and lead to “sizable contractions” in economic activity.Other risks include investor fear over the debts of big countries like the and , a “hard landing” in emerging economies and spiraling oil prices as the European bloc and the United States confront .The fund cut its growth forecasts for every region in the world, as well as for trade and commodity prices. The fund now estimates that Europe will experience a mild 0.1 percent — down from a September forecast of 1.4 percent growth — with a sharper contraction of 0.5 percent among the 17 countries that use the euro currency and deeper recessions in and . It also cut its estimate of global trade volumes.The I.M.F. did not change its growth forecast for the United States, however. Speaking with reporters, Olivier Blanchard, the fund’s chief economist, said that the “good and bad news” about the American economy were “more or less canceling each other” out:But the fund made a stark warning about the safety of the American financial system. The fund said that “potential spillovers” from the euro area crisis might “include direct exposures of U.S. to euro-area banks, or the sale of U.S. assets by European banks.”In recent months, American regulators and policy makers have played down such risks, pointing to sharply reduced exposure to Europe among money-market funds and banks.The I.M.F. also warned that the United States might turn to austerity budgeting too soon, imperiling its own recovery. Carlo Cottarelli, the director of the fiscal affairs department, cited such premature fiscal tightening as a “concrete risk.” He noted that the steep, automatic budget cuts put into place by Congress last year would lead to the biggest hit to spending in four decades. He called for a more “gradual decline in the deficit.”The same advice applies to the rest of the world, the fund said. Mr. Cottarelli warned that “both too little and too much adjustment will be bad for growth.” The main risk is that too many countries will cut their budgets too deeply, too soon, sapping demand from the global economy.Mr. Viñals, the director of the I.M.F.’s monetary and capital markets department, acknowledged that bond yields had declined in Europe in recent weeks. But he warned it “should not be taken for granted, as some sovereign debt markets remain under stress and bank funding markets are on life support by the .”Banks should continue to deleverage, the fund said, adding that they should do so by raising funds, rather than reducing and thus hampering economic activity.1083 2012-01-25 Seeking to counter the narrative of Tibetan advocacy groups about the violence in Luhuo, the Chinese government said Tuesday that the episode had started as a riot by monks and protesters who attacked stores and a police station.“The mob, some armed with knives, threw stones at police officers and destroyed two police vehicles and two ambulances,” said a report by Xinhua, the official news agency.Citing Hong Lei, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Xinhua said that one protester had been killed in Luhuo and that four protesters were hospitalized with injuries, while five police officers were injured.The accounts from both sides suggested that the violence in the area was the worst since a series of large-scale protests that rocked Tibetan-populated regions of China in early 2008, just five months before the Olympic Games in Beijing.Free Tibet and another overseas Tibetan advocacy group, the International Campaign for Tibet, as well as the Tibetan exile government in India, all said on Monday evening that security forces had opened fire on protesters in Luhuo, known in Tibetan as Draggo.Free Tibet said that 2 protesters had been killed and 31 wounded by gunfire, while the International Campaign for Tibet said that 3 protesters had been killed and 49 injured, nine of them with gunshot wounds.The exile government said that at least one person had been killed, and possibly six.The Xinhua report made no mention of gunfire. The Foreign Ministry was closed Tuesday in observance of the second day of Chinese New Year.Free Tibet had said that the protest might have started with demands for religious freedom, or with a refusal to observe Chinese New Year, which comes a month before the time when Tibetans traditionally mark a new year.“There had been some stones thrown, but we’re uncertain about the sequence of events, whether that was after the security forces opened fire,” Ms. Brigden said.She said that she had not heard any reports from the Tibetan side of knives wielded against the Chinese security forces, adding, “I would suggest that is untrue.”Citing a Tibetan monk in India, Radio Free Asia said that thousands of Tibetans had participated in the protest on Monday and that they had destroyed “Chinese shops and other Chinese facilities in the area.”Free Tibet also said in a separate statement that tear gas had been used on Monday against protesters in Aba, another ethnic Tibetan community located 100 miles northeast of Luhuo in western Sichuan Province.Mr. Hong was quoted by Xinhua as denouncing the Tibetan groups outside China, saying, “Overseas forces of ‘Tibet independence’ have always fabricated rumors and distorted the truth to discredit the Chinese government with issues involving Tibet.”1084 2012-01-25 The company added 1.5 million wireless subscribers over the quarter, bringing its total subscriber count to 108.7 million.“We have great momentum in wireless, and we expect to build on that strength,” said Francis J. Shammo, chief financial officer of Verizon, during a conference call after the earnings report was released.Profit margins, however, dropped because of the high subsidies that Verizon pays for each new iPhone bought by customers when they commit to a two-year contract.Wireless carriers subsidize a part of the retail price on most new cellphones to attract customers. The companies recoup the costs over the duration of the customer’s contract.Verizon said this week that it had a large lead over its rival AT&T in the race to build out a newer, faster network called 4G Long Term Evolution, or LTE. The company says it now has LTE networks deployed in 195 markets, compared with AT&T’s 26 markets, and it plans to make coverage from such so-called fourth-generation networks as ubiquitous as its older third-generation networks by mid-2013. Verizon said it sold 2.4 million 4G devices in the fourth quarter.Mr. Shammo added that Verizon’s wireless business intends to expand in the business market, as the company is planning wireless innovations for automobiles, health care and energy conservation.He said Verizon is advancing its lead in 4G at a time when AT&T is trying to obtain more spectrum needed to expand its networks. In one effort to gain spectrum, AT&T tried to merge with T-Mobile USA, but eventually withdrew the bid after it faced resistance from government agencies over antitrust concerns.While AT&T was pursuing the merger, Verizon made a deal with a consortium of cable companies, including Comcast and Time Warner, for $3.6 billion worth of spectrum.Though AT&T is far behind in acquiring spectrum, it is not out of the 4G game, said Christopher C. King, a telecom analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. The company still has enough spectrum to deploy its nationwide 4G LTE network.Verizon’s wireline business, which includes traditional landlines, continued to shrink. Quarterly revenue decreased 1.5 percent, to $10.14 billion.To Simon Leopold, an analyst at Morgan Keegan, Verizon’s aggressive pursuit of 4G networks symbolizes its continued investment in superior technologies to attract consumers and beat rivals. “ ‘It’s the network’ is not just a tagline with Verizon,” Mr. Leopold said. “It’s something that’s deep within their culture.”Verizon’s expansion of 4G will probably create new opportunities for makers of networking equipment, like Cisco, Alcatel Lucent and Juniper, meaning consumers can expect a wave of new devices compatible with the faster network in the coming year, Mr. Leopold said.1085 2012-01-25 Controversy swirls around private equity as attacks on Mitt Romney and the entire industry mount.

The figure, which reached a high of 80 percent in 1975, has been declining since 2006.John H. Pryor, director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the University of California, Los Angeles, which administers the survey, pointed to a related statistic: 18 percent of students, or nearly 1 in 5, who are accepted to their first-choice school decided not to attend.“When you look at those students, the primary thing that jumps out is cost and financial aid,” Mr. Pryor said in an interview. “These students who were accepted and are not attending are much more likely to say they are not going because they did not get the financial aid they wanted.”1131 2012-01-26 Given that Washington provides only about 10 percent of education financing, the federal government’s effort to dictate policy in an area that has always been left to the states may raise hackles.“I will concede that having the federal government decree this, that’s going to stick hard with some people,” said Bob Wise, president of the Alliance for Excellent Education, which supports the proposal. “But with almost a third of our students dropping out of high school, we have an economic crisis and we need to be sending a stronger message about the importance of education.”And, he said, it would not be hard for the federal government to incentivize the higher age requirement by making it a condition of states’ getting Race to the Top grants or other federal education money.Several economists, over two decades, have found that higher dropout ages improve not only graduation rates but entrance to higher education and career outcomes. “The evidence is quite robust that raising the school-leaving age increases educational attainment,” said Philip Oreopoulos, an economics professor at the University of Toronto, whose study found, however, that exceptions to the law, lenience in enforcement and weak consequences for truancy could all interfere with an increase. “Ideally, you use both a carrot and stick approach, so that if students have to stay in school longer you’re also providing wider curriculum options that might interest them.”In a 2010 report on the dropout problem, Robert Balfanz, a research scientist at Johns Hopkins University, found that of the six states that increased the compulsory school age from 2002 to 2008, two — Illinois and South Dakota — experienced increases in their graduation rates, and one, Nevada, had a decline.“It’s symbolically and strategically important to raise the age to 18, but it’s not the magical thing that in itself will keep kids in school,” Dr. Balfanz said.Most policy experts warn that to prevent dropouts, schools need a broad range of supports for struggling students, as far back as the middle grades.“There’s a whole array of reasons students drop out: teen pregnancy, financial obligations, detachment from the school environment, boredom, feeling the curriculum has no relevance in the real world,” said Jennifer Dounay Zinth, a senior policy analyst at the Education Commission of the States. “Schools need to intervene quickly if there are warning flags.”1132 2012-01-26 Goalkeeper Hope Solo has a leg injury, a result of work she was doing to get back into playing shape after “Dancing With the Stars,” that could keep her out of the game that determines whether the United States women’s national team goes to the Olympics.Coach Pia Sundhage said she needed to see how Solo was recovering from a pulled right quadriceps before deciding on the lineup for the game Friday against Costa Rica in the semifinals of the Concacaf Olympic qualifier in Vancouver, British Columbia. The winner goes to London; the loser stays home.1133 2012-01-26 Seth Wescott, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in snowboardcross, is out for the season after surgery to reattach a torn pectoral muscle to the bone in his upper arm. Wescott, who was hurt in a World Cup race last Thursday, is expected to recover fully.1134 2012-01-26 Brazil granted a tourist visa on Wednesday to Yoani Sánchez, a dissident Cuban author and blogger, ahead of a trip to Cuba this month by Brazil’s president, Dilma Rousseff. The request by Ms. Sánchez to travel to Brazil for the screening of a documentary had emerged as a test of Cuba’s restrictive travel policies for its own citizens and Brazil’s willingness to prod a friendly government on a prominent human rights issue. Ms. Sánchez, 36, had appealed personally for the visa to Ms. Rousseff, a former member of an urban guerrilla cell, referring to a photograph made public in December that showed Ms. Rousseff as a young woman being questioned at a military hearing by men whose faces were covered. It remains to be seen whether Cuba will allow her to travel to Brazil.1135 2012-01-26 MUIR WOODS NATIONAL MONUMENT, Calif. — What do you get when you bring together a groundbreaking lesbian poet, a famous Zen philosopher, the founder of a prostitutes’ union and the inventor of the self-regulating filtered hot tub?The answer: Druid Heights — a once-thriving Bay Area bohemia deep in the forest, now moldering despite the best efforts of its residents, a few hardy holdovers from the counterculture, to maintain it.Secreted away one and a half miles down a dirt road, Druid Heights is unknown to thousands of tourists who flock to the misty redwoods of Muir Woods, even as it comes under review by the National Park Service for recognition as a historic or culturally significant site. The philosopher Alan Watts, who died here in 1973 in the Mandala House, a circular work of architecture resembling a spinning top, wrote of this community’s “numinous, mythological quality,” which drew artists, writers, musicians and hedonists from 1954 through the early ’70s.Among them were the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Gary Snyder; Margo St. James, who organized the union for prostitutes; Catharine A. MacKinnon, the feminist law professor who advises the International Criminal Court in The Hague on gender issues; and the lesbian poet Elsa Gidlow, whose ashes reside near the Moon Temple. Her guest room and meditation cabin still exude an otherworldly goddess aura.In the 1970s, the Park Service bought the land the community sits on to protect endangered species and the watershed of Muir Woods. It gave the three former owners who remained, all of them still alive, the legal right to remain in Druid Heights until their deaths. But the fate of the place is uncertain, with the Park Service now determining whether Druid Heights, its once-renegade hot tub an evocative ruin, is culturally noteworthy enough to qualify for the National Register of Historic Places.In his 1962 book, “The Joyous Cosmology,” Mr. Watts, the English-born popularizer of Eastern religion and philosophy, described sitting amid fuchsia and hummingbirds with fellow residents, eating homemade bread and drinking white wine. Collectively, he suggested, they had escaped the strictures of modern society, “no longer the humdrum and harassed little personalities with names, addresses and social security numbers.”1136 2012-01-26 No phrase better evokes wealth and its mysteries than “Swiss bank account.” And for all the mind-numbing complexity and eye-popping wealth revealed in Mitt Romney’s tax returns this week, no other detail more stirred the public imagination, or drew more insinuation from his enemies, than the relatively modest — by their standards — $3 million that a trust in the name of Mr. Romney’s wife reported holding in a Swiss money-market account.Mr. Romney’s campaign has said there was nothing unusual or tax-evasive about the account, and no evidence has emerged to contradict it. But that did not appear to dissuade his critics.Mr. Romney’s rivals for the Republican presidential nomination stoked the widely held suspicion that Swiss banking is a nefarious enclave of the privileged and the tax-averse. Democrats on Capitol Hill whispered that Mr. Romney would not pass muster as his party’s nominee for Treasury secretary, let alone president, with such an asset among his millions. And President Obama’s proxies at the Democratic National Committee suggested that Mr. Romney, who released more than 500 pages of tax returns on Tuesday, was holding something back.“What is Mitt Romney hiding, and where is he hiding it?” the party asked in a Web video, laying out a litany of abuses wrought by Swiss bank secrecy, interspersed with clips of Mr. Romney’s lawyer, R. Bradford Malt, explaining the account.Mr. Malt, who manages the family’s blind trusts, said Tuesday in a conference call that he had opened the account with the United Bank of Switzerland in 2003 and closed it in 2010. The account was reported to the United States government; the interest it accrued in 2010, about $1,700, was reported on tax documents the campaign released this week.1137 2012-01-26 The freshman swingman Le’Bryan Nash scored a career-high 27 points Wednesday night as host Oklahoma State defeated No. 2 Missouri, 79-72.Brian Williams added 22 points for the Cowboys (10-10, 3-4 Big 12). Ricardo Ratliffe had 25 points to lead Missouri (18-2, 5-2).DUKE 74, MARYLAND 61 No. 8 Duke bounced back from Saturday’s loss to Florida State by beating host Maryland for the 10th time in 11 meetings. Mason Plumlee scored 23 points for Duke (17-3, 5-1 Atlantic Coast Conference). The Terrapins fell to 12-7, 2-3.FLORIDA ST. 75, WAKE FOREST 52 No. 23 Florida State (14-6, 5-1) won its fifth straight A.C.C. game as Michael Snaer scored 18 points. Host Wake Forest (11-9, 2-4) lost center Ty Walker to a concussion in the first half.MICHIGAN ST. 68, MINNESOTA 52 Coach Tom Izzo earned his 400th win as No. 10 Michigan State (17-4, 6-2 Big Ten) prevailed at home. Minnesota is 15-6, 3-5.1138 2012-01-26 Mr. Kelly did not appear on Thursday morning on the television show on which he is an anchor.Paul J. Browne, the deputy commissioner of public information at the Police Department, referred most questions about the case to Mr. Vance’s office. Mr. Vance declined to comment.The woman, who is in her late 20s or early 30s, walked into the 13th Precinct station house with her sister sometime after 8 p.m. on Tuesday and made her complaint, according to one of the law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the continuing investigation and the sensitivity of discussing accusations against the police commissioner’s son.The woman told the police that she met the younger Mr. Kelly on the street and that the two went to South Street Seaport for drinks on Oct. 8. They then proceeded to her office at a Lower Manhattan law firm. The woman told the police that the rape occurred at the office. The two continued to have contact by phone and text message after the encounter.According to the woman’s account, when her boyfriend later learned about the night, he became angry. He then approached the police commissioner at a public event and told him that the younger Mr. Kelly had sexually assaulted his girlfriend.The commissioner, according to the woman’s account, told him to write a letter. It was unclear if the man did so.Commissioner Kelly’s account of his encounter with the boyfriend is similar, though according to Mr. Browne, the man told the commissioner that his son had “ruined my girlfriend’s life” but declined it to discuss it there. So the commissioner suggested that he write the letter.Mr. Kelly, who is currently a co-anchor of “Good Day New York” on the Fox station WNYW (Channel 5), is a former NY1 political reporter. He served as a fighter pilot for nine years in the United States Marine Corps and holds the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Reserves.A few minutes after “Good Day New York” began on Thursday, one of the anchors reported the account of the accusation against Mr. Kelly and his lawyer’s statement was shown on the screen. No explanation was given for Mr. Kelly’s absence from the show.1139 2012-01-26 Boeing’s revenue hit a record $68.74 billion for all of 2011, and the company forecast that sales would reach $78 billion to $80 billion in 2012. It also predicted that it would deliver 585 to 600 jets in 2012, up from 477 in 2011, as plane orders continue to recover from the recession.Several analysts said Boeing was often conservative in its earnings forecasts. But Robert Stallard, an analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients that “the scale of the shortfall versus consensus may surprise some.”He also said that the company’s projected Dreamliner shipments were “also a little lower than we had been looking for.”Shares of Boeing closed up 46 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $75.82.Boeing’s chief executive, W. James McNerney, said that by the second half of the year, the 787s rolling off the assembly line would require much less corrective work. He also expressed confidence that the company could stay on track in expanding the production rate to 10 Dreamliners a month by the end of 2013.The Dreamliner is the first commercial airliner made substantially of lightweight carbon composites to reduce fuel costs. Before the first delivery last year, it had received more advance orders — more than 800 — than any plane in history. Boeing is counting on it to overtake its European rival, Airbus, in total plane sales.Mr. McNerney said Boeing was building 2.5 Dreamliners each month and planned to increase that to five a month by the end of 2012. The company has said it will make little profit on the first several dozen planes. It has had to repair parts that came from suppliers and make design changes.Boeing said revenue for its military business came in at $32 billion in 2011, about the same as in 2010. Pentagon officials are expected to detail cuts in spending on Thursday, and Boeing and other military contractors are seeking sales to foreign governments to offset the domestic cuts.On Wednesday, General Dynamics cited the Pentagon cuts in forecasting 2012 earnings below expectations. It now expects earnings from continuing operations of $7.10 to $7.20 a share. The average analyst estimate was $7.62, according to Bloomberg.Jay L. Johnson, the company’s chief executive, told analysts the company’s military sales might fall 1 to 2 percent this year.The company’s fourth-quarter profit fell 17.3 percent amid problems at a unit in Switzerland that refurbishes business jets. Net income dropped to $603 million, or $1.68 a share, compared with $729 million, or $1.91 a share, in the year-earlier period. Sales increased 6.3 percent, to $9.15 billion.General Dynamics is counting on foreign military sales and its aerospace unit, which makes Gulfstream business jets, to offset the reductions at the Pentagon, Mr. Johnson said. He said he expected Gulfstream’s new G650 and G280 planes to go into service by mid-2012.United Technologies has also turned to its commercial aerospace business to bolster results. It said on Wednesday that its profit increased 11 percent in the fourth quarter, thanks to increases in its aviation parts business.Net income was $1.33 billion, or $1.47 a share, compared with $1.2 billion, or $1.31 a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales rose 1 percent, to $14.97 billion.The company repeated an earlier forecast for a 2012 profit of $5.80 to $6 a share, up from $5.49 a share in 2011. It expects revenue to rise to $59 billion to $60 billion from $58.19 billion last year.1140 2012-01-26 Back during the global commodity boom, which continued through the spring of 2008, the world’s shipowners could hardly place orders for freighters fast enough. But because of the long lead times in shipbuilding, those vessels only now are being delivered by the hundreds — into a very different, much less robust international economy than when they were ordered.For the shipping industry, the glut means not only lower charter fares, but also steep declines in the value of their vessels. The bigger losers, though, could eventually be some big European banks, many of which are already struggling with big losses on their holdings of government bonds from Greece, Italy and other heavily indebted European nations.Basil Karatzas, the chief executive of Karatzas Marine Advisors, a ship brokerage and finance advisory firm in Manhattan, estimated that European banks hold about $500 billion in shipping loans on their books and face nearly $100 billion in losses to restructure them.Just as American banks have grappled with huge loan losses for houses that are worth less than their mortgages, European banks face tens of billions of dollars in potential losses on shipping loans.The banks’ “biggest concern is what is the write-off, and how do you treat it from an accounting point of view,” Mr. Karatzas said. “They do not know how to deal with these losses.”Banks in Europe have long been the world leaders in ship financing because many of the biggest fleet owners are based there. But many have abruptly stopped lending money to shipowners. Some, as they scramble to muster capital to meet tougher reserve requirements demanded by European banking regulators, have even tried to raise money by asking some shipowners to prepay loans in exchange for a discount.There is a scant secondary market for ship loans right now, except at deep discounts that banks are loath to agree to, according to shipping finance experts. Even for loans on which the vessel is still worth more than the mortgage, these experts say, the discount demanded is about 20 percent.Commerzbank in Germany and the Lloyds Banking Group in Britain are among European institutions that have publicly said they were reducing their exposure to shipping loans.Société Générale in France also has been looking for ways to reduce its holdings of shipping loans and instead focus on providing financial advice to shipping companies, according to two people with knowledge of the bank’s moves.The bank declined to provide a comment on its shipping exposure ahead of the release of its annual financial report next month.Shipowners, meantime, are nervously monitoring an industry benchmark, the Baltic Dry Index of bulk freighter charter rates, which has lost more than half its value since the start of the year. The index is now at its lowest level since January 2009, during the depths of the economic downturn after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.And as charter rates plummet, so do prices of the vessels themselves. A large tanker that sold for $137 million in early 2008, the Samho Dream, was repossessed by bankers late last year and sold last week in Hong Kong for just $28.3 million.The world’s tonnage of large freighters is climbing by more than 10 percent a year, with 1,650 large freighters for bulk commodities expected to emerge from shipyards this year alone.As long as the shipped tonnage of world trade is creeping up at an annual rate of only 2 to 3 percent a year, the oversupply can only grow more burdensome for the seaborne freight industry.Making the glut especially acute right now is the fact that shipyards have delivered a large number of vessels to owners since the beginning of the year. Just as some car buyers wait to buy a car at the start of a model year — because it will hold its resale value longer — shipowners have traditionally taken delivery of as many vessels as possible in January, so as to have a full calendar year’s use before a vessel celebrates its first birthday, said Natasha Boyden, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York.Buyers who might be tempted to refuse delivery of vessels can lose their deposits, which are typically up to 40 percent of the contract price of the ship. But it is getting harder to borrow money from struggling banks to pay for the remaining 60 percent — particularly with resale values now much lower than the prices at which contracts were signed four or five years ago.Freight rates are now close to operating costs for many bulk freighters, leaving almost nothing to pay the mortgage, so more old vessels may be scrapped in the coming years, which would eventually reduce oversupply.Worldwide lending for ships totaled about $100 billion last year, down only slightly from previous years, according to industry estimates. But as much as three-quarters of last year’s loans were to refinance or restructure previous loans that the borrowers were struggling to repay, shipping finance executives said.One big question is whether the plunge in freight rates might also signal further trouble in the global economy. World oil demand has been fairly flat lately because of weak economic growth, so there has been limited need for more tankers to haul oil.The biggest market for bulk carriers lies in carrying iron ore to China’s voracious steel mills. But with a real estate slowdown in China undermining demand for steel, the annual growth rate of Chinese iron ore imports has abruptly slowed since October.Harley Seyedin, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in South China, said that many construction projects had slowed to a crawl, with barely enough work being done for developers to persuade their bankers to continue financing projects already under way.Yet the growing glut of vessels, combined with seasonal factors, could skew the reliability of shipping as a global economic indicator. Bad weather lately off Australia and Brazil, the two countries where bulk freighters are most likely to take on iron ore and other cargo, has made companies leery of chartering vessels and risk waiting for days for ports to reopen after storms.Further confusing the picture is that the cost to ship a container from China to the United States or Europe actually jumped in the first two weeks of this year, as factories rushed to fill orders before shutting down for up to a month for the Chinese New Year, which began Monday. But that could be a misleading metric, because container rates temporarily surge every year for the last sailings before the Chinese New Year.Even if world trade does not slow in the coming months, the shipping industry still has a long way to go before cargo demand can possibly catch up to capacity. Meantime, bulk freighters, container ships, tankers and refrigerator ships by the hundreds may continue to bob idly in the waves here, their hulls showing wide bands of paint that would be submerged if the vessels were fully laden.1141 2012-01-26 “F.D.A. Creeps Forward” (editorial, Jan. 11) highlights the agency’s action to limit misuse of an important human class of antibiotics (cephalosporins) in food animal production.Factory farms are major contributors to the selection and transfer of drug resistance genes, which threaten human health. Animals far outnumber humans in the United States and consume a higher volume of antibiotics, particularly at subtherapeutic doses for growth promotion. Sludge and downstream waterways from farms create an environment where drug resistance can transfer to human pathogens, leading to treatment failure.We applaud the Food and Drug Administration order. But we see this as a small first step toward improving antibiotic use in animal husbandry and curtailing drug resistance. More needs to be done. Antibiotic resistance in American hospitals now costs $20 billion a year. Responsible stewardship of antibiotics should be practiced in food animals as in humans.The writer, a medical doctor, is director of the Center for Adaptation Genetics and Drug Resistance at Tufts University School of Medicine and president of the Alliance for the Prudent Use of Antibiotics.1142 2012-01-26 Re “Gingrich ‘Super PAC’ Gets Cash Infusion of $5 Million” (front page, Jan. 24): It is time for both the legislative and the judicial branches of our government to step in to stop the selling of our entire political system to the highest bidder. The notion that regulating campaign contributions impinges on free speech is preposterous.The way to support free speech is to create an environment that allows those who cannot pay millions of dollars for air time to compete with those who can — not to allow big business and the wealthiest citizens to buy a platform from which they can speak louder and longer than anyone else.That isn’t free speech; it’s speech at a premium. It doesn’t take much to figure out that the current rules (or lack of same) will lead to policies that favor the wealthy few over the not-so-wealthy majority — hardly anyone’s idea of a democratic ideal.1143 2012-01-26 After a haltingly poor performance in the middle of last year, Netflix reported fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday that exceeded analysts’ expectations and a subscriber uptick that surpassed its own outlook.The company posted total revenue of $875.6 million, up 47 percent from the quarter last year. As the company invested in content rights and spent more to gain new subscribers, its profit, $40.7 million, or 73 cents a share, was down nearly 14 percent from the quarter last year, when its profit was $47.1 million, or 87 cents a share.Reed Hastings, the company’s chief executive, said he was encouraged by the number of new sign-ups for streaming video, the service that he is emphasizing as Netflix’s DVD-by-mail service shrinks. In a letter to investors, he and the company’s chief financial officer, David Wells, called Netflix a “global Internet TV network,” reflecting the growing importance of TV shows to a company that started as a distributor of movies on DVD. Netflix is also beginning to make its own shows, in much the same way that HBO and Showtime do.The fourth quarter was the first full quarter since a price increase and a bungled — and later abandoned — plan to spin off its DVD-by-mail service hurt the company’s reputation and decimated its stock price. It lost about 800,000 subscribers in the United States in the third quarter, leveling off at 23.8 million; at the end of the fourth quarter, it had 24.4 million, somewhat more than it had expected to have.Investors welcomed these signs of recovery, sending the stock up about 15 percent in after-hours trading on Wednesday, after ending regular trading at $95.04. The stock, which plummeted from $300 to well under $100 last summer and fall, has rebounded about 30 percent in the last few weeks.1144 2012-01-26 The outsourcing of manufacturing jobs remains a major sore point for most Americans. But owners of some of the nation’s most popular electronics — including iPhones and iPads — are less concerned than other Americans about where their purchases are made, according to a nationwide survey conducted by The New York Times.Apple, meanwhile, remains a hugely popular American company. More than three-quarters of respondents said they had a very favorable or mostly favorable opinion of Apple.The Times poll found that most Americans considered it very important to buy American-made products.Over all, 52 percent of the public said it was very important that the products they buy were made in the United States; only 42 percent of owners of Apple products agreed.Outsourcing, they say, is clearly a cause of fewer jobs domestically. And two-thirds of the public wants American companies to shoulder a lot of responsibility to keep manufacturing jobs in the United States.“Things would be more expensive if they were made here, and companies want to cut costs. Everything seems to be about money,” said Dannie Gilchrist of Oskaloosa, Iowa, in a follow-up interview. “I would be willing to pay more for items manufactured here,” he added, volunteering that he owned an iPad. “I think if people knew products were made entirely overseas they wouldn’t buy as much of them.”Owners of Apple products were largely aware that Apple products had a large foreign manufacturing component. Most, 54 percent, said they were made partly in the United States and partly overseas, 18 percent said entirely overseas, 8 percent said entirely in the United States and 20 percent said they did not know.“I had no idea where they are made. But 90 percent of the products we have in America are made overseas,” Mariann Bellville of Haverhill, Mass., said. “We don’t like it, but we don’t have a heck of a choice. You can’t get a coffee pot made totally in this country.”1145 2012-01-26 Results from a telephone survey conducted by The New York Times in Nov. 2011....1146 2012-01-26 Tiny substances called nanomaterials have moved into the marketplace over the last decade, in products as varied as cosmetics, clothing and paint. But not enough is known about their potential health and environmental risks, which should be studied further, an expert panel of the National Academy of Sciences said on Wednesday.Nanoscale forms of substances like silver, carbon, zinc and aluminum have many useful properties. Nano zinc oxide sunscreen goes on smoothly, for example, and nano carbon is lighter and stronger than its everyday or “bulk” form. But researchers say these products and others can also be ingested, inhaled or possibly absorbed through the skin. And they can seep into the environment during manufacturing or disposal.Nanomaterials are engineered on the scale of a billionth of a meter, perhaps one ten-thousandth the width of a human hair, or less. Not enough is known about the effects, if any, that nanomaterials have on human health and the environment, according to a report issued by the academy’s expert panel. The report says that “critical gaps” in understanding have been identified but “have not been addressed with needed research.”And because the nanotechnology market is expanding — it represented $225 billion in product sales in 2009 and is expected to grow rapidly in the next decade — “today’s exposure scenarios may not resemble those of the future,” the report says.The panel called for a four-part research effort focusing on identifying sources of nanomaterial releases, processes that affect exposure and hazards, nanomaterial interactions at subcellular to ecosystem-wide levels and ways to accelerate research progress.1147 2012-01-26 In November, sales at stores open at least a year fell 2 percent, and in December, same-store sales rose just 0.3 percent, both well below industry averages, and it recently cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast because of the bad holiday sales. From 2006 to 2011, “J. C. Penney has had the worst performance among peers,” a Barclays Capital analyst, Robert S. Drbul, wrote in a note to clients.While many shoppers go to Walmart for price, Target for cheap style, high-end stores for luxury treats and the Web for ease, stores like J. C. Penney have faded into the background.At the presentation on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson outlined some of Penney’s current troubles and his proposals to fix them.Though retailers use promotional pricing to attract shoppers, even if they often vow to move away from it when it gets too pronounced, Mr. Johnson said the method used what he called “fake prices” — artificially inflated prices that are on near-constant markdowns.But consumers, he said, were not fooled. From 2002 to 2011, the average cost that Penney paid for an item stayed about the same, from $9 to $10. During that period, though, Penney increased the average price tag to $36 from about $27. Yet even as the price tag rose, customers ended up paying less because of coupons or sales. “Now most things are on 60 percent markdown, and every time we do that, we’re discounting Penney’s brand,” he said.Mr. Johnson said that 72 percent of Penney’s revenue came from products sold at a discount of 50 percent or more. The company is repricing all its items to fit within its three-tiered pricing system. For instance, a T-shirt that was priced last year at $14, but sold closer to $6 after promotions, will now be priced at $7.Also, he said, customers had to deal with a confusing number of promotional e-mails, fliers and ads. Last year, Penney ran 590 unique promotions, he said, but the average customer visited only four times.“So customers ignored us 99 percent of the time,” he said. “At some point, you, as a brand, look desperate if you have to market that much.” He will move to monthlong promotions, on which Penney will spend $80 million a month, he said, which is a decrease from Penney’s current marketing spending level, which is more than $1 billion a year. And instead of mailed fliers, the company will send shoppers a 96-page catalog each month with a more magazinelike presentation.Mr. Johnson said that dividing the stores into specialty boutiques was meant to take advantage of a larger industry trend.“When we want a great product today, we go to a specialty store” like J. Crew, or H&M, Mr. Johnson said, and he wanted to create a specialty-store feeling within Penney. The move expands on what Penney has already done, creating store-within-a-store areas for brands like Sephora, where sales per square foot are three times higher than the average of the rest of Penney.Target announced earlier this month that it was pursuing a similar strategy, adding local shops to its stores for a limited time.In terms of the products themselves, Mr. Johnson and Michael R. Francis, Penney’s new president and the former chief marketing officer of Target, said that Penney was cutting dozens of its 400 or so brands, mostly the private labels that the company created. “It’s almost like we’re selling clothes by the pound” for those, Mr. Johnson said.Penney did not disclose the projected cost of these changes, but it has already invested heavily in its new top officials. It has given four of its new executives — Mr. Johnson, Mr. Francis, the chief talent officer Daniel Walker and the chief operating officer Michael W. Kramer — a total of almost $134 million in stock grants, based on Wednesday’s closing price. And in the third quarter, it awarded those four executives, along with the two executives that they replaced, $36 million in one-time cash payments. Penney’s shares fell 0.95 percent on Wednesday to $34.27.Mr. Johnson, who spent more than a decade at Apple, stressed the similarities between that company and J. C. Penney now (both had market share of about 3 percent when he joined, he said). But those who were expecting Apple-esque technological prowess — a dressing-room mirror that could offer styling tips, perhaps? — from Mr. Johnson’s presentation did not get it.“You have to stay tuned. I’ve been here 90 days — dazzling technology takes time,” he said. “Changing the merchandise takes time. Getting new partners to carry in-store takes time. And we have a very clear vision for exactly what will happen.”1148 2012-01-26 Demand for bonds was higher. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 18/32, to 100. The yield fell to 2.0 percent, from 2.06 percent late Tuesday.Apple was a standout in what has otherwise been a fairly lackluster earnings season. So far, 57 percent of companies reporting have beaten forecasts, while at this stage in previous earnings seasons, an average of 70 percent of businesses beat analysts’ forecasts.Apple shares touched a record high of $454.45 on results issued after Tuesday’s market close that sailed past expectations. The increase pushed Apple’s market capitalization above that of Exxon Mobil.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 81.21 points, or 0.64 percent, at 12,756.96. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 11.41 points, or 0.87 percent, at 1,326.06. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 31.67 points, or 1.14 percent, at 2,818.31.In other earnings news, the video company Netflix reported results that outpaced Wall Street’s expectations, sending shares up about 13 percent, to $107.40, in after-hours trading.During the regular trading session, both United Technologies and Rockwell Automation shares fell after the companies slightly missed revenue forecasts. United Technologies shares closed down 0.13 percent at $77.65 and Rockwell dropped 2.9 percent to $79.42.Another diversified manufacturer, Textron, surged 14.6 percent to $24.76 after it raised its 2012 profit forecast. The S.& P. industrials index gained 1.2 percent.Corning tumbled 10.7 percent to $13.05 as manufacturers cut back on the production of big-screen televisions that use the company’s specialty glass.Applications for home loans declined 5.4 percent last week after two straight weeks of gains, the Mortgage Bankers Association said in a report.“We are encouraged by the pop in prices as it may be a signal of further stabilization in the housing market and evidence that the erosion in home prices may be nearing an end,"" said Millan Mulraine, senior macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed in December, dropped 3.5 percent to 96.6 in December, after hitting a 19-month high in November.Economists had expected signed contracts for sales, which lead existing home sales by a month or two, to fall by only 1 percent. However, sales were up 5.6 percent in the 12 months to December.The reports on Wednesday did not change perceptions that a nascent recovery is under way in the housing market, which continues to be challenged by an oversupply of properties.“This is potentially negative for January existing home sales although the two do not always go hand in hand,” said Jennifer Lee, a senior economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto. “So does this mean the story has changed and housing is back in the dumps? Nope.”Another report by the Federal Housing Finance Agency showed house prices rose 1 percent in November from October.1149 2012-01-26 THE HAGUE, Netherlands — An Estonian citizen was arrested by Dutch police at the request of American authorities investigating the file-sharing Web site Megaupload, a prosecutor’s office spokeswoman said Wednesday.Also Wednesday, a New Zealand judge denied Kim Dotcom, the Megaupload founder, bail following his arrest last week on American accusations of copyright infringement.The prosecutor’s office spokeswoman, Marieke van der Molen, declined to release the name of the latest man arrested in line with Dutch privacy rules, but a United States Justice Department official identified him as software programmer Andrus Nomm, 32, a citizen of Estonia and a resident of both Turkey and Estonia.Ms. Van der Molen said the suspect was arrested last Friday and appeared on Monday before a judge, who ordered him detained for 60 days pending an American extradition request.Judge David McNaughton in Auckland denied Mr. Dotcom bail pending a hearing Feb. 22 on his possible extradition to face trial in the United States, saying Mr. Dotcom poses a flight risk. Mr. Dotcom, 38, insisted he was innocent and posed no flight risk.New Zealand police arrested three other Megaupload employees last week on American accusations that they facilitated millions of illegal downloads of films, music and other content, costing copyright holders at least $500 million in lost revenue. Judge McNaughton was expected to make bail rulings on the three later this week or early next week.1150 2012-01-26 8:43 p.m. | Updated      The prominent money manager David Einhorn and his hedge fund, Greenlight Capital, were fined about $11 million by Britain's financial regulator on Wednesday for using confidential information to trade in the stock of a Bri...1151 2012-01-26 WEISSMAN--Alisha.

For anyone who spent time in Issue Project’s former home, a tiny space at the Old American Can Factory, also in Brooklyn, this is a new world: the room is spacious (5,000 square feet) and rich in retro grandeur, with marble floors, columns and arches, and a high, ornate ceiling.Though the hall is comfortably functional now, another two years of renovations are planned. Then it will be an entirely flexible space, with neither a permanent stage nor fixed seating, so that performers can use it in any of several configurations. Right now colorful, sound-absorbing panels dot the walls, and according to Ed Patuto, Issue Project’s executive director, the organization has halved the room’s natural reverberation time of about five seconds. Mr. Patuto said he would like to shave off another second or so.But as they are, the acoustics suited the experimental works that the Wet Ink Ensemble performed at the inaugural concert, the first installment of Gaudeamus Muziekweek New York. The series is an American version of a Dutch new-music festival that has flourished since 1945. The festival, in Utrecht, does not focus particularly on Dutch music; its scope is international, and the Brooklyn edition is following suit, with a Dutch group, Ensemble MAE, joining two American ones, Wet Ink and the International Contemporary Ensemble, in programs that are global and eclectic.That said, Wet Ink’s opening concert was devoted mostly to American works, with a piece by the Japanese composer Yoshiaki Onishi as the sole exception. All were, at heart, about morphing timbres and textures, and whether by design or by happenstance, they added up to an impressive demonstration of the space’s tolerances for dynamic breadth and clarity of projection.In “Nucleus” Alex Mincek, the composer and saxophonist, offered a philosophical look at repetition and variation, moving between repeated (but subtly different) figures and sudden changes that retained some of the melodic DNA of the repetitions. Not surprisingly, the similar phrases arrested the ear, but the quick changes in tempo, volume and density proved more memorable.Another of the ensemble’s composer-performers, Kate Soper, sang her own “cipher,” an exotic score in which her vocal settings of text fragments from Wittgenstein, Freud, Jenny Holzer, Michael Drayton and Sara Teasdale closely matched, in timbre and gesture, a brash violin line played energetically by Joshua Modney. Sometimes Ms. Soper ran a hand along the fingerboard.1162 2012-01-27 The California Air Resources Board approved a recommendation that included the projection of 1.4 million additional zero-emission and transitional zero-emission vehicles to be on state roads by 2025....1163 2012-01-27 The California Air Resources Board approved a recommendation that included the requirement of 1.4 million additional zero-emission and transitional zero-emission vehicles to be on state roads by 2025....1164 2012-01-27 Just how long have Americans and Europeans been vying to acquire badges proving their Chinese connection?

(AP)1190 2012-01-27 Researchers like Bing Liu, a computer science professor at the at , are also taking notice, trying to devise mathematical models to systematically unmask the bogus endorsements. “More people are depending on reviews for what to buy and where to go, so the incentives for faking are getting bigger,” said Mr. Liu. “It’s a very cheap way of marketing.”By last week, 310 out of 335 reviews of VIP Deals’ Vipertek brand premium slim black leather case folio cover were five stars and nearly all the rest were four stars. The acclaim seemed authentic, barring the occasional indiscretion. “I would have done 4 stars instead of 5 without the deal,” one man bluntly wrote.VIP Deals, which specializes in leather tablet cases and , denied it was quietly offering the deals. “You are totally off base,” a representative named Monica wrote in an e-mail.But three customers said in interviews that the offer was straightforward. Searching for a protective case for their new Kindle Fire, they came upon the VIP page selling a cover for under $10 plus shipping (the official list price was $59.99). When the package arrived it included a letter extending an invitation “to write a product review for the Amazon community.”“In return for writing the review, we will refund your order so you will have received the product for free,” it said.Anne Marie Logan, a pharmacist, was suspicious. “I was like, ‘Is this for real?’ ” she said. “But they credited my account. You think it’s unethical?”While the letter did not specifically demand a five-star review, it broadly hinted. “We strive to earn 100 percent perfect ‘FIVE-STAR’ scores from you!” it said.The merchant, which seems to have no Web site and uses a mailbox drop in suburban as a return address, did not respond to further requests for comment. As of last week, the company (as opposed to its products) had received 4,945 reviews on Amazon for a nearly perfect 4.9 rating out of five.Amazon is expected to sell 20 million Kindle Fire tablets this year, making the market for cases potentially enormous. But it is also bitterly competitive, with dozens of models in Amazon’s Kindle showroom. With a modest , VIP pushed its product far above the competition, none of which had so much enthusiasm with so little dissent. Customers like Ms. Logan, who got something they had genuinely wanted for only a small shipping charge, were of course thrilled. And Amazon racked up more revenue.Even a few grouches could not spoil the party. “This is an egregious violation of the ratings and review system used by Amazon,” a customer named Robert S. Pollock wrote in a review he titled “scam.”He was promptly chastised by another customer. This fellow, himself a seller on Amazon, argued that he had both given and gotten free items in exchange for reviews. “It is not a scam but an incentive,” he wrote.Under F.T.C. rules, when there is a connection between a merchant and someone promoting its product that affects the endorsement’s credibility, it must be fully disclosed. In one case, Legacy Learning Systems, which sells instructional tapes, paid $250,000 last March to settle charges that it had hired affiliates to recommend the videos on Web sites.Amazon, sent a copy of the VIP letter by , said its guidelines prohibited compensation for customer reviews. A few days later, it deleted all the reviews for the case, which itself was listed as unavailable. Then it took down the product page itself.Asked why Amazon did not seem to notice that at least a few consumers called into question the VIP deal on its own site, a spokeswoman declined to comment. Nor would she say exactly what happened to VIP’s other products, like the Vipertek VTS-880 mini stun gun, which also disappeared from the retailer.The gun, like the Kindle case, received nearly all five-star reviews. “I bought one for my wife and decided to let her try it on me,” one man wrote in a typical display of the sort of effusiveness that VIP inspired. “We gave it a full charge and let me just say WOW! Boy do I regret that decision.”1191 2012-01-27 Gay-rights advocates say they have almost twice the 57,277 signatures required to put a same-sex marriage referendum on the ballot this November, which will most likely bring the issue before voters for the second time in three years. Same-sex marriage was legalized here in 2009, but voters overturned the law with a so-called people’s veto later that year. Six states and the District of Columbia allow same-sex marriage, but none have yet legalized it with a popular vote.1192 2012-01-27 Stories of bipolar disorder, like Ms. Stiehm’s, resonate with the public and the media. This year, the television series “Homeland” won a Golden Globe award for best TV drama. Two years ago, “Next to Normal,” a play about a mother with bipolar disorder, won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for Drama.Untreated, bipolar disorder can lead to wildly euphoric and manic behavior as well as depressive, suicidal phases. These behaviors not only fascinate but also repel; fear of mental illness leads to debilitating stigma for the mentally ill.As these stories demonstrate, the entertainment industry, like the media, can play an important role in increasing public awareness of mental disorders, enabling our society to better understand and diminish the stigma associated with mental illness.The writer is chairman of the department of psychiatry at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons.I was glad to read Jamie Stiehm’s article, which shines a spotlight on recovery from mental illness. Glad, that is, until nearly the end, where Ms. Stiehm calls electroconvulsive therapy “extremely effective.” In reality, E.C.T. can cause permanent amnesia and permanent deficits in cognitive abilities. The Food and Drug Administration continues to classify E.C.T. equipment in its high-risk Class III category — which comprises only 10 percent of medical devices — despite repeated pressure from E.C.T. equipment makers to reclassify it into the lower-risk Class II.1193 2012-01-27 The other cuts were spread out among the major military contractors, though some reductions would be offset by spending increases on computer security, other unmanned planes and equipment for the special forces.The plan to cut the size of the ground forces by 92,000 and eliminate older ships and planes came in response to political pressure to lower the federal budget deficit. It will eliminate most of spending increases that were above inflation, thereby limiting the Pentagon’s budget increases to approximately the rate of inflation after a big surge during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.Pentagon officials said that they had tried to limit the reductions to weapons programs and would focus on continuing efforts to modernize the armed forces. Many of the most costly and contentious programs — like the radar-evading F-22 fighter and a high-tech destroyer — had already been canceled or trimmed over the last three years, leaving few big-ticket items.Mr. Panetta said he had decided to slow the purchases of the F-35 fighters “to complete more testing and allow for developmental changes before buying significant quantities.”“We wanted to make sure before we go into full production that we are ready,” he said.The plane was originally described as an affordable and dependable design. But changes in the requirements, faulty parts and software difficulties caused several years of delay and turned the program into the Pentagon’s biggest budget-buster.Last year, Mr. Panetta’s predecessor, Robert M. Gates, threatened to cancel the Marine version of the plane, which can take off and land almost vertically, if Lockheed could not solve some of the problems. Mr. Panetta recently lifted that probation, saying the company had made substantial progress.Pentagon officials also announced that the Air Force was canceling one version of Northrop Grumman’s Global Hawk surveillance drone. It flies at 60,000 feet and was intended to replace the piloted U-2 spy plane, which gained fame for flying over the Soviet Union during the cold war.After an extensive review, the Air Force had decided last July to go ahead with the switch even though the Global Hawk’s costs had soared and Pentagon testing officials had questioned whether it was reliable.The Air Force had said then that the unmanned plane, which took photographs and was also supposed to intercept communications, would be cheaper to operate than the U-2. But Pentagon officials said Thursday that it now looked as if the costs would be higher over the next five years for the Global Hawk than the U-2.They said they still planned to build other versions of the drone that could survey large areas, though those costs could rise if fewer total planes are built.Mr. Panetta said the Navy would delay its long-range plans to build a new nuclear-powered missile submarine by two years to ease the current budget pressures and help start the program on a more solid footing.Pentagon officials have said that the new missile submarines would eventually replace the aging Ohio-class subs, which carry nuclear missiles and could cost $5 billion each. Pentagon officials said they also would delay construction of one Virginia-class attack submarine, two coastal combat ships and a large amphibious ship to reduce short-term costs.Most of the ship construction is done by General Dynamics and Huntington Ingalls Industries, which was spun off by Northrop Grumman last year. Lockheed and a unit of an Australian company build the coastal ships.Still, the Pentagon said it also planned to redesign the Virginia-class subs, which are smaller than the Ohio-class subs and protect other warships, to carry more cruise missiles and upgrade radars on both airplanes and ships. It will also design a new long-range bomber to replace the B-2.Military contractors have laid off workers and consolidated plants in recognition that the boom times were ending. But Mr. Panetta said some of the cuts would be offset by increased spending on special forces, other surveillance planes and protections against attacks by computer hackers.1194 2012-01-27 Re “How U.S. Lost Out on iPhone Work” and “In China, the Human Costs That Are Built Into an iPad” (“The iEconomy” series, front page, Jan. 22 and 26):It’s ironic and disheartening that the company that set out to change the world could accomplish the task only by employing vendors who subject workers to slave-labor wages and an Orwellian work environment.With all due respect to the late, great Steve Jobs, if the famous 1984 Super Bowl commercial for Apple were reshot, the image of Big Brother on the giant screen might fittingly be his own.In stark contrast to its counterculture origins, Apple seems to have evolved into the embodiment of everything it once despised — a greedy, callous, ruthless behemoth beholden only to fund managers who demand incremental profits every quarter at any cost.I’m grateful that American workers do not have the “flexibility” or “diligence” of those who are manufacturing our electronics overseas.Your articles and other investigations of the Foxconn plant in China where Apple products are made have noted terrible conditions there: under-age workers; a rash of suicide attempts by employees; workers stuffed into overcrowded dormitories; serious injuries and even death as a result of poor safety standards.1195 2012-01-27 In Grantham, 120 miles north of London on the route to , the debate has been less vigorous, but the poles are here, too. For every resident who spoke admiringly of the way “Mrs. T” handled the big issues — the battles with the unions, the retrenchment of the postwar welfare state, the Falklands war, the cold war confrontation with the Soviet Union — there were two or three others who disparaged her as too bossy, too uncaring toward society’s have-nots and too little interested in tending to her Grantham roots.Even in the red-brick shop on the corner where she grew up as a grocer’s daughter, the mood was dyspeptic. Only a modest plaque marks the building as “The birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, the first woman prime minister of and .”The old grocery, once a laboratory for the shopkeeper’s economics that became a hallmark of Thatcherism, now serves as the Living Health Chiropractic Clinic and Holistic Retreat, offering marine algae body wraps and hypnotherapy treatments.Few visitors seek out the site these days, said Sandra Green, a receptionist, and those who do mostly come when Mrs. Thatcher is “in the news, or not feeling well.” A therapist, Lauren Hall, 24, had her own perspective. “People who come to Grantham are more interested in ,” who attended school in the town from 1655 to 1661 and has a statue in the town’s main square, she said. In case the visitor had not grasped Newton’s place in history, she offered a prompt. “Did you know he invented the cat flap?” she said.The only hometown politician who merits a statue is Frederick James Tollemache, a 19th-century lawmaker with a minor role in promoting the settlement of . From more recent times, it is Alfred Roberts, Mrs. Thatcher’s father and a former Grantham mayor, who commands respect.The one place where a sense of pride in the town’s famous daughter was palpable was the Kesteven and Grantham Girls’ School, on a blustery height across the River Witham from the town center. There, a gold-lettered entry on the honors board shows that Margaret Roberts was head girl in 1943, the year she won a place to study chemistry at .“She was always very determined,” said Ian Todd, the assistant headmaster, who escorts visitors on tours of the school. When she wanted to take science courses not available at the Kesteven school, she arranged to go to a local boys’ school, and did her studies there, he said. “And she taught herself Latin for the Oxford entrance exams.”A group of students clustered at a table in the lobby studying for an examination in religious studies — the topic for the moment was Immanuel Kant, the 18th-century German philosopher — seemed keen to mark their distance, too. “She was the first woman prime minister, and I admire her for that,” said Grace Dawson, 18.But Emily Cheesman, 17, chimed in. “I don’t know particularly what she did,” she said. “But I know a lot of people have bad feelings towards her, because she did her thing, and a lot of people didn’t like that. And I think she might have harmed other women’s chances of becoming prime minister.”Back in the town center, there were those with firsthand memories of the Thatcher years who disagreed, some of them vigorously. “I liked her a lot,” said Michael Calladine, 42, a weather-beaten landscape gardener unloading logs at the Angel and Royal Hotel, on the site of a 13th-century inn that played host to a succession of English kings, including Richard III. “She pulled the country out of a slump,” Mr. Calladine said, “and when you look at the idiots who have run the country into the ground since her, well, what can you say?”1196 2012-01-27 Caterpillar Inc. said Thursday that its fourth-quarter profit jumped 60 percent, lifted by pent-up demand for new equipment and by continuing growth in developing countries.The performance of Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and mining equipment, is an indicator of the strength of the global economy. Along with strong fourth-quarter earnings, Caterpillar issued optimistic guidance, saying that it expects the global economy to grow faster this year and construction activity to continue to improve in most parts of the world.Net income was $1.55 billion, or $2.32 a share, compared with $968 million, or $1.47 a share, in the period a year earlier.Revenue jumped 35 percent, to $17.24 billion, as sales volume increased at all three of the company’s main businesses. Revenue from the mining equipment company Bucyrus International, which Caterpillar acquired in July, totaled $1.39 billion.Caterpillar’s results easily topped Wall Street predictions for profit of $1.76 a share and $15.95 billion in revenue, according to FactSet. That sent its shares higher. The stock rose $2.26, or 2.07 percent, to $111.31.Caterpillar, based in Peoria. Ill., said that despite the continuing downturn in the construction industry, many of its customers had to replace their aging equipment during the quarter. In addition, the company continued to get a boost from rapid economic growth in developing parts of the world.Construction sales rose 31 percent, to $5.26 billion, while resource industries sales, which include Bucyrus, jumped 80 percent, to $5.06 billion. Sales of power systems were up 22 percent, to $5.67 billion.1197 2012-01-27 Dance isn’t the most affordable art form to keep up with. Decent tickets to the ballet can range from $60 to $200. But Dance on Camera, a collaboration of the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Dance Films Association, helps keep the Miser rich in high culture, at movie theater prices.That festival presents more than just live performance on film.“The effort is to celebrate a merging of both the dance and film arts,” said Deirdre Towers, who organizes the program with Joanna Ney. “For example, the screen adaptation of ‘Coup de Grâce’ is a duet of two men in five different locations inside and outside a grand manor. So it gives you an experience that you wouldn’t have in a stage performance, nor would it happen in a Hollywood musical that the dance could stand on its own.”This year, its 40th, the program features a full spectrum of dance, from Balanchine to the New York underground movement in the 1990s.On Friday at 3:30 p.m. Bill T. Jones narrates Ron Honsa’s “Never Stand Still,” the story of how Jacob’s Pillow grew into a dance mecca in the Berkshires.The documentary “Joffrey: Mavericks of American Dance,” has its premiere this weekend. Standby tickets are available for Friday’s 8:30 p.m. showing. Saturday’s 1:30 p.m. showing includes a discussion with the dancers Trinette Singleton and Christian Holder, as well as Bob Hercules, the film’s director.1198 2012-01-27 What’s the difference between a political activist and a political hero? It’s often a matter of intention versus accident. Within the civil rights movement Rosa Parks is seen as an activist: She trained at the Highlander Folk School for social justice in Tennessee, and her refusal to give up her seat on a crowded bus was the catalyst for the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott. Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed in “The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet” as heroes who fell into history by accident.The Loving story is well known in the annals of American civil rights history. It began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings’ bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them for violating the Racial Integrity Act, which banned interracial marriage. (Or you might say it began several years earlier, when Richard Loving, a white teenager, met Mildred Jeter, a girl of African-American and American Indian descent, six years his junior.)When, at 18, Mildred became pregnant, the couple decided to marry in Washington, D.C., where interracial marriage was legal. They were arrested five weeks later when they returned to Virginia and tried to live as husband and wife, kicking off a nine-year legal odyssey.Grey Villet, a South African photographer who worked for Life magazine, entered the story in 1965 when he traveled to Virginia to photograph the family, by then living together under an unofficial amnesty with their three children. Mr. Villet shot 73 rolls of film, but Life published only 9 images. The photographer then sent 70 prints to the Lovings. The vintage prints in this show are from that collection, as well as from Mr. Villet’s estate.The images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the photo-essay format established by magazines like Life and Look. There is the whiff of Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange and other 1930s documentarians, but also of W. Eugene Smith, a revered midcentury photo essayist, and David Goldblatt, a South African chronicler of apartheid.1199 2012-01-27 The show’s chronological midportion is heavy with portrait busts, including one from 17th-century Venice of a man whose imposing face is nearly outranked by his large wig and majestic garment; a sweet portrait relief of the poet Robert Burns from 19th-century England; and “Allegory of Winter,” a bust of an old man by Pietro Baratta (Venice, 1659-1729), so weathered that its hoary surface is part and parcel of its content. Decay is more deliberately the subject of a wonderfully creepy 17th-century Italian vanitas bust in white and yellow marble of a grotesque skull outfitted with wig and armor.The works of contemporary vintage, many dated 2011, are often by artists you rarely associate with a material as refined and expensive as marble, including the Post-Minimalists Richard Long, Robert Barry and Joseph Kosuth. (So much for the dematerialization of the art object.) Mr. Long, known for works in rough-hewn stone and wood, makes a double departure — toward virginal perfection and figuration — with a row of six thick, impeccably smooth marble beams titled “Heaven (Portrait of Carl Andre).”Ai Weiwei is represented by a series of doors made of vividly grained marble that recall the Chinese tradition of displaying small slabs of marble as paintings. Tom Sachs weighs in with a marble trash can, Saint Clair Cemin with a large and beautiful sphere, ridged with spirals. Fabio Viale, an Italian artist unfamiliar to me (and likely to remain so), contributes a gimmicky sculpture of actual-size interlocked truck tires titled “Infinite.”Among the living artists here marble seems most natural to the Swiss sculptor Not Vital, who is represented by several pieces from the last two decades. Especially mysterious is a low-lying piece that resembles a small pile of melting snow but is actually a model of a very small island made entirely of marble off the coast of Patagonia. According to the gallery Mr. Vital has bought this tiny land mass and is currently carving a cavelike dwelling in it, indicated by the tiny doorway cut into one of the model’s bluffs.In the show of portrait paintings, organized by Mr. Sperone in collaboration with Marco Voena, a partner in the London gallery Robilant & Voena, consistency of material is replaced by a single motif: the individual, recorded in a flattering light for posterity’s sake. This exhibition is an excellent chaser to the historical firmness and confirmed quality of the Renaissance portrait show now on at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Things here are less distinguished, more up for grabs; you have to see for yourself. The earlier examples range through Italy, France and the Low Countries and are sometimes newly attributed, as is explained in the catalog, to which numerous scholars have contributed.Among its more ostentatious works is Nicolas de Largillière’s astoundingly realistic portrait from around 1700 of Pierre-Joseph Titon de Cogny, an opulently attired and bewigged French aristocrat. For contrast there’s the self-conscious earthiness of Luca Giordano’s “Democritus,” which depicts the ancient philosopher as a jolly bare-chested chap with scrolls and manuscripts protruding from his cloak.Besides Giordano the show has few big names and is devoted instead to excellent or at least engaging works by lesser-known figures. One of the more unusual works is a collaborative portrait of a Dutch still life painter named Coenraet Roepel from 1717 by Richard Van Bleeck; Roepel himself rendered the still life on which he is shown working so industriously that he has pushed his wig back from his flushed brow. Also intriguing are an assured self-portrait by David de Haen, a recently discovered Dutch artist who worked in Rome in the early 17th century, and a portrait of a man in black by Jacopino del Conte, a friend of Raphael’s, in which unsettling proportions — overlarge head and hands — teeter on the brink of Mannerism.One star in this obstreperous lineup is a suave, effortlessly precise portrait from 1804 by the French painter Robert Lefèvre (1755-1830), who would go on to portray Napoleon numerous times. Depicting a modestly attired man named Michael Elias Meyer, it seems capable of holding its own against nearly any portrait by Lefèvre’s better-known contemporary Jacques-Louis David, thanks to the ineffable ease displayed by artist and sitter alike.After all this the floor devoted to modern and contemporary portraits and figurative works can’t help but disappoint. There is a disconcertingly rubbery and weird Picasso rendition of Dora Maar. Mark Greenwold’s group portrait, Ahn Duong’s self-portrait and works by Llyn Foulkes and Eric Fischl also stand out, but more of an effort should have been made. Don’t take my word for it. These shows constitute a wonderful chance to surf between the past and present, testing the eye at every turn.1200 2012-01-27 The 3M Company, the maker of Post-it Notes and industrial products, reported higher fourth-quarter profit than analysts had estimated as demand increased for aerospace and auto products.Net income rose 2.8 percent to $954 million, or $1.35 a share, from $928 million, or $1.28, a year earlier, the company said Thursday in a statement. The average of 16 estimates compiled by Bloomberg was $1.31.3M benefited as American auto sales rose 10 percent last year and as aircraft makers increased production amid demand for more fuel-efficient planes. Sales for 3M’s industrial and transportation unit increased 14 percent during the quarter.The company in October had reduced its full-year profit forecast for 2011, citing slowing growth, especially in western Europe and the electronics industry. 3M today affirmed its 2012 forecast of earnings of $6.25 to $6.50 a share.3M’s quarterly sales rose 5.7 percent from a year earlier to $7.09 billion, matching analysts’ estimates. Excluding acquisitions and foreign exchange, revenue was up 3.3 percent.1201 2012-01-27 The deal ended a year of speculation about the fate of M.L.S.E., for which the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan has been the majority owner. Assuming regulators approve the deal, it will mark a turning point for an organization that has spent the last decade and a half assembling a powerful sports conglomerate.“We spent the first 15 years going from 0 to 60, and now we’re going to go from 60 to 100,” said Tom Anselmi, the chief operating officer of M.L.S.E.Rogers and Bell Canada, he said, “are the right kind of partners.”He added, “There’s some beautiful music we’re going to make here.”In a business in which media rights can generate more than ticket sales, expanding distribution of sports and entertainment via television, mobile phones, Web sites and sports bars is a natural choice. In the case of M.L.S.E., it is a necessity because its teams sell out or are near capacity every game. To boost revenue, M.L.S.E. wants to reach fans who follow its teams but cannot attend their home games, Anselmi said.“I’ve never been to the Air Canada Centre because the prices are too high and tickets are hard to get,” said Anthony Martino, who took a day off work recently so his 12-year-old daughter could see the Leafs work out at a public rink that the team helped renovate.The Maple Leafs, the most valuable team in the N.H.L., according to Forbes.com, have sold out nearly every game for decades, first at Maple Leaf Gardens and now at Air Canada Centre, where the team moved in 1999. Their ticket prices are the highest in the league, and 5,000 people are on a waiting list for season tickets.Corporate suites that cost as much as $500,000 a year are booked, and the restaurants at Air Canada Centre, where a burger can set you back $31, are packed. M.L.S.E. owns Air Canada Centre, the sixth-busiest arena in the world. The site buzzes with concerts and other events when the Leafs and the Raptors are not in action.M.L.S.E. was also a co-developer of Maple Leaf Square, a residential and commercial district next to the arena. It also plans to create a chain of Real Sports, a sports bar connected to Air Canada Centre that, with space for 1,000 customers and nearly 200 televisions, is as raucous some nights as the crowd in the arena.“There were benefits to putting a good sports bar here because we have 150 events and 2.8 million people at our doorstep,” said Bob Hunter, who runs the venues and entertainment division of M.L.S.E.For all the financial success, though, M.L.S.E.’s teams have slipped on the ice, the court and the field. The Leafs have 13 Stanley Cup banners hanging from the rafters, but their last one is from 1967, the longest title drought in the N.H.L. The team has not made the playoffs since 2004 despite having one of the highest payrolls, although this season’s team has a winning record at the All-Star break and is in ninth place — one spot away from the playoffs — in the Eastern Conference.The Raptors, who entered the N.B.A. in 1996, lack the history of the Leafs, and their success on the court has been mixed. They draw well in part because the team has a roster full of international players, a good fit for an ethnically diverse city like Toronto. But in their first 16 years, the Raptors have only five winning seasons and one division title. Since joining Major League Soccer in 2007, Toronto has sold out 74 of 77 games at its lakefront stadium near downtown, so the team has added 2,000 extra seats. But the team has never played a postseason game.Next door at Ricoh Coliseum, the Marlies of the American Hockey League draw more than 5,000 fans a game, including many who want to see future Maple Leafs for a fraction of the cost.But all the losing has again proved that money alone cannot buy championships, something that fans understand at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks and the Rangers have won few titles despite ample resources.The streaks of futility in Toronto have led to finger pointing by frustrated fans. This is particularly true of the Leafs, who have their own television network and a general manager, Brian Burke, who is perhaps more closely followed than the mayor.Many skeptics say that M.L.S.E. and its parent company are too corporate to run successful teams. Although Ontario Teachers has stakes in dozens of large companies, the Leafs made the playoffs regularly during the first 10 years after Ontario Teachers bought the team.Still, the team’s ownership has inspired one blog, Pension Plan Puppets, and books like “Leafs AbomiNation.”“It’s a question you hear all the time, whether management is to blame,” said Myles Robinson, who runs the blog Editor-in-Leaf. “But it’s also the fans’ fault for continuing to support the team.”If only, Robinson said, the Leafs were led by an owner like Ted Leonsis, who has used his wealth and enthusiasm to revive the Washington Capitals, or Mark Cuban, who has spent tens of millions of dollars on the Dallas Mavericks.Some fans seem eager for new ownership, even if it means paying more for tickets.“Rogers wants to win to sell their television programming,” said Mark Burjoski, 25, who attended a recent Leafs game with friends. “If I have to pay $250 for tickets, I wouldn’t eat for a week.”Norman O’Reilly, who teaches sports business at the University of Ottawa, used 48 variables to analyze the connection between financial success and winning among the 122 baseball, football, basketball and hockey teams in North America’s major professional leagues. He found that independent owners were more successful because they were likely to be more focused on winning and more willing to lose money.Ian Clarke, the chief financial officer at M.L.S.E., scoffed at the notion, saying salary caps prevent teams from spending unlimited sums. He added that M.L.S.E.’s many businesses had allowed it to build better training facilities and a new soccer academy and also to give back to the community by revamping city-owned rinks and courts.“We know winning is what counts,” Clarke said.1202 2012-01-27 Since then, a third man, Novak Djokovic, has taken command of the men’s game. He is the defending champion and No. 1 seed this year and will face Andy Murray in the second men’s semifinal on Friday.Djokovic’s rise to the top explains why the second-seeded Nadal and third-seeded Federer were playing in a semifinal. But this match had the buzz and shot-making quality to compare favorably with some of their better duels. Although Federer had his moments and big opportunities in the fourth set, he could not extend the festivities.With Nadal down a break point in the eighth game, Federer missed an inside-out forehand by inches that would have given him a 5-3 lead. Nadal held on for 4-4 instead and then propelled himself to a higher plane in the next game to break Federer for the sixth time in the match.The keepsake on a night full of keepsakes came on the second deuce in that pivotal game when Nadal, sprinting to his left far behind the baseline, managed to whip a forehand passing shot crosscourt for a winner.Nadal was soon serving for the match. Federer saved one match point when Nadal missed a backhand passing shot crosscourt, but Federer could not convert on either of the break points that followed. Nadal took the hint on his second match point, and Federer, attacking again, knocked a forehand long as Nadal dropped to his knees, leaned back and clenched both fists.“A fantastic victory for me,” Nadal said. “Very, very happy playing against the greatest of the history in semifinals, big match on Rod Laver. It’s one of the victories that’s going to stay in my mind forever, no? It’s a fantastic way to start the season.”Nadal and Federer might know each other’s games intimately after nearly 30 head-to-head matches, but they can still surprise each other: Federer with a backhand half-volley drop shot that transforms raw power into poetry; Nadal with an off-balance ground stroke that looks as if it is going to be defensive but ends up being all about offense.Nadal said he also attempted to surprise with his tactics Thursday by playing more to Federer’s forehand than usual after winning just three games against Federer in their most recent match, which came indoors in the round-robin phase of the ATP World Tour Finals in London in November.“In London, he played very aggressive with his backhand, so he was very inside the court,” Nadal said. “Was very difficult for me to find spaces to move him, no? Even the final of Roland Garros, the same. He played more aggressive with his backhand. On clay is different. You have more time. But today I went on court with the idea to change a little bit more the direction against him, and in my opinion it worked well.”Consider the crucial third-set tie breaker, which Nadal led by 6-1 before losing four straight points. At 6-5, in dire need of a point, he sliced a serve to Federer’s backhand. Then, with a ball in the middle of the court, most experienced observers would have prepared for him to rip the ball to Federer’s backhand, but he went to the forehand instead and was rewarded with an error and a two-sets-to-one lead.There were other key moments, including Nadal’s ability to extend the first set after Federer, a marvelous front-runner, rolled to a quick 3-0 lead. There was Nadal’s ability to shake off an early break in the second set and his ability to maintain his focus after the annual Australia Day fireworks display that interrupted the match for several minutes with Nadal leading by 5-2 in the second set. Federer, meanwhile, dropped 11 straight points after play resumed.Though the stereotype is that Federer uses his racket like a wand and Nadal uses his like a hammer, the roles often got muddled Thursday. Nadal, who has added some weight to the top of his racket this year, appears to have gotten what he felt he was missing last season: a little more punch. Despite experiencing sudden and intense knee pain on the eve of the tournament, he also appears to be covering court as voraciously as ever.Now, after two deeply impressive victories over Tomas Berdych and Federer, he is into his fourth consecutive Grand Slam final with Djokovic or Murray soon to join him in the lineup.Asked after the match if he had any counsel for Murray on Friday, Nadal answered that he should play “more aggressive than usual” against Djokovic.“That’s my advice,” Nadal said, “but my advice is probably not very well, because I lost the last six times against him.”1203 2012-01-27 Stocks fell, reversing a rally that sent the Dow Jones industrial average toward its highest level since 2008 earlier Thursday, after bank shares tumbled and a report showed that sales of new homes declined unexpectedly.Banks fell the most among 24 groups in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index because of concern about the industry’s ability to increase profits after the Federal Reserve pledged to keep the benchmark interest rate low. Wells Fargo and Fifth Third Bancorp slumped. AT&T, the phone company, slid 2.5 percent as its profit forecast trailed estimates.The S.& P. 500 lost 0.6 percent to 1,318.43. The Dow fell 22.33 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,734.63, after earlier rising to the highest level on a closing basis since May 2008. The Nasdaq composite index was down 13.03 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,805.28.“It’s a little bit of cold water in the face,” said Bruce McCain, who helps oversee more than $20 billion as chief investment strategist at the private banking unit of KeyCorp in Cleveland. “We’re in risk territory because we’ve come a long way in the market and in terms of optimism on the economy. It’s premature to think that we’ve solved all problems.”The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 17/32, to 100. The yield fell to 1.94 percent, from 2.0 percent late Wednesday.1204 2012-01-27 Then, after the travel ban on the Americans became public on Thursday, the administration made the warning public as well. “It is the prerogative of Congress to say that our future military aid is going to be conditioned on a democratic transition,” Michael H. Posner, an assistant secretary of state responsible for human rights issues, said at a previously scheduled press conference in Cairo on Thursday.Raids last month on nongovernmental organizations, along with respect for basic rights, he said, are “very much a part of that package.” He said repeatedly that the military aid was now at stake and that the treatment of the American-backed groups had set off a Congressional outcry. “Obviously any action that creates tension with our government makes the whole package more difficult.”State Department officials said that it was the first time in three decades that American military aid to Egypt was at risk. That aid, $1.3 billion a year, has always been sacrosanct as the price the United States pays to preserve Egypt’s 1979 peace treaty with . Though members of Congress have talked this year of imposing conditions on American aid to Egypt, the Obama administration had previously opposed the idea.The White House negotiated intensely to allow the president the option of waiving the conditions, if necessary, in the name of national security. Now , the secretary of state, is required to certify that Egypt is making democratic progress — carrying out “policies to protect freedom of expression, association and religion, and due process of law” — before releasing the aid this fiscal year.Representative Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, said the Egyptian government continued to flout American efforts and to undermine democratic rights. “This is out of control,” Mr. Wolf said on Thursday. “If the administration follows the law, there’s no way they can continue the aid.”The issue has already become subject of “an active debate” within the administration, one senior State Department official said. “I hesitate to say that we have clear assurances of what’s going to happen,” the official said. “I think they understand the importance we attach to this issue and the value actually for Egypt on moving ahead on these questions.”A tug of war between Washington and Cairo over American aid for Egyptian human rights and democracy-building groups goes back to the era of former President . To maintain control over organizations that might pose potential challenges to his government, Mr. Mubarak required nonprofit groups to obtain licenses, which were almost never issued.Instead, the generals have echoed the Mubarak government’s refrain that any unrest was the work of “foreign hands.” Often, the military-led government has pointed specifically at Washington, suggesting that the United States was financing Egyptian groups behind the frequent turmoil in the streets.Last spring, the military-led government initiated a formal criminal investigation into foreign financing of nonprofit groups. Then, in December, investigators accompanied by squads of heavily armed riot police officers raided as many as seven rights groups, including four backed by American government funds. The raids were heavily criticized by American officials, lawmakers and advocacy groups.Sam LaHood said in an interview that his organization had cooperated with the inquiry, which is being conducted by judges at a court in Cairo. At the request of investigators, he had already signed a statement on a copy of his passport pledging to be available for his next interrogation. He said that 17 members of the group’s staff had been interrogated and three called back for a second session.“It is not like we were ducking them,” he said.In Cairo, officials of the Justice Ministry and the public prosecutor’s office could not be reached for comment. Amr Roshdy, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry, said the travel restrictions were “a purely judicial process,” imposed at the request of the attorney general. Told that the furor over the handling of the investigations could affect American aid to Egypt, he paused and then said, “Really?”Since the fiscal year began in October, the United States has not provided any money, though portions of last year’s budget are still in the pipeline. The administration has budgeted an additional $250 million in economic assistance, but that is not subject to the certification. All aid, however, is subject to a separate requirement that Egypt abide by the peace treaty with Israel. Officials have said that the current military funds will dry up by March.The administration has welcomed many recent steps in Egypt, including the seating of a new Parliament this week after elections that were broadly viewed as free and fair, and the partial lifting of a longstanding emergency law. But the raids against the nonprofit groups have become politically explosive.In addition to Mr. LaHood, four other employees from the Republican Institute, including two Americans, had been barred from travel. Officials of the National Democratic Institute said that six of its employees had been banned, including three Americans.Lorne W. Craner, of the Republican Institute, noted that the Egyptian government had promised senior American officials that they would close the investigation and return documents, computers and cash that were seized.“Here we are all these weeks later and all these assurances later, and things are getting worse,” Mr. Craner said in Washington.Mr. LaHood said that he wondered if he might be brought up on trial. “It is ludicrous, but the whole thing is ludicrous,” he said.1205 2012-01-27 WEISSMAN--Alisha.

In folk music, we’re telling a story. The guitars would begin it, but Dick was an orchestrator, and his entry often signified a particular turning point in a song.”Richard Lawrence Kniss was born in Portland, Ore., on April 24, 1937. His father left the family when he was very young. Reared by his mother, Bernice, he was a bit of a drifter into his late teens, never graduating from high school and focusing on his future only when he found music. His first instrument was the guitar, though, as his wife tells the story, he was lousy at it.“Someone suggested he play the bass because it didn’t have so many strings,” Ms. Kniss said. “And he just became passionate about it.”He began an itinerant music career in San Francisco, then moved to Troy, N.Y., to play in the short-lived trio Dick, Dick and Nick before landing in New York City. He was playing in a band led by the clarinetist and saxophonist Woody Herman when he heard that Peter, Paul and Mary were looking for a bassist.In addition to his wife, whom he met while he was playing a gig in the Poconos — “I was a fan,” she said — and married in 1969, he is survived by their two sons, Jonathan and Peter; a son from a previous relationship, Richard Manders; two sisters, Carol Smith and Karen Stensrud; a half-brother, Lewis Johnson; and seven grandchildren.Mr. Kniss played with Denver from 1970 to 1978, was featured on many of his recordings and wrote “Sunshine on My Shoulders” with him and Mike Taylor. But he joined the band simply because he needed the work. In 1970, Denver had not yet become the clear-voiced crooner of popular, sentimental ballads like “Annie’s Song” and “Rocky Mountain High,” though he had written “Leaving on a Jet Plane,” which Peter, Paul and Mary turned into a No. 1 hit in 1969.Denver asked him to play electric bass, which he did for the only time in his career.“Back then when you flew, the bass was carried in its own seat in the plane, like a child, and John Denver couldn’t afford it,” Diane Kniss recalled. Denver asked Mr. Kniss to set the stand-up instrument aside and play the electric. “Denver said, ‘When we get some money, the first thing we’ll do is bring it back,’ ” she said. “And that’s what he did.”1215 2012-01-28 In previous cases, the Navy has at times resorted to putting captured pirates in life jackets and ferrying them in small boats into the Somali surf, where they hop out and wade to shore. (These releases have been videotaped, sailors said, as evidence that the prisoners were healthy and freed safely.)No one — except perhaps the pirates — has found that outcome satisfying, and the State Department insists that this will no longer be an acceptable resolution. Newly detained pirates, according to a senior State Department official, will face trial.The many possible permutations for prosecuting the 15 pirates now locked up in the Vinson almost perfectly capture the puzzle surrounding such cases.The pirates are Somali. They attacked the motor vessel Sunshine, which is Greek-owned but operates under a Bahaman flag. They were detained in international waters, but in the so-called exclusive economic zone of Oman. And they had commandeered an Iranian fishing vessel and held the crew hostage for more than a month.The Navy took the pirates into custody. But the former hostages returned to Iran, and the Sunshine simply steamed on, over the horizon and out of sight.So which country should take the case? And how would it hold the pirates before trial, collect evidence, and arrange for foreign witnesses and foreign investigators to testify?A few nations, including the Seychelles, have entered nonbinding memorandums of understanding that some American officials believe could clear a path for them to hear high-seas piracy cases. But the agreements have not proved robust, available prison systems can be small or strained, and the backlog of captured pirates must await venues.Discussions about where are under way with several possible countries.“We’re still searching for an appropriate venue for prosecution, but we are committed to bringing these pirates to justice,” said an assistant secretary of state, Andrew J. Shapiro. He added that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton “has made clear that she is not happy with the practice of catch and release.”The pirates’ victims have shared that sentiment. Mahmed Younes, captain of the Iranian fishing vessel, was held hostage by the 15 pirates from November to early January. He said it was the second time in recent years that he had been taken captive by Somali pirates in the North Arabian Sea.“The punishment should be for the crime,” Captain Younes said, in an interview at sea soon after being freed. “They should be taken to court and tried. At any cost they should not be let go, because if you let them go they will come back stronger and harass more people.”He added, “Every time these navies’ countries let them go, the pirates just laugh at that.”The reasons that cases languish vary from an absence of bureaucratic capacity in countries in the region affected by piracy to concerns about costs. International politics also play a role.American officials said that in pursuing prosecution for the group of 15 pirates, for example, the United States had asked several countries to consider taking the cases, but not the most obvious venue — Iran. The tensions between Washington and Tehran have precluded such dialogue.The legal questions persist even as counterpiracy measures show gains. In recent years, Somali pirates have typically held 15 or 16 vessels at a time, while negotiating ransoms for their release. Early last year they held a high of 32 vessels. But as the vessels have been ransomed, fewer have been captured.As of this month, pirates hold six ships — the lowest number in years, Admiral Fox said.The Navy credited the increased presence of ships from NATO and the European Union, as well as the actions of independent participants, including India.It also said that merchant vessels were more often sailing with armed security teams. “No vessel with an on-board security team has been hijacked,” a State Department official said.Admiral Fox and Mr. Shapiro agreed that whatever the venue for the current high-profile case, a longer-term solution was necessary.One proposal is to form a regional legal center that would be able to apply its own laws to the cases, interact with foreign navies, and have the capacity to incarcerate convicted pirates in a prison system and to return others safely to their home nations.The United States supports such a “piracy chamber,” Mr. Shapiro said.The group of 15 pirates seemed not especially worried by their capture.One, Mohammed Mahmoud, said they had developed a script for lying to naval patrols — they were simply fishermen searching for lost, drifting nets — and that if they were detained they expected to be treated well.He seemed to think that if he were patient, the Navy would play by rules that were not especially menacing.“The Navy has a system,” Mr. Mahmoud said while aboard the Iranian fishing boat, waiting to be transferred to the first American warship. “They do not shoot everything. Everything is balanced, very balanced.”An American Navy officer also said that after the pirates had been read their rights, in case any of them ended up in American courts, many had become uncooperative with investigators, apparently expecting that with time they would be let go.Rear Adm. Kaleem Shaukat, the Pakistani commanding Combined Task Force 151, the region’s multinational counterpiracy command, said that without a legal system to match the navies’ tactical progress, piracy, and uncertainties about what to do with Somali prisoners on the high seas, would persist.“If there is no effective legislation that makes sure these pirates are taken to a court of law and punished, if that does not occur, they will come back again and hijack other ships,” he said. “That is still a weak area.”1216 2012-01-28 Chevron’s fourth-quarter profit declined to $5.1 billion, or $2.58 a share, from $5.3 billion, or $2.64, a year earlier. Its earnings per share were 32 cents below the average of five analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales rose 11 percent to nearly $60 billion during the quarter. Chevron’s American refineries lost an average $2.2 million a day during the final three months of 2011 as crude-processing margins shrank and maintenance work at a California plant curbed fuel output, the company said in a statement. Chevron added the equivalent of 1.67 billion barrels in reserves last year, enough to replace 171 percent of the oil and gas the company pumped last year.1217 2012-01-28 European leaders continued to pressure Greece and address the debt crisis, Apple released blockbuster earnings lifted by the iPhone 4S, global financial leaders met in Davos and the American economy was seen as gaining strength....1218 2012-01-28 From Florida to the Midwest to the Southwest and the Pacific Coast, Democrats are urging voters to oust Republicans who supported the Ryan proposal, which they say would gut the guarantee of health benefits for older Americans.Representative Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said Medicare would be “a defining issue in the 2012 elections.”Mr. Israel said he was advising Democratic candidates to “make sure that at every opportunity you mention the following three issues in alphabetical order and in order of priority: Medicare, 1; Medicare, 2; and Medicare, 3.”In automated telephone calls and radio advertisements, the Democratic Party is accusing Republican lawmakers of favoring “millionaires over Medicare.”For their part, Mr. Ryan, the Wisconsin lawmaker who is chairman of the budget committee, and other House Republicans describe their proposal as a bold step to tame a program whose unsustainable growth is contributing to the deficit.That plan was never enacted; the Senate rejected it.But in an interview, Mr. Ryan said that Republicans would try to push a similar budget plan through the House this spring. Asked if it would include similar changes in Medicare, Mr. Ryan said, “Yes, absolutely.”“Not one member thinks we should backtrack on these ideas,” Mr. Ryan said after listening to his colleagues at the annual retreat of House Republicans in Baltimore last week.Democrats see the Ryan plan as a political gift. They relish the opportunity to bash it again on the House floor and at campaign events.In the 13th District of Florida, which includes Sarasota, Keith Fitzgerald, a Democrat, said Medicare would be “a major theme” of his campaign against Representative Vern Buchanan, a three-term Republican. The 2010 census found that this district had a larger proportion of residents 65 and older than any other district in the country.“People here, including many rock-ribbed Republicans, get Medicare,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “They understand Medicare. They see the benefit. For them, it’s tangible, it’s real, it works.”By voting for the Republican budget plan, Mr. Fitzgerald said, Mr. Buchanan was “marching in lockstep with his party” and against the interests of constituents.The Congressional Budget Office said that the Republican budget plan could eventually require new beneficiaries to spend about $6,000 a year more for health care, on average, than they would spend under current law.Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential contender, described Mr. Ryan’s Medicare plan this month as “absolutely right on.” By giving people a choice of competing health plans, he said, it could help hold down Medicare costs. Other Republican presidential candidates have also spoken favorably of Mr. Ryan’s approach.House Republicans are ready for the attacks, and they say they will respond by repeating criticism of President Obama’s health care overhaul.“If House Democrats want to engage in debate about Medicare, we are happy to remind them about $500 billion in Medicare cuts they made to pay for their government takeover of health care,” said Paul A. Lindsay, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which seeks to increase the House Republican majority.Mr. Buchanan did not sound worried about use of the Medicare issue against him. “I have not seen that much of it yet in my district,” he said.In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Gary McDowell, a Democrat, is using Medicare against Representative Dan Benishek, a freshman Republican, in a rematch of their 2010 race.“Benishek’s vote for the Ryan budget will play big here,” Mr. McDowell said, noting that the district had a larger proportion of residents 65 and older than any other district outside Florida.Kyle Bonini, a spokesman for Mr. Benishek, said the congressman understood “Medicare’s importance to Michigan seniors” because he had been a surgeon for 25 years.“Dr. Benishek is committed to keeping his promise of not cutting benefits for existing retirees or those near retirement,” Mr. Bonini said.Representative Kathy Hochul, a Democrat from the Buffalo area, showed the power of the Medicare issue last May when she won a special election in one of New York’s more conservative Congressional districts. The race turned largely on Republican plans to overhaul Medicare. Voters said they trusted Ms. Hochul to protect the program.Republicans say they learned a lesson from that race: They cannot avoid the Medicare issue and should fight back when it is raised. Democrats were unable to duplicate their feat in Nevada, where the Republican candidate routed the Democrat last September in a special election for an open seat in the United States House of Representatives.House Republicans continue to seek Medicare savings as part of any bill to extend the Social Security payroll tax cut for the rest of this year.Republicans point to several factors that could complicate Democrats’ efforts to exploit the issue. In trying to negotiate a comprehensive deficit-reduction agreement with Congressional Republicans, Mr. Obama proposed major cuts in the growth of Medicare spending and indicated that he was willing to consider other changes, like a gradual increase in the age of eligibility, as part of a “grand bargain.”Moreover, Mr. Ryan has altered features of his Medicare plan that provoked criticism. The latest version of his proposal, worked out with Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would keep traditional Medicare as an option, alongside private plans. It would also allow larger annual increases in the federal contribution to the cost of private plans, reducing the burden that might otherwise fall on beneficiaries.Democrats say these changes are somewhat technical and do not diminish Medicare’s value as a campaign issue.The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said the Wyden-Ryan proposal “would end Medicare as we know it for millions of seniors.”“The Wyden-Ryan proposal could, over time, cause the traditional Medicare program to wither on the vine because it would raise premiums, forcing many seniors to leave traditional Medicare and join private plans,” Mr. Carney said. “And it would shift costs from the government to seniors.”1219 2012-01-28 “If your heart is in the right place, everything else will fall into place,” said the Rinpoche, who raised more than $3 million to build the vermilion-painted building topped by shimmering gold roofs. The main building, which dominates a breathtakingly picturesque valley, also houses an ornate temple filled with colorful Buddhas and altars illuminated by butter lamps. The school is so far off the grid that it must rely on solar power.The Rinpoche, who has achieved the status of a “living Buddha,” says the idea for the center came to him in a vision one morning six years ago. Dismayed by the growing number of Tibetans unable to decipher the written form of their mother tongue, he dreamed of a sanctuary where young Tibetans left behind by China’s progress could study their culture and pass it on to the next generation.“Monasteries just teach monks about Buddhism, but they don’t teach the full range of how to be a Tibetan,” he said. “From a cultural point of view, it’s an emergency.”This frustration over a struggling culture, shared by a great many Tibetans, has fueled the ethnic unrest that has roiled Tibetan areas of China in recent years. Part of the anger stems from the influx of Han Chinese migrants to the region and other policies, including a renewed emphasis on Mandarin instruction, that some feel is undermining an ancient way of life. Last year, thousands of middle and high school students in Qinghai took to the streets in protest over proposals to eliminate academic instruction in Tibetan.The deadliest outburst occurred in 2008 in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, where rioting and the crackdown that followed killed at least 20 people. In recent months, the protests against Chinese governance have taken the form of self-immolations that have left 15 Tibetans dead or gravely hurt.Rather than be deterred by the tense relationship between the Communist Party and Tibetan people, the Rinpoche spent years cultivating “guanxi,” or personal relationships, with Qinghai officials. Through those efforts he methodically obtained approvals from numerous government departments. The government, he says, hopes the center, which he says will eventually house 600 students, will attract tourism and raise local living standards. To raise money, the Rinpoche traveled across China seeking donations, and received them largely from Han Chinese, who make up 80 percent of his 1,000 contributors. “Han people give me money for the same reason Tibetans donate: they want to do good,” he said.Many donors — most of them newly affluent Han — say they view Tibetan Buddhism as an antidote to the materialism and greed that have flourished alongside China’s breakneck development.Zhu Chuanhong, 35, a banker in the southern city of Guangzhou, says she was deeply inspired after meeting the Rinpoche at a dinner party there last year. “I was so moved by his love, mercy, devotion, selflessness and determination,” she said in a telephone interview. Soon afterward she traveled to the center and handed over more than $15,000 for a well and a passenger van. Friends of hers contributed money for the center’s cafeteria and religious statuary. “That money can buy a lot more, do a lot more and mean a lot more in Qinghai than in Guangzhou,” she said.In addition to his fund-raising quest, the Rinpoche traveled to poor villages and orphanages across Qinghai in search of those young people most in need of an education. While room and board for each student costs only $2.50 a day, teaching is more expensive. He said it cost $1,000 a month to employ an artisan from Tibet to teach the students how to paint thangkas, the intricately vibrant scrolls that depict Buddhist religious scenes.The Rinpoche hopes to enroll girls too, but given religious norms that forbid monks from mixing with women, that means building another dorm and a suite of classrooms.Those who now call the center home have seen their world profoundly altered. Some, like Tuzansanzhi, 19, a shy youth dressed in monks’ robes who, like many Tibetans, uses a single name, had never been to school before. “I’m an only child, and my parents needed me to care for our sheep,” he said in Tibetan, the only language he knows. Before he arrived in July, Tuzansanzhi was illiterate. Now, he sits at a desk writing a Tibetan script that is crisply uniform.For Tuzansanzhi and his classmates, academic instruction may be hard, but it beats their old lives. Wearing a blue track suit and brushing long black hair from his eyes, another boy, Jiuxuejop, 18, said the school had saved him from a bleak future. “I don’t want to be a herder,” he said. “I did it for over 10 years, it’s exhausting. Better to be a teacher and keep Tibetan culture alive.”1220 2012-01-28 THE Mississippi River Delta loses the equivalent of a football field of marshland every hour as it melts into the Gulf of Mexico. Over the last 75 years, we’ve lost the equivalent of the state of Delaware to erosion.We have a chance to stop this disaster and protect the delta, where much of the nation’s seafood is spawned. But for this to happen, Congress must turn over billions in penalties, expected from the BP oil spill, to the Gulf of Mexico states for the restoration of the delta’s wetlands.Since the 19th century, the Army Corps of Engineers has channelized the Mississippi River to improve navigation while avoiding the expense of dredging. But the levees built for that goal deprived the marsh of the alluvial silt that nurtured it over millenniums. After the epic 1927 flood, the corps raised the levees higher still. Starved of silt, the marshes are now subsiding into the gulf.On top of that, sulfur, natural gas and oil production companies have, since the 1930s, dug close to 10,000 miles of canals into the delta, gaining direct routes to their mineral wealth. These canals brought saltwater deep into the wetlands, killing marsh grasses and encouraging tidal and wave action that eroded banks. Like the pelican, our state bird that, legend has it, feeds its young with its own blood, the Mississippi River Delta has sacrificed itself for the good of the nation. But the nation has not repaid in kind.Disaster and rebirth is an old story around here. My family has lived that cycle for generations. After the hurricane of 1915, the family spent three weeks on the levee, the only high ground, their cattle and rice, ready to harvest, washed away. Life was hard. But it was also the land of plenty. In deltaic mud 200 feet deep, they farmed rice, indigo and oranges. They hunted and fished. In the Depression, according to my mother, who would later found Ruth’s Chris Steak House, “We never knew we were poor. There was always plenty of food for the taking.”1221 2012-01-28 As a student and sports fan at the University of Wisconsin, I have seen a number of my fellow students fall prey to the same conflicts between academics and athletics that Laura Pappano mentions in “How Big-Time Sports Ate College Life” (Education Life, Jan. 22).Many a semester has been ruined by football season tickets selling out. Statistics showing academic performance diminishing as teams perform well seem accurate, but perhaps teams performing poorly has the same effect. Losing the Rose Bowl two years in a row did not encourage the study habits of any student I know.Ultimately, however, it is up to the student to decide what role a university’s sports teams take on during their college years: Did I come to school to learn or did I come to school to become a fan?1222 2012-01-28 The group, known as the Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Working Group, is part of the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, an interagency outfit created by Mr. Obama in 2009 to prosecute financial crimes.Despite three years of work by that task force, however, public sentiment still holds that few if any of the real perpetrators of the housing bubble and financial crisis have been held accountable.Eric Schneiderman, the New York attorney general, who is a co-chairman of the working group, said that having many different law enforcement groups working together “enables us to go places where each of us individually could not go.” For example, he said, “having the I.R.S. on the team opens up the possibility of looking into tax issues that hadn’t existed before.”In addition, the New York State Martin Act, which gives the attorney general broad powers to elicit information during investigations, “is more flexible than federal securities laws,” Mr. Schneiderman said. The New York and Delaware attorneys general also have jurisdiction over the trusts that hold the mortgages that underlie the mortgage-backed securities, making them “the bricks and mortar of this entire structure.”By coordinating their efforts, group members might be able to share documents and information that usually would be in individual agency silos, Mr. Holder said.Although some prohibitions exist on sharing federal grand jury information, he added, “there are ways in which we can structure these investigations so that I don’t think grand jury prohibitions on the federal side will prevent us from sharing necessary information with our state partners.”Shaun Donovan, the secretary of housing and urban development, whose agency is also part of the antifraud group, said its priorities also would include getting some financial relief to homeowners whose investments had been hurt by manipulations in the market for mortgage-backed securities.A “fundamental principle” of the effort, Mr. Donovan said, is that “there is relief also for those homeowners” whose loans underlie the mortgage-backed securities. “It would be a tragedy,” he added, “if investors were made whole but homeowners who were wronged as well” continued to suffer.Mr. Donovan said that a separate settlement being worked out between state attorneys general and mortgage servicing companies would not thwart the new group’s investigations, even if the settlement released companies from further law enforcement efforts related to mortgage servicing.“We would not be standing here today if we were not absolutely confident,” Mr. Donovan said, adding that any releases being contemplated “are narrow enough to allow us to go forward aggressively.”1223 2012-01-28 “Just like a presidential election, you’ve got the swing voters as your deciders,” said Steve Lombardo, the chief executive of the Edelman unit that conducted the surveys. Independents are more closely divided, but more of them think increased regulation is needed than believe there is too much regulation.In only three of the 25 countries — Sweden, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates — are as many as a third of respondents happy with the level of regulation.Historically, the clamor for more regulation often comes after economic problems that perhaps could have been prevented. That has often made even pro-business politicians more open to imposing new rules. That seems to be happening in Britain, where the government, led by the Conservative Party, is pushing for more regulation of banks and has been critical of high bonuses for bankers. The poll indicates that nearly half of British respondents think there is too little regulation, while fewer than a fifth think there is too much.In some countries, demands for more regulation may actually be calls for more effective regulation. “Italy is one of the most heavily bureaucratic countries in the world,” Mr. Lombardo said. “They have rules. They just don’t follow them.” In Italy, 56 percent of the respondents called for more regulation. Among the members of the European Union that were surveyed, the figures were higher only in Spain and Ireland, both countries that have experienced sharp recessions that some say were brought on by ineffective bank regulation.Germany, currently the most successful economy in Europe, ranks second to the United States in the proportion of people who think there is too much regulation, with 28 percent. But that is well below the 44 percent figure for those who want more regulation.While the Chinese economy has done well, it and Hong Kong, which was treated separately in the survey, are the countries where respondents were least likely to think there was too much regulation, and among the most likely to think more rules were needed.1224 2012-01-28 “You have very little information to go on and it’s very easy to aim too high or even worse, too low,” Mr. Stoner said in an e-mail. “You really don’t want someone to say, ‘Wow, that’s a bargain,’ which basically translates as ‘We would have been happy to pay much more than that!’ ”But how do you find out? Consult with others in the field. Especially if you are just starting, many professionals will be eager to help. Roy Cohen, a career counselor who has provided outplacement services to Goldman Sachs employees, said that when he first started, his competitors were not threatened. “They didn’t consider me competition,” he said, “and therefore shared information.”Surveying friends or colleagues who have hired consultants in your area is a “very efficient way to determine a fee structure,” said Mr. Cohen, who wrote “The Wall Street Professional’s Survival Guide” (Financial Times Press, 2010).Professional organizations are another great way to find out information. I belong to the American Society of Journalists and Authors. In one section of the group’s Web site, members can anonymously report what they were paid for jobs.Colleen Plimpton, a garden consultant for the last three years, said she joined the Garden Writers Association to learn about prevailing wages.“There is a lot of free information available, but with many sites it’s not easy to find, so you have to hone your research skills,” said Leanne Hoagland-Smith, whose company, Advanced Systems, offers executive coaching focusing on small businesses. She found that the American Society for Training and Development and SherpaCoaching were valuable resources.But money is only one part of the negotiation, and it’s crucial to know what all your objectives are before talking to a client.What does the contract say? If you’re a writer or graphic artist or logo designer, say, will you own the rights or will someone else? For how long? Will the work appear under your name or someone else’s? Is the client well known and possibly helpful to your career? If so, are you willing to take less for the long-term benefits that may offer?Sometimes, especially when starting, underpricing yourself is a good strategy.My sister, who was a marketing consultant, then took time off, is just returning to the job market. When bidding on her first job recently, she deliberately lowballed her work.“I wanted to get some practice and get my confidence up,” she said.It’s also important to realize that you have to constantly revise and change as a business develops. Kate M. Gilbert, a Web developer in Massachusetts, said, for instance, that she started out charging hourly rates when working by herself.But when she teamed up with a friend who is a Web designer and started a business, Wide Open Sites, last year, “we had dozens of different clients and we were constantly asking each other, ‘What’s the rate for this one?’ It made it difficult when dividing up the payments.”So they decided to set a flat rate based on an hourly fee, which they do not disclose to customers, because they want clients to focus on the project, not on the time it will take.“Back in 2005, when I started as an independent contractor, I charged about $30 an hour,” Ms. Gilbert said. She started hearing from potential clients that her fees were lower than average, “so we kept pushing the envelope.” Now they charge $80 to $140 an hour.Asking for more money, especially from customers you’ve worked with before, isn’t easy for most people. One option is to state that your own costs have risen and, therefore, you need to pass them on.You can “take the coward’s strategy and say, ‘I intend to accept this assignment and I’m very excited, but I wonder if there’s any wiggle room with the fee,’ ” Mr. Cohen said.If money isn’t available, there may be other ways to parlay the customer’s resources to your advantage. Mr. Stoner, the magician, offered an example. “I might say, ‘O.K., instead of 300, how about if I do it for 200 but you give me a link on your Web site and let me take a few pictures for my business blog?’ ”Most important, don’t feel intimidated and underestimate your own worth. You’re not asking for a favor but engaging in a business transaction. It can be easy to lose sight of that.“You need to point out what additional value you offer,” Ms. Hoagland-Smith said. “It’s not just price point. If that was the case, we’d all be driving Yugos and eating at McDonald’s.”And, of course, what you ask for will depend on where you live.“I can’t charge in the Midwest what some of my colleagues can charge on the East Coast,” she added.While difficult, negotiating the fee is only the beginning. Ms. Gilbert says that as issues arise with clients, she is constantly adding clauses to her contracts.She has put in stipulations, for example, about how much it will cost if a customer decides to make changes after approving the design. Or if a customer delays and forces the project to run longer than the anticipated timeline.Also, charging a certain amount and getting paid can be very different things.“Make sure to invoice early and follow up gently,” Mr. Cohen said. Here’s one way: “I’m checking my unpaid invoices and noticed that I have not yet received payment from you. Please check your records and let’s discuss. I’ll take the liberty to follow up with you immediately.”At worst, there’s always small claims court, but few people want to put out that kind of time and energy. Another option is simply to walk away and, of course, never deal with that client again.Working for yourself can be wonderful and incredibly difficult at the same time, say those who have taken the plunge.“I love what I do, but this has been the most challenging year of my life,” Ms. Gilbert said. “I just want people to pay me for the work I do.”1225 2012-01-28 HONG KONG — The police in the western Chinese province of Sichuan fired on Tibetan protesters for the third time this week, killing at least one and injuring several, overseas Tibetan activist groups said on Friday.The shootings, which appear to be the worst outbreak of violence in the heavily Tibetan-populated region of Sichuan in nearly four years, came as the Chinese authorities tightened security in the region as well as in neighboring Tibet to suppress any further unrest.Foreign journalists in Sichuan who tried to drive to the affected region were turned back at security checkpoints that had been erected more than 60 miles from where the shootings took place. One overseas activist group, Free Tibet, said its informants in Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, had reported a heavy increase in Chinese security forces there as well.The latest shooting episode occurred on Thursday when the police detained a young man for putting up posters that described a series of recent self-immolations as acts aimed at winning freedom for Tibetans, according to Free Tibet, which is based in London, and another activist group, the International Campaign for Tibet, based in Washington. A crowd formed and tried to prevent the officers from taking him away, and the police responded by opening fire, both groups said.The shooting took place in a village in Rangtang County, known in Tibetan as Dzamtang. It is in Aba Prefecture, which was also the site of the first episode this year in which activists said the police had opened fire on Tibetan protesters. Initial reports suggested that one person may have died during that shooting, on Jan. 14, but overseas activist groups have struggled to confirm that.1226 2012-01-28 In a unanimous vote on Friday, the California Air Resources Board, known as CARB, affirmed a major expansion of its Advanced Clean Car rules.

Now the physician performing the abortion — not an ultrasound technician, for example, or a secondary doctor — must conduct the sonogram on a separate day, a scheduling struggle when doctors providing elective abortions are in short supply and rotate between clinics.“They’ve had to set aside a whole other day doing ultrasounds, visits that in most parts of medicine would be dedicated to people with less training than a physician,” Ms. Hagstrom Miller said. “The effect on their travel schedule, on their reimbursement, on patients’ access to them has been tremendous.”For the patients, the process of obtaining an abortion has lengthened. Instead of having a sonogram and receiving an abortion in a single day, they must spread out their visits, often taking a second or third day off of work, paying double for transportation and child care, and delaying the procedure. Ms. Hagstrom Miller said that on a recent weekend, a family played soccer all day in a nearby field while their mother waited to have an abortion.And at the intersection of the abortion provider and the patient is conflict: women blame clinics, not the Legislature, for the multiday inconvenience.“We’re asked, ‘Why are you doing this to me? Why are you making me wait? I have to go to work; I could lose my job,’ ” said Dorothy Reno, director of clinics for Planned Parenthood of the Texas Capital Region.Supporters of the sonogram law say that these complaints are the bare minimum that should be required before pregnant women make a life-changing decision. They say abortion providers are the ones disrespecting their patients by rushing them through a difficult process.“This paternalistic attitude, that we’re saddling women with too much information, really does an injustice,” said Elizabeth Graham, director of Texas Right to Life. “It underestimates the capability of women to make a decision with more information, not less.”Ms. Graham also said she cannot be sure that Texas abortion providers are actually abiding by the new sonogram rules, because there has been no evidence of enforcement so far.But abortion providers say that in Texas, where they face tougher restrictions seemingly every time lawmakers convene in Austin, they cannot afford not to play by the rules.At both Planned Parenthood clinics and independent clinics, directors say they immediately notified their doctors on Jan. 10, when they learned that a federal court had ordered Texas to enforce the provision requiring pregnant women to hear the heartbeat and view the sonogram, or else listen to a verbal description of the fetus. They did it despite the fact that they had received no memos, no phone calls, no directions from the Texas Department of State Health Services, Ms. Hagstrom Miller said. (The department said it expects to release guidelines soon.)“There’s a lot of confusion about what we’re required to do and whether we’ll be held accountable for it, whether it’s part of the inspection, if we’ll be punished, if doctors will face sanctions,” she said.If the goal is for women to rethink having an abortion, providers argue, it is not working. Clinic directors said they have not had a single woman change her mind in the 24-hour period between her sonogram and her abortion. Abortion opponents and advocates for crisis pregnancy centers say that anecdotally, they have not heard of any either.“Women say, ‘What do I have to do?’ ” Ms. Hagstrom Miller said. “Do I have to come in two days, three days? What video do I have to watch? What do I have to listen to?”But Ms. DeVillez said her Austin crisis pregnancy center provides sonograms, too, and that with the right support, seeing that image can be a magical, life-changing moment for scared women.“Before, it might have been, ‘We can’t do this. We can’t take care of it,’ ” she said. “After, it becomes ‘This is our baby. This is our family.’ ”1237 2012-01-29 Previously inaccessible, shale gas has been unlocked in recent years by advances in a drilling technology known as hydraulic fracturing, or hydrofracking. These advances have prompted a drilling frenzy in states like Louisiana, Pennsylvania and Texas, which has helped create tens of thousands of jobs, lowered energy prices for consumers and offered the promise of lessening American dependence on foreign energy.Despite the lower estimates, the agency’s report noted that shale gas would continue to have a growing impact on the broader energy market. The share of natural gas produced by drilling in shale formations is projected to more than double, from 23 percent in 2010 to 49 percent in 2035, the report said. The United States will also become a net exporter of liquefied natural gas by 2016, while natural gas prices are expected to remain low for more than a decade, according to the report.Energy companies are also likely to be undaunted by the new lower estimates because they are confident that whatever the total amount of available gas, technology will improve over time so that they can access the gas more efficiently and profitably. This assumption depends on the price of gas rising soon from the rock-bottom levels where it has lingered since late 2008.In his State of the Union address last week, President Obama said the United States had a nearly 100-year supply of natural gas.That prediction includes gas from shale wells, offshore wells and Alaska’s North Slope. But many energy experts question these types of projections because they include substantial amounts of natural gas that many scientists and engineers say may never be tapped.Drilling proponents, including investors and many politicians, tend to embrace optimistic projections, even though estimating resources is an inexact science.Some of the earliest and most optimistic estimates of gas resources have come from academia. In 2009, Terry Engelder, a geosciences professor at Pennsylvania State University, helped accelerate the rush to drill for natural gas in Pennsylvania and surrounding states by projecting that more than 500 trillion cubic feet of natural gas could be produced from the Marcellus.This estimate is more than three times as high as the estimate for the Marcellus region from Energy Information Administration, and it is higher than what federal energy officials now say can be found in the entire country.Mr. Engelder said last week that he stood by his estimates, citing assumptions that he believed remained reasonable, and he questioned whether federal officials were being too conservative.“I don’t know what E.I.A. did other than cave into peer pressure from the U.S.G.S.,” he said, referring to the United States Geological Survey, which released its new estimates in August.Energy companies, which use different formulas for calculating their numbers, tend to present even higher estimates.For example, more than three dozen companies have leased land in the Marcellus region, and each company provides its own estimates to investors for how much gas it believes can be found under the acreage they possess. The combined resource estimates of just two of those companies, Range Resources and Chesapeake Energy, whose acreage holdings represent a small fraction of the Marcellus shale, is roughly equal to the amount federal energy officials now say can be found in the entire region.Many experts note that it is hard to predict how difficult or easy it will be to extract gas in different parts of the country because the geology varies drastically.Since the hydrofracking boom is fairly recent, there is also a shortage of data to indicate how much gas wells will produce over the long term.In private discussions, some federal energy officials have raised questions about the way oil and gas companies may be inflating estimates of the amount of recoverable gas.“The variability of shale gas well performance is crucial to any assessment of the resource potential of a shale play,” Philip Budzik, an Energy Information Administration research analyst, wrote in an e-mail to an industry analyst last April.The e-mail was released this month in response to open-records requests, and it echoes comments made previously in other publicly released e-mails.“Companies highlight their highly productive and profitable wells,” Mr. Budzik wrote, “while ignoring their ‘dogs,’ thereby giving the public the impression that every well is a ‘gold mine.’ ” The information administration declined to comment about the e-mail.Last summer, the New York attorney general and the Securities and Exchange Commission sent subpoenas to several companies to see whether they were accurately portraying the amount of recoverable gas to investors. The offices declined to comment about the subpoenas.1238 2012-01-29 In November, a federal advisory board recommended that two scientific papers describing research that created strains of bird flu potentially transmissible in humans should be published only if key details are omitted. The fear is that terrorists or hostile nations could learn how to cause a pandemic. This week we will finally find out how the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity reached its conclusion.Advocates of the research have protested that public health will suffer if a wide range of scientists are unable to fully study how the avian virus might be altered or develop the capacity to spread easily among humans. Opponents believe the experiments should never have been done without more rigorous analysis of the risks; some want the most lethal of the new viruses destroyedIt’s not clear why the National Institutes of Health, which financed the research and coordinates the board, decided not to release the statement in December, when it was approved by all 23 voting board members. The board sent the statement to the two journals — Science and Nature — that plan to publish the papers, but board members feared it could languish for months. Now, we are told, the journals plan to release the statement on Feb. 1.The document is unlikely to settle the argument. It deals only with the threat posed by publishing details of the research, not with the even greater risk should the virus escape or be stolen from the laboratory. Even so, it should be made public now, while scientists and health officials are planning forums to debate the pros and cons of such research and whether similar work should proceed in the future.We believe in robust research and almost always oppose censorship. But in this case the risks — of doing the work and publishing the results — far outweigh the benefits. Scientists and the public need to see how many eminent experts are less worried about censorship than about evildoers using the information to wreak havoc.1239 2012-01-29 When the last American troops came home from Iraq in December, thousands of Iraqis who had worked with the Americans were left behind. Many have already been targeted by militants, and some had taken refuge on American military bases. But once the bases were closed — or handed over to the Iraqi government — those Iraqis were forced into hiding. Unless Washington lives up to its moral obligation, many more will suffer or be killed.The Special Immigrant Visa program was enacted by Congress in 2007 for Iraqis who helped the military, other parts of the American government and military contractors. It authorized 5,000 special visas annually — but only 3,317 were granted through 2011. Iraqis who aided American non-governmental organizations and media outlets can apply under the refugee program and are also having a hard time. But the special visa program has the worst delays.Because of security vetting, processing has always been slow. The programs came to a near halt last year when two Iraqis living in Kentucky were charged with providing arms and money to Al Qaeda. The Obama administration then imposed additional security checks on all applicants. Approval in the Special Immigrant Visa program is now taking at least a year.The American government never kept track of how many Iraqis it employed, so no one knows how many thousands of Iraqis are potentially eligible for admission. It is unclear exactly how many thousands of those Iraqis have visa applications pending. The administration refused to disclose a number last week.Last July, the Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center, a nonprofit, put the estimate at 62,000 Iraqis, including 29,000 who worked for the Americans, plus their family members. The group now says it has been told that 19,000 cases were dropped from the process, perhaps because people went into hiding, or they were just lost track of. The Philadelphia Inquirer recently used a figure of 15,000 Special Immigrant Visa applicants.The United States has a responsibility to rigorously screen visa applicants and ensure they pose no threat to this country. The process needs to be transparent and accountable — and it needs to work expeditiously.1240 2012-01-29 Today, 18 judicial nominees wait for Senate votes even though they were approved by the Judiciary Committee, 16 unanimously. It can take a year for a nominee to receive a vote, an extraordinary hardship — since many cannot work while they wait — that threatens to reduce the pool of highly qualified candidates.There are many examples. , a liberal law professor nominated last year to an appellate bench, was filibustered even though he was entirely in the legal mainstream, supported by conservatives including Kenneth Starr and . His offense: He once dared to criticize Justice as being too conservative.Democrats used the filibuster to impose a two-year delay on President ’s appointment of Jeffrey Sutton, a highly credentialed candidate, for a federal judgeship because of his doubts about Congress’s power to enact legislation protecting workers and consumers.It is not just judicial appointments that are frozen. When Congress created a vitally needed as part of the financial reform law, Republicans in the Senate decided to block confirmation of a chief so the agency could not exercise its full regulatory powers.This was not a matter of rejecting one choice for substantive reasons and asking for another. Republicans first told Mr. Obama that they would not confirm any head of the bureau unless he first agreed to gut its powers. Mr. Obama dropped his original choice, the highly qualified , before she was named. Senate Republicans then blocked the confirmation vote for , a strong pro-consumer leader and the bureau’s chief of enforcement. Mr. Obama gave Mr. Cordray a , which means he will be able to serve only until the end of 2013.Senators also use filibusters to block nonpolitical positions, like the administrator of the — to demand passage of a pet project, out of pique or, most troubling, as part of the Republicans’ electoral strategy to block anything Mr. Obama wants.There was an attempt to deal with this seven years ago. A bipartisan group of 14 senators agreed to prevent judicial filibusters except under “extraordinary” circumstances after Republicans threatened to do away with the filibuster rule they now abuse so routinely. The center did not hold, and the agreement fell apart.Under Mr. Obama’s proposal, during the 90-day period, hearings can be held, research conducted, objections raised, thunderous speeches given. But in the end, the senators will have to vote directly on the nominee, not hide behind the filibuster. This will require making confirmation hearings substantive events, not the Kabuki theater they are now.We know it is risky. But the nation votes for a president, who needs to be able to appoint top officials and judges. The Senate needs to decide whether to give its consent or not. We can only hope that the president and the Senate will do that job responsibly, especially when both are controlled by the same party. Voters could then watch and reach their own judgments. And with fewer vacancies, government and the judiciary could do the nation’s work.1241 2012-01-29 Twenty-six years after Hudson’s death from AIDS and more than four decades after “Hollywood Babylon” was first published, it will come as a surprise to no one that the images the movie factories created for stars of the 1940s, ’50s and ’60s — when Mr. Bowers was most active — were just that: images. The people who fed the world strait-laced cinema like “The Philadelphia Story” and perfect-family television like “I Love Lucy” were often quite the opposite of prudish in private.At the same time, a lot of what Mr. Bowers has to say is pretty shocking. He claims, for instance, to have set Hepburn up with “over 150 different women.” Other stories in the 286-page memoir involve Spencer Tracy, Cole Porter, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor and socialites like the publisher Alfred A. Knopf. “If you believe him, and I do, he’s like the Kinsey Reports live and in living color,” said Mr. Tyrnauer, who recently completed a deal to make a documentary about Mr. Bowers.“Full Service” at the very least highlights how sharply the rules of engagement for reporting celebrity gossip have changed. The sexual shenanigans of movie stars were a currency for tabloids stretching back to Hollywood’s earliest days, but studios and, subsequently, squadrons of privately hired public relations experts could usually keep all but the most egregious behavior out of the news media. Secrets were kept.A degree of that still goes on, of course, but it’s much harder to keep details as salacious as the ones Mr. Bowers outlines under wraps. Now all it takes is one pair of loose lips for TMZ to beam all manner of embarrassing information around the globe.The people behind the memoir, including Mr. Bowers’s agent, David Kuhn, and Morgan Entrekin, the publisher of Grove/Atlantic, insist that “Full Service” is not a prurient tell-all, but instead provides a window into an erased, forgotten and denied past of Los Angeles. In his pitch to publishers, Mr. Kuhn positioned it as no less than a tale about “the complex and conflicted psychosexual history of America’s soul.”A lot of big publishers didn’t agree, or at least were not willing to risk the bawdy stuff to get to any larger point. (Yes, the book was offered to Knopf.) Mr. Entrekin said he decided to publish “Full Service” partly because “there seemed to be nothing meanspirited about it at all.“You don’t get the sense that this guy is trying to exploit these experiences,” he said.The heirs and estates of some of the people mentioned in the book are bound to feel otherwise. Fans, too.“He needs to brace himself for attacks,” said William J. Mann, the author of celebrity biographies like “Kate: The Woman Who Was Hepburn,” which details what he says was Hepburn’s lesbianism and Tracy’s bisexuality, using Mr. Bowers (identified as Scotty) as one of several sources. “Some of the pushback is going to be homophobia,” Mr. Mann added. “But there will also be people who say he’s making it up to sell books and others who say why can’t you let these people rest in peace.”“Kate” drew all those reactions and more when it came out in 2006. In particular, “Spencer Tracy: A Biography,” written by James Curtis and published in October, dismisses Mr. Mann’s account of Hepburn’s and Tracy’s sexuality, characterizing Mr. Bowers as unreliable. “Bowers is full of glib stories and revelations, all cheerfully unverifiable,” Mr. Curtis writes.Jennifer Grant, the daughter of Cary Grant, declined to comment on Mr. Bowers’s book. But her spokeswoman said Ms. Grant’s book, “Good Stuff: A Reminiscence of My Father, Cary Grant,” published in 2011, acknowledges that she knew him to be very straight and that he was amused by chatter that he was bisexual.The ABC News anchor Cynthia McFadden, an executor of the Hepburn estate, said it was its long-standing practice not to comment about books like “Full Service.”Mr. Entrekin said that the book had been vetted by a libel lawyer. “Based on his comments, we deleted some information,” he said.Lawyers who specialize in celebrity-related matters said neither federal copyright law nor the patchwork of state-based “right of publicity” laws offer recourse to heirs or estates displeased with assertions published in a memoir. “They might be in tears, but there’s nothing they can do about it,” said Alan U. Schwartz, a veteran entertainment lawyer at Greenberg Traurig.A $20 bill, given as a tip, according to Mr. Bowers, bought his services in the beginning. That was 1946, and he was 23. As Mr. Bowers tells it, he stumbled into his profession by accident.Newly discharged from the Marines after fighting in the Pacific during World War II, Mr. Bowers got a job pumping gas at the corner of Van Ness Avenue and Hollywood Boulevard, not far from Paramount Pictures. One day Walter Pidgeon (“Mrs. Miniver”) drove up in a Lincoln two-door coupe, according to the book, and propositioned Mr. Bowers, who accepted.Soon, word got around among Pidgeon’s friends, and Mr. Bowers, from his base at the station, started “arranging similar stuff” for some of Bowers’s more adventurous friends.Many clients were not famous, Mr. Bowers said. Film production was flourishing in the late 1940s, and Los Angeles became a destination for writers, set designers, hairstylists and other “artists with open minds,” as Mr. Bowers put it. It was also a time of the vice squad, which raided gay bars. “The station was a safer hangout,” he said. “Sometimes police would come around, sure. But I think I never got caught partly because I kept everything in my head. There was no little black book.”Perhaps it’s hard to look at Mr. Bowers today — an elderly man with sloped shoulders and a shock of unruly white hair — and believe that a half-century ago he was sought out by some of the most handsome men to have ever strutted through Hollywood. But after some time with him, the still-sparkling blues and the impish smile help convince you that he could have definitely had seductive powers.Mr. Bowers quit pumping gas in 1950 and says he supported himself for the next two decades through prostitution, bartending and working as a handyman. Mr. Bowers writes that, in addition to his gay clients, he also gained a following among heterosexual actors like Desi Arnaz, who used him as a type of matchmaking service. Mr. Bowers, who says he personally “prefers the sexual company of women,” says he never took payment for connecting people like Arnaz with bedroom partners.“I wasn’t a pimp,” he said. (Mr. Arnaz’s wife at the time, Lucille Ball, apparently felt otherwise, according to “Full Service.”)Mr. Bowers said he continued this life until the onset of AIDS in the 1980s; he also married in 1984. AIDS “brought an end to the sexual freedoms that had defined much of life in Tinseltown ever since the birth of movies,” Mr. Bowers writes. “It was obvious that my days of arranging tricks for others were over. It was too unsafe a game to play anymore.”Over the years, according to Mr. Bowers, various writers he encountered considered writing about him. One was Dominick Dunne, whose son, the actor and director Griffin Dunne, provided a blurb for the “Full Service” book jacket. (“A jaw-dropping firsthand account of closeted life in Hollywood during the ’40s and ’50s.”)Mr. Bowers says Tennessee Williams, during a visit to the Beverly Hills Hotel in the 1960s, wrote “a revealing exposé.” But Mr. Bowers hated it, and Williams scrapped it. “He made me sound like a mad queen flying over Hollywood Boulevard on a broomstick directing all the queens in town,” he said. “It was way over the top.”1242 2012-01-29 “Our totals were only a couple million off from 2007,” Craig Jackson, chief executive of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company, said in an interview, referring to the peak year before the economy went into a tailspin. “It’s coming back.”Barrett-Jackson’s six-day event, the largest of the annual January auctions in the Phoenix area, accounted for more than half of the vehicles that changed hands during the week, with total sales of more than $90 million.Barrett-Jackson’s top sale was a 1948 Tucker Torpedo that brought a surprising $2.9 million. The previous record for a Tucker was $1.1 million at Monterey, Calif., in 2010.The marquee sale of the week, however, was by Gooding & Company, which sold a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Gullwing — one of just 29 produced with an aluminum body — for $4.62 million, a record for that type of vehicle.“It was aggressively estimated before the sale at $2.5 to $3 million,” the president of the auction house, David Gooding, said in an interview. “Eyebrows were raised at that amount. But the sale absolutely soared past that. We had no idea it would do that well.”What might such a sale mean for the collector car market as a whole?“It is a strong but discerning market,” Mr. Gooding said. “It’s very, very strong for the best of the best. But average cars didn’t set the world on fire.”He added: “There is incredible strength for luxury brands from Europe, sports and racing cars especially, more post-World War II than prewar. Those vehicles are seeing very strong, high demand.”Even so, six auctions in town during the week may be one or two too many. Bonhams joined the party this year with a one-day event, while at auctions conducted by RM, Russo & Steele and Silver there was a drop from 2011 both in the number of cars consigned and in gross proceeds.“I do see the scene as a bit diluted around the edges,” Mr. Gooding said.Even Gooding’s catalog offered some vehicles a bit out of its usual range. These included a 1953 Simplex motorcycle and a garish 1948 Chrysler Town & Country convertible once owned by the actor Leo Carrillo of the “Cisco Kid” TV series, that had a Texas longhorn head mounted on the hood. The longhorn’s eyes even lit up, blinking left or right to signal turns. “Such a unique vehicle,” the auctioneer, Charlie Ross, said with understatement.At RM, notable deals included the $781,000 paid for a 1991 Ferrari F40 Berlinetta bought new by Lee A. Iacocca, the onetime Chrysler chairman, and the $990,000 sale of a 1959 BMW 507 roadster — one of only 251 built.Barrett-Jackson, long considered a specialist in 1950s and ’60s American sports and muscle cars, extended its reach in the other direction. The company’s seven-figure sales — nine in all — included prewar classics from Daimler, Duesenberg and Isotta Fraschini.The high-end cars of Barrett-Jackson’s new Salon Offering Collection are part of what it called the 5000 series, named for the special lot numbers assigned to them. These cars, which carried reserves of at least $500,000, included the Tucker and a 1947 Bentley Mark VI from the collection of Ron Pratte, a Phoenix-area businessman.Thirty-five percent of the buyers at Barrett-Jackson’s auctions were first-timers. “Businessmen are seeing how much potential there is in putting money into classic cars,” Mr. Jackson said. “Where else are you going to put your money — in a bank?”No small part of the Barrett-Jackson event’s appeal is based on its six days of nationally televised programming on the Speed cable TV channel.“The 5000 Series cars brought in some excitement — and we are all about excitement,” Mr. Jackson said. “We could do small, European-style, one-day events only for a small, select group of high-end cars. But we prefer the large-scale American-style events. It’s a lifestyle event now, with tours of the Phoenix area for our people who come in from out of town. We take the wives — more than 100 of them this year — shopping, golfing and to the casino. We have dinner and receptions. So do our sponsors.”On the other hand, the auction house is getting very picky about the vehicles it accepts, Mr. Jackson said. “We turned down a lot of cars this time.”Cars were rejected, Mr. Jackson said, for not being in sale-ready condition; for the type of restoration or modifications done; and for those of questionable provenance.“When the amount of money we’re talking about goes up, like it has, we see more phonies trying to get in,” he said. “We have researchers who look very carefully into the claims of the consignors. If we find something that can’t be substantiated, we bounce it back.”Examples of questionable vehicles cited by Mr. Jackson include Pontiac Tempests that had been turned into GTOs and big-block Corvettes.Surprising amounts were paid, particularly at Barrett-Jackson, for so-called resto-mods. These are not authentic classics, but modified vehicles — for instance, a 1957 Chevrolet gutted mechanically and fitted with a modern powertrain and suspension.“In some cases, these cars are getting prices that exceed even the values of the original versions of the cars,” Mr. Jackson said. “These are collectibles you can actually use and drive.”1243 2012-01-29 At 136 West 75th Street, a two-bedroom two-bath co-op is listed for sale for $1.195 million by Halstead Property. The median price per square foot in 2011 was $896, said Jonathan J. Miller of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.Park Slope, , has often been an option for those priced out of the Upper West Side, but with prices rising there, prospective buyers might consider its neighbor on the other side of Flatbush Avenue, Prospect Heights. There, the median per-square-foot price, $446, is half that of the Upper West Side, Mr. Miller said.The neighborhood borders its own great green space, Prospect Park, as well as the broad Eastern Parkway and Grand Army Plaza. The , the Brooklyn Public Library and the are just across the parkway.“The late-19th-century apartment buildings on Eastern Parkway and the row houses on the mid blocks — it’s the same style of you find on the Upper West Side,” said Simeon Bankoff, the executive director of the , a citywide preservation group. Much of the southern end of the neighborhood is under landmark protection, including stretches of St. Mark’s Avenue, Prospect Place and Park Place. To the north are smaller brick row houses and the construction site of the arena for the vast development.A wave of new residents arrived in the early 1990s, said Gib Veconi, the treasurer of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council.“People would buy a house with their last dollar,” Mr. Veconi said, “start remodeling the ground floor and rent it out to get some income, and slowly renovate over time, mostly with their own labor.”Now, he said, more affluent residents buy houses and commission half-million-dollar gut renovations in under a year.David Rogers, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman, said brownstones in the neighborhood sold for roughly $1.4 million to $1.8 million, depending on condition and location.At 416 Park Place, a two-family town house with a three-bedroom owner’s duplex is listed at $1.55 million by Brown Harris Stevens.New bars, restaurants and coffee shops have recently opened on Vanderbilt Avenue, the neighborhood’s commercial spine. Saul Bolton, who earned a Michelin star for his restaurant in Boerum Hill, opened a restaurant here called the Vanderbilt. The shop Ample Hills Creamery draws crowds of children on summer afternoons.The large houses of Prospect Heights have drawn families to the area. Joyce Szuflita, the founder of NYC School Help, which helps families find schools in Brooklyn, said parents had put a lot of energy into improving Public School 9.Mr. Veconi of the development council said Prospect Heights’ new appeal was not surprising. “The allure here was that this was an undervalued neighborhood,” he said. “I felt like people were going to get this sooner or later.”Over the last two decades the Lower East Side has become a microcosm of everything New York is known for. Its short, intimate blocks harbor innovative restaurants, boutiques, galleries and clubs. Its history as an immigrant enclave is celebrated at the Tenement Museum, and its Jewish past persists at the venerable Eldridge Street Synagogue and the lox purveyors Russ & Daughters on East Houston Street.And as the neighborhood changed, the price of housing soared. New condos sell for a median of $1,020 per square foot, according to Mr. Miller, who said asking prices over $1 million were not uncommon. In the new building at 60 Orchard Street, Stribling & Associates is listing a two-bedroom two-bath condo for $1.35 million.But prospective buyers would do well to look across the East River at Greenpoint, Brooklyn, which has a vibrant ethnic history as well as lively shopping and dining — and much lower housing prices. The median condo price per square foot in Greenpoint is $563, Mr. Miller said. At 149 Huron Street, two blocks from the subway, Apartments and Lofts has an accepted offer on a two-bedroom condo listed for $513,000.Greenpoint is not as convenient as its better-known neighbor to the south, Williamsburg, because it is on the G subway line and Manhattan is not a straight shot. The housing is a mix of new condos, small apartment buildings, brownstones, brick town houses, conversions, a few loft spaces and wooden row houses, many covered in vinyl siding. For many decades Greenpoint was a Polish enclave, and Manhattan Avenue is crowded with bakeries, butcher shops displaying kielbasa, and inexpensive Polish restaurants.But now, wedged in among Polish businesses, the avenue also has an artisanal ice cream parlor that serves Earl Grey cones, an infants’ clothing and toy store, and coffee shops. The area around Franklin Street, once a desolate strip, has restaurants, bars, shops and condos, and is part of a small historic district.Families have been attracted to the neighborhood because they can get more space without sacrificing the quality of their schools.

S. 31, for example, gets high scores: 90 percent of students meet state standards for reading and 97 percent for math.“Greenpoint is a great Brooklyn neighborhood,” said David Maundrell, the founder of Apartments and Lofts, which markets many condos in the area. “There are different ethnic backgrounds, the Polish and Irish and the new people moving in over the last 10 years. You have amazing retail and services. It is a well-rounded neighborhood.”Inside Vinny’s of Carroll Gardens on Smith Street, firefighters sit alongside locals in their 70s out for a meal with their grandchildren. Waitresses sit down at your table to take your order. The food is old-school Italian — red sauce and eggplant-parm heroes. Next door to Vinny’s is Persons of Interest, a new old-school barbershop where the “combo platter” — a shave and a haircut — costs $75.It is that congenial mix of the traditional and the retro-modern that has drawn well-heeled newcomers, many with families, to the deep-yarded brownstones that are Carroll Gardens’ signature. Asking prices for these houses, many built in around the time of the Civil War, can easily top $2 million; the median price was $602 per square foot last year, according to Mr. Miller.At 230 Union Street, Prudential Douglas Elliman is listing a town house for $2.295 million.About three miles east lies Crown Heights North, a neighborhood with a trove of brownstones and row houses, in a variety of styles, that can be had for a fraction of those in Carroll Gardens. The median price for all of Crown Heights last year was $384 per square foot, Mr. Miller said. The houses are of newer vintage, built from about 1870 to 1920, but many bear the elaborate details of the Gilded Age.Once among Brooklyn’s wealthiest neighborhoods, Crown Heights is filled with mansions and town houses. Many were built by well-known architects, including Montrose Morris, Axel Hedman and C. P. H Gilbert.“This was the luxury housing of its day,” said Simeon Bankoff, the director of the Historic Districts Council. “There are some drop-dead gorgeous buildings there.”Today Crown Heights North has a large historic district. St. Marks Avenue, Dean Street and multiple blocks of Prospect Place have some very ornate houses. These sell for over $1 million when they become available, said Barbara Brown-Allen, a broker with Prudential Douglas Elliman.Other houses, depending on the work required to bring them up to snuff, go for $700,000 to $900,000. Many are quite large, often 20 feet wide by 50 feet deep and four stories tall. At 1174 Dean Street, Prudential Douglas Elliman is listing a town house for $1.195 million.The 2, 3, 4 and 5 trains run through the neighborhood, and the A and C are not far away, in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Franklin Avenue, the main commercial strip, is about a mile from Prospect Park.A number of the stores cater to West Indian and Panamanian residents. Nick Juravich, who blogs about the neighborhood at I Love Franklin Avenue, said that since he moved here in 2008, more than 30 businesses had opened, including Mexican, Indian and Thai restaurants. “We have a sleek new wine bar that would fit right in on Smith Street,” he said, meaning the main drag in Carroll Gardens.Hell’s Kitchen, as is obvious from its name, wasn’t always the most desirable place to live. But that has changed, at first slowly and then more quickly. Restaurants, bars, coffee shops and other businesses have settled in along Ninth Avenue, and a few are opening farther west on 10th Avenue.Much of Hell’s Kitchen has been protected from high-rise development, so that on the cross streets, low-rise town houses, brownstones and historic churches remain. In the northern part of the neighborhood, Prudential Douglas Elliman is listing a two-bedroom two-bath condo at 426 West 58th Street for $1.749 million.Development has been pushed to the neighborhood’s edges, toward the Hudson River and along 42nd Street, where high-rises, mostly rentals, have sprouted in the last few years. Two-bedrooms at the new MiMA tower on 42nd Street rent for about $6,500 a month; the most expensive three-bedroom there is $16,250 a month.Mr. Miller said the median price per square foot in Hell’s Kitchen in 2011 was $854 — a bargain compared with costs in some other Manhattan neighborhoods.But that figure is still 35 percent more expensive than the median of $555 in Long Island City, , which is growing its own forest of handsomely appointed residential towers. Large condo projects are rising throughout the neighborhood, overshadowing brick town houses, as well as garages and other businesses.It’s easy to see why developers are drawn to its East River shoreline. High-rise towers are under construction alongside a riverfront park with views to the west of the and Midtown — just a few minutes away on half a dozen subway lines. Restaurants, supermarkets, preschools and dog day care centers are popping up. The neighborhood has a mix of old and new on Vernon Avenue, the commercial strip closest to the water. There’s a strong arts community and even some remaining manufacturing.Long Island City is home to , a center for modern and performance events. Galleries and lofts are taking over industrial buildings.“You have a sense of a real community here,” said Bob Singleton, the director of the Greater Astoria Historical Society. “You have all the benefits of a small town with all of the advantages of a big city right next to you in Midtown Manhattan.”Eric Benaim began selling units in Long Island City in 2006 through his firm Modern Spaces, which lists a two-bedroom two-bath condo at L Haus on 49th Avenue for $870,000.“It has all started happening over here in the last year and a half or so,” Mr. Benaim said. And, he added, “It’s only about eight minutes on the subway to Hell’s Kitchen.”When artists began moving into lofts in manufacturing buildings with cast-iron fronts in SoHo in the 1960s and 1970s, they were looking for cheap space to live and work. But they wound up changing the way people think about cities, said Andrew Berman, the director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation.“We take for granted the notion that it is cool to live in a converted loft building in an old industrial section of a city,” Mr. Berman said. “But that is a relatively new concept, an outgrowth of artists’ taking over disused industrial spaces in SoHo.”Today, few artists could afford to buy a loft in SoHo. The neighborhood is packed with boutiques, brand-name stores, upscale restaurants and hotels. Lofts that decades ago housed painters sell for millions of dollars, like one listed by Prudential Douglas Elliman for $3.25 million at 475 Broadway, now in contract. The median price per square foot is $1,122, according to Mr. Miller.Just 20 blocks uptown, another neighborhood is going through a similar revival: the Ladies’ Mile Historic District. Roughly framed by the Avenue of the Americas and Broadway from 17th to 24th Street, the area also has historic loft buildings with large windows and cast-iron facades. But the median per-square-foot price is $987, about 20 percent less than in SoHo, Mr. Miller said.And it has a different history. The Ladies’ Mile was home to some of the city’s largest department stores, including and Lord & Taylor.Unlike the industrial buildings of SoHo, the stores along the Ladies’ Mile were ornate, many built in the Beaux-Arts style. Some have mansard roofs. The former Hugh O’Neill store has large gold domes.As in SoHo, artists found their way to the upper floors of these large buildings. So many photographers worked here that it was called the photo district, said Jack Taylor, the president of the Drive to Protect the Ladies’ Mile District. However, it differed from SoHo in that galleries, restaurants and retail were slow to follow.The historic district was approved in 1989. About a decade ago, big-box stores moved in. Today the area has a TJ Maxx, a , a and a Trader Joe’s. There are new restaurants; on a recent Sunday, the line at the brunch spot tbsp on 20th Street was nearly out the door.Some of the old department stores are being converted into condos, including the O’Neill Building and the Cammeyer, a former shoe emporium at 650 Sixth Avenue, where CORE is marketing a unit for $2.85 million. The units are not the same raw and massive spaces one finds in SoHo.“It feels more like a residential neighborhood,” Mr. Taylor said. “Ladies’ Mile used to be like Siberia, but now it can be pretty hard to bear in terms of noise and crowds. There is no denying it is populated.”1244 2012-01-29 Credit: Andrew Testa for The New York Times1245 2012-01-29 That was certainly the affect when she performed on “Saturday Night Live” a couple of weeks ago, looking uncertain, like a child singing her grandmother’s favorite songs, dressed in her grandmother’s clothes. The persistent purr she nails on her record was here punctuated with evident breaths and awkward silences. When she hit her lower register, it was bumpy, as if she needed a backhoe. Her eyes avoided the cameras.It wasn’t much better at the Bowery Ballroom last month, in her first proper New York concert, where she appeared resistant to the need to be polished, or even prepared.Maybe Ms. Del Rey is self-immolating. And if so, maybe it’s from reluctance, not lack of talent. Sometimes you make choices, and circumstances force you to have to stick by them. If the Internet hadn’t glommed onto Ms. Del Rey’s video for “Video Games,” which she made herself and released last August, maybe she’d have shrugged her shoulders and moved on to another pose. But notoriety has a way of freezing its targets, and so Ms. Del Rey doubled down in her amber.It hasn’t helped, maybe because one has to wear clothes for a long time before they fit well. Her success has been presented a fait accompli, largely because of the intensity of ire she arouses: anything dissected this aggressively must be important, no?No, not really. Whether from boredom or schadenfreude or sexism or rockism, she’s taken an unfair amount of guff: Ms. Del Rey is a fraud! That’s not even her real name! Her father is a heavy in the domain-name industry! She has fuller lips now! Those who discovered Ms. Del Rey on “SNL” — yes, those people still exist — and choose to learn more about her online will find a grotesque, not-at-all hidden background story, like an especially troubling Carfax report on a pristine-looking roadside sale find.To counteract this Ms. Del Rey can only do so much. She has some songs, some videos, some live performances and some interviews, ranging from daffy to difficult to dull, which haven’t helped the case that behind this painted facade ticks a real heart.And so the Lana Del Rey-bashing economy moves faster than the actual Lana Del Rey economy, a reminder of how free people feel to clobber someone, especially a young woman, for the crime of art. Not always artful art, but that matters less than the elevation of the mundane into something worth exploding. Ms. Del Rey generates so much anger precisely because she does so little. People don’t know what to do with this unformed thing they’ve been told they need to care about; crushing it is easy, almost humane.It has also resulted in a self-perpetuating apoplexy around her image and reception. A parody self-defense written in Ms. Del Rey’s voice was published on the Web site Thought Catalog, but was then removed after zealous, repeated entreaties from Ms. Del Rey’s publicity team, which insisted that fans were confused, even after a disclaimer was added. The satirical trend-thumping site Hipster Runoff, a frequent and happy agitator of Ms. Del Rey’s and others, reprinted it. Carles, the site’s author-proprietor-inventor, also went into self-examination mode, writing about the evolution of blogs from taste-making engines to traffic-generating tools of destruction, as if those weren’t the same thing to begin with.Even the NBC news-hipster Brian Williams acted out in an e-mail to Gawker’s honcho, Nick Denton, that was published on the site, seemingly without Mr. Williams’s permission. He sounds outraged: “one of the worst outings in SNL history”; “booked on the strength of her two song web EP.”Yes, Mr. Williams, exactly, that is just the strength she was booked on, the strength to polarize after just a short period of time. That she was booked on “SNL” indicates at least a fundamental understanding of Internet dynamics, and was a no-lose: she wins, “SNL” wins; she loses, “SNL” wins. (Or maybe it indicates that January is a slow month for new releases.)There is hypocrisy all around: on the part of Ms. Del Rey, on the part of her various teams and enablers, on the part of her dissecters and executioners. A career founded on bad faith all around can’t be long for this world, but at this point what can Ms. Del Rey do? Not much. Her cultural stamp has already been affixed, her biography written in concrete. The only real option is to wash off that face paint, muss up that hair and try again in a few years. There are so many more names out there for the choosing.1246 2012-01-29 WEISSMAN--Alisha. ""One sees clearly ONLY with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes"".

It still owns an 82 percent stake. The government — which has insisted it has no control over the bank’s bonuses — welcomed the announcement.“This is a sensible and welcome decision that enables Stephen Hester to focus on the very important job he has got to do, namely to get back billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money that was put into RBS,” said George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer.The RBS chairman, Philip Hampton, is also going to waive his bonus of £1.4 million in shares.The board last week approved Mr. Hester’s bonus of 3.6 million shares — worth just under £1 million at Friday’s closing share price. That is in addition to his £1.2 million salary.Many politicians were critical. Mayor Boris Johnson of London said he found the bonus “absolutely bewildering.”1290 2012-01-30 It was good news that the Obama administration withstood pressure from Roman Catholic bishops and social conservatives to deny contraceptive coverage for millions of American women who work for religiously affiliated employers. Kathleen Sebelius, the Health and Human Services secretary, rejected broad exemptions from a new rule requiring all health plans to cover birth control, without a deductible or co-payment.The requirement, announced last August, contains an exemption for employees of churches and other houses of worship. But it properly covers employees of hospitals, universities, charitable groups and other entities that are associated with religious organizations but serve the general public and employ people of different faiths. The final version of the rule gives certain nonprofit employers an extra year to comply. The administration’s commitment to affordable birth control is welcome at a moment when women’s access to reproductive health care, including contraceptives, cancer screenings and abortion services, is under assault in the courts, state legislatures and Congress, as well as on the Republican campaign trail.Earlier this month, for example, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit lifted a preliminary injunction barring enforcement of a new Texas law requiring doctors to show women seeking an abortion a fetal sonogram. It forces doctors to describe the image and play the sound of the fetal heartbeat, despite a woman’s wishes or a doctor’s ethical objections.This outrageous intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship tramples on the First Amendment rights of physicians and their patients. The opinion, written by the court’s chief judge, Edith Jones, a vocal opponent of abortion rights, brushes aside the free-speech violation.The Supreme Court has approved of laws requiring doctors to offer material describing fetal development and to inform patients before an abortion about possible risks of the procedure. Texas’s more intrusive requirement is wholly unnecessary for informed consent and is intended to dissuade women from having the procedure.It does not bode well that the panel that struck down the injunction retained jurisdiction over future appeals. The immediate impact of the ruling will be to encourage other states to adopt similar laws impinging on women’s access to a constitutionally protected medical procedure.1291 2012-01-30 The American Psychiatric Association has been trying to do just that ever since, mostly by leaving behind ideas about the meaning of our suffering in favor of observation and treatment of its symptoms. In 1980, it hit on the strategy of adopting a medical rhetoric, organizing those symptoms into neat disease categories and checklists of precisely described criteria and publishing them in the hefty — and, according to its chief author, “very scientific-looking” — D.S.M.-III.That book, with its more than 200 objectively described diagnoses, would have made Dr. Salmon proud. By meeting the scientific demands of the day, it was credited by many with having rescued psychiatry from the brink of extinction, and its subsequent revisions have been the cornerstone of the profession’s survival as a medical specialty.But as all those Diagnostic and Statistical Manuals have stated clearly in their introductions, while the book seems to name the mental illnesses found in nature, it actually makes “no assumption that each category of mental disorder is a completely discrete entity with absolute boundaries dividing it from other mental disorders or no mental disorder.” And as any psychiatrist involved in the making of the D.S.M. will freely tell you, the disorders listed in the book are not “real diseases,” at least not like measles or hepatitis. Instead, they are useful constructs that capture the ways that people commonly suffer. The manual, they go on, was primarily written to give physicians, schooled in the language of disease, a way to recognize similarities and differences among their patients and to talk to one another about them. And it has been fairly successful at that.Still, “people take it literally,” one psychiatrist who worked on the manual told me. “That is its strength in a political sense.” And even if the A.P.A. benefits mightily from that misperception, the troubles on the front page are not the organization’s fault. They are what happens when we expect the D.S.M. to be what it is not. “The D.S.M. has been taken too seriously,” another expert told me. “It’s the victim of its success.”Psychiatrists would like the book to deserve a more serious take, and thus to be less subject to these embarrassing diagnostic squabbles. But this is going to require them to have what the rest of medicine already possesses: the biochemical markers that allow doctors to sort the staph from the strep, the malignant from the benign. And they don’t have these yet. They aren’t even close. The human brain, after all, may be the most complex object in the universe. And the few markers, the genes and the neural networks, that have been implicated in mental disorders do not map well onto the D.S.M.’s categories.“We’re like Cinderella’s older stepsisters,” a psychiatrist told me the other day. “We’re trying to stick our fat feet into the delicate slipper so the prince can take us to the ball. But we ain’t going to the ball right now.” Which is why we might feel a little sorry for the beleaguered A.P.A.On the other hand, given that the current edition of the D.S.M. has earned the association — which holds and tightly guards its naming rights to our pain — more than $100 million, we might want to temper our sympathy. It may not be dancing at the ball, but once every mental health worker, psychology student and forensic lawyer in the country buys the new book, it will be laughing all the way to the bank.1292 2012-01-30 “It is impossible to live in this city on $15,000 a year,” said Micah C. Lasher, Mr. Bloomberg’s director of state legislative affairs.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said that he is generally in favor of a minimum wage increase, but that he will have to see the speaker’s proposal before deciding whether to support it. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has enjoyed strong support from the business community, but has also been under pressure from the liberal wing of his party to demonstrate concern for the poor.The state’s current minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, which is lower than that of 18 states and the District of Columbia, took effect three years ago as the result of a federal law. The State Legislature last approved a minimum wage increase eight years ago.The neighboring state with the highest minimum wage is Vermont, at $8.46. In Massachusetts it is $8, and in Connecticut it is $8.25.For Mr. Silver, the minimum wage proposal is one element of a broader agenda, including a tax cut for families making less than $30,000 per year, that he said he hoped would begin to address inequality issues.“When you work full time at the minimum wage, you are poor in New York,” Mr. Silver said in an interview. “You’re not making enough to get by. We want to have people able to support their families, plain and simple.”Mr. Silver, who is sponsoring the measure with Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, also a Manhattan Democrat, estimated that the increase would benefit one million New Yorkers — those making less than the proposed amount, and others making slightly more, whose salaries would be adjusted to keep them above the minimum wage.Supporters say that a minimum wage increase could help bring low-income families out of poverty, stimulate economic growth and spur job creation.“The Occupy movement shone a light on inequality,” said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party. “Raising the minimum wage is a modest but real step in balancing the scales.”But opponents say it could hurt low-income earners and small businesses, by raising the cost of doing business, which could lead to layoffs.“The national minimum wage went up, and in the United States of America the economy’s the worst it’s been since the Great Depression,” said Senator Tom Libous, a Binghamton Republican. Mr. Libous said he was skeptical of studies suggesting that increasing the minimum wage spurs economic growth.“I think that’s a lame theory that doesn’t amount to much,” he said.Mr. Silver’s proposal may not go far enough for advocates who have called for an even higher minimum wage. Had the national minimum wage kept pace with inflation over the past 40 years, it would be at $10.39 now, according to the National Employment Law Project.Mr. Silver’s proposal “is a good start, but really is not enough for New York’s cost of living and New York’s economy,” said Paul Sonn, the legal co-director at the project.The Fiscal Policy Institute, which has been supportive of minimum wage increases, argues that people who earn the minimum wage tend to spend all the additional money they receive, which pumps money into the economy. The extra spending will create jobs and benefit the mom-and-pop shops that opponents of an increase say will be most hurt by a higher minimum wage, said James A. Parrott, the chief economist at the institute.“They’re going to be spending more money in local communities, where they live,” Mr. Parrott said.But, citing a 2008 study by professors at American University and Cornell, Russell Sykes, a senior fellow at the Empire Center for New York State Policy, said that increasing the minimum wage even to $8.25 could result in a loss of tens of thousands of jobs.“When you begin to take people who are lower-skilled and require the business to pay them more, they make decisions of a different nature that can lead to job loss,” Mr. Sykes said. “It prices less-skilled workers out of the market.”1293 2012-01-30 “We set our priorities here often simply based on what the big issues are,” Mr. Lawsky, 41, said in an interview. “Does that come from the world of Andrew Cuomo? Yes, because government shouldn’t be a waste of time. Government should be about making a difference in people’s lives.”For his part, Mr. Schneiderman has not allowed himself to be rolled over.Last year, he helped beat back an effort by Mr. Cuomo’s office to give Mr. Lawsky and the new agency even more expansive powers that would have cut into the heart of the attorney general’s jurisdiction. The governor’s proposal, which would have allowed Mr. Lawsky to investigate violations of the Martin Act, the sweeping state securities law used by former Gov. Eliot Spitzer and his successors to pursue financial malfeasance, alarmed Wall Street and even academics.Writing in The New York Law Journal, Jonathan R. Macey, a Yale Law School professor, called it “a naked and highly suspicious power grab.”And in a recent interview, John C. Coffee Jr., a law professor at Columbia University, put it this way: “Cuomo made his fame as attorney general, and he sort of treated that jurisdiction as portable and took it with him as governor.”The Cuomo administration backed off, dropping the Martin Act provision. Nonetheless, the new agency, besides absorbing two major regulatory bodies, has gained a number of new powers. It has broader authority to fight fraud beyond the insurers and state-chartered banks it licenses, and its reach has extended to all manner of financial products, including student lending, credit cards and tax refund anticipation loans.Eric R. Dinallo, a partner at Debevoise & Plimpton and former state insurance superintendent, likened the new agency to the Securities and Exchange Commission, in the way it combines regulation and enforcement under one roof.“It’s not common to have a combined regulatory and enforcement function,” he said, adding, “It’s effectively very competitive with the attorney general’s jurisdiction.”The two agencies are publicly cordial, but behind the scenes they are much like two boxers feeling each other out in an opening round. Already, turfs are overlapping.Mr. Schneiderman, a liberal-minded attorney general, made a national name for himself in his first year by spurning a settlement that the Obama administration and other attorneys general had been negotiating with the banking industry over foreclosure practices. Then last week, President Obama, vowing to get tougher on Wall Street, reached out to Mr. Schneiderman, naming him co-chairman of a new financial crimes unit to prosecute large-scale financial fraud.At the same time, Mr. Cuomo, in his State of the State address this month, turned to Mr. Lawsky, not Mr. Schneiderman, on the issue, directing the Department of Financial Services to create a Foreclosure Relief Unit. And Mr. Lawsky has moved on his own to secure deals with smaller lenders on curbing abuses.Asked whether he supported Mr. Schneiderman’s stance on the national negotiations, Mr. Lawsky was noncommittal.“We’re not commenting at all on the ongoing negotiations because we are at least tangentially a part of them and could ultimately be called on to sign or not sign,” he said, adding, “We want to see what the final proposal is.”Danny Kanner, a spokesman for Mr. Schneiderman, said in a statement that the two offices “will continue to work together toward our common purpose of protecting consumers, investors, and the integrity of New York’s global markets.”“In the aftermath of the financial crisis,” the statement said, “we need more willing hands on deck, not less, to meet that critical objective.”Mr. Lawsky said he was learning to balance the roles of regulator and enforcer. And during his years as a top aide to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Lawsky has been known as one of the relatively few administration officials to play nicely with others.“A lot of people like to paint me as a tough guy because I’m a former prosecutor,” he said, adding: “You are being handed a huge amount of power over people’s lives and their businesses. It’s not something you willy-nilly bang people over the head with.”Mr. Lawsky grew up in New York and Pittsburgh, received his undergraduate and law degrees from Columbia, and worked under four United States attorneys for the Southern District of New York, prosecuting everything from insider trading to terror and mob cases. He is a runner, but last had time to train for and run a marathon — the Marine Corps Marathon — in 2009. (His time was 3:40:17.)Perhaps his most notable early achievement has been putting pressure on health insurers to make public proposed rate increases. But his office also pointed to early relationships he has formed with both industry executives and consumer groups.Theodore A. Mathas, chief executive of the New York Life Insurance Company, said, “Ben is approachable, he’s a good listener and he’s quickly grasped a lot of complex things we’ve thrown at him.” Michael P. Smith, president of the New York Bankers Association, said, “We are very pleased with his performance.”On the consumer advocacy side, Charles Bell, programs director for Consumers Union, said, “We’ve been pleased that they have reached out,” adding that a group of consumer advocates was meeting with the agency monthly on a variety of topics.Mr. Lawsky does know how to answer the tough questions. During a recent online question-and-answer session with the public, the first questioner asked: “Mr. Lawsky, are you copying the governor’s hairstyle? It seems you have a similar look.” He replied: “That never occurred to me. It’s very flattering. Thanks.”1294 2012-01-30 ¶Mizuno USA, Norcross, Ga., part of Mizuno, chose McKinney, Durham, N.C., as its creative advertising agency of record for footwear, apparel and equipment for sports like baseball, running, golf and volleyball.

For anyone who spent time in Issue Project’s former home, a tiny space at the Old American Can Factory, also in Brooklyn, this is a new world: the room is spacious (5,000 square feet) and rich in retro grandeur, with marble floors, columns and arches, and a high, ornate ceiling.Though the hall is comfortably functional now, another two years of renovations are planned. Then it will be an entirely flexible space, with neither a permanent stage nor fixed seating, so that performers can use it in any of several configurations. Right now colorful, sound-absorbing panels dot the walls, and according to Ed Patuto, Issue Project’s executive director, the organization has halved the room’s natural reverberation time of about five seconds. Mr. Patuto said he would like to shave off another second or so.But as they are, the acoustics suited the experimental works that the Wet Ink Ensemble performed at the inaugural concert, the first installment of Gaudeamus Muziekweek New York. The series is an American version of a Dutch new-music festival that has flourished since 1945. The festival, in Utrecht, does not focus particularly on Dutch music; its scope is international, and the Brooklyn edition is following suit, with a Dutch group, Ensemble MAE, joining two American ones, Wet Ink and the International Contemporary Ensemble, in programs that are global and eclectic.That said, Wet Ink’s opening concert was devoted mostly to American works, with a piece by the Japanese composer Yoshiaki Onishi as the sole exception. All were, at heart, about morphing timbres and textures, and whether by design or by happenstance, they added up to an impressive demonstration of the space’s tolerances for dynamic breadth and clarity of projection.In “Nucleus” Alex Mincek, the composer and saxophonist, offered a philosophical look at repetition and variation, moving between repeated (but subtly different) figures and sudden changes that retained some of the melodic DNA of the repetitions. Not surprisingly the similar phrases arrested the ear, but the quick changes in tempo, volume and density proved more memorable.Another of the ensemble’s composer-performers, Kate Soper, sang her own “cipher,” an exotic score in which her vocal settings of text fragments from Wittgenstein, Freud, Jenny Holzer, Michael Drayton and Sara Teasdale closely matched, in timbre and gesture, a brash violin line played energetically by Joshua Modney. Sometimes Ms. Soper ran a hand along the fingerboard.1296 2012-01-31 Prosecutors are said to be preparing criminal charges against former Credit Suisse trading, accusing them of defrauding investors by mispricing mortgage securities....1297 2012-01-31 Prosecutors are said to be preparing criminal charges against former Credit Suisse trading, accusing them of defrauding investors by mispricing mortgage securities....1298 2012-01-31 While the authorities have traced hundreds of millions of dollars from MF Global, investigators do not know whether they can retrieve the money....1299 2012-01-31 While the authorities have traced hundreds of millions of dollars from MF Global, investigators do not know whether they can retrieve the money....1300 2012-01-31 Michael Stockman, the firm's chief risk officer, is set tell Congress that he did not sound the alarms about risky wagers on European sovereign debt until about three months before MF Global collapsed....1301 2012-01-31 Michael Stockman, the firm's chief risk officer, is set tell Congress that he did not sound the alarms about risky wagers on European sovereign debt until about three months before MF Global collapsed....1302 2012-01-31 The government contends that Rajat K.

Four others received six-year sentences. Prosecutors alleged that companies and state agencies were forced to pay fees to attend a conference, and the money was used for Mr. Nastase’s presidential run in 2004.1328 2012-01-31 But he found his way to a program at Medical Center called Operation Mend that provides for severely burned veterans at no cost — and the operations fundamentally realigned his face, restoring not just the semblance of his former visage, but also a healthy chunk of his self-confidence.He is venturing out again, to bars, and ball games. On last year, Mr. Paulk, 26, rode in the lead car of the parade, his head bared for tens of thousands to see.“The burns on a soldier’s face are huge: It’s your military uniform and you can’t take it off,” he said. “The surgery changed so much on my face that it completely changed my whole outlook on life.”The story of Mr. Paulk’s cosmetic and emotional revival says much about the ways private philanthropy can complement the overtaxed military and veterans health care systems. Now in its fifth year, Operation Mend has provided free cosmetic surgery to more than 50 badly burned veterans of the current wars. The program estimates it spends $500,000 on each of its patients.But the story also underscores the difficulties of bringing private care into the military world. Though Operation Mend’s founder envisioned the program as a model for public-private cooperation in treating wounded soldiers, it remains one of only a few such ventures, which include Center for the Intrepid rehabilitation centers and Fisher Houses for military families.Part of the problem, said Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the outgoing Army vice chief of staff who has embraced Operation Mend, is that many military doctors remain uncomfortable referring patients out of their system, which they view as a protective cocoon for troops and their families. But that attitude is changing, said General Chiarelli, who is pushing for a private program similar to Operation Mend for treating and . “Our problems are so big, we have to reach out beyond ourselves,” he said.Mr. Paulk, who grew up and still lives in the town of Vista in northern San Diego County, joined the Army a year out of high school in 2004, thinking it might help him get a job in law enforcement.On his first deployment, with a military police unit in eastern Afghanistan in 2007, he was in a Humvee when it struck a buried mine that ignited the fuel tank and instantly killed his team leader. Mr. Paulk regained consciousness 20 feet from the truck, engulfed in flames.In searing pain yet shivering with cold in the 90-degree heat, an odd question popped into Mr. Paulk’s head as he waited to be evacuated: Do I still have hair? Yes, another soldier said; his Kevlar helmet had saved it. Mr. Paulk told himself, “the burns aren’t so bad, and I’ll still look like me.”But it was not to be. By the time he awoke in San Antonio from a medically induced coma, he had already undergone numerous operations and skin grafts to patch his charred face, arms and legs. With his mother’s permission, a surgeon had removed all his fingers, which had been burned black and to the bone and were all but certain to become infected. He had lost 50 pounds in barely four weeks.Over many months, his body accepted the vast majority of his skin grafts and he regained strength. But the one attempt by a surgeon to replace tissue on his face had failed, Mr. Paulk felt. After nearly 30 operations in 18 months, he began to resign himself to his appearance, and prepared to return to Vista, suffering from what his doctors called “surgery fatigue.”“Everyone has a limit,” said Dr. Ivan Renz, the director of the burn unit at Brooke who Mr. Paulk says saved his life. “You get to a point where you go: ‘hold it, I’ve got to go through again?’ ”But before he left Brooke in December 2008, Mr. Paulk met a representative from Operation Mend who urged him to visit U.C.L.A. He took her card, skeptical that anyone could make him look good again.The program had its origins in late 2006 when a wealthy philanthropist, Ronald A. Katz, was watching a interview with a badly burned Marine named Aaron Mankin. Charmed by the Marine but appalled at the extent of his wounds, Mr. Katz’s late wife, Maddie, poked him in the ribs and practically issued an order: “You have to do something!”The military already had a state-of-the-art burn center at Brooke. But while the center offered reconstructive surgery, its focus was on saving lives and getting the wounded back on their feet. The did not provide reconstructive surgery unless it was deemed medically necessary to restore, promote or preserve health — criteria that did not seem to include making someone look better.During the coming year, Mr. Katz enlisted the support of U.C.L.A. and a respected reconstructive surgeon on its faculty, Dr. Timothy Miller, a veteran. One of Mr. Katz’s daughters-in-law began assembling volunteer “buddy families” to meet patients at the airport, entertain them and accompany their families to the hospital. He met with General Chiarelli and began to slowly win over the doctors at Brooke.Mr. Paulk remained a tough sell. But the smaller indignities of his injuries made him relent when an Operation Mend representative called again. He could not open his mouth wide enough to eat a hamburger. Could Dr. Miller fix that? And what about his misshapen lips, which made it impossible for him to pronounce his own name? Dr. Miller pledged to have Mr. Paulk whistling and eating double cheeseburgers again.With the first surgery, Dr. Miller removed scar tissue, raising the eye lid and lower lip. With second and third operations, he improved the alignment of Mr. Paulk’s eyes and lips by replacing scars with healthy tissue. A fourth surgery implanted silicone to add definition to his chin.At a recent checkup in Dr. Miller’s office, Mr. Paulk admired his new profile in the mirror. “From a distance, you can’t tell I was injured,” he said.There are still uncomfortable moments. Some drunks taunted him about his looks at a baseball game, nearly starting a brawl. And Mr. Paulk admits to moments of self-consciousness about his hands. When, for instance, a little girl gawked at him at U.C.L.A. recently, he reflexively tucked his palms under his armpits.But he has also learned how to function: to put on socks, pull up zippers and tie shoes. He can send texts and drive. He can’t play his beloved baseball, and video games remain a challenge, but he manages to catch a football and spike a volleyball with his palms.And he looks remarkably comfortable holding a drink at a party.“Sometimes I’ll hold my cup against my body so I can talk with my hands, and I’ll maneuver and pick it up and everyone thinks it’s so intriguing,” he said. “But I’m just doing what I’m doing to survive.”1329 2012-01-31 Such small differences might influence the rankings, and the deception underscores the importance those rankings have taken on, as colleges fret over the loss of even a notch or two against their competitors.Robert Franek, the senior vice president of publishing for The Princeton Review, which provides preparation for the SAT and also ranks colleges, said that he had never heard of a college intentionally reporting incorrect data.“We want to put out very clear information so that students can make an informed decision about their school,” Mr. Franek said. “I feel like so many schools have a very clear obligation to college-bound students to report this information honestly.”The Princeton Review bases its college rankings on student opinion rather than test data, Mr. Franek said, so he was uncertain whether a change as small as that reported would make a difference.“It’s hard for me to say, but that is a small percentage,” Mr. Franek said. “That is a pretty mild difference in a point score. That said, 10 points, 30 points to a student that isn’t getting that score on the SAT could be an important distinction.”Claremont McKenna, a liberal arts school with about 1,200 students and a strong focus on political science and economics, is part of the Claremont colleges cluster east of Los Angeles. Long considered a good school, in the last generation it has moved into the elite ranks — at least as measured by the most-popular ratings.The current U.S. News rankings list Claremont McKenna as the ninth-best liberal arts college in the country, a fact noted on Ms. Gann’s biography on the college’s Web site. The Princeton Review gives the college an academic rating of 97 out of 99 and an admissions selectivity rating of 96 out of 99, comparable to some Ivy League schools. It remains to be seen whether the revelation of falsified test scores changes that status.Ms. Gann wrote in her message that she was first warned of inaccurate reporting this month and asked other administrators to investigate, leading to an administrator’s admission of guilt and Monday’s announcement.“At this time, we have no reason to believe that other individuals were involved,” she wrote. “As an institution of higher education with a deep and consistent commitment to the integrity of all our academic activities, and particularly our reporting of institutional data, we take this situation very seriously.”She added that the college has alerted the publishers of college rankings and has hired the law firm O’Melveny & Myers to investigate further.1330 2012-01-31 Drones are increasingly small, affordable and available to nonmilitary buyers. For hundreds of thousands of dollars — no longer many millions — a surveillance drone could be flying over protests and clashes in Syria.An environmental group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, has reported that it is using drones to monitor illegal Japanese whaling in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere. In the past few years, human-rights groups and the actor and activist George Clooney, among others, have purchased satellite imagery of conflict zones. Drones can see even more clearly, and broadcast in real time.We could record the repression in Syria with unprecedented precision and scope. The better the evidence, the clearer the crimes, the higher the likelihood that the world would become as outraged as it should be.This sounds a lot like surveillance, and it would be. It would violate Syrian airspace, and perhaps a number of Syrian and international laws. It isn’t the kind of thing nongovernmental organizations usually do. But it is very different from what governments and armies do. Yes, we (like them) have an agenda, but ours is transparent: human rights. We have a duty, recognized internationally, to monitor governments that massacre their own people in large numbers. Human rights organizations have always done this. Why not get drones to assist the good work?It may be illegal in the Syrian government’s eyes, but supporting Nelson Mandela in South Africa was deemed illegal during the apartheid era. To fly over Syria’s territory may violate official norms of international relations, but governments do this when they support opposition groups with weapons, money or intelligence, as NATO countries did recently in Libya. In any event, violations of Syrian sovereignty would be the direct consequence of the Syrian state’s brutality, not the imperialism of outsiders.There are some obvious risks and downsides to the drone approach. The Syrian government would undoubtedly seize the opportunity to blame a foreign conspiracy for its troubles. Local operators of the drones could be at risk, though a higher-end drone could be controlled from a remote location or a neighboring country.Such considerations figured in conversations we have had with human rights organizations that considered hiring drones in Syria, but opted in the end for supplying protesters with phones, satellite modems and safe houses. For nearly a year now, brave amateurs with their tiny cameras arguably have been doing the trick in Syria. In those circumstances, the value that a drone could add might not be worth the investment and risks.Even if humanitarian drones are not used in Syria, they should assume their place in the arsenal of human rights advocates. It is a precedent worth setting, especially in situations where evidence of large-scale human rights violations is hard to come by.Drones can reach places and see things cell phones cannot. Social media did not document the worst of the genocide in the remote villages of Darfur in 2003 and 2004. Camera-toting protesters could not enter the fields where 8,000 men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica in 1995. Graphic and detailed evidence of crimes against humanity does not guarantee a just response, but it helps.If human rights organizations can spy on evil, they should.1331 2012-01-31 DETROIT — A Japanese auto supplier, the Yazaki Corporation, agreed to pay one of the largest ever antitrust fines, and four of its executives will serve up to two years in prison for price-fixing and bid-rigging, the Justice Department said Monday.Yazaki, based in Tokyo, agreed to a $470 million fine for engaging in three conspiracies that began as long ago as 2000 and continued until 2010, when the government’s investigation into the matter began. The executives who pleaded guilty were Japanese nationals who worked in Ohio and Kentucky overseeing sales of parts used by Honda and Toyota.Another Japanese supplier, the Denso Corporation, based in Kariya, agreed to pay a $78 million fine to settle two price-fixing and bid-rigging charges.“This criminal activity has a significant impact on the automotive manufacturers in the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe and had been occurring at least a decade,” Andrew G. Arena, special agent in charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s office in Detroit, said in a statement. “The conduct had also affected commerce on a global scale in almost every market where automobiles are manufactured and/or sold.”In documents filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, in Detroit, the Justice Department said Yazaki, Denso, the four executives and unnamed co-conspirators inflated prices on automotive electrical components. They allocated the supply of certain parts on a model-by-model basis and coordinated price adjustments for parts that automakers in the United States and elsewhere requested, the government said.1332 2012-01-31 The bill states that members and employees of Congress are not exempt from the federal law and regulations that ban insider trading.“No member of Congress and no employee of Congress shall use any nonpublic information derived from the individual’s position as a member of Congress or employee of Congress, or gained from performance of the individual’s duties, for personal benefit,” the bill says.Federal securities law does not explicitly exempt members of Congress, but experts disagree on whether and when lawmakers may be found to have violated the law. The bill is meant to eliminate any ambiguity.It says that lawmakers have “a duty arising from a relationship of trust and confidence” to Congress, the federal government and the citizens of the — a duty they violate by trading on nonpublic information.The bill also requires members of Congress to disclose the purchase or sale of stocks, bonds, commodities futures and other forms of securities within 30 days of transactions. The information would be posted on the Web in a searchable format.In his speech last week, Mr. Obama urged Congress to act, citing what he called “the corrosive influence of money in politics.”“Send me a bill that bans insider trading by members of Congress,” Mr. Obama said. “I will sign it.”The Senate was already writing such a bill. However, the bill does not subject lawmakers to a second type of restriction suggested by Mr. Obama, who said Congress should “limit any elected official from owning stocks in industries they impact.”From talking to other lawmakers, executive branch officials and business executives, members of Congress learn potentially valuable information about military contracts, economic policy and myriad federal programs before the information becomes public. In addition, they can write spending bills in ways that, for example, benefit their own real estate .The bill — the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act, or Stock Act — was drafted by Senator , independent of , and Senator , Republican of . Similar bills were introduced by Ms. Gillibrand and Senator , Republican of .“This is a measure that the American people are clamoring for,” Mr. Brown said Monday. “We need to re-establish trust with the American people, and this is a first step in doing that.”In the House, more than 250 lawmakers, including at least 90 Republicans, have signed up as co-sponsors of a similar bill. Laena Fallon, a spokeswoman for the House Republican leader, Representative of , said he “plans to move an expanded version of the Stock Act through the House in February.”Senior House Republicans said they wanted to expand the bill to prohibit lawmakers from using nonpublic information in real estate transactions as well as stock trades.Representative , Democrat of New York, who has been pushing such legislation since 2006, urged House Republican leaders to stop their “continued stalling.”Academic studies have come to different conclusions about whether members of Congress have higher investment returns than ordinary investors.Senator , Democrat of , introduced the bill codifying the principle that the top earners should pay at least the tax rate of middle-class workers.Mr. Whitehouse said he might press his legislation as a stand-alone bill or try to attach it to other legislation.“In theory,” Mr. Whitehouse said, “we have a progressive tax code in which the more successful you are, the more money you make, the greater rate you pay in taxation. Unfortunately what turns out to be the fact, in practice, is that you have these huge exceptions.”Mr. Whitehouse noted that the billionaire investor had often asserted that he pays a lower percentage of his income in taxes than his secretary does.The bill, following the rough contours suggested by Mr. Obama, creates what would be an for the most affluent.Households with adjusted annual gross incomes over $1 million would prepare their taxes as they do now, with all the deductions, credits and loopholes intact. They would also calculate what 30 percent of their adjusted gross income amounts to. They would then pay whichever amount was larger.Republicans showed no sign of coming to the table on the Buffett Rule legislation. Senator of , the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said he had breakfast with Mr. Buffett on Sunday, but rejected his personal entreaties. He cited an estimate by the liberal-leaning Citizens for Tax Justice that the proposal would raise $50 billion a year, a small percentage of a budget deficit that will probably top $1 trillion.1333 2012-01-31 At the end of last year, many foreign investors were dismayed that the government quickly put off its decision to allow foreign retailers like Walmart to take a 51 percent stake in Indian retailing stores because of protests by opposition political parties and small retailers and wholesalers. It is unlikely that the government will reconsider that proposal before elections in five states conclude in March.This month, policy makers put in place a related decision to allow retailers like Starbucks that sell only one brand of products to set up wholly owned stores in the country. But some foreign chains like Ikea have said that a condition that requires retailers to buy 30 percent of their products from artisans and small Indian companies would make it difficult for them to take advantage of the decision.India’s finance minister, Pranab Mukherjee, spent the last two days in Chicago trying to reassure investors and companies that India was committed to opening up its economy to outsiders. “India presents opportunity at this moment that cannot be ignored,” Mr. Mukherjee said at the Chicago Council of Global Affairs on Sunday. “I urge you to seize this moment and contribute to our collective prosperity in the times to come.”India, long a country of tea drinkers, has experienced an explosion in cafes and restaurants over the last decade because of its growing middle class and a large youth population.John Culver, the president of Starbucks in Asia, said it was the market growth that had persuaded the company to finally commit to India after considering it for nearly a decade.“We are going to move as fast as we possibly can to take advantage of the opportunity that exists in India,” he said during an interview. “It’s an economy that is moving very quickly, and the consumer is evolving very quickly.”Mr. Culver suggested that Starbucks would not compete directly with Indian coffee chains because it would sell premium coffee, tea and food in its Indian stores. He declined to say how its prices in India would compare with other Indian chains and with its American and European outlets. Most Indian coffee chains sell beverages at far lower prices than their counterparts in the West. A small cappuccino typically costs 53 rupees, or $1, at Café Coffee Day, the country’s largest cafe chain.While several foreign coffee players, like Lavazza of Italy and the California-based chain Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, have outlets in India, the national market is dominated by Café Coffee Day, which is owned by a coffee-growing and trading firm based in Bangalore.With more than 1,200 stores, Café Coffee Day has a ubiquitous presence and is especially popular with the country’s youth, many of whom appear to prefer its large selection of cold, sweet milkshakes, teas and other beverages to traditional coffee. An executive with the company said it planned to have 2,000 stores by the end of 2014.“We will hopefully learn a few things from them,” the executive, K. Ramakrishnan, president of marketing for Café Coffee Day, said about Starbucks. “That apart, it’s business as usual for us. We continue our expansion story.”For Tata, the venture with Starbucks serves as a second chance at creating a national cafe chain. It earlier had a minority stake in Barista, a chain now controlled by Lavazza. R. K. Krishnakumar, the vice chairman of Tata Global Beverages, said the company left that venture when two of its partners started fighting with each other.Mr. Krishnakumar said that while Starbucks was “cautious and careful” in setting and announcing goals, it could easily have 3,000 stores in India.1334 2012-01-31 Wall Street stock indexes recovered from steep losses on Monday, but still closed lower, as a spike in Portuguese bond yields and the still-unresolved Greek debt talks raised investors' fears that the European and global economies face greater risks.A rise in the yield on Portuguese government bonds to more than 17 percent, the highest level since the launch of the euro, sparked fears that Lisbon will follow in Greece's footsteps and require a second bailout.And a European Union summit that was to focus on reviving growth and creating jobs failed to deliver the hoped-for message of optimism as Greece and its private bondholders continued to struggle to reach a deal.""Until this deal is actually done, there are going to be concerns. The longer it takes there is more suspicion that there is something wrong,"" said Michael Yoshikami, chief investment strategist at YCMNet Advisors in Walnut Creek, Calif. ""They've been saying they're on the verge of a deal for a long time.""The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 0.1 percent, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.2 percent.1335 2012-01-31 New rules to limit pollution from ships are set to start moving through the European Parliament on Tuesday, with the specter of potential environmental contamination from a stricken cruise ship lending momentum to the debate.     While the legisla...1336 2012-01-31 As evidence of his conservative credentials, Mr. Gingrich appeared Monday with Michael Reagan, a son of President , and , whose presidential campaign first gained ground in Florida before he dropped out of the race.Mr. Reagan framed the choice for Florida voters as a struggle for the soul of the , similar to the one his father fought in the 1960s and ’70s. “That is the battle we are having today, between the Rockefeller Republicans and a true Reagan conservative Republican,” Mr. Reagan said.Mr. Gingrich spent much of the day aloft, flying from to , , and Orlando.Mr. Romney’s pace was more leisurely, with just three events, befitting a candidate with a double-digit lead in some polls.“With a turnout like this, I’m beginning to feel we might win tomorrow,” he told the crowd in Dunedin before offering an even more confident assessment: “So the people here in Florida said, ‘We’re not going to get behind Newt Gingrich, we’re going to get behind Mitt Romney.’ And I want to say thank you to you, for your help.”A Quinnipiac poll of likely Republican primary voters released Monday morning showed Mr. Romney with a 14-point lead over Mr. Gingrich.But Mr. Gingrich’s campaign manager, Jose Mallea, said volunteers were making 100,000 phone calls to voters in the final two days of the race. “I think we’re in good shape,” he said. “I think on Election Day the intensity of our voters is going to be significantly better than theirs.”Seeking to motivate activists at an airplane hangar in Tampa, Mr. Gingrich mentioned a “brand-new poll” showing him and Mr. Romney in a tie. But he was mistaken. The poll, his campaign later confirmed, was by The News-Press of Fort Myers and others, was published Saturday and was based on surveys taken the three days before a debate on Thursday that began to turn the tide toward Mr. Romney.Both candidates were already looking past Florida, which Mr. Gingrich once predicted he would win if he won South Carolina.Amid signs that his campaign was running out of money — Mr. Gingrich told Bloomberg News over the weekend that he had only $600,000 on hand — he vowed to stay in the race, citing national polls showing a close two-man race.But the Romney campaign sought to knock him off even that pedestal. “I think it’s hard for Newt to characterize this as a two-person race between him and Mitt given the calendar ahead,” said Eric Fehrnstrom, a top Romney strategist.And in the next contests, caucuses in and on Saturday and then in and on Feb. 7, the Romney campaign identifies Representative of as an equal or greater threat. Mr. Paul skipped campaigning in Florida to concentrate elsewhere. , who is vying for the same conservative voters as Mr. Gingrich, left Florida over the weekend and spent Monday campaigning in the Midwest.Mr. Gingrich planned to head to Nevada on Wednesday and remain until the voting; Mr. Romney planned stops in Colorado and Minnesota.1337 2012-01-31 Such small differences might influence the rankings, and the deception underscores the importance those rankings have taken on, as colleges fret over the loss of even a notch or two against their competitors.Robert Franek, the senior vice president of publishing for The Princeton Review, which provides preparation for the SAT and also ranks colleges, said that he had never heard of a college intentionally reporting incorrect data.“We want to put out very clear information so that students can make an informed decision about their school,” Mr. Franek said. “I feel like so many schools have a very clear obligation to college-bound students to report this information honestly.”The Princeton Review bases its college rankings on student opinion rather than test data, Mr. Franek said, so he was uncertain whether a change as small as that reported would make a difference.“It’s hard for me to say, but that is a small percentage,” Mr. Franek said. “That is a pretty mild difference in a point score. That said, 10 points, 30 points to a student that isn’t getting that score on the SAT could be an important distinction.”Claremont McKenna, a liberal arts school with about 1,200 students and a strong focus on political science and economics, is part of the Claremont colleges cluster east of Los Angeles. Long considered a good school, in the last generation it has moved into the elite ranks — at least as measured by the most-popular ratings.The current U.S. News rankings list Claremont McKenna as the ninth-best liberal arts college in the country, a fact noted on Ms. Gann’s biography on the college’s Web site. The Princeton Review gives the college an academic rating of 97 out of 99 and an admissions selectivity rating of 96 out of 99, comparable to some Ivy League schools. It remains to be seen whether the revelation of falsified test scores changes that status.Ms. Gann wrote in her message that she was first warned of inaccurate reporting this month and asked other administrators to investigate, leading to an administrator’s admission of guilt and Monday’s announcement.“At this time, we have no reason to believe that other individuals were involved,” she wrote. “As an institution of higher education with a deep and consistent commitment to the integrity of all our academic activities, and particularly our reporting of institutional data, we take this situation very seriously.”She added that the college has alerted the publishers of college rankings and has hired the law firm O’Melveny & Myers to investigate further.1338 2012-01-31 At the end of last year, many foreign investors were dismayed that the government quickly put off its decision to allow foreign retailers like Walmart to take a 51 percent stake in Indian retailing stores because of protests by opposition political parties and small retailers and wholesalers.

For hundreds of thousands of dollars — no longer many millions — a surveillance drone could be flying over protests and clashes in Syria.An environmental group, the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, has reported that it is using drones to monitor illegal Japanese whaling in the waters of the Southern Hemisphere. In the past few years, human-rights groups and the actor and activist George Clooney, among others, have purchased satellite imagery of conflict zones. Drones can see even more clearly, and broadcast in real time.We could record the repression in Syria with unprecedented precision and scope. The better the evidence, the clearer the crimes, the higher the likelihood that the world would become as outraged as it should be.This sounds a lot like surveillance, and it would be. It would violate Syrian airspace, and perhaps a number of Syrian and international laws. It isn’t the kind of thing nongovernmental organizations usually do. But it is very different from what governments and armies do. Yes, we (like them) have an agenda, but ours is transparent: human rights. We have a duty, recognized internationally, to monitor governments that massacre their own people in large numbers. Human rights organizations have always done this. Why not get drones to assist the good work?It may be illegal in the Syrian government’s eyes, but supporting Nelson Mandela in South Africa was deemed illegal during the apartheid era. To fly over Syria’s territory may violate official norms of international relations, but governments do this when they support opposition groups with weapons, money or intelligence, as NATO countries did recently in Libya. In any event, violations of Syrian sovereignty would be the direct consequence of the Syrian state’s brutality, not the imperialism of outsiders.There are some obvious risks and downsides to the drone approach. The Syrian government would undoubtedly seize the opportunity to blame a foreign conspiracy for its troubles. Local operators of the drones could be at risk, though a higher-end drone could be controlled from a remote location or a neighboring country.Such considerations figured in conversations we have had with human rights organizations that considered hiring drones in Syria, but opted in the end for supplying protesters with phones, satellite modems and safe houses. For nearly a year now, brave amateurs with their tiny cameras arguably have been doing the trick in Syria. In those circumstances, the value that a drone could add might not be worth the investment and risks.Even if humanitarian drones are not used in Syria, they should assume their place in the arsenal of human rights advocates. It is a precedent worth setting, especially in situations where evidence of large-scale human rights violations is hard to come by.Drones can reach places and see things cell phones cannot. Social media did not document the worst of the genocide in the remote villages of Darfur in 2003 and 2004. Camera-toting protesters could not enter the fields where 8,000 men and boys were massacred in Srebrenica in 1995. Graphic and detailed evidence of crimes against humanity does not guarantee a just response, but it helps.If human rights organizations can spy on evil, they should.1340 2012-01-31 About one in 15 Americans is infected with oral human papillomavirus, a sexually transmitted virus that causes throat cancers, and the disease is especially common among men, new research shows.

The executives who pleaded guilty were Japanese nationals who worked in Ohio and Kentucky overseeing sales of parts used by Honda and Toyota.Another Japanese supplier, the Denso Corporation, based in Kariya, agreed to pay a $78 million fine to settle two price-fixing and bid-rigging charges.“This criminal activity has a significant impact on the automotive manufacturers in the United States, Canada, Japan and Europe and had been occurring at least a decade,” Andrew G.
