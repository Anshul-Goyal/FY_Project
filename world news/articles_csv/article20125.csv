"'12-05-01,'1','“Clouds really are the biggest uncertainty,” said Andrew E. Dessler, a climate researcher at A&M. “If you listen to the credible climate skeptics, they’ve really pushed all their chips onto clouds.”Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at the , is the leading proponent of the view that clouds will save the day. His stature in the field — he has been making seminal contributions to climate science since the 1960s — has amplified his influence.Dr. Lindzen says the earth is not especially sensitive to greenhouse gases because clouds will react to counter them, and he believes he has identified a specific mechanism. On a warming planet, he says, less coverage by high clouds in the tropics will allow more heat to escape to space, countering the temperature increase.His idea has drawn withering criticism from other scientists, who cite errors in his papers and say proof is lacking. Enough evidence is already in hand, they say, to rule out the powerful cooling effect from clouds that would be needed to offset the increase of greenhouse gases.However, politicians looking for reasons not to tackle climate change have embraced Dr. Lindzen and other skeptics, elevating their role in the public debate.Dr. Lindzen has obliged by assuring them that they are running no risks by refusing to enact emission limits. “There’s been a lot of scare stuff put out that just doesn’t make sense,” he said in an interview.Some politicians have welcomed that message, regularly calling Dr. Lindzen and a handful of other contrarian scientists before Congressional committees. During a hearing before a House subcommittee, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican and vocal global warming skeptic, complained that “in the scientific community, there are people trying to tell us that we have got to accept draconian changes in our way of life mandated by law because the CO2 that we are emitting is going to cause drastic consequences to the planet’s climate.”He repeatedly sought affirmation from Dr. Lindzen for his views, and got it.At gatherings of climate change skeptics on both sides of the Atlantic, Dr. Lindzen has been treated as a star. During a debate in over carbon , his work was cited repeatedly. When he appears at conferences of the Heartland Institute, the primary American organization pushing climate change skepticism, he is greeted by thunderous applause.While the scientific majority acknowledges that the lingering uncertainty about clouds plays into the hands of skeptics like Dr. Lindzen, they say that he has gone beyond any reasonable reading of the evidence to provide a dangerous alibi for inaction.Dr. Lindzen is “feeding upon an audience that wants to hear a certain message, and wants to hear it put forth by people with enough scientific reputation that it can be sustained for a while, even if it’s wrong science,” said Christopher S. Bretherton, an atmospheric researcher at the . “I don’t think it’s intellectually honest at all.”With climate policy nearly paralyzed in the , many other governments have also declined to take action, and worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases are soaring.Clouds are so familiar they are easy to take for granted, but scientists point out that they have an enormous effect on the climate.The energy that drives life on earth arrives as sunlight. To remain at a steady temperature, the earth has to return the energy it receives back to space, primarily as heat. Clouds alter the energy flow in both directions.On balance, in today’s climate, clouds cool the earth. Dense, low-lying clouds are responsible for most of that effect, because they reflect considerable sunlight back to space. Many high, thin clouds have the opposite influence, allowing incoming sunshine to pass through but effectively trapping heat that is trying to escape.“It’s like putting a lid on a pot on the stove,” said Andreas Muhlbauer, a cloud researcher at the University of Washington.Humans are perturbing the earth’s heat balance by releasing greenhouse gases. Chemists proved in the 19th century that these gases, especially the carbon dioxide that results from burning fossil fuels, work like an invisible blanket in the atmosphere, blocking some heat that is attempting to escape to space. In the mid-20th century, as it became clear how fast carbon dioxide levels were rising, some scientists began to predict a warming of the planet. But they also realized that an exact forecast was difficult for several reasons, especially the question of how clouds would react.Researchers are virtually certain the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will rise with temperature, and evidence suggests this is already happening. But that does not say much about the type or location of clouds that will condense from the vapor.Scientists use sophisticated computer programs to forecast future climate, but the computers are not yet powerful enough to predict the behavior of individual clouds across the whole earth over a century, which forces the researchers to use rough approximations.The most elaborate computer programs have agreed on a broad conclusion: clouds are not likely to change enough to offset the bulk of the human-caused warming. Some of the analyses predict that clouds could actually amplify the warming trend sharply through several mechanisms, including a reduction of some of the low clouds that reflect a lot of sunlight back to space. Other computer analyses foresee a largely neutral effect. The result is a big spread in forecasts of future temperature, one that scientists have not been able to narrow much in 30 years of effort.The earth’s surface has already warmed about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, most of that in the last 40 years. Modest as it sounds, it is an average for the whole planet, representing an enormous addition of heat. An even larger amount is being absorbed by the oceans. The increase has caused some of the world’s land ice to melt and the oceans to rise.By midcentury, the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is expected to double compared with the value that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution. At the low end, computers predict that the earth could warm in response by another 2 degrees Fahrenheit. The likelier figure, the analyses say, is 4 degrees. At the high end of projections, the warming could exceed 8 degrees. In all possible outcomes, the warming over land would be roughly twice the global average, and the warming in the greater still.Even in the low projection, many scientists say, the damage could be substantial. In the high projection, some polar regions could heat up by 20 or 25 degrees Fahrenheit — more than enough, over centuries or longer, to melt the ice sheet, raising sea level by a catastrophic 20 feet or more. Vast changes in  rainfall, heat waves and other weather patterns would most likely accompany such a large warming.“The big damages come if the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases turns out to be high,” said Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, a climate scientist at the . “Then it’s not a bullet headed at us, but a thermonuclear warhead.”A major goal of climate research is to improve the way clouds are represented in the computer analyses, which should narrow the range of predicted temperatures. And some of the most important data that researchers need to do so are streaming from a hilltop in rural , near the town of Lamont, where the Department of Energy runs the world’s largest facility for measuring the behavior of clouds.Accuracy is an overriding goal there. One recent morning, Patrick Dowell, a technician, worked his way across the hill with a rag in hand, carefully dusting dozens of instruments pointed at the sky. When his fingers knocked one gauge off kilter, tiny motors whirred and the device snapped back to position, as though annoyed with him.“When you clean it,” Mr. Dowell said, “it kind of fights you.”The questions that scientists still need to answer are voluminous. For instance, they want a better idea of how clouds form at a microscopic scale, how their behavior varies under different atmospheric conditions, and how sensitive they are to higher temperatures.Recently, $30 million worth of new radars have been installed in Oklahoma and at other research facilities, promising a better view of the innards of clouds. Satellites are also supplying better data, and theories of the atmosphere are improving. “I feel like we’re on our way to doing a lot better,” said Anthony D. Del Genio, a researcher with .But the problem of how clouds will behave in a future climate is not yet solved — making the unheralded field of cloud research one of the most important pursuits of modern science.Among the many climate skeptics who plaster the Internet with their writings, hardly any have serious credentials in the physics of the atmosphere. But a handful of contrarian scientists do. The most influential is Dr. Lindzen.Dr. Lindzen accepts the elementary tenets of climate science. He agrees that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, calling people who dispute that point “nutty.” He agrees that the level of it is rising because of human activity and that this should warm the climate.But for more than a decade, Dr. Lindzen has said that when surface temperature increases, the columns of moist air rising in the tropics will rain out more of their moisture, leaving less available to be thrown off as ice, which forms the thin, high clouds known as cirrus. Just like greenhouse gases, these cirrus clouds act to reduce the cooling of the earth, and a decrease of them would counteract the increase of greenhouse gases.Dr. Lindzen calls his mechanism the iris effect, after the iris of the eye, which opens at night to let in more light. In this case, the earth’s “iris” of high clouds would be opening to let more heat escape.When Dr. Lindzen first published this theory, in 2001, he said it was supported by satellite records over the Pacific Ocean. But other researchers quickly published work saying that the methods he had used to analyze the data were flawed and that his theory made assumptions that were inconsistent with known facts. Using what they considered more realistic assumptions, they said they could not verify his claims.Today, most mainstream researchers consider Dr. Lindzen’s theory discredited. He does not agree, but he has had difficulty establishing his case in the scientific literature. Dr. Lindzen published a paper in 2009 offering more support for his case that the earth’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases is low, but once again scientists identified errors, including a failure to account for known inaccuracies in satellite measurements.Dr. Lindzen acknowledged that the 2009 paper contained “some stupid mistakes” in his handling of the satellite data. “It was just embarrassing,” he said in an interview. “The technical details of satellite measurements are really sort of grotesque.”Last year, he tried offering more evidence for his case, but after reviewers for a prestigious American journal criticized the paper, Dr. Lindzen published it in a little-known Korean journal.Dr. Lindzen blames groupthink among climate scientists for his publication difficulties, saying the majority is determined to suppress any dissenting views. They, in turn, contend that he routinely misrepresents the work of other researchers.“If I’m right, we’ll have saved money” by avoiding measures to limit emissions, Dr. Lindzen said in the interview. “If I’m wrong, we’ll know it in 50 years and can do something.”But mainstream scientists counter that society’s impulse to wait only heightens the risks.Ultimately, as the climate continues warming and more data accumulate, it will become obvious how clouds are reacting. But that could take decades, scientists say, and if the answer turns out to be that catastrophe looms, it would most likely be too late. By then, they say, the atmosphere would contain so much carbon dioxide as to make a substantial warming inevitable, and the gas would not return to a normal level for thousands of years.Researchers are trying various shortcuts to get a rapid answer. One of those is to use short-term natural variations, such as the El Niño cycle, to see how clouds react to higher ocean temperatures. Dr. Dessler, the researcher, did that recently. His analysis, while not definitive, offered some evidence that clouds will exacerbate the long-term planetary warming, just as many of the computer programs have predicted. Most, but not all, papers relying on the historical cloud record have come to similar conclusions.In his Congressional appearances, speeches and popular writings, Dr. Lindzen offers little hint of how thin the published science supporting his position is. Instead, starting from his disputed iris mechanism, he makes what many of his colleagues see as an unwarranted leap of logic, professing near-certainty that climate change is not a problem society needs to worry about.“You have politicians who are being told if they question this, they are anti-science,” Dr. Lindzen said. “We are trying to tell them, no, questioning is never anti-science.”Among the experts most offended by Dr. Lindzen’s stance are many of his colleagues in the M.I.T. atmospheric sciences department, some of whom were once as skeptical as he about climate change.“Even if there were no political implications, it just seems deeply unprofessional and irresponsible to look at this and say, ‘We’re sure it’s not a problem,’ ” said Kerry A. Emanuel, another M.I.T. scientist. “It’s a special kind of risk, because it’s a risk to the collective civilization.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','Ovechkin’s goal came four seconds after a strict call against Brad Richards. The referees Stephen Walkom and Dan O’Halloran, who had made other debatable calls that worked in the Rangers’ favor, sent Richards off for holding after Capitals defenseman John Carlson crossed in front of him at the Rangers’ blue line and fell.“He just came across right in front of me,” Richards said. “I just put my hand up there — can’t have my hand up there.”Nicklas Backstrom won the ensuing face-off, directing the puck to Ovechkin, whose drive beat Lundqvist cleanly.“First I saw it, then I didn’t see it, and then I saw it,” said Lundqvist, who finished with 22 saves. “It was a hard shot, a good shot. Unfortunately someone got tied up, and he got a free lane. It’s the wrong guy to get that opportunity.”The Rangers almost forced overtime with 50 seconds remaining when Del Zotto took a shot from the blue line that nicked a Washington stick and hit the crossbar behind the rookie goaltender Braden Holtby. Earlier in the period, he hit a goal post.“You look at the difference in the two games,” Holtby said. “We hit two posts last game, and they hit two this game. That’s how close it is. The hockey gods were on our side tonight.”Trailing by 2-1 in the third period, the Rangers tied the score on a power play when a shot by Del Zotto deflected off a Washington stick and Callahan’s leg at 6:58.Del Zotto had a productive night, finishing with two assists and a game-high 13 shot attempts, 4 of which hit the net.After learning the hard way in Game 1, when a long pass from Derek Stepan to Chris Kreider led to the decisive Rangers goal, the Capitals blocked lanes and kept defenders in the neutral zone. That eliminated the effectiveness of stretch passes to the Rangers’ fast forwards.“With the Rangers having those quick young guys, we can’t allow any more stretch passes,” Washington right wing Troy Brouwer said before the game. “If we can take those away them, we should have a better result.”The Rangers’ only breakaway came when Kreider, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, emerged from the penalty box late in the first period after serving a team bench minor.Holtby made the stop at 17:03 — one of 26 — and the Capitals immediately broke the other way. Lundqvist tried to play the puck along the end boards, but the speedy winger Jason Chimera barged in and took it away. He passed it to the front of the empty Rangers net, where Matt Hendricks backhanded it between his legs. In a momentary scramble, Chimera touched it again and Ryan McDonagh wound up kicking it into his own net at 17:14 for a 2-0 Washington lead. Chimera was credited the goal, his third in three playoff games at the Garden.The Rangers got back into the game, with help from some odd refereeing by O’Halloran and Walkom. Capitals defenseman Carlson was slashed by Staal after the whistle, but was given a minor penalty along with Staal.On the subsequent four on four, Del Zotto and Gaborik made beautiful passes that allowed Richards to direct the puck home at 19:17, halving the deficit.The Rangers clawed back to 2-2, but Ovechkin’s winner negated the comeback.“All year we responded to losses,” Callahan said. “It’s a tough place to play in Washington. We’re going to have to be ready.”Brian Boyle returned Monday after sustaining a concussion in Game 5 of the Ottawa series. He played 15:20 and was credited with six body checks.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','“The ‘C-word’ in American journalism is Conspiracy,” writes Edward Jay Epstein in his short, new e-book, “Three Days in May,” about l’affaire .By the time we reach this sentence, toward the end, Epstein has taken us — practically moment by moment — through the series of events that culminated with D.S.K.’s arrest for allegedly forcing himself sexually on a hotel maid in . The charges were later dropped when prosecutors concluded that, even though the assault likely took place, the maid’s credibility was a problem. Still, Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign as the managing director of the . And his political career — he was the favorite to challenge President of in the election that will be decided on Sunday — was destroyed.The day before the alleged assault, Epstein writes, Strauss-Kahn had participated in a sex party in . He then flew to New York and got a room at the , whose parent company employed an executive close to Sarkozy’s intelligence coordinator, according to Epstein. After dinner, D.S.K. returned to the hotel with a woman who was seen exiting the ground-floor elevator at 3:56 a.m. Whenever he was visible on one of the hotel’s security cameras, a certain hotel executive could also be seen. Coincidence? Or was Strauss-Kahn being followed?The actions of the 32-year-old maid, Nafissatou Diallo, the next day added to the mystery. Several times she went in and out of a certain room on D.S.K.’s floor. She entered his suite twice without her cleaning equipment. After the alleged assault, D.S.K. left the hotel to have lunch with his daughter — while Diallo inexplicably re-entered his suite.It then took an hour for hotel security and Diallo to report the assault to the police. A few minutes after the call was made, two hotel officials were caught on camera doing a brief “victory dance.” (Epstein has included the hotel videos as part of his e-book.) When D.S.K. later realized that one of his cellphones was missing — a phone, Epstein notes ominously, that has never been found and whose GPS was turned off 23 minutes after he lost it — he called the hotel to see if it had been retrieved. That call led to his arrest.What does one make of all this? In the immediate aftermath of Strauss-Kahn’s arrest, French journalists flocked to the idea that he had somehow been set up by his enemies. But that thinking has largely faded, especially after it was revealed that D.S.K. had been involved in sex parties that included prostitutes and that were paid for by wealthy businessmen friends of his. The Washington orgy he attended the night before his alleged assault was part of that ring; it has since morphed into a bona fide scandal, and D.S.K. is once again in trouble with the law thanks to his sexual appetite.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','New Yorkers have been trying to describe the color of the new taxis for the outer boroughs. Mayor Michael Bloomberg says it’s “apple green.” David Yassky, the taxi and limousine commissioner, calls it mint, instead of Shrek or bile or sea-foam green.This light-ish, lime-ish green, as it turned out, was about the only color left for official city vehicles. Red is best for firetrucks; blue is mostly reserved for the police. Orange wouldn’t work because, as Mr. Yassky explained, it is hard to get an orange that doesn’t look like yellow in some light. Black is mostly for limos and hearses. Forget white or gray; those are the favorite colors for private vehicles (which could cause confusion). So green it is.The first of these 18,000 cabs should start appearing on the streets in June. Under an agreement worked out in Albany last year, the new cabs will not be allowed to pick up customers in most of Manhattan or at the city airports. Those areas will be exclusively yellow cab territory for pickups. If the city moves rapidly, up to 6,000 of the new verdurous taxis will be on the streets by the end of the year, with 20 percent of them outfitted especially for the disabled.The green taxis are still controversial in the yellow cab world. The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the yellow cab industry, has filed suit arguing that their million-dollar medallions give them the exclusive right to operate in the city. The problem is that they can’t be easily found everywhere (just ask anybody in the Bronx or Queens). For millions of New Yorkers outside Manhattan, the green cabs will be a welcome sight.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','The electrical shock delivered to the chest by a Taser can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death, according to a new study, although it is unknown how frequently such deaths occur.The study, which analyzed detailed records from the cases of eight people who went into cardiac arrest after receiving shocks from a Taser X26 fired at a distance, is likely to add to the debate about the safety of the weapons. Seven of the people in the study died; one survived.Advocacy groups like Amnesty International have argued that Tasers, the most widely used of a class of weapons known as electrical control devices, are potentially lethal and that stricter rules should govern their use.But proponents maintain that the devices — which are used by more than 16,700 law enforcement agencies in 107 countries, said Steve Tuttle, a spokesman for Taser — pose less risk to civilians than firearms and are safer for police officers than physically tackling a suspect. The results of studies of the devices’ safety in humans have been mixed.Medical experts said on Monday that the new report, published online on Monday in the journal Circulation, makes clear that electrical shocks from Tasers, which shoot barbs into the clothes and skin, can in some cases set off irregular heart rhythms, leading to cardiac arrest.“This is no longer arguable,” said Dr. Byron Lee, a cardiologist and director of the electrophysiology laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco. “This is a scientific fact. The national debate should now center on whether the risk of sudden death with Tasers is low enough to warrant widespread use by law enforcement.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','Fred Hakim’s family owned a hole-in-the-wall hot-dog counter in Times Square that was the last of its kind when New York decided to revitalize the area in the 1990s by condemning dozens of establishments like it. It was a seven-seat, 250-square-foot piece of Edward Hopper streetscape at 229-31 West 42nd Street, which Mr. Hakim’s father had opened in 1941 and wryly named the Grand Luncheonette.Mr. Hakim (pronounced HAY-kim) tried to keep the place open as a sort of living museum of the golden age of hawkers and honky-tonks in Times Square. But the city had other ideas, and after a two-year fight, he was evicted on Oct. 19, 1997.He died on April 25 at age 83.Mr. Hakim seemed stumped by the economics of the Times Square redevelopment. In conversations with family members, and in interviews with the many reporters who crowded his joint in its last days, he often asked, “Where are the people who just want a hot dog and a knish?”Working for his father from age 13, Mr. Hakim was witness to a New Yorker’s version of the history of the world. From the counter, he saw bobby-soxers rounding the corner to swoon over Frank Sinatra at the Paramount. He watched the crowds flood the street like a dam burst on V-E Day — May 8, 1945 — which also marked the end of the wartime brownout, when the lights in Times Square — the billboards, the marquees, the windows in every building that had been dark for three years — blazed once again.He met a world of shoeshine men, longshoremen, sailors, drug dealers, prostitutes and policemen in the gritty years. “He called it a symbiotic relationship,” his son Mark said. “You depended on each other, and no one was in anybody’s business.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','For Ms. Quinn — who stalked away from a celebratory rally on the steps of City Hall because she proclaimed herself outraged that a demonstrator, in something closer to a mutter than a yell, said “Pharaoh Bloomberg” — the victory is considerable. She champions a bill she neutered, and this all-but-declared mayoral candidate takes a salute from labor leaders on her left side.Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, claims a victory, which sets him apart from the otherwise moribund grouping known as the city’s labor leadership. He pulled together a sometimes unruly coalition. But his claims that the bill is the nation’s most far-reaching measure sound far-fetched. Boston and Los Angeles have ordinances that encompass far more workers. And San Francisco’s minimum wage, covering all of its workers, now stands at $10.24.New York’s bill carries carefully devised exemptions, not the least for development on Midtown’s western flank. So the bill will apply, say, to deepest Queens but spares the vastly more profitable acreage in Midtown.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spent months humming bars from “Back in the U.S.S.R.” This reasonably subtle plutocrat appears to lose his bearings entirely on this subject. He warned that a cloud of Soviet-style centralism would descend upon the world’s financial capital. He has vowed a veto, and a court battle. “If you think about it, the last time we really had a big, managed economy was the U.S.S.R., and that didn’t work out so well,” he said.If you think about it, very little about this makes sense. The mayor, after all, has walked this path. Early in his first term, he signed a provision that extended a living wage to 50,000 home health care workers and 9,000 child care workers.This bill shines a light on New York City’s curious subsidized economy, in which some corporations hit the tax-cut daily double for no particular strategic reason other than that some other state casts a covetous eye at them. So Fresh Direct gets a $120 million tax subsidy for what still appears to be a modestly profitable business. (The mayor’s proposed tech campus on Roosevelt Island, in fairness, seems a far better example of carefully targeted city subsidies, the difference perhaps between thinking and reacting.)Business leaders grumble about the measure, although most agree that it would cost them but marginally.The Lend Lease fiasco that was disclosed by prosecutors last week, meanwhile, points to where business and Mr. Bloomberg might far more profitably concentrate their fire: Construction unions routinely demand no-show jobs, and overtime for imaginary hours. And some minority contracting firms take cuts of lucrative public contracts, for very little work in return.In the end, you can’t help wondering if all of this cacophonous debate and battle might have gone more productively toward raising the state’s minimum wage, which sits at a rock-bottom $7.25 an hour. The state’s unemployment benefits are also far lower than in, say, New Jersey.“We do not want a city for the very, very rich with enclaves for the very poor,” the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, said. In a city where less than 1 percent of the population earns more than 40 percent of the income, this is no doubt a problem. Less clear is whether giving raises to 500 workers a year much turns the dial.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Mayor Angel Taveras had been in office for two months last year when he announced that this capital city was in dire financial shape — not the Category 3 hurricane he had expected, he said at the time, but a full-on Category 5.Since then, Mr. Taveras has repeatedly said that the only way Providence can avoid bankruptcy — a fate that has already befallen one Rhode Island city, Central Falls, and threatens others — is to scale back the pension benefits granted to city retirees.On Monday, Mr. Taveras celebrated an initial victory when the Providence City Council signed off on a plan to end, for now, annual cost-of-living increases for about 3,000 retired police officers, firefighters and other employees getting city pensions. The change would save about $16 million in the 2013 fiscal year, the mayor said; cost-of-living increases would be reinstated once the retirement system is 70 percent financed, which could take well over a decade. The change would also apply to current city workers once they retire.In an interview at City Hall last week, Mr. Taveras, a first-term Democrat, said he “absolutely” expected a lawsuit to delay the freeze on cost-of-living increases for pensioners. But he said he saw no alternative for the city of 178,000 short of receivership, which would allow for a bankruptcy filing.“It could drag out,” the mayor said of the expected legal battle. “But if we can’t reform our pensions, I don’t see how we can move this city forward. You could raise taxes, but I don’t think you can raise taxes enough to cover the cost of this.”Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, and the state legislature last year scaled back pension benefits for state workers and retirees but did not address the problem of unfunded pension liability at the municipal level. Mr. Taveras estimates Providence’s liability at $900 million; freezing the cost-of-living increases, which range from 5 percent to 6 percent per year, would reduce it by $236 million, he said.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','NYSE Euronext, the operator of the New York Stock Exchange and other markets, said Monday that its first-quarter earnings tumbled 44 percent as a result of weaker trading and costs from its failed attempt to merge with Deutsche Börse.NYSE Euronext’s chief executive, Duncan L. Niederauer, said in a conference call with analysts and investors that there had been “modest improvement in economic indicators around the world, which would generally bode well for our business.”“But unfortunately, we are still waiting for signs that trading volumes will return to the levels we have witnessed in 2010 and 2011,” he said.The company’s shares fell $1.31 on Monday, or 4.8 percent, to $25.76. The shares were trading above $40 last spring.NYSE Euronext reported its net income fell to $87 million, or 34 cents a share, for the January-March period from $155 million, or 59 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slid 17 percent to $952 million from $1.15 billion in the first quarter of 2011.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','A CHILD in Mexico soon learns that corruption is a way of life, and that to get ahead in school, work and politics, “El que no transa, no avanza” — loosely, “You’re not going anywhere if you don’t cheat.”When I was in junior high school, my history teacher sold us lottery tickets, promising that the more we bought, the higher our grades would be. The winning number, he said, would coincide with the National Lottery winner. I happened to buy that number and received the highest grade, but because he kept the tickets, I never got the money.Years later, as president of an environmental activist organization called the Group of 100, I was offered visits to Las Vegas (chips provided), cars (drivers included), cash and even prostitutes in exchange for staying silent. But my most uncomfortable experience was in 1988, when I met with the secretary of Fisheries to protest the killing of dolphins by tuna fishers. He asked me, “What’s your problem?” “I don’t have any problems,” I replied. “How can I help you?” “Make the tuna fleet stop killing dolphins.” He reached for his checkbook. “Let’s talk money, how much do you want?”So the news that Walmart may have paid $24 million in bribes for permits to open stores in Mexico was no surprise to me. When President Felipe Calderón declared he was “very indignant,” I thought of Claude Rains in Casablanca: “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!”Walmart already had a history of controversial behavior in Mexico. Most notably, in November 2004, despite widespread opposition, the company opened a 72,000-square-foot store within the boundaries of the 2,000-year-old city of Teotihuacán, which features the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon (“the place where men became gods” — or consumers?). Walmart has also built a supermarket on forested land in the resort town of Playa del Carmen, in Quintana Roo — though the permit for the building later turned out to have been granted for another site, on the island of Cozumel. The question now is who allows this, and in exchange for what?'"
"'12-05-01,'1','A new advertising campaign highlights new fruit flavors of Newtons, as well as Newtons Fruit Thins, a line of crispy cookies introduced last year.“And now, another Newtonism,” begins the voiceover in one ad, which shows fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. “Never beat around the bush — you’ll just squash the berries.” The ad, for a new triple berry filling, emphasizes it is made with whole grain and closes with the tagline, “One unique cookie.”Another commercial, for a new flavor of the crispy variety, apple cinnamon oat, says, “Being the apple of someone’s eye — is easier with cinnamon.”The campaign, by McGarryBowen, part of Dentsu, was introduced on television on Monday. It is not aimed at children, to whom cookies are typically pitched, or even mothers, who typically pack their lunchboxes, but rather to baby boomers.Tim Scott, president of the Chicago office of McGarryBowen, says the campaign forgoes conventions of ads directed at children.“You see a lot of animation and characters, and kids asking for cookies and eating cookies,” Mr. Scott said of other advertising in the category. “We thought, let’s stay away from cute, let’s stay away from silly and let’s do something a little more cerebral, a little more adult.”Newtons spent $14.8 million on advertising in 2011, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.First produced by a bakery in Cambridge, Mass., in 1891, the cookies are named for Newton, another city that borders Boston.In 2010, after four year-over-year declines in sales and market share for the brand, it conducted consumer research with boomers who were both devotees and detractors.“For people who loved us there was heritage there, and they had eaten them most of their lives,” said Tara Rutan, the brand manager for Newtons. “But the opposite was true with the people that didn’t love us — they knew the brand as Fig Newtons, but they really disliked figs.”Like prunes, which similarly are recognized for their laxative effect, “to a lot of people a fig means ‘geriatric’ and that’s not good,” said Jeff Hilton, co-founder of the Integrated Marketing Group, an agency that works with natural brands.Ms. Rutan said that consumers also associated the brand with “real fruit, and at the end of the day that’s what we’ll always stand for is real fruit.”On packages beginning last May, the logos became simply Newtons, with the flavor relegated to smaller text printed across an illustration of fruit.At the same time, the brand introduced the Newtons Fruit Thins line of crisp cookies, a version of which Kraft has marketed in Canada since 2005 as Lifestyle Selections, under the Peek Freans brand.Declines were swiftly reversed, primarily because of the new Fruit Thins.Revenue for the 52 weeks that ended April 15 totaled $106.4 million for traditional Newtons, up 0.6 percent, while the fruit thins, which were not widely available for the entire 52 weeks, totaled $47.7 million, according to data from the SymphonyIRI Group, whose totals do not include Walmart stores.Newtons has a 3.2 share of the American cookie segment, up nearly a point over a year ago.Early in 2011, fig varieties accounted for 75 percent of sales for the brand, but now account for about 60 percent, according to the company.“We needed to let fruit be the core of the brand as opposed to the fig,” said Gary Osifchin, who has the enviable title of senior director of wholesome sweet snacks at Kraft. “It was going to be hard for us to advance the Newtons brand with the baggage of the fig.”Still, marketing a cookie as both a healthy option and marketing it to boomers is somewhat counterintuitive. When asked if they considered 22 different types of snacks healthy, only 9 percent of consumers said they considered cookies healthy, a tie for last place with potato chips, and less than those who consider chocolate (13 percent), ice cream (12 percent) and meat snacks (12 percent) to be healthy, according to Mintel, a market research firm.Boomers, meanwhile, are among the shoppers least apt to turn into the cookie aisle once their children are grown, and they are satisfying their own between-meal cravings with such adult-oriented items as cereal bars and snack bars.Kraft, therefore, will soon feature Newtons beyond the cookie aisle in stand-alone displays in the produce sections of major retailers, including Walmart stores.“When you have a consumer looking for healthy fruits and vegetables, you’re putting your product in a whole new context that consumers haven’t seen before,” he said. “It’s ingenious.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','The tough talk makes Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak seem increasingly isolated in the international arena, where predictions of war in the near future have all but disappeared amid a focus on the negotiations scheduled to continue in Baghdad this month. American officials believe the looming threat of tighter sanctions July 1 has made the Iranians take the talks more seriously, and that the government has begun to prepare the people for a deal.In Israel, the dissent that burst into public view in recent days has been simmering here for some time, so it may actually have less of an effect.A poll conducted last week by Smith Research for The Jerusalem Post showed that fewer than half of Israelis back an independent strike on Iran. But about half disagreed with the harsh critique of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak by Yuval Diskin, who retired last May as head of Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the F.B.I.,  according to a poll conducted by Dahaf Institute.Other recent surveys show that about three-quarters consider a nuclear Iran an existential threat, and almost as many support a strike with American backing. Mr. Netanyahu’s popularity is strong, with polls showing his Likud Party would pick up seats in the next election, which is now expected in late summer or early fall.“Israelis like the hawkish rhetoric,” said Mina Zemach, director of the Dahaf Polling Institute. “Netanyahu is very strong now. What the public hopes is that Netanyahu prepares us just in case, if no one will stop Iran, then we have to attack.”Several political and security experts said that they did not expect to see a change in policy or tone from Mr. Netanyahu or Mr. Barak, but that the move to elections indicates that they do not believe a strike is imminent. And campaign season is likely to push the issue aside in favor of domestic concerns.“The minute we have a date set for elections, you have to assume that Bibi and Barak are not going to risk their electoral chances by taking some dramatic military initiative which could go wrong,” said Yossi Alpher, a strategic analyst who is an editor of BitterLemons.net, a Web site about the Middle East. “The Palestinian issue and Iran are not the first issues. This is not what preoccupies the public.”Iran insists that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, but Israel says that Tehran must be prevented from developing the capacity to build a nuclear weapon.Despite the move toward early elections, and what many here believe is a commitment Mr. Netanyahu made to President Obama in March not to attack before the American elections, a senior intelligence official said the military option remains very much a live possibility. “It is affecting the regime,” he said of the international pressure. “We don’t think it will bring the regime to change the strategy.”In his speech, Mr. Barak said that sanctions had “forced the Iranians to take note, sit down and talk,” but that “actions speak louder than words.” He repeated his view that Iran is “approaching what I have termed the immunity zone,” in which the enrichment of uranium to weapons grade could not easily be stopped.“Just imagine the most unstable elements in the hands of the most unstable regime in one of the most unstable regions of the world,” he warned. “It is well understood in Washington, D.C., as well as in Jerusalem that as long as there is a future existential threat to our people, that all options to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons should stay on the table, and they will.”Yehuda Ben Meir, one of the directors of the national security and public opinion project at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that there was some discomfort among Israelis with Mr. Netanyahu’s comparing the Iranian threat to the Holocaust, but that “there’s a consensus about the severity of the threat and there’s a consensus that Israel should do whatever it can.”David Horovitz, a veteran journalist here who runs the new Web site The Times of Israel, said many Israelis view the strident tone as a “successful effort to create the sense in the international community that there needs to be more dramatic action in a nonmilitary sense.”“I don’t think what’s unfolding is deemed by Netanyahu and Barak to justify, ‘O.K., we can tone down the process,’ ” Mr. Horovitz said of the international pressure. “Quite the reverse.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','If all you know about Jesse Owens is Hitler, four gold medals and, oh yeah, didn’t he run against a horse?, then the “American Experience” documentary “Jesse Owens” (Tuesday night on PBS stations) will fill some gaps in brisk and entertaining fashion.The sections about Owens’s pre-Olympic career will introduce you to his epochal day at the Big Ten track and field championships in 1935, when he set or tied four world records in less than an hour, an achievement that dwarfs, in purely athletic terms, what he achieved at the Berlin Olympics the next year.They also give some much deserved attention to Eulace Peacock, a fellow African-American sprinter who beat Owens in 7 of 10 head-to-head races in 1935 and was favored by some to best Owens in several Olympic events. If not for a bad hamstring, the histories of sports and World War II might read differently. The Eulace Peacock story cries out for its own film.“Jesse Owens,” directed by Laurens Grant and written by the frequent PBS collaborator Stanley Nelson (“Freedom Riders”), is a smooth and handsome production that suffers from its brevity: about 52 minutes, after credits and promos. There’s not much time to get below the surface, and Owens’s troubled post-Olympic life gets particularly quick treatment.That may also reflect a desire to stay on message, the message being that Owens represents, as the sociologist Harry Edwards puts it, the shoulders on which Jackie Robinson stood. No doubt Owens is an almost preternaturally graceful and heroic figure, asserting his will despite isolation and scorn even greater than Robinson had to face.But a more interesting and complex documentary would take a closer look at Owens’s accommodations with the systems that both celebrated and oppressed him, and his lifelong reluctance to be seen as a spokesman for change, issues that are noted briefly in “Jesse Owens.” Mr. Edwards appears frequently on screen, but no mention is made of the public battle between him and Owens over Owens’s criticism of the black-power salutes delivered at the 1968 Olympics, or of the Owens quotation, “The only time the black fist has significance is when there’s money inside.”What Ms. Grant does put on screen, though, is unimpeachable. Perhaps no athlete has looked as beautiful in motion as Owens, and the copious film of him running and jumping is mesmerizing, even when his opponent is a horse.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','On Friday evening Bloom! Dance Collective, a group of five dancer-choreographers with roots in Hungary, Italy and Spain, made its American debut at Abrons Arts Center. If the piece it presented, “City,” is an indication, this group isn’t coy when it comes to addressing social issues. Even though these artists, based in London and Budapest, welcome humor and convey a decidedly casual vibe, “City” is political dance. End of story.Created and performed by Viktoria Danyi, Csaba Molnar, Timea Sebestyen, Moreno Solinas and Igor Urzelai, this 2010 evening-length work is Bloom’s first collaboration.Its “City” is less an urban milieu than a microcosm of the world where power games are led by a dogmatic leader with a computer-generated voice. Individualism is cause for mortification. Prejudice is rampant. It’s easy material for a dance, but it’s not exactly original: in essence, “City” is a choreographic version of Simon Says.Under Kata Dezsi’s bright lights, the five dancers formed a triangle and immediately disrobed. As the dancers stood in third position, with their arms held behind their backs — the stance was curiously bold and submissive — the mood shifted dramatically when circus music filled the theater. (The sound design is by Alberto Ruiz Soler.) The main attraction? Bouncing breasts and genitals. Linking arms, the dancers formed a long line that rotated as they pranced like trick horses.This was all about the power of the group, and it was over in a flash. After dressing, the performers retreated to chairs placed in rows on either side of the stage. Here, they grew restless, unconvincingly shifting their legs while sighing and crossing their arms.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','Mr. Vitale is finishing a 10-city study of interactions between protesters and the police since last fall, which he said showed a lack of overall “militarization” in police response in major cities. (New York is an exception, said Mr. Vitale, who organized a demonstration against police tactics in Zuccotti Park last fall but said he did not consider himself part of the Occupy movement.) Other researchers are doing ethnographic studies, crunching survey data, recording oral histories and analyzing material by and about the movement, all at lightning speed compared with the usual pace of scholarship.“Academics are used to taking forever, but we don’t have to,” said Theda Skocpol, a sociologist at Harvard and author, with Vanessa Williamson, of “The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,” a study of Occupy’s right-wing counterpart published in January.That book, which combines in-depth interviews with quantitative analysis of the Tea Party movement, is a model for the kind of ambitious work that could emerge in studies of the Occupy movement, some social scientists say. But getting a handle on Occupy, with its amorphous structure and aims, could be more challenging, Ms. Skocpol said.“The Tea Party from the beginning saw themselves as leveraging and changing the Republican Party, while the Occupy people are much more ambivalent,” she said. “That makes them harder to pin down.”Some researchers also say that the sympathy many academics feel for the movement risks undermining objective research.Edward Maguire, a criminologist at American University who is leading a study of attitudes toward the police and the law among Occupy protesters in six cities, cited an incident in which one research assistant at a demonstration in Washington in March “handed in her ID, turned in her clipboard and within minutes got arrested.”“Part of where our research is heading is making recommendations to police departments,” he said. “When they look at our research, I want them to trust it. Having people involved in the movement wouldn’t work for us.”Yet scholars in disciplines with a long tradition of participant-observer research say that direct involvement can offer a better understanding of a movement’s internal dynamics.“Everybody I know doing this is an activist of some sort,” said Jeffrey Juris, an associate professor of anthropology at Northeastern University who is organizing strategy workshops for Occupy Boston while also studying it. “But Occupy is so open and broad based, it doesn’t take much to consider yourself an activist.”Dr. Juris and other activist scholars started an online clearinghouse called Occupy Research last fall to share research methods, tools and data sets. So far the network has hosted two “hackathons” using data gathered on the site as well as facilitated collaborative research like an accounting of Occupy encampments worldwide and analyses of Occupy-related Twitter posts.But that kind of research, however valuable, is “low-hanging fruit,” said Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology and communications at Columbia and the author of “Occupy Nation,” a sympathetic account of the movement published this week as an e-book. The most pressing unanswered question, he said, doesn’t concern Occupy’s activist core but the nature of what he called “the outer movement,” those people who may have showed up for big marches but don’t attend general assemblies or other meetings.“They are the political means by which the movement grows,” Mr. Gitlin said. “And there are a lot more of them.”Last fall the Occupy organizers in New York asked Héctor Cordero-Guzmán, a sociologist at Baruch College, to devise an online survey, which was then posted at occupywallst.org. The first wave of results, published in October, is widely credited with cementing the picture of the movement as representing what Mr. Cordero-Guzmán, in an interview, called “a decent cross-section of the population.”“This wasn’t just young single people with nothing to do at age 22,” he said. “These were people who had done all the right things and things weren’t working out for them so well.”Many scholars, however, question the value of Internet surveys, which can skew toward respondents who are more committed and more comfortable with technology. “I think it’s terrific that he did it, and did it so quickly,” said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York who is planning a randomized survey of Occupy participants. “But it’s not representative. No one quite knows who is excluded.”Some researchers studying local Occupy groups see a movement struggling with the question of just who is and is not part of it. Jesse Klein, a graduate student in sociology at Florida State University who has been studying Occupy Tallahassee since October, said divisions have emerged between activists who have time for long, consensus-based meetings and those who don’t but feared being criticized as lacking commitment. “There’s a strain,” she said.In the meantime the group has disbanded its camp near the capitol in favor of sit-ins, legislative actions and other conventional political activity. “Just being physically present didn’t get them the results they wanted,” she said.In an article in the May issue of the journal American Ethnologist, Dr. Juris argues that Occupy’s social-media-driven “logic of aggregation” may make it less durable than the anti-globalization movement of a decade ago, which mobilized existing activist groups according to a “logic of networks.”“Occupy has been about aggregating large numbers of individuals who have never been active before,” he said. But people who are easily aggregated, he said, can also be easily disaggregated.At a panel discussion at American Ethnological Society’s annual meeting in New York last month Dr. Juris warned against what he called a troubling “fetishization of occupation itself.”“It’s critical to broaden tactics,” he said. “But how do you do that when the movement is called Occupy?”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','I USED to hate business travel. For six years, I flew so much that I was in the top tier of mileage for all the major airlines. At one point, I was flying to Europe nearly every week for most of a year.There was a woman in security at La Guardia who started to recognize me. One time she actually asked me if I was an air marshal. I think it’s because I had this special way of going through security. I could take off my shoes and belt and then put my computer on the belt in this really fluid move.I’m glad those days are over. I now think of myself as a recovered frequent flier, even though I still fly a lot to find beautiful objects for our site. I lost my special moves to get through security. I fumble like everyone else. Most of my mileage perks are gone, and I usually fly coach.And now, I love talking to seatmates. I can’t stop myself. I’ve learned a lot about all different kinds of careers.  I’ve met horse breeders, combat engineers, garbage men and one guy who was a commercial tank cleaner. I even talked fashion with a seamstress who worked a lot of fashion shows. She told me that there were about 20 different stitches she could use for a ripped hem. Who knew?Being more open can also lead to some incredible kindnesses. I was leaving Macau after a conference and I had three hours to catch my flight. The problem was there was a long boat trip and long taxi ride between me and the airport in Hong Kong. I wasn’t going to make it.  If I missed the flight, I would have to stay another day.I have young children and I wanted to get home.

She then asked me if I wanted to take their helicopter.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','Responding to criticism that the administration had not pushed China forcefully enough on Mr. Chen’s case, Mr. Obama said that “every time we meet with China the issue of human rights comes up,” though he refused to discuss the matter at all.“It is our belief that not only is that the right thing to do, because it comports with our belief in freedom and human rights, but also because we actually think China will be stronger as it opens up and liberalizes its own system,” Mr. Obama said as he appeared at the White House with ’s prime minister, . “We want China to be strong, and we want it to be prosperous.”The handling of Mr. Chen’s fate is so sensitive that American officials and diplomats have refused even to confirm whether Mr. Chen is inside the embassy, as supporters and Chinese officials have said, or somewhere else in American hands. Mr. Obama went so far as to decline to discuss what he called “press reports” about Mr. Chen’s case.Administration officials have made clear they hoped silence on the matter was the best chance to resolve the case, given the embarrassment Mr. Chen’s escape has already caused Chinese leaders, who bristle at anything they perceive as foreign interference.Mr. Chen, in a videotaped appeal to Premier , outlined his preferred solution: a deal that would allow him to be free and guarantee that he and his family are protected from the persecution that prompted his flight from a severe and extralegal house arrest.Mr. Chen’s supporters say he does not want the one thing American officials may be able to provide him — asylum — because he knows his influence will quickly diminish to the people who matter most to him if he leaves China.China’s leaders, however, are unlikely to allow Mr. Chen, a blind lawyer who became a media-savvy advocate, to have the freedom to continue his crusading legal defense work. Any major concession on such a sensitive internal affair seems especially unlikely during China’s once-in-a-decade leadership succession process, now under way.For the White House, handing Mr. Chen back over to Chinese authorities would leave it vulnerable to election-year criticism that it had abandoned him. “This administration has made a calculated decision not to challenge the Chinese regime on its dismal human-rights record,” the Republican chairwoman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of , said in a statement after Mr. Obama’s remarks. “This is an opportunity to correct that mistake.”With Secretary of State and other American officials scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Wednesday, China and the United States both appear to be under enormous pressure to find a resolution that does not overshadow the talks, known as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, or derail the broader relationship.On Sunday, Kurt M. Campbell, an assistant secretary of state, arrived in Beijing to discuss the matter with Chinese officials. A deputy secretary of state, William J. Burns, also traveled there on Monday ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s arrival, but administration officials would discuss neither the negotiations now under way nor any potential solution.“We’ve worked hard to build an effective, constructive, comprehensive relationship that allows us to find ways to work together,” Mrs. Clinton said at the State Department hours before departing, also refusing even to utter Mr. Chen’s name, though she has in the past. “Now a constructive relationship includes talking very frankly about those areas where we do not agree, including human rights. That is the spirit guiding me as I take off for Beijing tonight.”Representative , a Republican from and one of Congress’s most outspoken critics of Chinese abuses, urged Mrs. Clinton in a letter released on Monday to raise not only Mr. Chen’s demands, but also the fate of others facing repression. “I would request that you raise the issue of all harassed, arrested, disappeared and disbarred human-rights lawyers and defenders with the Chinese government on an ongoing basis and link this issue with the United States’s interest in the rule of law and respect for human rights generally in China,” he wrote.Even if American diplomats could persuade Mr. Chen to accept political asylum in the United States, it is not clear whether Beijing would allow him — and his family — to leave. For one, Chinese officials are loath to set a precedent that could encourage other dissidents to seek protection in foreign embassies.Still, if Mr. Chen were willing to leave, diplomats would find it easier to work out the logistics of a solution than if he insists on staying. Indeed, one Chinese figure who has knowledge of the attitudes of top leaders, said the government would probably be happy to see Mr. Chen leave, even if it meant a temporary loss of face.But absent that, one veteran Chinese diplomat who works for the Foreign Ministry said, “I predict that if Chen is in the embassy then he won’t get out for years.”There are few historical precedents for resolving a case like this. The last Chinese dissident to find refuge in an American diplomatic compound was Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist, who walked into the embassy in Beijing with his wife in 1989, the day after the People’s Liberation Army crushed pro-democracy protests in . China finally allowed him to leave, ostensibly for medical treatment in , after a year living on the compound.China now is in a far different position than it was two decades ago, when it was subjected to international censure for the bloody crackdown. And the United States is now far more reluctant to alienate a rising economic powerhouse whose diplomatic heft makes its cooperation crucial on many security matters, including and .On the contrary, Mr. Obama said on Monday that he hoped China would grow stronger and prosper, calling on it to “be a partner with us in a set of international rules and norms that everybody follows.”So far, the Chinese government has suppressed any news of Mr. Chen’s escape by aggressively blocking and deleting posts on popular microblog services. Nonetheless, many people have already been swept up by his cause, said Murong Xuecun, a well-known Chinese writer who joined a grass-roots effort last year to break through the blockade around the farmhouse where Mr. Chen was held after being released from prison.“People have been willing to take such risks for him because more and more people are so outraged by his mistreatment,” he said. “He has become a figure for people, a representative of their own grievances.”If past news coverage of other dissidents is any guide, Mr. Murong said he expected propaganda officials to spin a new narrative once news of his predicament becomes impossible to tamp down, criticizing Mr. Chen as an enemy of the nation. In recent years, the government has used a similar playbook for , the artist and government critic, and , the essayist and political reform advocate who won the Nobel Peace Prize while serving an 11-year sentence for subversion. Both men were portrayed in the official press as self-serving elitists seeking to tear the nation apart.That could prove difficult in his case. “A blind person and peasant as a destabilizing threat to the government?” Mr. Murong asked. “That would be a joke.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','PARIS — Stocks fell modestly in Europe on Monday, after confirmation that Spain had slumped back into recession in the first three months of 2012.The Spanish economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the January-March quarter, the same rate of contraction as in the last quarter of 2011, the National Statistics Institute said in Madrid. The common definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of real economic decline.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks euro zone blue-chip shares, fell 1.6 percent by the close of trading. The FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.7 percent.The Spanish economic news was not quite as bad as anticipated — a Reuters poll had found a market consensus for a quarterly contraction of around 0.4 percent. Compared with the first quarter a year earlier, the Spanish economy shrank by 0.4 percent.Still reeling from the collapse of a property market bubble, Spain is seeking to enact austerity measures to restore government finances, even as it grapples with an unemployment rate of 24.4 percent. The market reaction was muted, with Spanish and other bond yields — the subject of intense scrutiny since the euro crisis began — essentially unchanged.The data suggested that “the Spanish economy is not shrinking as rapidly as the other southern European economies,” Ben May, an economist in London with Capital Economics, noted in a report. But he cautioned that “the full effects of the recent fiscal measures on economic growth will not have yet been fully felt.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','Last year, an independent commission on banking led by John Vickers, a former chief economist of the Bank of England, suggested raising capital requirements for British banks.An E.U. diplomat, speaking at a private briefing, suggested that British officials were among those who were particularly wary of how “banks may be international in life but national in death.”That worry underlines the central issue raised by the proposals: While rules can be set at a European level, national governments must pay for banks that run into trouble.Sweden, with its large banking sector, is expected to support Britain’s position. But countries led by France disagree and instead want a single rule book for the European banking sector.The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, which drafted the proposal last year, shares that concern and has warned that capital for shoring up bank reserves is limited.Giving added discretion to the national authorities could have a severe impact on countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, where the banking sector is dominated by subsidiaries of banks based elsewhere in the Union, according to the commission.There could be “several potential negative spillover effects,” the commission has warned in an internal briefing paper. A “home member state could choose to apply higher capital requirements selectively to banks with high exposure in certain host member states,” it added, and that “would lead to a reduction of credit in host member states with adverse consequences for employment and growth.”Austrian banking regulations have already had a negative impact on Hungary, an E.U. official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.Some countries including Germany are also wary of higher capital requirements because they could put some of their banks’ balance sheets under further strain.A number of British banks also oppose their government’s position, but British officials so far have held firm, warning that the financial sector is such a large part of the national economy that the risks associated with future banking failures must be minimized.The discussions in Brussels follow an agreement among major economies, known as Basel III, to raise the requirement for the minimum amount of highest-quality capital held by banks so they can absorb sudden losses, like those associated with the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. The minimum required by Basel III is for banks to hold 7 percent of so-called Tier 1 capital by 2019.But ministers could make progress on Wednesday. Officials from Denmark, which holds the current rotating E.U. presidency, have proposed a compromise allowing member states to impose higher capital requirements of as much as 3 percentage points without prior approval of the E.U. authorities.Ministers must also resolve a fierce debate over whether banks with insurance arms should be regulated more lightly, and a deal will probably come in the middle of this month. The European Parliament must also agree to any proposal before it can become law.Another focus for ministers on Wednesday is likely to be the future leadership of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.But an even more sensitive job is not on the formal agenda.Jean-Claude Juncker — Luxembourg’s prime minister, who leads meetings of the Eurogroup, which comprises the euro zone’s finance ministers, and whose mandate runs out in June — has expressed support for the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, to become his successor.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','Guillaume Jesel, a senior vice president for global marketing at MAC, likened the company’s contest — which logged over 636,000 votes — to “Dancing With the Stars,” but for makeup. “It’s the same revolution you see in other industries,” Mr. Jesel said. “You let the consumer take the steering wheel for a while.”Perhaps adding to the fervor is the fact that winning products won’t be available in stores. Wine, the shade of Bobbi Brown lipstick that had the most votes in the United States, will be available only online via a Facebook link to start in October, while the winning shades of MAC products — a lipstick, lip gloss and eye shadow — will be available in August, also only on the company’s Web site. (Next February, Bobbi Brown will most likely hold another “Bring Back” campaign, this time with eye shadows, Ms. Sontag said.)It used to be that beauty retailers and manufacturers had to adhere to a strict “one in, one out” policy, with low-selling products discontinued to make room for new ones at counters. But selling these products online or on television — on Saturday for instance, Carol’s Daughter will reintroduce its Ocean collection, a three-product bath and body line, on the HSN network — changes the equation.“At the shelf, you have to think about turnover,” said David Lonczak, the division vice president for eCommerce and digital marketing for Drugstore.com, Beauty.com and Walgreens.com. “That doesn’t make it possible to carry these tertiary products, but there is still a reasonable amount of business there.”In 2009, Drugstore.com made a deal with Procter & Gamble to carry select Max Factor items after the company stopped sales in the United States. “When products go off the shelf, consumers go online,” Mr. Lonczak said.Another company trying to pre-empt frustrated customers is the Britain-based Lush, known for making beauty products by hand with fresh ingredients. It has a so-called Retro line, which most recently included a Pineapple Grunt soap and All That Jasmine Bath Bomb. (Once, the company brought back its Tramp shower gel because a customer wrote a note about how much her cat loved the smell.) “It’s not a hugely commercial thing for us,” Hilary Jones, the company’s ethics director in Britain, said of the program. “It’s about keeping the customer’s good will.”And, of course, her loyalty. After buying Erno Laszlo, the cult skin-care brand, last year with a group of investors, Charles Denton decided to pare the company’s 127 offerings down to fewer than 60. Rumors spread over the Internet about which products would make the cut and which wouldn’t, and eventually Mr. Denton, the company’s chief executive, began personally responding to e-mails — as many as 200 a day — from worried customers. Partly because of those communiqués, he decided to keep two powders that had been marked for discontinuation.“The consequence of a poor decision could take 18 months to two years to filter back to the head office,” Mr. Denton said. “With social media you can take an instant read. That’s fantastically valuable.”And beauty behemoths are heading the call, as well. Last year the French cosmetics giant Lancôme brought back Blush Subtil in Cosmopolitan Pink, available for purchase on its site, in response to consumer demand. Next up? Possibly Aroma Tonic, a citrus-scented body spray with its own “bring back” Facebook page, which has over 370 “likes.” “One person writes, then another person writes,” said Gracemarie Papaleo, an assistant vice president for Lancôme. “They rally together.”Perhaps Carolyn Park, 28, who works in business development at a law firm in Manhattan, should mobilize the troops. Upon discovering that Guardian Angel Heat Protect ’n Curl, a hair spray from Got 2 Be, was discontinued, Ms. Park, who stockpiles mascara and hand cream, among other products, snapped up four bottles for $7 each at Amazon.com.But “I’m on my last one,” she said. “And I haven’t found a replacement.”'"

"'12-05-01,'1','The partisan divide leaves Mr. Cameron as a de facto defender of Mr. Murdoch, while his Labour Party opponents have asked British regulators to move, on the basis of the report, toward reducing Mr. Murdoch’s 39.1 percent controlling interest in BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster that produces a hefty profit for the News Corporation.The members of Parliament rejected the defense of Mr. Murdoch, 81, that his executives kept him in the dark about the hacking, saying he “exhibited willful to what was going on in his companies and publications.”It said the use of illegal reporting methods and the efforts to thwart inquiries into the practice came from a culture that “permeated from the top throughout the organization and speaks volumes about the lack of effective corporate governance at News Corporation and News International,” its British newspaper subsidiary.“We conclude, therefore, that Rupert Murdoch is not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company,” the report said.While the long-term impact on Mr. Murdoch’s -based News Corporation remains uncertain, the report at least initially cheered investors, some of whom have pressed for a change of leadership at the News Corporation and a reduced role for Mr. Murdoch and his family. The company’s share price rose about 1.25 percent in early afternoon trading on Wall Street.The parliamentary findings increase pressure on Ofcom, Britain’s broadcast regulator, which since last summer has been assessing the News Corporation to determine whether it is “fit and proper” to hold the BSkyB television license. In the nine or so years of its existence, Ofcom has only once removed a television license on the basis that its owner had not met the “fit and proper” test — in the case of the broadcaster of a pornography channel.Losing BSkyB would be a startling blow for the News Corporation, but one that could be mitigated by the reaction of analysts and investors, who have long urged that the company shed some minority-owned assets in an effort to raise its share price.In its report, the committee did not use the full term “fit and proper” in condemning Mr. Murdoch, a distinction that John Whittingdale, the committee’s Conservative nonvoting chairman, told the was significant. Media commentators said the phrasing appeared to be an effort not to throw the committee’s weight fully behind the Labour Party push for a regulator-ordered sell-off of News Corporation’s BSkyB interest.Mr. Murdoch released a message to News Corporation employees that sidestepped the criticism directed at him, stressing instead the company’s cooperation with the inquiry and his recognition of “mistakes we have made.”“I recognize that for all of us — myself in particular — it is difficult to read many of the report’s findings,” the memo said. “But we have done the most difficult part, which has been to take a long, hard and honest look at our past mistakes.“There is no easy way around this, but I am proud to say that we have been working hard to put things right.”In a statement from its New York headquarters, the company acknowledged “serious wrongdoing” but also said the committee was “wildly outside” its mandate in finding that Mr. Murdoch was “not a fit person.” It called that a purely partisan attempt to influence regulators.In a statement on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was reading the committee’s report “with interest” and would use it, along with other evidence, to make its final judgment on the News Corporation. It gave no timetable, but some analysts say they expected the decision before the summer.But it is significant, media analysts said, that Ofcom has openly discussed some of the evidence it is considering as it makes its assessment — evidence that at the very least presents an unflattering portrait of the News Corporation’s activities.The committee report singled out , the second son of the media tycoon, who until recently was head of the family’s media interests in Britain, for failing to act much earlier. “Had James Murdoch been more attentive to the correspondence that he received at the time, he could have taken action on phone hacking in 2008, and this committee could have been told the truth” during an earlier inquiry in 2009, the report said.It said the News Corporation had tried to blame lower-ranking executives while “striving to protect more senior figures, most notably James Murdoch.”The panel raised the possibility that three senior former managers at News International, , and , could be cited for contempt of Parliament for misleading the panel in their testimony.“I am shocked and disappointed by the culture, media and sport select committee’s allegations that I have misled Parliament and was ‘complicit’ in a cover-up,” Mr. Hinton said in a statement on Tuesday. “I refute these accusations utterly.” He said he would formally object to the findings.Mr. Myler, now the editor of The Daily News in New York, said he stood by his testimony. “I have always sought to be accurate and consistent in what I have said to the committee,” he said in a statement.Mr. Crone did not respond to a message seeking comment.The committee’s findings appeared certain to set off a new storm in Parliament, with the Labour opposition signaling that it would press for a vote finding the three men guilty of contempt of Parliament, a sanction rarely used in modern times that Labour supporters said would seriously damage the men’s reputations and careers.James Murdoch told the panel last week that when he took over News International in late 2007 — months after a News of the World reporter and a private investigator were jailed for hacking into the voice mail of members of the royal family — he believed that the affair had been settled.But that version has been challenged by Mr. Myler, a former editor of The News of the World, and Mr. Crone, the newspaper’s former legal manager — the executives accused by Rupert Murdoch of a cover-up. The men have testified that they told James Murdoch in June 2008 of the extent of the hacking, but Mr. Murdoch has said he did not learn of the extent of the practice until last year.In a measure of the damage to his interests since the scandal broke last year, Rupert Murdoch has closed the 168-year-old News of the World and the family has withdrawn a $12 billion bid to assume full control of BSkyB.For his part, James Murdoch has severed many business ties with Britain, although he remains on BSkyB’s board.Meanwhile, the company still faces investigations by and the Crown Prosecution Service, which the parliamentary committee criticized as failing to take action soon enough.The police in Britain have started three separate investigations into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and bribery of police officers. All have focused largely on Mr. Murdoch’s newspapers, but can extend to more general wrongdoing in newspapers he does not own.A public inquiry led by a judge, Brian Leveson, has also been calling witnesses under oath and publishing evidence on the “culture, practices and ethics of the press.” It has most recently sought to investigate allegations of inappropriate closeness between Mr. Murdoch, his family and closest executives, and the British political establishment.More than 40 people have been arrested and questioned — though not charged — including senior editors and executives at News International. They include , the former chief executive of News International, and , a former editor who left the company to become Mr. Cameron’s media adviser — a job he quit last year under pressure from the media scandal.'"

Such personality! So hot and sweet and sassy. It’s irresistible piled on rye with spicy brown mustard, or even with mayonnaise, as some here prefer (all beef sandwiches are $6 for small, $9 for medium, $12 for large). Layers of ruddy, tender slices hide streaks of fat, to be mined like unctuous gold as you eat.The pastrami’s shtick upstages all else. If you must have morning eggs (David’s opens at 7 a.m.), the wonderfully nonkosher breakfast sandwich includes them with gooey American cheese and pastrami, but you’ll hardly notice them, the meat is so mesmerizing.David’s brisket is the dark, handsome, silent type; it lures you in with its deep, warm manner. Moist and mightily beefy, seasoned simply and cooked low and slow, it offers just the right amount of chew. It lends gravitas to a combo sandwich with the pastrami ($15). But no one really needs a duet this outsize; get the brisket solo on a roll with luscious gravy on the side, and savor its swarthy torch-song flavor.The lean, slightly musky corned beef is David’s wallflower.

The White House set it up as a big moment, but the president squandered the chance to fully explain his exit strategy from a war Americans are desperate to see brought to an end.Mr. Obama repeated his commitment that American combat troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014 and that Afghan troops would be ready long before that to take over prime responsibility for the fight against the .But the speech was frustratingly short on specifics. Mr. Obama didn’t explain what the and its allies planned to do to improve the training of Afghan forces so they can hold off the Taliban. Nor did he explain what President plans to do to rein in the corruption and incompetence that are the hallmark of his leadership and that have alienated so many of his own people, playing into the hands of the Taliban.We have long supported the war in Afghanistan as a painful but necessary fight to ensure that does not again have a major launching pad for attacking the United States. But we are increasingly concerned that Mr. Obama does not have a clear policy to ensure that the country does not implode once the Americans are gone.The president’s brief, unannounced trip did accomplish one thing. He signed a long-delayed strategic partnership agreement with Mr. Karzai that is intended to signal that the United States will not cut and run, even after the 2014 withdrawal. That agreement is also short on specifics, but American officials say that Washington — and, they hope, the allies — will provide some number of troops for years to come and billions in military and economic aid.'"
"'12-05-01,'1','The Obama administration has remained virtually silent on Mr. Chen, refusing to confirm that he is in American hands and moving the choreography forward for what the Chinese consider “all weather” talks involving hundreds of diplomats and officials at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse complex, dotted with lakes and willow trees.Washington’s regard for the Chinese government’s sensitivity may have helped the Beijing leadership remain outwardly calm about the Chen case, which comes at a time of political upheaval in the aftermath of the dismissal of Bo Xilai, a member of the Politburo.Even before the Chen case erupted, there were few expectations of specific outcomes for the economic and strategic talks, in which every item on the agenda, from North Korea to the global economy, has been painstakingly negotiated.Mrs. Clinton said in Washington before her departure on Monday that she would raise human rights during her visit.Until Mr. Chen’s case complicated the atmosphere, human rights were expected to play little part. Human rights talks between the nations are accorded a separate dialogue at a different time of year.Still, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, Michael H. Posner, who has pressed Mr. Chen’s case, is a member of Mrs. Clinton’s delegation. He had been scheduled to accompany her before Mr. Chen’s escape.In the military talks, Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns and the acting under secretary of defense for policy, James N. Miller, will lead the American delegation, and Gen. Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army, is the head of the Chinese delegation.With the discussion generally limited to cyberwarfare and maritime issues, the talks will not include space weaponry or missile defense, two areas in which the Chinese are concentrating military expenditure, Obama administration officials said.In a recent report on the American military relationship with China, Shirley A. Kan, a specialist in Asian security at the Congressional Research Service, wrote that China’s “reduced appreciation for military-to-military exchanges has accompanied its rising assertiveness.” In an example of the rocky relationship, she noted that when Adm. Mike Mullen, the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited China last year, he was the first chairman to do so since 2007.Scott Harold, who is studying the military relationship between China and the United States for the RAND Corporation, echoed that view. “There is a mutual suspicion by each side of the other’s growing capabilities,” he said.The Chinese have acquired or are developing a variety of weapons and technologies that would enable them to put into practice the doctrine of “anti-access, area denial,” Mr. Harold said. The basic idea is to block American access to strategic waterways, particularly the seas off China’s coast.Among the weapons to advance the doctrine are ultraquiet submarines and advanced surface vessels equipped with antiship cruise missiles, Mr. Harold said. China is also testing ballistic missiles that can strike an aircraft carrier, he said.In addition, China has built an advanced cyberprogram designed to disable a potential enemy’s command-and-control capabilities, Mr. Harold said.In response to the Chinese doctrine, Pentagon planners are devising a military fighting concept called the “air-sea battle strategy” that would ensure that the American military could deploy over great distances to defend United States allies and interests.“I wouldn’t characterize the situation as an arms race, but competitive military modernization through hardware and, more important, in doctrine,” Mr. Harold said.A major reason for the limited nature of the military talks between Beijing and Washington, American officials say, is the Chinese position that the United States must abide by three conditions: stopping arms sales to Taiwan, halting close-in maritime and airborne surveillance of China, and scrapping restrictions in the National Defense Authorization Act that prevent the export of American technologies deemed to have military use for China.The export restrictions are unfair and demonstrate the United States’ determination to keep China in an inferior position, said Yan Xuetong, the dean of modern international relations at Tsinghua University.“The arms embargo is a clear indication that the United States does not want China to become a military power,” said Mr. Yan, a prominent professor who reflects a more nationalistic belief among Chinese academics.Military competition between the two powers is inevitable and should be recognized as such, he said.The United States talked about more cooperation, but the Chinese military asked itself, “ ‘What can I benefit from this cooperation, what payoff does the P.L.A. get?’ ” Mr. Yan said, referring to the People’s Liberation Army.“We think the U.S. is hypocritical when they say, ‘We want this cooperation for your benefit,’ ” he added.There should be more contact between the two sides in the mode of “negative cooperation,” Mr. Yan said.“That way,” he added, “we can work together to prevent war between us.”'"
"'12-05-01,'1','Advocates argue that the treaty is vital to the future of the euro currency, with provisions intended to prevent any further debt crises like that of Greece, and they warn that Ireland may have great difficulty borrowing internationally if it votes no.“Companies that are now deciding to invest in Europe, and who look at Ireland, want to know: Is there a backstop, is there an insurance policy, is there access to funds if the country ever needed them?” Mr. Kenny said.Opponents call it the Austerity Treaty and say the provisions limiting member nations’ budget deficits and debts will condemn Ireland to at least a decade of further economic stagnation. Mary Lou McDonald, vice president of the opposition party Sinn Fein, accused the government of “scaremongering” and called the borrowing issue a red herring.“There is no way that we will be allowed to go under within the euro zone,” Ms. McDonald said. “To do that would be to jeopardize the euro, and protection of the currency is the primary goal” of the European Union leaders.The issue of access to financing has dominated the debate in recent days, and both sides think it may decide the outcome.The leaders of 25 of the 27 member states of the European Union approved the treaty in January, with only Britain and the Czech Republic refusing to sign. In most of the signatory countries, such treaties can be ratified by a vote of the Parliament, but since 1987, Irish law has required a referendum.The government has been skirmishing with the treaty’s opponents for weeks, and some commentators say the “no” side gained an edge by organizing months ago. The opposition is a cohesive force, battle-hardened by a campaign to boycott a widely reviled new property tax, for which about half the population failed to register by the March 31 deadline.Meanwhile, the government has found itself in difficulties over a range of cutbacks to social services and new revenue-raising measures, including the introduction of water metering and septic tank inspection charges.“It is hardly the best time for establishment politicians looking for votes to be knocking on doors, while the fine notices are dropping through the letter boxes of up to one million people across the country who have refused to pay the household property charge,” said Joe Higgins, the leader of the Socialist Party.In January, when the government had not yet decided whether the referendum would be called, the transportation minister, Leo Varadkar, referred to the difficulties that a campaign for the treaty would face. He told the national radio network RTE that referendums were “never very democratic” because voters tended to use them as a stick to beat the government.“I would be concerned that it would turn into a referendum on extraneous issues such as septic tanks, bondholders, banking crisis or decisions being made by the government, such as cutbacks,” Mr. Varadkar said.Irish voters have a history of doing just that. They voted down the Lisbon Treaty in 2008 despite an intense campaign in favor of it, with the government warning that Ireland would be frozen out of Europe if it failed to ratify it because that treaty required unanimous approval by member states. It passed on a second try, after the European Union offered assurances on contentious issues like abortion and military neutrality.This time around, it is less clear what effect a rejection would have because Ireland has no veto: only a simple majority of signatory states, 13 out of 25, are needed to put the treaty into effect.Still, the government says a “yes” vote would affirm Ireland’s commitment to Europe, while opponents say the referendum is a chance to promote an alternative agenda to austerity.Looming over the debate is Sunday’s presidential runoff election in France, where the candidate leading in the polls, the Socialist François Hollande, has vowed to renegotiate the stability treaty to allow for more growth stimulus, an idea both sides in the Irish debate support. Many commentators here wonder whether the election returns from France will be the biggest influence on how Ireland votes on the treaty.'"

Read, Pfizer’s chief executive, said in an interview Tuesday. “We are at our heart a biopharmaceutical company focused on applying science to improving people’s quality of life. That is what our core is. That is what will determine our success.”Pfizer is one of many pharmaceutical companies racing to reinvent itself. This year alone, at least 19 drugs — including the antistroke drug Plavix — are scheduled to lose patent protection, a potential $38.5 billion in lost sales, according to an analysis by .Drug executives are asking themselves: “What is it that we now face, given that in the past decade — when everything was going right — we didn’t build with this future in mind?” said Jeremy Levin, who oversaw a similar reorganization of and is about to take over as chief executive at Teva Pharmaceuticals.At Pfizer, skeptics have questioned the decision to shed some of its most profitable units in favor of doubling down on the risky pharmaceutical business. Pfizer’s nutrition unit grew by 15 percent and animal health by 17 percent in 2011, while its pharmaceutical sales dipped by 1 percent. And Pfizer has suffered some notable flops over the last several years, including the failure of an experimental cholesterol treatment that was seen as a potential successor to Lipitor and poor sales of an inhaled insulin drug that the company eventually abandoned.“It’s a high-risk plan,” said Erik M. Gordon, who teaches business at the . “They’re focusing on what they don’t have the best track record in and they’re spinning off things that are doing pretty well.”Pfizer spent the last decade buying other big companies. In 2000, it acquired Warner Lambert and with it the rights to Lipitor, which Pfizer had been co-marketing with the company. In 2003, it merged with Pharmacia and added the painkiller to its lineup. It acquired Wyeth in 2009 in a $68 billion deal that brought a portfolio of biologic drugs. Last year, Pfizer bought King Pharmaceuticals, a maker of pain drugs.The acquisitions, some said, turned Pfizer into a Frankenstein’s monster — a giant stitched together from the scraps of smaller companies that lurched forward with little purpose.“I think the company sort of lost their way in the years before the Wyeth acquisition,” said Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst for .Mr. Read said he agreed. “I think it was broken — I think we were spending huge amounts of money,” said Mr. Read, who took over as chief executive in late 2010 after resigned abruptly. “We weren’t producing the drugs we needed and frankly that was seen in the marketplace.”Analysts said Pfizer’s nutrition deal and the divestiture of the animal health business is a way to tide over shareholders while it undertakes more substantial changes to its business model. The company has said it plans to use most of the cash from the deals to buy back stock, though studies have repeatedly cast doubt on the efficacy of such moves by corporations.Pfizer said Tuesday that it had repurchased $1.7 billion in stock in the first quarter, and expects to buy back about $5 billion by the end of the year. The company reported earnings of $1.79 billion last quarter, or 24 cents a share, compared to $2.22 billion, or 28 cents a share over the same period last year.Investors seem to be buying into the company’s strategy so far: Pfizer stock has risen nearly 8 percent over the last year. Pfizer’s stock closed at $22.78 on Tuesday, down 12 cents, or less than 1 percent.Even so, the company’s decision to cut research budgets as it is planning to recommit to its pharmaceutical core struck some as risky. Mr. Gordon, the business professor, called it a “magic trick.”It’s a magic trick, however, that most major pharmaceutical companies are also trying. “The question is how do you remain successful and sustain your operations if you’re investing less and less in R&D?” said Kenneth I. Kaitin, a professor and director of ’s Center for the Study of Drug Development. “The answer to that is to try to find a new way and a more efficient mechanism for discovering and developing drugs.”Pfizer plans to reduce its research budget from $9.4 billion in 2010 to $6.5 billion to $7 billion this year. It closed a research center in and has been trimming its facility in Groton, Conn., and moving resources to areas closer to universities in and , .In 2011, the company ended 91 projects, canceling programs aimed at treating , for example, as well as one to treat nasal symptoms from . Company executives have also said they will be on the lookout for smaller acquisitions to fill gaps in their portfolio, and will expand partnerships with academic institutions.Mr. Read said the cuts would not affect the areas that the company has prioritized. “Most of what I cut had a low probability of success,” he said.While Pfizer does not have another Lipitor, analysts say several drugs seem promising. On May 9, a advisory panel is to consider recommending approval of an oral pill for . In June, the agency is expected to weigh approval of Eliquis, an antistroke drug that Pfizer is developing with Bristol-Myers Squibb.In corporate strategy, Pfizer is following the path of Bristol-Myers, which in 2009 announced plans to spin off the nutrition company Mead Johnson to focus on acquiring small biotech companies. The company has since fared well despite the loss of patent protection for Plavix on May 17. “So long as the blockbuster game was working, people kept playing it,” Mr. Gordon said.'"

And Pfizer has suffered some notable flops over the last several years, including the failure of an experimental cholesterol treatment that was seen as a potential successor to Lipitor and poor sales of an inhaled insulin drug that the company eventually abandoned.“It’s a high-risk plan,” said Erik M. Gordon, who teaches business at the . “They’re focusing on what they don’t have the best track record in and they’re spinning off things that are doing pretty well.”Pfizer spent the last decade buying other big companies. In 2000, it acquired Warner Lambert and with it the rights to Lipitor, which Pfizer had been co-marketing with the company. In 2003, it merged with Pharmacia and added the painkiller to its lineup. It acquired Wyeth in 2009 in a $68 billion deal that brought a portfolio of biologic drugs. Last year, Pfizer bought King Pharmaceuticals, a maker of pain drugs.The acquisitions, some said, turned Pfizer into a Frankenstein’s monster — a giant stitched together from the scraps of smaller companies that lurched forward with little purpose.“I think the company sort of lost their way in the years before the Wyeth acquisition,” said Catherine J. Arnold, an analyst for .Mr. Read said he agreed. “I think it was broken — I think we were spending huge amounts of money,” said Mr. Read, who took over as chief executive in late 2010 after resigned abruptly. “We weren’t producing the drugs we needed and frankly that was seen in the marketplace.”Analysts said Pfizer’s nutrition deal and the divestiture of the animal health business is a way to tide over shareholders while it undertakes more substantial changes to its business model. The company has said it plans to use most of the cash from the deals to buy back stock, though studies have repeatedly cast doubt on the efficacy of such moves by corporations.Pfizer said Tuesday that it had repurchased $1.7 billion in stock in the first quarter, and expects to buy back about $5 billion by the end of the year. The company reported earnings of $1.79 billion last quarter, or 24 cents a share, compared to $2.22 billion, or 28 cents a share over the same period last year.Investors seem to be buying into the company’s strategy so far: Pfizer stock has risen nearly 8 percent over the last year. Pfizer’s stock closed at $22.78 on Tuesday, down 12 cents, or less than 1 percent.Even so, the company’s decision to cut research budgets as it is planning to recommit to its pharmaceutical core struck some as risky. Mr. Gordon, the business professor, called it a “magic trick.”It’s a magic trick, however, that most major pharmaceutical companies are also trying. “The question is how do you remain successful and sustain your operations if you’re investing less and less in R&D?” said Kenneth I. Kaitin, a professor and director of ’s Center for the Study of Drug Development. “The answer to that is to try to find a new way and a more efficient mechanism for discovering and developing drugs.”Pfizer plans to reduce its research budget from $9.4 billion in 2010 to $6.5 billion to $7 billion this year. It closed a research center in and has been trimming its facility in Groton, Conn., and moving resources to areas closer to universities in and , .In 2011, the company ended 91 projects, canceling programs aimed at treating , for example, as well as one to treat nasal symptoms from . Company executives have also said they will be on the lookout for smaller acquisitions to fill gaps in their portfolio, and will expand partnerships with academic institutions.Mr. Read said the cuts would not affect the areas that the company has prioritized. “Most of what I cut had a low probability of success,” he said.While Pfizer does not have another Lipitor, analysts say several drugs seem promising. On May 9, a advisory panel is to consider recommending approval of an oral pill for . In June, the agency is expected to weigh approval of Eliquis, an antistroke drug that Pfizer is developing with Bristol-Myers Squibb.In corporate strategy, Pfizer is following the path of Bristol-Myers, which in 2009 announced plans to spin off the nutrition company Mead Johnson to focus on acquiring small biotech companies. The company has since fared well despite the loss of patent protection for Plavix on May 17. “So long as the blockbuster game was working, people kept playing it,” Mr. Gordon said.'"

The White House set it up as a big moment, but the president squandered the chance to fully explain his exit strategy from a war Americans are desperate to see brought to an end.Mr. Obama repeated his commitment that American combat troops would be withdrawn by the end of 2014 and that Afghan troops would be ready long before that to take over prime responsibility for the fight against the .But the speech was frustratingly short on specifics. Mr. Obama didn’t explain what the and its allies planned to do to improve the training of Afghan forces so they can hold off the Taliban. Nor did he explain what President plans to do to rein in the corruption and incompetence that are the hallmark of his leadership and that have alienated so many of his own people, playing into the hands of the Taliban.We have long supported the war in Afghanistan as a painful but necessary fight to ensure that does not again have a major launching pad for attacking the United States. But we are increasingly concerned that Mr. Obama does not have a clear policy to ensure that the country does not implode once the Americans are gone.The president’s brief, unannounced trip did accomplish one thing. He signed a long-delayed strategic partnership agreement with Mr. Karzai that is intended to signal that the United States will not cut and run, even after the 2014 withdrawal. That agreement is also short on specifics, but American officials say that Washington — and, they hope, the allies — will provide some number of troops for years to come and billions in military and economic aid.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Pfizer has settled a lawsuit filed by Brigham Young University, over development of the blockbuster painkiller Celebrex, for $450 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.Terms of the settlement were not disclosed in an announcement by the drug company and the university, which the Mormon Church owns, in Utah.However, Pfizer said in a regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it was taking a $450 million charge against first-quarter earnings to settle the case.Brigham Young and Pfizer battled for six years over the discovery of an enzyme that led to the development of Celebrex, a breakthrough in the treatment of arthritis and inflammation. A jury trial had been set to start May 29 in United States District Court in Salt Lake City.Brigham Young had sought a 15 percent royalty on sales of Celebrex, or about $9.7 billion. The university also could have sought billions of dollars more in punitive damages and interest.Brigham Young’s lawsuit said a chemistry professor, Daniel L. Simmons, discovered the genetic workings of the drug in the early 1990s. It accused Pfizer of violating a research agreement the university made with predecessor companies.As part of the settlement, Brigham Young plans to endow a Dan Simmons Chair in recognition of his lifelong work advancing human health.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','Advocates argue that the treaty is vital to the future of the euro currency, with provisions intended to prevent any further debt crises like that of Greece, and they warn that Ireland may have great difficulty borrowing internationally if it votes no.“Companies that are now deciding to invest in Europe, and who look at Ireland, want to know: Is there a backstop, is there an insurance policy, is there access to funds if the country ever needed them?” Mr. Kenny said.Opponents call it the Austerity Treaty and say the provisions limiting member nations’ budget deficits and debts will condemn Ireland to at least a decade of further economic stagnation. Mary Lou McDonald, vice president of the opposition party Sinn Fein, accused the government of “scaremongering” and called the borrowing issue a red herring.“There is no way that we will be allowed to go under within the euro zone,” Ms. McDonald said. “To do that would be to jeopardize the euro, and protection of the currency is the primary goal” of the European Union leaders.The issue of access to financing has dominated the debate in recent days, and both sides think it may decide the outcome.The leaders of 25 of the 27 member states of the European Union approved the treaty in January, with only Britain and the Czech Republic refusing to sign. In most of the signatory countries, such treaties can be ratified by a vote of the Parliament, but since 1987, Irish law has required a referendum.The government has been skirmishing with the treaty’s opponents for weeks, and some commentators say the “no” side gained an edge by organizing months ago. The opposition is a cohesive force, battle-hardened by a campaign to boycott a widely reviled new property tax, for which about half the population failed to register by the March 31 deadline.Meanwhile, the government has found itself in difficulties over a range of cutbacks to social services and new revenue-raising measures, including the introduction of water metering and septic tank inspection charges.“It is hardly the best time for establishment politicians looking for votes to be knocking on doors, while the fine notices are dropping through the letter boxes of up to one million people across the country who have refused to pay the household property charge,” said Joe Higgins, the leader of the Socialist Party.In January, when the government had not yet decided whether the referendum would be called, the transportation minister, Leo Varadkar, referred to the difficulties that a campaign for the treaty would face. He told the national radio network RTE that referendums were “never very democratic” because voters tended to use them as a stick to beat the government.“I would be concerned that it would turn into a referendum on extraneous issues such as septic tanks, bondholders, banking crisis or decisions being made by the government, such as cutbacks,” Mr. Varadkar said.Irish voters have a history of doing just that. They voted down the Lisbon Treaty in 2008 despite an intense campaign in favor of it, with the government warning that Ireland would be frozen out of Europe if it failed to ratify it because that treaty required unanimous approval by member states. It passed on a second try, after the European Union offered assurances on contentious issues like abortion and military neutrality.This time around, it is less clear what effect a rejection would have because Ireland has no veto: only a simple majority of signatory states, 13 out of 25, are needed to put the treaty into effect.Still, the government says a “yes” vote would affirm Ireland’s commitment to Europe, while opponents say the referendum is a chance to promote an alternative agenda to austerity.Looming over the debate is Sunday’s presidential runoff election in France, where the candidate leading in the polls, the Socialist François Hollande, has vowed to renegotiate the stability treaty to allow for more growth stimulus, an idea both sides in the Irish debate support. Many commentators here wonder whether the election returns from France will be the biggest influence on how Ireland votes on the treaty.'"

Such personality! So hot and sweet and sassy. It’s irresistible piled on rye with spicy brown mustard, or even with mayonnaise, as some here prefer (all beef sandwiches are $6 for small, $9 for medium, $12 for large).

"'12-05-02,'0','The Obama administration has remained virtually silent on Mr. Chen, refusing to confirm that he is in American hands and moving the choreography forward for what the Chinese consider “all weather” talks involving hundreds of diplomats and officials at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse complex, dotted with lakes and willow trees.Washington’s regard for the Chinese government’s sensitivity may have helped the Beijing leadership remain outwardly calm about the Chen case, which comes at a time of political upheaval in the aftermath of the dismissal of Bo Xilai, a member of the Politburo.Even before the Chen case erupted, there were few expectations of specific outcomes for the economic and strategic talks, in which every item on the agenda, from North Korea to the global economy, has been painstakingly negotiated.Mrs. Clinton said in Washington before her departure on Monday that she would raise human rights during her visit.Until Mr. Chen’s case complicated the atmosphere, human rights were expected to play little part. Human rights talks between the nations are accorded a separate dialogue at a different time of year.Still, the assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, Michael H. Posner, who has pressed Mr. Chen’s case, is a member of Mrs. Clinton’s delegation. He had been scheduled to accompany her before Mr. Chen’s escape.In the military talks, Deputy Secretary of State William J. Burns and the acting under secretary of defense for policy, James N. Miller, will lead the American delegation, and Gen. Ma Xiaotian, deputy chief of the general staff of the People’s Liberation Army, is the head of the Chinese delegation.With the discussion generally limited to cyberwarfare and maritime issues, the talks will not include space weaponry or missile defense, two areas in which the Chinese are concentrating military expenditure, Obama administration officials said.In a recent report on the American military relationship with China, Shirley A. Kan, a specialist in Asian security at the Congressional Research Service, wrote that China’s “reduced appreciation for military-to-military exchanges has accompanied its rising assertiveness.” In an example of the rocky relationship, she noted that when Adm. Mike Mullen, the recently retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, visited China last year, he was the first chairman to do so since 2007.Scott Harold, who is studying the military relationship between China and the United States for the RAND Corporation, echoed that view. “There is a mutual suspicion by each side of the other’s growing capabilities,” he said.The Chinese have acquired or are developing a variety of weapons and technologies that would enable them to put into practice the doctrine of “anti-access, area denial,” Mr. Harold said. The basic idea is to block American access to strategic waterways, particularly the seas off China’s coast.Among the weapons to advance the doctrine are ultraquiet submarines and advanced surface vessels equipped with antiship cruise missiles, Mr. Harold said. China is also testing ballistic missiles that can strike an aircraft carrier, he said.In addition, China has built an advanced cyberprogram designed to disable a potential enemy’s command-and-control capabilities, Mr. Harold said.In response to the Chinese doctrine, Pentagon planners are devising a military fighting concept called the “air-sea battle strategy” that would ensure that the American military could deploy over great distances to defend United States allies and interests.“I wouldn’t characterize the situation as an arms race, but competitive military modernization through hardware and, more important, in doctrine,” Mr. Harold said.A major reason for the limited nature of the military talks between Beijing and Washington, American officials say, is the Chinese position that the United States must abide by three conditions: stopping arms sales to Taiwan, halting close-in maritime and airborne surveillance of China, and scrapping restrictions in the National Defense Authorization Act that prevent the export of American technologies deemed to have military use for China.The export restrictions are unfair and demonstrate the United States’ determination to keep China in an inferior position, said Yan Xuetong, the dean of modern international relations at Tsinghua University.“The arms embargo is a clear indication that the United States does not want China to become a military power,” said Mr. Yan, a prominent professor who reflects a more nationalistic belief among Chinese academics.Military competition between the two powers is inevitable and should be recognized as such, he said.The United States talked about more cooperation, but the Chinese military asked itself, “ ‘What can I benefit from this cooperation, what payoff does the P.L.A. get?’ ” Mr. Yan said, referring to the People’s Liberation Army.“We think the U.S. is hypocritical when they say, ‘We want this cooperation for your benefit,’ ” he added.There should be more contact between the two sides in the mode of “negative cooperation,” Mr. Yan said.“That way,” he added, “we can work together to prevent war between us.”'"
"'12-05-02,'0','NEW DELHI — Rescuers in eastern India continued to search for survivors on Tuesday after a ferry, overcrowded with more than 300 passengers, capsized during a severe storm. The authorities estimated that at least 40 people died and up to 200 were missing, suggesting that the death toll could climb.The accident occurred on Monday afternoon, on the Brahmaputra River, as the double-decker ferry was approaching shore near Buraburi, in the state of Assam. Police officials said the passengers were plunged into the water, with some able to swim to the bank, while others were either swept downstream or perished in the wreckage.News agencies reported that more than 100 bodies had been recovered.But the authorities offered conflicting accounts on the circumstances of the accident. J.N. Choudhury, the state police chief in Assam, said in an interview on Tuesday that the ferry broke into three pieces during the storm. He said investigators would try to determine whether the accident was caused by the storm or structural problems with the vessel.However, Tarun Gogoi, the chief minister of Assam, said reports that the vessel had shattered were inaccurate and blamed the accident on the weather. He predicted that more than 100 people likely died in the accident and said corpses were already being discovered downstream, in Bangladesh.“This is the most tragic incident,” Mr. Gogoi said in an interview, adding that he had already contacted officials in Bangladesh and begun making arrangements to reclaim the bodies swept across the border.Prime Minister Manmohan Singh issued a statement on Monday night expressing his condolences and announcing that the government would make payments of about $3,800 to assist the families of the dead. Mr. Gogoi said the Assam government would add about $950.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','The partisan divide leaves Mr. Cameron as a de facto defender of Mr. Murdoch, while his Labour Party opponents have asked British regulators to move, on the basis of the report, toward reducing Mr. Murdoch’s 39.1 percent controlling interest in BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster that produces a hefty profit for the News Corporation.The members of Parliament rejected the defense of Mr. Murdoch, 81, that his executives kept him in the dark about the hacking, saying he “exhibited willful to what was going on in his companies and publications.”It said the use of illegal reporting methods and the efforts to thwart inquiries into the practice came from a culture that “permeated from the top throughout the organization and speaks volumes about the lack of effective corporate governance at News Corporation and News International,” its British newspaper subsidiary.“We conclude, therefore, that Rupert Murdoch is not a fit person to exercise the stewardship of a major international company,” the report said.While the long-term impact on Mr. Murdoch’s -based News Corporation remains uncertain, the report at least initially cheered investors, some of whom have pressed for a change of leadership at the News Corporation and a reduced role for Mr. Murdoch and his family. The company’s share price rose about 1.25 percent in early afternoon trading on Wall Street.The parliamentary findings increase pressure on Ofcom, Britain’s broadcast regulator, which since last summer has been assessing the News Corporation to determine whether it is “fit and proper” to hold the BSkyB television license. In the nine or so years of its existence, Ofcom has only once removed a television license on the basis that its owner had not met the “fit and proper” test — in the case of the broadcaster of a pornography channel.Losing BSkyB would be a startling blow for the News Corporation, but one that could be mitigated by the reaction of analysts and investors, who have long urged that the company shed some minority-owned assets in an effort to raise its share price.In its report, the committee did not use the full term “fit and proper” in condemning Mr. Murdoch, a distinction that John Whittingdale, the committee’s Conservative nonvoting chairman, told the was significant. Media commentators said the phrasing appeared to be an effort not to throw the committee’s weight fully behind the Labour Party push for a regulator-ordered sell-off of News Corporation’s BSkyB interest.Mr. Murdoch released a message to News Corporation employees that sidestepped the criticism directed at him, stressing instead the company’s cooperation with the inquiry and his recognition of “mistakes we have made.”“I recognize that for all of us — myself in particular — it is difficult to read many of the report’s findings,” the memo said. “But we have done the most difficult part, which has been to take a long, hard and honest look at our past mistakes.“There is no easy way around this, but I am proud to say that we have been working hard to put things right.”In a statement from its New York headquarters, the company acknowledged “serious wrongdoing” but also said the committee was “wildly outside” its mandate in finding that Mr. Murdoch was “not a fit person.” It called that a purely partisan attempt to influence regulators.In a statement on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was reading the committee’s report “with interest” and would use it, along with other evidence, to make its final judgment on the News Corporation. It gave no timetable, but some analysts say they expected the decision before the summer.But it is significant, media analysts said, that Ofcom has openly discussed some of the evidence it is considering as it makes its assessment — evidence that at the very least presents an unflattering portrait of the News Corporation’s activities.The committee report singled out , the second son of the media tycoon, who until recently was head of the family’s media interests in Britain, for failing to act much earlier. “Had James Murdoch been more attentive to the correspondence that he received at the time, he could have taken action on phone hacking in 2008, and this committee could have been told the truth” during an earlier inquiry in 2009, the report said.It said the News Corporation had tried to blame lower-ranking executives while “striving to protect more senior figures, most notably James Murdoch.”The panel raised the possibility that three senior former managers at News International, , and , could be cited for contempt of Parliament for misleading the panel in their testimony.“I am shocked and disappointed by the culture, media and sport select committee’s allegations that I have misled Parliament and was ‘complicit’ in a cover-up,” Mr. Hinton said in a statement on Tuesday. “I refute these accusations utterly.” He said he would formally object to the findings.Mr. Myler, now the editor of The Daily News in New York, said he stood by his testimony. “I have always sought to be accurate and consistent in what I have said to the committee,” he said in a statement.Mr. Crone did not respond to a message seeking comment.The committee’s findings appeared certain to set off a new storm in Parliament, with the Labour opposition signaling that it would press for a vote finding the three men guilty of contempt of Parliament, a sanction rarely used in modern times that Labour supporters said would seriously damage the men’s reputations and careers.James Murdoch told the panel last week that when he took over News International in late 2007 — months after a News of the World reporter and a private investigator were jailed for hacking into the voice mail of members of the royal family — he believed that the affair had been settled.But that version has been challenged by Mr. Myler, a former editor of The News of the World, and Mr. Crone, the newspaper’s former legal manager — the executives accused by Rupert Murdoch of a cover-up. The men have testified that they told James Murdoch in June 2008 of the extent of the hacking, but Mr. Murdoch has said he did not learn of the extent of the practice until last year.In a measure of the damage to his interests since the scandal broke last year, Rupert Murdoch has closed the 168-year-old News of the World and the family has withdrawn a $12 billion bid to assume full control of BSkyB.For his part, James Murdoch has severed many business ties with Britain, although he remains on BSkyB’s board.Meanwhile, the company still faces investigations by and the Crown Prosecution Service, which the parliamentary committee criticized as failing to take action soon enough.The police in Britain have started three separate investigations into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and bribery of police officers. All have focused largely on Mr. Murdoch’s newspapers, but can extend to more general wrongdoing in newspapers he does not own.A public inquiry led by a judge, Brian Leveson, has also been calling witnesses under oath and publishing evidence on the “culture, practices and ethics of the press.” It has most recently sought to investigate allegations of inappropriate closeness between Mr. Murdoch, his family and closest executives, and the British political establishment.More than 40 people have been arrested and questioned — though not charged — including senior editors and executives at News International. They include , the former chief executive of News International, and , a former editor who left the company to become Mr. Cameron’s media adviser — a job he quit last year under pressure from the media scandal.'"

"'12-05-02,'0','He said American officials contacted him Thursday morning and said they would visit later in the day,In interviews Wednesday with Western journalists, Mr. Chen, said he wanted to leave China, preferably for the , because “guaranteeing citizens’ rights in China is empty talk,” an assertion that sharply undermines the American rationale for releasing him from diplomatic protection.“My safety and my family’s safety are not guaranteed even now,” he said. “Their promises have not been fulfilled.”The turn of events left Mrs. Clinton to begin her strategic dialogue with her Chinese counterparts on Thursday under a cloud of confusion. It also exposed the Obama administration to criticism from Republicans and human rights groups that it had rushed to resolve a delicate human rights case so that it would not overshadow other matters on the bilateral agenda that Mrs. Clinton previously called more important, including the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs and China’s currency and trade policies.Earlier in the day, senior State Department officials who had negotiated on Mr. Chen’s behalf said that he had repeatedly insisted he wanted to remain in China, and that the Chinese authorities had made concessions to make that possible. The officials said the Chinese had agreed to allow him to start a new life in Tianjin, a port city near the capital, where he could study law and live with his family. There, he would be free of the harassment and intimidation he had suffered for years at the hands of security officials in a rural village of Shandong Province, they said.Mrs. Clinton, who arrived in Beijing about six hours before Mr. Chen’s release, said after his departure that the Chinese government had given understandings about his future. “Making those commitments a reality is the next crucial task,” she said.She also said she was “pleased that we were able to facilitate Chen Guangcheng’s stay and departure from the U.S. Embassy in a way that reflected his choices and our values.”“I was glad to have the chance to speak with him today and to congratulate him on being reunited with his wife and children,” she said.But the deal began coming apart almost immediately, as the Chinese government issued a blistering statement to domestic news media saying the role the United States had played in the matter “is totally unacceptable to China.” The Foreign Ministry statement insisted that Washington offer an apology and punish officials involved in taking Mr. Chen into American protection.State Department officials disputed Mr. Chen’s assertion, made in interviews Wednesday with Western news media, that American officials had relayed threats against his family by the Chinese authorities.The officials said that they had passed along a Chinese message that Mr. Chen’s wife, Yuan Weijing, would be sent back to Shandong if he remained under American care, and that American officials could do nothing to ensure her safety there.“At no time did any U.S. official speak to Chen about physical or legal threats to his wife and children, nor did Chinese officials make any such threats to us,” Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. “U.S. interlocutors did make clear that if Chen elected to stay in the embassy, Chinese officials had indicated to us that his family would be returned to Shandong, and they would lose their opportunity to negotiate for reunification.”Mr. Chen’s statement he no longer wanted to stay in China contradicted what American officials said he had told them while in their care, and public statements Mr. Chen had made before he sought American protection.His reversal, perhaps the result of panic at being left alone in a big Beijing hospital after a long ordeal that had begun with a daring escape from house arrest nearly two weeks ago, or of true second thoughts, could turn out to be a reflection of the American rush to have the scheduled economic and security talks unimpeded by a messy human rights case.Mrs. Clinton has mentioned Mr. Chen’s bravery in public as one of the most startling among China’s human rights dissidents. But she has also made clear during her tenure as secretary of state that the vital economic and strategic dealings with China cannot become captive to the human rights cases.Mrs. Clinton left the details of the negotiations over Mr. Chen to two of her top officials, Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Harold Koh, the State Department legal adviser, and appeared to give her final blessing to the arrangements they had worked out after she landed in Beijing Wednesday morning.Mr. Campbell said he felt the agreement with the Chinese forged a new model for how Chinese dissidents could stay in China, if they wanted to, rather than seeking residence in another country and losing their voice inside their homeland. He said it was unrealistic to expect that a written accord outlining the Chinese assurances could have been completed.The deal came under sharp criticism in the United States.Representative , a Republican from and an outspoken critic of China’s human rights record, said that given Mr. Chen’s fears, the administration should have considered granting him asylum.“There are no safe places in China for dissidents,” Mr. Smith said. “Going to the hospital is no different from going to the police station.”An outspoken supporter in the United States of Chinese dissidents, Bob Fu, who heads the ChinaAid Association and was involved in Mr. Chen’s escape from security officials last week, said he feared the “U.S. side has abandoned Mr. Chen.”The trouble for the Americans began to emerge soon after 7 p.m. Wednesday when American diplomats and doctors at the hospital with Mr. Chen, who had injured his foot while fleeing house arrest, were told to leave by the hospital authorities, in accordance with visiting hours, two American officials said.Mr. Chen said his wife and two children were still with him in his room Thursday after being allowed to stay overnight, but he told friends and reporters who could get through to him on the phone that he had expected round-the-clock American protection. An American official involved in the negotiations said that the embassy called Mr. Chen at 9 p.m. and that he said he was fine.Jerome A. Cohen, a New York lawyer and a friend of Mr. Chen’s, said the dissident appeared to have panicked after being taken to the hospital. The authorities had cordoned off the room, denied visitors access and apparently limited his phone calls, Mr. Cohen said.“The trouble is nobody has appeared to stay with him,” Mr. Cohen said of the diplomats who escorted him to the hospital. “That must have produced panic. His friends couldn’t get through.”Perhaps most difficult for the State Department was the statement by Mr. Chen’s lawyer, Teng Biao, that his client had “changed his mind” and did not feel secure.Mr. Chen even chose to dispute an account by American senior officials that he was so ebullient in talking to Mrs. Clinton on the phone during his ride to the hospital that he had said in his broken English: “I want to kiss you.” Instead, Mr. Chen said in the interview Thursday, he had said he wanted to “see” her.Though the outcome of his case remained unclear, American officials said they felt the Chinese had been surprisingly forthcoming in their willingness to discuss the terms of Mr. Chen’s remaining in the country.Many experts had doubted after Mr. Chen sought American protection that the Chinese authorities would discuss the terms of a Chinese citizen’s rights under Chinese law with the United States, and that the standoff over his case could persist for a long time. Outlining the terms, American officials said the Chinese had agreed Mr. Chen could leave his home province, where he had suffered repeated abuses, and move to one of seven cities chosen by the two sides to study law.A self-educated lawyer, Mr. Chen indicated he wanted to study law at Tianjin, a city about 40 minutes from Beijing, they said.

"'12-05-02,'0','Re “In Turkey, Fears of a Retreat on Women’s Rights” (news article, April 29): It is disappointing to read such a one-sided account on the state of women’s rights in Turkey given the substantial efforts to achieve equality and security for millions of women.Our government has not only adopted far-reaching legislation that strengthens the authorities’ ability to prevent and prosecute violence against women, but it has also taken steps to ensure full implementation of these laws.We have intensified the training of law enforcement, health, judicial and other public officials, held numerous symposia and workshops, and launched a broad public education program to raise awareness about women’s issues in general and violence against women in particular.Turkey has also signed on to and followed through on international conventions dealing with women’s rights and has been conducting joint projects with regional and international institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union and the Council of Europe.To be sure, in Turkey, as in so many nations, there is much work to do when it comes to the challenge of women’s empowerment and gender equality. But your article missed the real story: we fully recognize this challenge, and we’re tackling it aggressively.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','In this campaign year, we are bound to hear endless complaints about excessive government regulation. But here’s an area where scientists are increasingly critical of our government for its failure to tackle Big Chem and regulate endocrine disruptors adequately.Last month, the Endocrine Society, the leading association of hormone experts, scolded the Food and Drug Administration for its failure to ban , a common endocrine disruptor known as BPA, from food packaging. Last year, eight medical organizations representing , gynecology, urology and other fields made a joint call in Science magazine for tighter regulation of endocrine disruptors.Shouldn’t our government be as vigilant about threats in our grocery stores as in the mountains of ?Researchers warn that endocrine disruptors can trigger hormonal changes in the body that may not show up for decades. One called DES, a synthetic form of , was once routinely given to pregnant women to prevent or , and it did little harm to the women themselves. But it turned out to cause and breast cancer decades later in their daughters, so it is now banned.Scientists have long known the tiniest variations in hormone levels influence fetal development. For example, a female twin is very slightly masculinized if the other twin is a male, because she is exposed to some of his hormones. Studies have found that these female , on average, end up slightly more aggressive and sensation-seeking as adults but have lower rates of .Now experts worry that endocrine disruptors have similar effects, acting as hormones and swamping the delicate balance for fetuses in particular. The latest initiative by scholars is a landmark 78-page analysis to be published next month in Endocrine Reviews, the leading publication in the field.“Fundamental changes in chemical testing and safety determination are needed to protect human health,” the analysis declares. Linda S. Birnbaum, the nation’s chief environmental scientist and toxicologist, endorsed the findings.The article was written by a 12-member panel that spent three years reviewing the evidence. It concluded that the nation’s safety system for endocrine disruptors is broken.“For several well-studied endocrine disruptors, I think it is fair to say that we have enough data to conclude that these chemicals are not safe for human populations,” said Laura Vandenberg, a Tufts University developmental biologist who was the lead writer for the panel.Worrying new research on the long-term effects of these chemicals is constantly being published. One study found that pregnant women who have higher levels of a common endocrine disruptor, PFOA, are three times as likely to have daughters who grow up to be overweight. Yet PFOA is unavoidable. It is in everything from microwave popcorn bags to carpet-cleaning solutions.Big Chem says all this is sensationalist science. So far, it has blocked strict regulation in the , even as Europe and Canada have adopted tighter controls on endocrine disruptors.Yes, there are uncertainties. But the scientists who know endocrine disruptors best overwhelmingly are already taking steps to protect their families. John Peterson Myers, chief scientist at Environmental Health Sciences and a co-author of the new analysis, said that his family had stopped buying canned food.“We don’t microwave in plastic,” he added. “We don’t use in our house. I refuse receipts whenever I can. My default request at the A.T.M., known to my bank, is ‘no receipt.’ I never ask for a receipt from a gas station.”I’m taking my cue from the experts, and I wish the Obama administration would as well.'"

"'12-05-02,'0','To the Editor: Regarding “Are Travel Agents Back?” (April 22): As a veteran agent with over 30 years in the industry, I feel that the article should be entitled “Young Travel Agents Rescuing an Endangered Profession.” Do older agents have no place in this trend? The article failed to address an important question. Do these young agents have the depth of knowledge that veteran agents with decades of experience can offer? Part of travel “navigation” is the sharing of deep destination knowledge. Also, as an aging baby boomer, I do speak the same “language” and understand the stage-of-life issues facing my generation right now.

"'12-05-02,'0','“When I saw that I my hand was cut, I was like, what? I was very upset and upset with myself. But never in a million years did I think I would cut my hand.”Stoudemire was disappointed that he would not be able to help his teammates Thursday — he said he had let them down — but added that he believed he could play in Sunday’s game. The Knicks list him as doubtful for Game 4.“I’m expecting to heal up fast,” Stoudemire said. “I think there’s a great chance I can play Sunday.”Knicks Coach Mike Woodson, however, was not planning on Stoudemire’s return.“I wait until the doctors tell me who’s ready,” Woodson said. “It’s not something I can undo. You don’t expect something like this to happen, but over the years, I’ve seen players do strange things.”Woodson added that Stoudemire was apologetic, although according to his teammates, there was no formal apology to the team. Nor was one sought.“He doesn’t have to apologize to me,” Steve Novak said after an unusually long practice session. “I know Amar’e wouldn’t do anything to hurt the team.”Carmelo Anthony said he talked on the telephone with Stoudemire on Tuesday, the day after the incident.“He feels bad and we talked about it,” Anthony said. “Right now, all I care about is him getting healthy.”At times Wednesday, Stoudemire appeared to be rationalizing the injury, as if to say he was an unlucky victim.“Everybody gets upset at times,” he said. “People knock over ice coolers or kick a chair or a table. It was accidental that I struck the glass. I just swung my arm backward.”Asked about fan reaction to the incident and criticism he has received, Stoudemire said: “I understand the fans are frustrated, and I am, too. But they have the wrong perception of what happened. I wasn’t trying to hurt myself and I didn’t punch a glass window. It was nothing like that.”After Stoudemire left the Knicks’ practice, and after his teammates and coaches faced 20 minutes of questioning about the chaotic Monday night postgame scene, the mood around the team suddenly changed to something a little more uplifting. In an elaborate ceremony broadcast nationally by the N.B.A., center Tyson Chandler was named the league’s defensive player of the year — the first Knick to win the award.Chandler, signed as a free agent before this season, said he was especially happy to be recognized because he is not among the top players in either blocked shots or steals.“I play defense by being in the right position and in many other fundamental and not always flashy ways,” he said. “So I’m glad that was recognized. I’ve always wanted to be considered one of the top defensive players in the league. But the defensive player of the year often goes to a big name. It’s just a dream for it to come my way.”The defensive work of Chandler and his teammates will have to be at its best Thursday against Miami. Much of the Knicks’ lineup is in flux. Woodson said Anthony would shift to power forward, where he played recently, and sometimes thrived, when Stoudemire was sidelined with a back injury, but was undecided about whom to start at small forward.“Whoever plays, we’re going to need a big push from everyone on the court,” Woodson said. “But I’m not unnerved by this situation. We’ve got a legitimate chance on our home court. We’ll see what we’re made of.”Point guard Jeremy Lin participated in a full-court three-on-three pickup game after practice. Wearing a brace on his surgically repaired left knee, Lin looked fluid and ran without a limp. “This is the first time he’s been able to run up and down,” Mike Woodson said. “The question is: Can he defend? Can he cut on the knee? We’ll wait and see how he feels. He’s talked about wanting to play but it’s up to a decision by the doctors.” ... The Knicks announced that Iman Shumpert had knee surgery and would need six to eight months to recover.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','Hallwalls, the first multidisciplinary artist-run space in Buffalo, was founded by a group that included Cindy Sherman and Michael Zwack in an ice-packing warehouse where they all had studios. But it was driven by Charles Clough and Robert Longo, a student at Buffalo State. (Mr. Clough’s mixed-media work “Eyes 2,” above, is an expanded version of the photographs of eyes he glued to walls throughout the building.)“Hallwalls was a better school than we could buy out there in the education market,” Mr. Clough said. The concept, he added, was to “figure out which artists ahead of us we were interested in and bring them in, and those artists got to know who we were, so that when we went to New York, we’d have an audience. And the fact that we were in proximity to the Albright and Artpark and Media Studies meant that we could bait them.”In late 1974 Mr. Longo approached Robert Irwin, who, to his surprise, offered to visit. “I basically called everybody and told them to come on over,” Mr. Longo recalled. “We talked about what we wanted to do, and he helped push it along.” Soon after, Mr. Clough mounted a huge works-on-paper show in the hallway (inviting “anybody who had any sort of avant-garde reputation,” he said), and Hallwalls was born. After that, Mr. Longo said, “contacting artists would become our M.O.”Among the many they lured were Jonathan Borofsky, whom Mr. Longo stalked through SoHo. Mr. Clough bagged Sol LeWitt, who handed over instructions for a piece that the group labored over for one beer- and marijuana-filled evening. “They had incredible enthusiasm,” said Vito Acconci, who created an installation there in 1975. “They seemed so involved that it was impossible not to get swept up.” (Two years later, when Mr. Longo moved to New York with Ms. Sherman, his girlfriend at the time, Mr. Acconci was so swept up that he hired Mr. Longo as a studio assistant.)The early ’70s was a time of transformation for Lewiston State Park, on 172 acres alongside the Niagara River Gorge, into a cultural oasis. It reopened as Artpark in 1974, its first season dedicated to the memory of the land artist Robert Smithson, offering a vast array of performances and public workshops. Artpark also ran a summer residency program in which artists made projects on site.That’s how Gordon Matta-Clark came to carry out his renowned 1974 house deconstruction, “Bingo,” on an abandoned building in Niagara Falls. In 1975 the earth artist Alan Saret built “Ghosthouse,” a teepeelike structure of wire mesh, and tried to live there until the freezing weather drove him out. The first artist invited was Charles Simonds, known for building miniature dwellings for an imaginary civilization on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which he continued in the park. He collaborated with local teenagers to build a stone house and cairns (above) in the ruins of a railway tunnel.But Artpark had a darker history. Part of it had been used as an industrial waste dump, and when he arrived weeks before the opening, he found construction workers complaining of chemical burns. That’s when he realized that “Artpark was a cosmetic overlay on what could have become another Love Canal,” he said. (That’s why he sited his project further into the gorge.)Buffalo’s first photography gallery, the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts was founded by the photographer Robert Muffoletto in 1974 — a time when, according to Ellen Carey, there was virtually “no platform to show new work and no place to talk about photography.” It soon became a go-to place for anyone interested in the field (and also offered talks, poetry readings and music performances). Ms. Carey exhibited her work there for the first time, in a group show with Cindy Sherman, then a student at Buffalo State.The two also showed together in 1976, in the center’s first Metro Bus series, which put artists’ photographs in the slots on buses normally reserved for advertisements. Ms. Sherman contributed a series of photographs of fictional passengers in which she played each role. Ms. Carey offered a group of experimental portraits, including the self-portrait at left. (She made it by sitting in front of a camera set for a long exposure and drawing in the air with a light pen, a technique borrowed from Man Ray.)Although Mr. Muffoletto warned them they might lose their work, “people were very respectful,” Ms. Carey said. “I got it all back.”Steina Vasulka, “Allvision,” 1976 (seen in the exhibition “The Vasulkas,” 1978)Although the Albright-Knox had shown new art in the past, the museum made a commitment to it in 1975 by hiring the young curator Linda Cathcart. Formerly an intern at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where she worked with Marcia Tucker (the founder of the New Museum), Ms. Cathcart gave early museum shows to Bruce Nauman, Ed Ruscha (then known mostly on the West Coast), Hannah Wilke, Gilbert & George and the video pioneers Steina and Woody Vasulka. (Ms. Vasulka’s robotic video sculpture “Allvision,” shown above in the couple’s 1978 show, has been refurbished for the exhibition.)But Ms. Cathcart’s most significant move was to collaborate with other Buffalo arts groups, notably Hallwalls, mounting joint shows of artists like Charles Simonds and the sculptor Joel Shapiro. She also changed the museum’s annual regional art survey, adding an invitational section that gave many young artists, including Robert Longo and Charles Clough, their first chance to show in a museum. “We had to make pieces for the show,” Mr. Longo recalled. “It was this really incredible breakthrough.” It was also life changing. In the survey Mr. Longo was discovered by Douglas Crimp, the curator of the 1977 “Pictures” show at Artists Space, which made his name in New York.Buffalo’s avant-garde began taking shape in the early 1960s, when the private University of Buffalo was absorbed by the State University of New York. Ms. Pesanti said the resulting influx of students came with a surge of government financing, which opened up scores of faculty positions. One went to Gerald O’Grady, a medieval literature specialist who also had a burning interest in media studies, a field then in its infancy.In 1971 Mr. O’Grady founded Media Study/Buffalo, a nonprofit exhibition space that offered film and video workshops and access to equipment. Two years later he persuaded the university to start its own Center for Media Study, one of the first film and video departments in the country. His first faculty hires were the structuralist film pioneers Hollis Frampton and Paul Sharits. (Mr. Sharits’s groundbreaking four-projector film “Dream Displacement,” above, was recreated for the exhibition.) Then came Steina and Woody Vasulka, the founders of the Kitchen in New York, and Tony Conrad, the Minimalist musician, experimental filmmaker and video artist.“I could have been in New York City, but it was almost the same thing to be in Buffalo,” said Mr. Conrad, who joined the faculty in 1976 and remains there. “In fact there were things that were better, because of the funding resources, and the animated spirit of the young people in our program and other places in the city.” Bill Viola, who also visited frequently in the 1970s, agreed. “Everybody managed to go through Buffalo,” he said. “It was kind of the mecca.”'"
"'12-05-02,'0','Economic issues have been overshadowed by diplomatic ones in advance of Mr. Geithner’s meetings Thursday, which will include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and officials from the upper echelons of the Chinese government. Last week, Chen Guangcheng, a blind human rights lawyer, escaped from Chinese security forces and sought refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing. On Wednesday, he left the compound, but his fate remained unclear.A senior administration official in the American delegation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid disturbing diplomatic relations, said that the incident had not seemed to disrupt the economic dialogue, even as it had taken some attention from it.Officials on both sides, who had spent about two months negotiating before the meetings, were determined to pursue their respective agendas, and early sessions were congenial, the administration official said.“Both sides are bending over backward to not make strong statements about the issue,” said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China specialist at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research group. Mr. Lardy said in a call with reporters that he expected open talks but little progress.Mr. Geithner’s central goal is to encourage changes to make the Chinese currency and financial systems more responsive to market forces, with exchange rate and interest rate controls as main points of American concern.The renminbi has appreciated about 30 percent against the dollar since 2005, adjusting for both economies’ rates of inflation.Beijing had halted the currency appreciation during the financial crisis from summer 2008 to mid-2010 to help increase the competitiveness of Chinese exporters and maintain China’s rapid pace of economic growth. But the government allowed the currency to resume its upward drift in 2010, to applause from the Obama administration.The rate of appreciation initially spiked. But about 18 months ago, it started to fall, and the currency remains too cheap relative to the dollar, according to the Congressional Research Service.The American official taking part in the dialogue said that in response to the widespread worries, the Chinese government might have halted the renminbi’s appreciation or even allowed the currency to fall in value relative to the dollar over the winter. But that did not happen, the official said, for which Washington gave China’s government credit.Moreover, last month the Chinese central bank widened the currency’s trading band to a daily range of 1 percent from a range of 0.5 percent, letting market forces play a bigger role in determining the value of the currency versus the dollar.The appreciation of the currency and other changes by the Chinese government have started to rebalance the country’s economy.China’s current-account surplus, a measure of how much more the country exports than it imports, fell to less than 3 percent of economic output in 2011 from about 10 percent in 2010. Its trade surplus has fallen as well. And as the government has eased certain controls, more Chinese companies are investing overseas.But an International Monetary Fund report released in April warned that the changes have not been a result of increased consumption as a share of Chinese economic output, which the fund and the Obama administration describe as vital for the world economy.Instead, the results were because of trade and currency dynamics. “Sustainable rebalancing will depend on China’s successful transition from investment-led to consumption-led growth,” the report said.The official said that given the brightening global outlook, Washington expected the currency appreciation to continue, and would press for that and a variety of economic and financial changes at the meeting.In the April speech, Mr. Geithner focused on changing China’s financial system: loosening state controls on interest rates, leveling the playing field so that private companies can compete with China’s state-owned enterprises and allowing the value of the renminbi to be determined by market forces.Progress on the currency issue is expected to be slow but consistent.“For so long, that’s been the flash point in the bilateral relationship,” said William R. Cline, a former Treasury official now at the Peterson Institute. But the global recession seemed to convince China that absolute reliance on exports for growth was a “risky strategy,” he said.The administration has applauded China’s efforts to let its currency appreciate, but it remains a hot-button issue in Washington.The Senate last year passed a bill punishing China for undervaluing its currency but the bill never passed the House.Moreover, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, has repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to name China as a “currency manipulator,” a term the Obama administration has avoided.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','ALBANY — Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan and New York State’s bishops are calling on the Legislature to increase the minimum wage, adding an influential source of support to a proposal that has divided lawmakers along party lines.In a statement to be released on Thursday, Cardinal Dolan, the archbishop of New York, and the bishops express concern that “it is becoming increasingly difficult for the working poor of our state to make ends meet” and urge a “modest” increase in the minimum wage, now $7.25 an hour.Referring to full-time employees who earn the minimum wage, the statement said, “Our sustained recession and painfully slow recovery have left many of these workers — often people of color and frequently the newest immigrants to our shores who therefore have the fewest support systems — on the brink of homelessness, with not enough in their paychecks to pay for the most basic of necessities, like food, medicine or clothing for their children.”The statement, which was obtained by The New York Times in advance of its release, comes as Albany lawmakers continue to debate whether to increase the minimum wage. The proposal has emerged as the most divisive issue in the closing weeks of this year’s legislative session, which is scheduled to conclude next month.The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, is seeking to raise the wage to $8.50, and he has made the minimum wage his top priority this year. The current wage is lower than that in 18 states and the District of Columbia.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','According to security consultants, kidnappers generally prey on victims more vulnerable than business travelers, who tend to limit time in dicey destinations and keep irregular schedules. But sometimes even the business class gets swept up in this rising international crime wave.Many companies offer help in response, among them international insurance companies, secretive consultants who manage hostage situations and local outfits offering abduction prevention courses. As the Web site of Chartis, a leading underwriter of kidnapping insurance, says: “Kidnapping is not a rare occurrence; it’s big business.”Kidnapping for ransom is on the rise in many countries. In 2011, the Mexican government reported a more than 300 percent increase in the crime since 2005. The United States State Department Web site, which tracks worldwide crime trends, warns of “alarming increases” in kidnapping in Venezuela, and that abductions in Pakistan “continued to increase dramatically nationwide.” But statistics can be difficult to gather, and the numbers of victims are likely underestimated. Many released hostages refuse to report the crime; some fear attracting copycat criminals, while others distrust corrupt police who moonlight as kidnappers. In Venezuela, for instance, the State Department estimates that roughly four out of five kidnappings are not reported.Insurance companies say business is brisk. “Kidnapping and ransom is a very profitable insurance business,” said Ana Paula Menezes, a former underwriter. Kidnap insurance policies typically include the services of response teams that coach victims’ families on everything from proof-of-life questions to ransom prices, which the policies reimburse. “Generally, the family will have someone in front of them within 24 hours,” said Jeff Green, the director of Griffin Underwriting, which specializes in kidnap and ransom insurance. He explained the kidnapping bargaining process: “It’s a business negotiation, where somebody is trying to sell something — and you know you are going to buy it, you have to buy it. But the advantage you have is that you are the only buyer, because they have no value to anyone else.”Some response consultants deal directly with clients lacking kidnapping coverage. “It’ll cost you at least $3,000 a day, and it’s going to be money up front,” said Christopher T. Voss, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business and former lead international kidnapping negotiator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Several security companies market antikidnapping training. For $650, Risks Incorporated in Miami, for instance, promises to teach students about the “real world of terrorism and kidnap and ransom!” And, yes, there’s an anti-kidnap app. BrickHouse Security, a surveillance emporium, sells Executrac software ($29.95 and a $19.95 monthly subscription), “a powerful, invisible application that turns any BlackBerry or smartphone into a covert GPS tracker with an emergency panic button.”Mr. Voss questions the value of tracking technology. Kidnappers are “more and more aware these days that the phone can be tracked,” he said. He gave some advice to travelers visiting high-risk countries: “Get off the X, No. 1. The X is the spot where the kidnappers try and take you.” Mr. Voss argues that running away from abductors, if possible, can make sense.“Kidnappers generally don’t pursue,” said Mr. Voss. “They’re not runners. And they are not going to shoot at you. It’s a waste of ammunition and they will probably miss anyway.”He said he came to that controversial conclusion when a former Navy Seal trainer, a classmate of his at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, told him: “Let’s be honest, the Navy Seals, when we do renditions” — the spiriting of people from one nation to another — “effectively we’re doing kidnappings. Nobody is better at it than we are. We are the most organized, and not one person, not one of us, was assigned to chase anybody. If we’re not chasers, then the bad guys aren’t chasers.’”Mr. Voss also urges business travelers to vary their routine, even if it means being intentionally late to appointments. “A good businessman is on time and consistent,” said Mr. Voss. “And a lot of businessmen are horrified at the idea of breaking out of consistency. If you vary your schedule by 10 minutes, 15 minutes, one way or the other, you can throw the bad guys off enough that they just might look for someone who is a little more precise.”In a coming book, “International Security: Personal Protection in an Uncertain World,” Orlando Wilson, a security consultant, suggests another common-sense strategy for travelers: “Do not draw attention to yourself. Consider what you wear and drive, don’t be loud and rowdy. And don’t tell strangers too much about yourself.”That can be a challenge in an era of oversharing. Marivel Andreu of the Celedinas Insurance Group in Miami warns against revealing to Facebook friends travel plans — or lunch plans.Her clients, often wealthy families in Latin America, “are sharing all sorts of information, where they’re traveling, where they are, where they’re not, and, unfortunately, the kidnappers are using that information against them.”A report, “Expatriate Risk Management: Kidnapping and Ransom,” by Richard A. Posthuma, professor of management at the University of Texas at El Paso, found that the length of time that Mexican kidnappers conducted surveillance decreased as they deploy “more sophisticated surveillance techniques,” like monitoring social media.Julie Mulligan of Drayton Valley, Alberta, concedes she maintained a high profile while leading a Rotary Club exchange trip to Kaduna, Nigeria, in 2009. She appeared on a local TV show, and soon after kidnappers dragged her out of her host’s car. Held nearly two weeks, hobbling around on the high heels she wore when snatched, Ms. Mulligan “had some really dark moments.”At one point, she contemplated an escape and hid keys to the house where she was held. Her guard discovered the keys and flew into a rage. “He raised his arm to hit me, and he called me ‘woman.’ ” Before that, said Ms. Mulligan, “he had been calling me ‘Auntie,’ a sign of respect for an older woman.”Despite the psychological scars from captivity — “Anybody that’s been kidnapped for more than 24 hours, the life that they knew is gone. It’s over,” said Mr. Voss — Ms. Mulligan says her experience actually enriched her life.“I started writing this list of people who were part of the fabric of my life,” she said. For days, Ms. Mulligan edited the list on a piece of cardboard, stopping at 472 names. “When I got home I found out, realized, that it could have been so much bigger.” While she struggled to survive, eating little but white rice, stung by countless mosquitoes and threatened by guards the age of her children, she was “humbled” to learn that the churches in her town had united for an interdenominational prayer service. “The biggest thing that I have to say that I’ve understood is the goodness, the innate goodness of people,” she said.Mr. de Ronde, the Dutch kidnapping victim, agrees that even brutal kidnappings can prove strangely liberating. “You feel the things that you are not doing right in your life,” he said. Before his trip to South Africa, he and his wife planned to buy a large house in Rotterdam, but after the kidnapping he canceled the contract. “We went on a holiday straight away, and we said, what do we really want to do in life? One of the things was, we can continue working, working, working. As I am married to a Chinese wife, I said I want to experience more of your culture.”Mr. de Ronde and his family moved to China. He did not say where.'"
"'12-05-02,'0','PROS Tingo offers an extensive hotel inventory (powered by the Affiliate Network) of tens of thousands of hotels in major destinations. The automatic refund process means travelers do nothing but reserve and then wait for a refund if the price drops. There are no booking fees involved. Tingo doesn’t charge a cancellation fee, either; only the hotel’s cancellation policy applies.CONS You may miss out on a cheaper price that the hotel offers directly. For example, a search on Tingo for a three-day mid-May hotel stay in turned up 125 hotels, including the Hotel of South Beach for about $312 a night including and fees — about $35 a night more than the hotel itself was offering for the same “designer” standard room. Refunds are not available for prepaid, nonrefundable hotels, which are also listed on the site.BOTTOM LINE It’s a no-brainer. Even if you later find a cheaper nonrefundable rate on the hotel’s own Web site, you can cancel your Tingo reservation without being charged if it is within the refund time frame, and go with the cheaper rate.HOW IT WORKS This airfare booking site has a Price Drop Payback program, which reimburses customers the fare difference if they find a lower rate for the same coach ticket on the site before their trip.PROS The service offers reassurance to diligent customers who check the site regularly after they book (which requires a $9.95 fee) that they won’t miss out on a lower price if one becomes available. Customers can easily check prices with one click to see if they have dropped.CONS Payouts are not automatic. While the site makes it easy for customers to see if the fare has dropped by clicking the “Price Drop Payback” button on their itinerary page, customers must do the work — monitoring the price by checking back often and then requesting reimbursement. Price Drop Payback does not apply to airfares on other Web sites. Customers don’t get cash back, either. Rather, reimbursements, which start at $10 and are capped at $100 per ticket, are issued in the form of a voucher for future bookings on the site. Another obstacle: each ticket is eligible for only one Price Drop Payback . So if the price drops even more after you accept a travel credit, you will not be eligible for additional credits for further price drops on the same itinerary.BOTTOM LINE CheapAir’s payback program makes price drops transparent by allowing travelers to track the flight themselves with a click of the mouse. But getting that refund involves repeatedly returning to the site to monitor price drops, and using what amounts to guesswork when it comes to determining when to claim the credit.HOW IT WORKS This online travel agency offers a refund service called Price Assurance for airfare and hotel bookings. Unlike Tingo, which refunds customers when the price drops, has a hurdle: to receive a refund when the price goes down, another Orbitz customer must have subsequently reserved the same flight (and type of ticket) or the same category room in the same hotel (and on the same date) on Orbitz for less. For example, let’s say you book a hotel on Orbitz for $200 a night. A few days later the hotel lowers the rate listed on Orbitz to $150, and another Orbitz customer reserves the room for the same night at the lower rate. Then Orbitz would automatically refund you $50. If no Orbitz customer books at the lower rate, then you don’t get the refund. Since it started the service for flights in 2008 and hotels in 2009, Orbitz says it has sent out more than 170,000 checks totaling more than $10 million.PROS Unlike Tingo, which offers money back only for fully refundable bookings, you can book a prepaid, nonrefundable hotel or flight and get a refund — as long as another Orbitz customer subsequently books it at a lower price. As with Tingo, there are no fees and no work on your part other than the initial booking. Orbitz continues tracking until your trip, and each time the price drops and another customer reserves your same room or flight for a lower amount, your refund increases.CONS Customers don’t get any money back when the price goes down unless another Orbitz customer books that same type of hotel room or flight for less than the price you paid. Price Assurance doesn’t apply to packages that bundle airfare and hotel together. And refunds, which are cut as a check and typically take about six to eight weeks to arrive after your trip, are capped at $250 per airline ticket and $500 per hotel room.BOTTOM LINE Some travelers might prefer Tingo’s money-back service for hotel bookings because its refunds aren’t based on someone else booking the same hotel room, and the amount that can be refunded isn’t capped. But there is no better option for flights than Orbitz if you want to avoid the chore of constantly checking prices in order to finagle a refund.'"

"'12-05-02,'0','Earlier in the day, Mr. Osborne challenged his fellow European finance ministers to carry out the international accord, known as Basel III, raising the minimum amount of capital that banks are required to hold.But after 10 hours of talks, a testy Mr. Osborne said that a deal on the table was inadequate because it failed to take into account his concerns and would subject Europe, and him, to ridicule at a time when the region was struggling to emerge from its debt crisis.“We’re not implementing the Basel agreement, as anyone who takes a look at this text will be able to tell you — every bank analyst, every financial journalist, every other finance ministry in the world would say that,” said Mr. Osborne, referring to Basel III, the accord to raise the minimum amount of capital that banks are required to hold.“I am not prepared to go out there and say something that would make me look like an idiot five minutes later,” Mr. Osborne said.Miroslav Kalousek, the Czech finance minister, shot back, “George, looking like an idiot is one of the basic qualifications for a minister.”That drew peals of laughter from assembled ministers at the late-night gathering in Brussels, but Mr. Osborne was infuriated by the jab.“I represent the largest banking industry around this table by far,” Mr. Osborne said solemnly. “You’ve got to allow me to sit down and go through the issues, and you have not done that for 10 hours,” he said.Mr. Osborne insisted that he was seeking rules that would be acceptable to regulators and authorities around the world including Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank, and his successor, Mario Draghi. “I will not be painted as somehow being anti-European or demanding something especially for London,” Mr. Osborne said.Other ministers attending the meeting raised strong concerns about the proposed text, including Jacek Rostowski, the Polish finance minister.Osborne said he supported efforts to reach a deal in negotiations that stretched well into Thursday morning.Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, also expressed some concern, but had said a deal still was within sight. But France’s finance minister, François Baroin, left the meeting before the dust-up to watch the French presidential debate on television.The ministers had been seeking agreement on requirements for banks to hold capital reserves that would function as a cushion against future losses. The idea is to help avoid financial crises like the one brought on by the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.The European Union faces a deadline of January 2013 to start phasing in rules agreed on by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision raising the minimum reserve to 7 percent of a bank’s assets.Backed by Sweden, Britain held firm to its demand that national regulators retain the option to require their banks to build up higher reserves than foreseen under a proposal by the European Commission, the European Union’s executive body, without prior approval.Britain has the largest banking sector in Europe in relation to gross domestic product, followed by Sweden, and has long fought efforts by the European authorities to exercise greater control over the City of London, the biggest financial center in Europe.But central governments in London and Stockholm are also extremely wary of putting taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts of their banking sectors.“My country has been very, very close to very deep problems in the banking sector twice and we don’t want to be there again,” Anders Borg, the Swedish finance minister, told his counterparts at the meeting earlier in the day.Mr. Borg sought to dismiss the view that Sweden and other nations that support more stringent requirements were seeking to attract more business for their sectors on the basis that they would be better capitalized than their rivals.“We are not trying to make our own banking system gain a competitive advantage to somebody else,” he said. “We are trying to safeguard our taxpayers and our society from the risks that a large banking sector is creating.”France and Austria are among nations that firmly opposed that view, saying that raising reserve requirements in one country could lead banks based there to reduce lending to their foreign subsidiaries, in turn damaging the economies of those nations.'"

"'12-05-02,'0','Outside of Sotheby’s, there was excitement of a different kind, as demonstrators protesting the company’s longtime lockout of art handlers waved placards with the image of “The Scream” along with the motto, “Sotheby’s: Bad for Art.” Many in the group — a mix of union members and protesters — even screamed themselves when the Munch went on the block. (Munch’s work was an apt focus for the group, said one protester, Yates McKee: “It exemplifies the ways in which objects of artistic creativity become the exclusive province of the 1 percent.”)Inside, the atmosphere generated by the Munch’s record price carried through the rest of the auction, which saw high prices for everything from Picasso paintings to sculptures by Giacometti and Brancusi.Of the 76 lots on offer, 15 failed to sell. The evening’s total was $330.56 million, close to its high estimate of $323 million. (Final prices include the buyer’s commission to Sotheby’s: 25 percent of the first $50,000; 20 percent of the next $50,000 to $1 million and 12 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)As is often true of auctions with star attractions, having “The Scream” for sale helped win other business. Its inclusion was a draw, for example, for the estate of , the financier, who died in November. The top work in his collection was Picasso’s “Femme Assise Dans un Fauteuil,” a 1941 portrait of , the artist’s muse and lover, posed in a chair. The painting went for $26 million, or $29.2 million with fees, within its estimated $20 million to $30 million.In 2004, Mr. Forstmann bought Soutine’s “Le Chasseur de chez Maxim’s,” a 1925 portrait of an employee at the celebrated French restaurant, for $6.7 million at a Sotheby’s auction. It had belonged to Wendell Cherry, vice chairman of the Louisville-based health care company , who died in 1991, and his wife, Dorothy. On Wednesday night the painting was up for sale again, this time with a $10 million to $15 million estimate, which turned out to be optimistic. Two bidders went for the Soutine, which ended up selling to a telephone bidder, working through Mr. Moffett, for $8.3 million, or $9.3 million with fees.More popular, however, was an 1892 Gauguin landscape, “Cabane Sous les Arbres,” which Mr. Forstmann had bought at Christie’s in 2002 for $4.6 million. On Wednesday night it was estimated to sell for $5 million to $7 million, but there were four bidders for the canvas, and it sold for $8.4 million.Surrealism has been the rage recently, and Sotheby’s had many examples to sell. Among the best was Dalí’s “Printemps Nécrophilique,” a 1936 painting that once belonged to Elsa Schiaparelli, the couturier closely associated with the Surrealist movement who collaborated on designs with Dalí. Six bidders fought over the painting, which went for $16.3 million, well above its $12 million high estimate.Another popular Surrealist image was Ernst’s “Leonora in the Morning Light,” a 1940 painting that depicts his lover, Leonora Carrington, a Mexican artist of English birth, emerging from a lush jungle. It brought $7.9 million, above its $5 million high estimate.A gilded bronze head that Brancusi conceived and cast in 1911 was another of the evening’s top sellers, bringing $12.6 million, well above its $6 million to $8 million estimate.But it was the record price for “The Scream” that captured everyone’s imagination. As soon as the hammer fell, rumors began circulating about who the buyer could be. Among the names floated were the financier Leonard Blavatnik, the tycoon and members of the Qatari royal family.While some were surprised at the price, one Munch enthusiast was not: “It’s nice to see the centrality of in the mainstream of western culture,” said Ivor Braka, a dealer. “The scream is more than a painting, it’s a symbol of as it anticipates the 20th-century traumas of mankind.”'"

"'12-05-03,'0','In this campaign year, we are bound to hear endless complaints about excessive government regulation. But here’s an area where scientists are increasingly critical of our government for its failure to tackle Big Chem and regulate endocrine disruptors adequately.Last month, the Endocrine Society, the leading association of hormone experts, scolded the Food and Drug Administration for its failure to ban , a common endocrine disruptor known as BPA, from food packaging. Last year, eight medical organizations representing , gynecology, urology and other fields made a joint call in Science magazine for tighter regulation of endocrine disruptors.Shouldn’t our government be as vigilant about threats in our grocery stores as in the mountains of ?Researchers warn that endocrine disruptors can trigger hormonal changes in the body that may not show up for decades. One called DES, a synthetic form of , was once routinely given to pregnant women to prevent or , and it did little harm to the women themselves. But it turned out to cause and breast cancer decades later in their daughters, so it is now banned.Scientists have long known the tiniest variations in hormone levels influence fetal development. For example, a female twin is very slightly masculinized if the other twin is a male, because she is exposed to some of his hormones. Studies have found that these female , on average, end up slightly more aggressive and sensation-seeking as adults but have lower rates of .Now experts worry that endocrine disruptors have similar effects, acting as hormones and swamping the delicate balance for fetuses in particular. The latest initiative by scholars is a landmark 78-page analysis to be published next month in Endocrine Reviews, the leading publication in the field.“Fundamental changes in chemical testing and safety determination are needed to protect human health,” the analysis declares. Linda S. Birnbaum, the nation’s chief environmental scientist and toxicologist, endorsed the findings.The article was written by a 12-member panel that spent three years reviewing the evidence. It concluded that the nation’s safety system for endocrine disruptors is broken.“For several well-studied endocrine disruptors, I think it is fair to say that we have enough data to conclude that these chemicals are not safe for human populations,” said Laura Vandenberg, a Tufts University developmental biologist who was the lead writer for the panel.Worrying new research on the long-term effects of these chemicals is constantly being published. One study found that pregnant women who have higher levels of a common endocrine disruptor, PFOA, are three times as likely to have daughters who grow up to be overweight. Yet PFOA is unavoidable. It is in everything from microwave popcorn bags to carpet-cleaning solutions.Big Chem says all this is sensationalist science. So far, it has blocked strict regulation in the , even as Europe and Canada have adopted tighter controls on endocrine disruptors.Yes, there are uncertainties. But the scientists who know endocrine disruptors best overwhelmingly are already taking steps to protect their families. John Peterson Myers, chief scientist at Environmental Health Sciences and a co-author of the new analysis, said that his family had stopped buying canned food.“We don’t microwave in plastic,” he added. “We don’t use in our house. I refuse receipts whenever I can. My default request at the A.T.M., known to my bank, is ‘no receipt.’ I never ask for a receipt from a gas station.”I’m taking my cue from the experts, and I wish the Obama administration would as well.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','ALBANY — Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan and New York State’s bishops are calling on the Legislature to increase the minimum wage, adding an influential source of support to a proposal that has divided lawmakers along party lines.In a statement to be released on Thursday, Cardinal Dolan, the archbishop of New York, and the bishops express concern that “it is becoming increasingly difficult for the working poor of our state to make ends meet” and urge a “modest” increase in the minimum wage, now $7.25 an hour.Referring to full-time employees who earn the minimum wage, the statement said, “Our sustained recession and painfully slow recovery have left many of these workers — often people of color and frequently the newest immigrants to our shores who therefore have the fewest support systems — on the brink of homelessness, with not enough in their paychecks to pay for the most basic of necessities, like food, medicine or clothing for their children.”The statement, which was obtained by The New York Times in advance of its release, comes as Albany lawmakers continue to debate whether to increase the minimum wage. The proposal has emerged as the most divisive issue in the closing weeks of this year’s legislative session, which is scheduled to conclude next month.The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, is seeking to raise the wage to $8.50, and he has made the minimum wage his top priority this year. The current wage is lower than that in 18 states and the District of Columbia.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','Economic issues have been overshadowed by diplomatic ones in advance of Mr. Geithner’s meetings Thursday, which will include Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and officials from the upper echelons of the Chinese government. Last week, Chen Guangcheng, a blind human rights lawyer, escaped from Chinese security forces and sought refuge in the United States Embassy in Beijing. On Wednesday, he left the compound, but his fate remained unclear.A senior administration official in the American delegation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid disturbing diplomatic relations, said that the incident had not seemed to disrupt the economic dialogue, even as it had taken some attention from it.Officials on both sides, who had spent about two months negotiating before the meetings, were determined to pursue their respective agendas, and early sessions were congenial, the administration official said.“Both sides are bending over backward to not make strong statements about the issue,” said Nicholas R. Lardy, a China specialist at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based research group. Mr. Lardy said in a call with reporters that he expected open talks but little progress.Mr. Geithner’s central goal is to encourage changes to make the Chinese currency and financial systems more responsive to market forces, with exchange rate and interest rate controls as main points of American concern.The renminbi has appreciated about 30 percent against the dollar since 2005, adjusting for both economies’ rates of inflation.Beijing had halted the currency appreciation during the financial crisis from summer 2008 to mid-2010 to help increase the competitiveness of Chinese exporters and maintain China’s rapid pace of economic growth. But the government allowed the currency to resume its upward drift in 2010, to applause from the Obama administration.The rate of appreciation initially spiked. But about 18 months ago, it started to fall, and the currency remains too cheap relative to the dollar, according to the Congressional Research Service.The American official taking part in the dialogue said that in response to the widespread worries, the Chinese government might have halted the renminbi’s appreciation or even allowed the currency to fall in value relative to the dollar over the winter. But that did not happen, the official said, for which Washington gave China’s government credit.Moreover, last month the Chinese central bank widened the currency’s trading band to a daily range of 1 percent from a range of 0.5 percent, letting market forces play a bigger role in determining the value of the currency versus the dollar.The appreciation of the currency and other changes by the Chinese government have started to rebalance the country’s economy.China’s current-account surplus, a measure of how much more the country exports than it imports, fell to less than 3 percent of economic output in 2011 from about 10 percent in 2010. Its trade surplus has fallen as well. And as the government has eased certain controls, more Chinese companies are investing overseas.But an International Monetary Fund report released in April warned that the changes have not been a result of increased consumption as a share of Chinese economic output, which the fund and the Obama administration describe as vital for the world economy.Instead, the results were because of trade and currency dynamics. “Sustainable rebalancing will depend on China’s successful transition from investment-led to consumption-led growth,” the report said.The official said that given the brightening global outlook, Washington expected the currency appreciation to continue, and would press for that and a variety of economic and financial changes at the meeting.In the April speech, Mr. Geithner focused on changing China’s financial system: loosening state controls on interest rates, leveling the playing field so that private companies can compete with China’s state-owned enterprises and allowing the value of the renminbi to be determined by market forces.Progress on the currency issue is expected to be slow but consistent.“For so long, that’s been the flash point in the bilateral relationship,” said William R. Cline, a former Treasury official now at the Peterson Institute. But the global recession seemed to convince China that absolute reliance on exports for growth was a “risky strategy,” he said.The administration has applauded China’s efforts to let its currency appreciate, but it remains a hot-button issue in Washington.The Senate last year passed a bill punishing China for undervaluing its currency but the bill never passed the House.Moreover, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, has repeatedly promised on the campaign trail to name China as a “currency manipulator,” a term the Obama administration has avoided.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','Re “In Turkey, Fears of a Retreat on Women’s Rights” (news article, April 29): It is disappointing to read such a one-sided account on the state of women’s rights in Turkey given the substantial efforts to achieve equality and security for millions of women.Our government has not only adopted far-reaching legislation that strengthens the authorities’ ability to prevent and prosecute violence against women, but it has also taken steps to ensure full implementation of these laws.We have intensified the training of law enforcement, health, judicial and other public officials, held numerous symposia and workshops, and launched a broad public education program to raise awareness about women’s issues in general and violence against women in particular.Turkey has also signed on to and followed through on international conventions dealing with women’s rights and has been conducting joint projects with regional and international institutions such as the United Nations, the European Union and the Council of Europe.To be sure, in Turkey, as in so many nations, there is much work to do when it comes to the challenge of women’s empowerment and gender equality. But your article missed the real story: we fully recognize this challenge, and we’re tackling it aggressively.'"

"'12-05-03,'0','Blabbing on a business trip can cause repercussions.In 2009, Robert B. Robbins, a partner in the Washington office of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman, unwittingly broadcast his law firm’s intention to lay off several associates to fellow Amtrak passengers. In a cellphone call, the lawyer named co-workers facing unemployment. The indiscretion mortified a law student on the train, who alerted the blog Above the Law.News of the gaffe prompted Mr. Robbins’s law firm to publicly apologize “for the unfortunate manner in which our deliberations about reductions have become public.” Mr. Robbins kept his job but got a new nickname: Acela Bob.In an age of hyperconnectivity, when several airlines offer in-flight cellphone service and an increasing number of buses, trains and even taxis now provide Wi-Fi access, business travelers routinely expose proprietary information.“People are woefully lax” about information security practices, said Cynthia Cheng Correia, who teaches a course at Simmons College in Boston on competitive intelligence, which is the legal and ethical monitoring of business or professional rivals.Ms. Cheng Correia pointed out that you could give away the store without saying a word. On one flight, she sat next to a sales manager working on a database marked “clients.” Ms. Cheng Correia happened to be reviewing photos on her cellphone at the time and could have snapped a shot of her neighbor’s computer screen. “He would not have been the wiser,” she said.Shoulder surfing, or surreptitiously reading a stranger’s documents or laptop, is widespread. In a 2007 survey of 400 business people commissioned by 3M United Kingdom, 80 percent shoulder-surfed. Still, when they were the subjects of such unwanted attention, more than half of respondents said they had just ignored it.Ms. Cheng Correia suggested that the casual appearance of seatmates often lulls business travelers into a false sense of security. “We can’t say we’re safe just because we’re surrounded by crying babies,” she said, adding that first-class snoops often lurk in coach: “There are more eyeballs in coach than in first class or business class.”Richard Plansky, senior managing director for business intelligence and investigations at Kroll in New York City, advises travelers concerned with shoulder surfing to go on a “data diet” before a business trip.“Do you really need to bring a laptop, and an iPhone and a USB drive?” Mr. Plansky asked. He warns clients traveling to China or Russia that the answer should be no. Corporate security experts accuse state security operatives in both countries of trying to steal trade secrets from visiting business travelers. He counsels clients traveling to high-risk countries to carry laptops and cellphones devoid of valuable information. “You can’t lose what you don’t have,” said Mr. Plansky.Ken Rygler, a consultant in the microelectronics industry, worries more about the prying eyes of curious seatmates than Chinese intelligence agents. During flights, he avoids using PowerPoint “because the font is so big.”Mr. Rygler sometimes snoops on neighboring passengers, especially on flights linking high-tech hubs. He recalled digging up interesting information on a flight between Austin, Tex., and San Jose, Calif. Mr. Rygler learned that one of his client’s competitors had struggled with a problem at its factory. “It was not public,” said Mr. Rygler. “It was helpful.”Some private investigators stake out airport lounges near a company’s headquarters to gather information from traveling employees. Mr. Plansky of Kroll dismissed such methods as inefficient, though he said he considered conferences and trade shows “particularly risky” destinations for travelers with intellectual property to protect.Leonard Fuld of the firm Fuld & Company in Cambridge, Mass., stressed that competitive intelligence professionals had more in common with librarians than spies, but he acknowledged that an eavesdropping expedition near a conference center could prove valuable.“You draw concentric circles around the location of the trade show or conference. You know the restaurants and hotels around the conference will have people filled to the brim that are attending the show. That could be useful,” said Mr. Fuld.Some conference attendees are easy marks. They wear name tags outside conference centers and clothing emblazoned with corporate logos. And employees of large companies could find it tempting to talk shop at industry events because they might see only co-workers from other offices at conventions.Disclosures would not surprise Robert D. Brownstone, a lawyer at Fenwick & West in Mountain View, Calif., who frequently lectures about information security at conferences.He recalled that before a speech at an employment law conference in Florida, he used a computer reserved for registrants. A Microsoft Word file entitled “Severance.doc” was on the desktop.“Just by hovering on the icon on the desktop, a yellow bubble came up with the name of the law firm,” said Mr. Brownstone. “I opened it up and saw a final or prior draft of a severance agreement. Here’s someone at a conference, learning to be a better employment lawyer and they obviously went into their work e-mail or their computer and dropped something onto the drive and left it sitting there.”On the road, Mr. Brownstone adheres to a strict protocol to protect confidential information. He uses a software program, Better File Rename, to make documents seem innocuous, and carries a portable scanner to digitize documents. “I just don’t want to have stuff that anybody could eyeball,” said Mr. Brownstone. He also avoids speaking on his cellphone with clients when traveling. “I’ve been a lawyer 25 years; I can only remember one phone call with a client.”If he speaks with colleagues outside the office, Mr. Brownstone practices what might be called verbal encryption. He recalled working in New York City in the 1980s and 1990s on prominent cases like the defense of Michael R. Milken, who was eventually convicted of securities fraud, and the civil case filed against Claus von Bulow by his stepchildren.“If we were going to court, the senior partner and I would be hopping in a cab to go to the federal courthouse,” said Mr. Brownstone. “We would use code names for the key players in the case. You don’t know who the cabdriver just drove or is about to drive.”Mr. Brownstone sheepishly admits that he fails to use a privacy filter on his laptop. “Shame on me,” he said. He is not alone. A 2010 survey by the software security company People Security of 800 attendees of an information technology conference found that only 13 percent used screen shields, which block the sideways view of curious onlookers without diminishing the user’s view.There may be physiological and psychological reasons airline passengers leak information. In the analysis of Robert Bor, an aviation psychologist and the editor of a book called “Passenger Behaviour,” (Ashgate, 2003) some travelers experience in-flight anxiety when away from familiar settings. “That anxiety can make us more susceptible to engaging with people,” said Mr. Bor.Airline passengers, he said, often suffer from fatigue, jet lag, low blood sugar from not having eaten or hypoxia, which is mild oxygen deprivation. “Being at 35,000 feet for more than two hours is going to make you mildly hypoxic,” said Mr. Bor, “and slightly less oxygen will make you euphoric or may give slightly poorer judgment.” Given the emotional and physical stresses, Mr. Bor judged commercial airlines as the perfect environment to turn a frequent flier into a chatterbox.Before breaking out the BlackBerry or yammering to a co-worker — whether in the skies or on the rails — consider the burden placed on the professional listener who may be minding your business from the next seat.“You can’t undo what you hear,” said Ms. Cheng Correia, the Simmons professor. “You might be able to avert your eyes, but you can’t just plug your ears and go ‘la, la, la, la, la.’ ”'"
"'12-05-03,'0','According to security consultants, kidnappers generally prey on victims more vulnerable than business travelers, who tend to limit time in dicey destinations and keep irregular schedules. But sometimes even the business class gets swept up in this rising international crime wave.Many companies offer help in response, among them international insurance companies, secretive consultants who manage hostage situations and local outfits offering abduction prevention courses. As the Web site of Chartis, a leading underwriter of kidnapping insurance, says: “Kidnapping is not a rare occurrence; it’s big business.”Kidnapping for ransom is on the rise in many countries. In 2011, the Mexican government reported a more than 300 percent increase in the crime since 2005. The United States State Department Web site, which tracks worldwide crime trends, warns of “alarming increases” in kidnapping in Venezuela, and that abductions in Pakistan “continued to increase dramatically nationwide.” But statistics can be difficult to gather, and the numbers of victims are likely underestimated. Many released hostages refuse to report the crime; some fear attracting copycat criminals, while others distrust corrupt police who moonlight as kidnappers. In Venezuela, for instance, the State Department estimates that roughly four out of five kidnappings are not reported.Insurance companies say business is brisk. “Kidnapping and ransom is a very profitable insurance business,” said Ana Paula Menezes, a former underwriter. Kidnap insurance policies typically include the services of response teams that coach victims’ families on everything from proof-of-life questions to ransom prices, which the policies reimburse. “Generally, the family will have someone in front of them within 24 hours,” said Jeff Green, the director of Griffin Underwriting, which specializes in kidnap and ransom insurance. He explained the kidnapping bargaining process: “It’s a business negotiation, where somebody is trying to sell something — and you know you are going to buy it, you have to buy it. But the advantage you have is that you are the only buyer, because they have no value to anyone else.”Some response consultants deal directly with clients lacking kidnapping coverage. “It’ll cost you at least $3,000 a day, and it’s going to be money up front,” said Christopher T. Voss, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business and former lead international kidnapping negotiator at the Federal Bureau of Investigation.Several security companies market antikidnapping training. For $650, Risks Incorporated in Miami, for instance, promises to teach students about the “real world of terrorism and kidnap and ransom!” And, yes, there’s an anti-kidnap app. BrickHouse Security, a surveillance emporium, sells Executrac software ($29.95 and a $19.95 monthly subscription), “a powerful, invisible application that turns any BlackBerry or smartphone into a covert GPS tracker with an emergency panic button.”Mr. Voss questions the value of tracking technology. Kidnappers are “more and more aware these days that the phone can be tracked,” he said. He gave some advice to travelers visiting high-risk countries: “Get off the X, No. 1. The X is the spot where the kidnappers try and take you.” Mr. Voss argues that running away from abductors, if possible, can make sense.“Kidnappers generally don’t pursue,” said Mr. Voss. “They’re not runners. And they are not going to shoot at you. It’s a waste of ammunition and they will probably miss anyway.”He said he came to that controversial conclusion when a former Navy Seal trainer, a classmate of his at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government, told him: “Let’s be honest, the Navy Seals, when we do renditions” — the spiriting of people from one nation to another — “effectively we’re doing kidnappings. Nobody is better at it than we are. We are the most organized, and not one person, not one of us, was assigned to chase anybody. If we’re not chasers, then the bad guys aren’t chasers.’”Mr. Voss also urges business travelers to vary their routine, even if it means being intentionally late to appointments. “A good businessman is on time and consistent,” said Mr. Voss. “And a lot of businessmen are horrified at the idea of breaking out of consistency. If you vary your schedule by 10 minutes, 15 minutes, one way or the other, you can throw the bad guys off enough that they just might look for someone who is a little more precise.”In a coming book, “International Security: Personal Protection in an Uncertain World,” Orlando Wilson, a security consultant, suggests another common-sense strategy for travelers: “Do not draw attention to yourself. Consider what you wear and drive, don’t be loud and rowdy. And don’t tell strangers too much about yourself.”That can be a challenge in an era of oversharing. Marivel Andreu of the Celedinas Insurance Group in Miami warns against revealing to Facebook friends travel plans — or lunch plans.Her clients, often wealthy families in Latin America, “are sharing all sorts of information, where they’re traveling, where they are, where they’re not, and, unfortunately, the kidnappers are using that information against them.”A report, “Expatriate Risk Management: Kidnapping and Ransom,” by Richard A. Posthuma, professor of management at the University of Texas at El Paso, found that the length of time that Mexican kidnappers conducted surveillance decreased as they deploy “more sophisticated surveillance techniques,” like monitoring social media.Julie Mulligan of Drayton Valley, Alberta, concedes she maintained a high profile while leading a Rotary Club exchange trip to Kaduna, Nigeria, in 2009. She appeared on a local TV show, and soon after kidnappers dragged her out of her host’s car. Held nearly two weeks, hobbling around on the high heels she wore when snatched, Ms. Mulligan “had some really dark moments.”At one point, she contemplated an escape and hid keys to the house where she was held. Her guard discovered the keys and flew into a rage. “He raised his arm to hit me, and he called me ‘woman.’ ” Before that, said Ms. Mulligan, “he had been calling me ‘Auntie,’ a sign of respect for an older woman.”Despite the psychological scars from captivity — “Anybody that’s been kidnapped for more than 24 hours, the life that they knew is gone. It’s over,” said Mr. Voss — Ms. Mulligan says her experience actually enriched her life.“I started writing this list of people who were part of the fabric of my life,” she said. For days, Ms. Mulligan edited the list on a piece of cardboard, stopping at 472 names. “When I got home I found out, realized, that it could have been so much bigger.” While she struggled to survive, eating little but white rice, stung by countless mosquitoes and threatened by guards the age of her children, she was “humbled” to learn that the churches in her town had united for an interdenominational prayer service. “The biggest thing that I have to say that I’ve understood is the goodness, the innate goodness of people,” she said.Mr. de Ronde, the Dutch kidnapping victim, agrees that even brutal kidnappings can prove strangely liberating. “You feel the things that you are not doing right in your life,” he said. Before his trip to South Africa, he and his wife planned to buy a large house in Rotterdam, but after the kidnapping he canceled the contract. “We went on a holiday straight away, and we said, what do we really want to do in life? One of the things was, we can continue working, working, working. As I am married to a Chinese wife, I said I want to experience more of your culture.”Mr. de Ronde and his family moved to China. He did not say where.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','Earlier in the day, Mr. Osborne challenged his fellow European finance ministers to carry out the international accord, known as Basel III, raising the minimum amount of capital that banks are required to hold.But after 10 hours of talks, a testy Mr. Osborne said that a deal on the table was inadequate because it failed to take into account his concerns and would subject Europe, and him, to ridicule at a time when the region was struggling to emerge from its debt crisis.“We’re not implementing the Basel agreement, as anyone who takes a look at this text will be able to tell you — every bank analyst, every financial journalist, every other finance ministry in the world would say that,” said Mr. Osborne, referring to Basel III, the accord to raise the minimum amount of capital that banks are required to hold.“I am not prepared to go out there and say something that would make me look like an idiot five minutes later,” Mr. Osborne said.Miroslav Kalousek, the Czech finance minister, shot back, “George, looking like an idiot is one of the basic qualifications for a minister.”That drew peals of laughter from assembled ministers at the late-night gathering in Brussels, but Mr. Osborne was infuriated by the jab.“I represent the largest banking industry around this table by far,” Mr. Osborne said solemnly. “You’ve got to allow me to sit down and go through the issues, and you have not done that for 10 hours,” he said.Mr. Osborne insisted that he was seeking rules that would be acceptable to regulators and authorities around the world including Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank, and his successor, Mario Draghi. “I will not be painted as somehow being anti-European or demanding something especially for London,” Mr. Osborne said.Other ministers attending the meeting raised strong concerns about the proposed text, including Jacek Rostowski, the Polish finance minister.Osborne said he supported efforts to reach a deal in negotiations that stretched well into Thursday morning.Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, also expressed some concern, but had said a deal still was within sight. But France’s finance minister, François Baroin, left the meeting before the dust-up to watch the French presidential debate on television.The ministers had been seeking agreement on requirements for banks to hold capital reserves that would function as a cushion against future losses. The idea is to help avoid financial crises like the one brought on by the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.The European Union faces a deadline of January 2013 to start phasing in rules agreed on by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision raising the minimum reserve to 7 percent of a bank’s assets.Backed by Sweden, Britain held firm to its demand that national regulators retain the option to require their banks to build up higher reserves than foreseen under a proposal by the European Commission, the European Union’s executive body, without prior approval.Britain has the largest banking sector in Europe in relation to gross domestic product, followed by Sweden, and has long fought efforts by the European authorities to exercise greater control over the City of London, the biggest financial center in Europe.But central governments in London and Stockholm are also extremely wary of putting taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts of their banking sectors.“My country has been very, very close to very deep problems in the banking sector twice and we don’t want to be there again,” Anders Borg, the Swedish finance minister, told his counterparts at the meeting earlier in the day.Mr. Borg sought to dismiss the view that Sweden and other nations that support more stringent requirements were seeking to attract more business for their sectors on the basis that they would be better capitalized than their rivals.“We are not trying to make our own banking system gain a competitive advantage to somebody else,” he said. “We are trying to safeguard our taxpayers and our society from the risks that a large banking sector is creating.”France and Austria are among nations that firmly opposed that view, saying that raising reserve requirements in one country could lead banks based there to reduce lending to their foreign subsidiaries, in turn damaging the economies of those nations.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','“When I saw that I my hand was cut, I was like, what? I was very upset and upset with myself. But never in a million years did I think I would cut my hand.”Stoudemire was disappointed that he would not be able to help his teammates Thursday — he said he had let them down — but added that he believed he could play in Sunday’s game. The Knicks list him as doubtful for Game 4.“I’m expecting to heal up fast,” Stoudemire said. “I think there’s a great chance I can play Sunday.”Knicks Coach Mike Woodson, however, was not planning on Stoudemire’s return.“I wait until the doctors tell me who’s ready,” Woodson said. “It’s not something I can undo. You don’t expect something like this to happen, but over the years, I’ve seen players do strange things.”Woodson added that Stoudemire was apologetic, although according to his teammates, there was no formal apology to the team. Nor was one sought.“He doesn’t have to apologize to me,” Steve Novak said after an unusually long practice session. “I know Amar’e wouldn’t do anything to hurt the team.”Carmelo Anthony said he talked on the telephone with Stoudemire on Tuesday, the day after the incident.“He feels bad and we talked about it,” Anthony said. “Right now, all I care about is him getting healthy.”At times Wednesday, Stoudemire appeared to be rationalizing the injury, as if to say he was an unlucky victim.“Everybody gets upset at times,” he said. “People knock over ice coolers or kick a chair or a table. It was accidental that I struck the glass. I just swung my arm backward.”Asked about fan reaction to the incident and criticism he has received, Stoudemire said: “I understand the fans are frustrated, and I am, too. But they have the wrong perception of what happened. I wasn’t trying to hurt myself and I didn’t punch a glass window. It was nothing like that.”After Stoudemire left the Knicks’ practice, and after his teammates and coaches faced 20 minutes of questioning about the chaotic Monday night postgame scene, the mood around the team suddenly changed to something a little more uplifting. In an elaborate ceremony broadcast nationally by the N.B.A., center Tyson Chandler was named the league’s defensive player of the year — the first Knick to win the award.Chandler, signed as a free agent before this season, said he was especially happy to be recognized because he is not among the top players in either blocked shots or steals.“I play defense by being in the right position and in many other fundamental and not always flashy ways,” he said. “So I’m glad that was recognized. I’ve always wanted to be considered one of the top defensive players in the league. But the defensive player of the year often goes to a big name. It’s just a dream for it to come my way.”The defensive work of Chandler and his teammates will have to be at its best Thursday against Miami. Much of the Knicks’ lineup is in flux. Woodson said Anthony would shift to power forward, where he played recently, and sometimes thrived, when Stoudemire was sidelined with a back injury, but was undecided about whom to start at small forward.“Whoever plays, we’re going to need a big push from everyone on the court,” Woodson said. “But I’m not unnerved by this situation. We’ve got a legitimate chance on our home court. We’ll see what we’re made of.”Point guard Jeremy Lin participated in a full-court three-on-three pickup game after practice. Wearing a brace on his surgically repaired left knee, Lin looked fluid and ran without a limp. “This is the first time he’s been able to run up and down,” Mike Woodson said. “The question is: Can he defend? Can he cut on the knee? We’ll wait and see how he feels. He’s talked about wanting to play but it’s up to a decision by the doctors.” ... The Knicks announced that Iman Shumpert had knee surgery and would need six to eight months to recover.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','Stocks were mostly lower on Wednesday as data showed that private sector hiring unexpectedly fell to a seven-month low in April, raising concerns that Friday’s jobs report will also disappoint investors.Private employers added 119,000 jobs in April, well short of expectations for 177,000, according to a report from ADP, the payroll processor. The report set off talk that Friday’s payrolls data from the Labor Department would show the economy added 125,000 to 150,000 jobs last month, well below a Reuters consensus forecast for 170,000.“If fewer and fewer people are participating in this recovery, it suggests underlying weakness that we have to address, and so far policy makers’ answers have been easy credit. I think we need to go beyond that,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank in Chicago.The report came on the heels of more glum news from Europe. Euro zone factory activity contracted again last month, with the purchasing managers index, seen as a measure of how the economy will fare, falling to its lowest level since June 2009.Energy was the worst performer among the 10 major S.& P. sectors, sapped by a 14.6 percent drop in Chesapeake Energy Corporation to $16.74. The S.& P. energy index lost 1.16 percent.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','The data was obtained from unsuspecting households as cars photographing the streets for the company’s Street View project drove by.All the overseas reviews except two in Germany — one regulatory, one criminal — were settled after Google apologized and blamed an error by the programmer for the incident.“We had been told that it was a simple mistake,” said Johannes Caspar, the data protection commissioner for Hamburg, whose investigation first brought the illegal collection of Internet data to light. “But now, we are learning that this wasn’t a mistake and that people within the company knew this information was being collected. That puts it in a totally different light.”His office is still investigating, he said.In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission released a heavily redacted report on its inquiry, finding that Google had broken no American laws but had obstructed its investigation. Last Saturday, Google made available a largely unredacted version of the report that offered a fuller picture of what had happened.The unredacted report showed that the programmer, a Google engineer who lives in Palo Alto, Calif., told his colleagues in 2007 and 2008 that his software program would collect the so-called Internet payload data from unencrypted Wi-Fi routers.A Google spokesman in Hamburg on Wednesday repeated the company’s previous statements: “While we disagree with some of the statements made in the document, we agree with the F.C.C.’s conclusion that we did not break the law. We hope that we can now put this matter behind us.”Privacy regulators in Britain and in France said they would review the F.C.C. report to determine whether further action was called for.The French regulator, the National Commission for Computing and Liberties, or CNIL, is leading a European review of Google’s new global data privacy policy, announced in January, which combines data collected from several Google services. It is currently analyzing Google’s responses to 69 questions the French regulator sent the company this year.A person with knowledge of the review said it was likely that the French agency would include new questions about Google’s collection of Wi-Fi data.In the United States, regulators had a milder reaction.At the Federal Trade Commission, which closed an investigation into Street View in late 2010 after the company asserted that the collection of data had been inadvertent, a spokeswoman said there were no plans to re-examine the issue.A spokeswoman for George Jepsen, the Connecticut attorney general, who is leading a multistate investigation of Street View, repeated earlier declarations that it was “active and ongoing.”Google said last week that the Justice Department had cleared it of wiretapping. Both Google and the Justice Department declined to release the department’s May 2011 letter closing the investigation.Mr. Caspar, the German regulator, said he thought that his European colleagues who had already settled with Google would have a hard time legally reopening their cases. Even the German criminal investigation could be thwarted by jurisdictional obstacles, he said.But Mr. Kohnstamm, the head of the top European privacy panel, known as the Article 29 Group, and the chairman of the Dutch Data Protection Authority, said that the new disclosures would be a topic of discussion among European regulators attending a convention in Luxembourg.“We will certainly discuss the matter,” he said. “My first reaction is, this is a bloody shame.”Mr. Kohnstamm recalled how in 2010, Google’s global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer, spoke at a hearing in the Netherlands on the incident.“Peter Fleischer made it pretty clear in his oral statement and in writing that it was the mistake of one single guy working at Google who had made a stupid mistake,” Mr. Kohnstamm said. “But apparently, it wasn’t a mistake at all.“In a political sense,” Mr. Kohnstamm continued, “that would be considered contempt of Parliament and would mean the end of the career for the person responsible.”The unauthorized collection of Internet payload data, which the F.C.C. determined was not illegal in the United States, is a violation of European law, Mr. Kohnstamm said.Enforcement of privacy law in Europe is done on a national level, although a proposed revision to the European Data Protection Directive, which will not be completed until 2013 at the earliest, would give national regulators the power to fine violators up to 2 percent of annual sales. Based on Google’s 2011 results, such a fine would amount to $758 million.Under existing law, European privacy regulators can impose only limited fines on global technology companies, even in egregious cases.The engineer at the center of the controversy, Marius Milner, lives in the United States, which could complicate efforts by German prosecutors to question him. The engineer invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to speak with officials at the F.C.C.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','He said American officials contacted him Thursday morning and said they would visit later in the day,In interviews Wednesday with Western journalists, Mr. Chen, said he wanted to leave China, preferably for the , because “guaranteeing citizens’ rights in China is empty talk,” an assertion that sharply undermines the American rationale for releasing him from diplomatic protection.“My safety and my family’s safety are not guaranteed even now,” he said. “Their promises have not been fulfilled.”The turn of events left Mrs. Clinton to begin her strategic dialogue with her Chinese counterparts on Thursday under a cloud of confusion. It also exposed the Obama administration to criticism from Republicans and human rights groups that it had rushed to resolve a delicate human rights case so that it would not overshadow other matters on the bilateral agenda that Mrs. Clinton previously called more important, including the Iranian and North Korean nuclear programs and China’s currency and trade policies.Earlier in the day, senior State Department officials who had negotiated on Mr. Chen’s behalf said that he had repeatedly insisted he wanted to remain in China, and that the Chinese authorities had made concessions to make that possible. The officials said the Chinese had agreed to allow him to start a new life in Tianjin, a port city near the capital, where he could study law and live with his family. There, he would be free of the harassment and intimidation he had suffered for years at the hands of security officials in a rural village of Shandong Province, they said.Mrs. Clinton, who arrived in Beijing about six hours before Mr. Chen’s release, said after his departure that the Chinese government had given understandings about his future. “Making those commitments a reality is the next crucial task,” she said.She also said she was “pleased that we were able to facilitate Chen Guangcheng’s stay and departure from the U.S. Embassy in a way that reflected his choices and our values.”“I was glad to have the chance to speak with him today and to congratulate him on being reunited with his wife and children,” she said.But the deal began coming apart almost immediately, as the Chinese government issued a blistering statement to domestic news media saying the role the United States had played in the matter “is totally unacceptable to China.” The Foreign Ministry statement insisted that Washington offer an apology and punish officials involved in taking Mr. Chen into American protection.State Department officials disputed Mr. Chen’s assertion, made in interviews Wednesday with Western news media, that American officials had relayed threats against his family by the Chinese authorities.The officials said that they had passed along a Chinese message that Mr. Chen’s wife, Yuan Weijing, would be sent back to Shandong if he remained under American care, and that American officials could do nothing to ensure her safety there.“At no time did any U.S. official speak to Chen about physical or legal threats to his wife and children, nor did Chinese officials make any such threats to us,” Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement. “U.S. interlocutors did make clear that if Chen elected to stay in the embassy, Chinese officials had indicated to us that his family would be returned to Shandong, and they would lose their opportunity to negotiate for reunification.”Mr. Chen’s statement he no longer wanted to stay in China contradicted what American officials said he had told them while in their care, and public statements Mr. Chen had made before he sought American protection.His reversal, perhaps the result of panic at being left alone in a big Beijing hospital after a long ordeal that had begun with a daring escape from house arrest nearly two weeks ago, or of true second thoughts, could turn out to be a reflection of the American rush to have the scheduled economic and security talks unimpeded by a messy human rights case.Mrs. Clinton has mentioned Mr. Chen’s bravery in public as one of the most startling among China’s human rights dissidents. But she has also made clear during her tenure as secretary of state that the vital economic and strategic dealings with China cannot become captive to the human rights cases.Mrs. Clinton left the details of the negotiations over Mr. Chen to two of her top officials, Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Harold Koh, the State Department legal adviser, and appeared to give her final blessing to the arrangements they had worked out after she landed in Beijing Wednesday morning.Mr. Campbell said he felt the agreement with the Chinese forged a new model for how Chinese dissidents could stay in China, if they wanted to, rather than seeking residence in another country and losing their voice inside their homeland. He said it was unrealistic to expect that a written accord outlining the Chinese assurances could have been completed.The deal came under sharp criticism in the United States.Representative , a Republican from and an outspoken critic of China’s human rights record, said that given Mr. Chen’s fears, the administration should have considered granting him asylum.“There are no safe places in China for dissidents,” Mr. Smith said. “Going to the hospital is no different from going to the police station.”An outspoken supporter in the United States of Chinese dissidents, Bob Fu, who heads the ChinaAid Association and was involved in Mr. Chen’s escape from security officials last week, said he feared the “U.S. side has abandoned Mr. Chen.”The trouble for the Americans began to emerge soon after 7 p.m. Wednesday when American diplomats and doctors at the hospital with Mr. Chen, who had injured his foot while fleeing house arrest, were told to leave by the hospital authorities, in accordance with visiting hours, two American officials said.Mr. Chen said his wife and two children were still with him in his room Thursday after being allowed to stay overnight, but he told friends and reporters who could get through to him on the phone that he had expected round-the-clock American protection. An American official involved in the negotiations said that the embassy called Mr. Chen at 9 p.m. and that he said he was fine.Jerome A. Cohen, a New York lawyer and a friend of Mr. Chen’s, said the dissident appeared to have panicked after being taken to the hospital. The authorities had cordoned off the room, denied visitors access and apparently limited his phone calls, Mr. Cohen said.“The trouble is nobody has appeared to stay with him,” Mr. Cohen said of the diplomats who escorted him to the hospital. “That must have produced panic. His friends couldn’t get through.”Perhaps most difficult for the State Department was the statement by Mr. Chen’s lawyer, Teng Biao, that his client had “changed his mind” and did not feel secure.Mr. Chen even chose to dispute an account by American senior officials that he was so ebullient in talking to Mrs. Clinton on the phone during his ride to the hospital that he had said in his broken English: “I want to kiss you.” Instead, Mr. Chen said in the interview Thursday, he had said he wanted to “see” her.Though the outcome of his case remained unclear, American officials said they felt the Chinese had been surprisingly forthcoming in their willingness to discuss the terms of Mr. Chen’s remaining in the country.Many experts had doubted after Mr. Chen sought American protection that the Chinese authorities would discuss the terms of a Chinese citizen’s rights under Chinese law with the United States, and that the standoff over his case could persist for a long time. Outlining the terms, American officials said the Chinese had agreed Mr. Chen could leave his home province, where he had suffered repeated abuses, and move to one of seven cities chosen by the two sides to study law.A self-educated lawyer, Mr. Chen indicated he wanted to study law at Tianjin, a city about 40 minutes from Beijing, they said. The Americans pledged to find funds for Mr. Chen’s tuition and family expenses from private sources.The Chinese also pledged to investigate the Shandong provincial authorities and their harsh treatment of Mr. Chen, something he was most anxious about, the American officials said.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','Guillaume Jesel, a senior vice president for global marketing at MAC, likened the company’s contest — which logged over 636,000 votes — to “Dancing With the Stars,” but for makeup. “It’s the same revolution you see in other industries,” Mr. Jesel said. “You let the consumer take the steering wheel for a while.”Perhaps adding to the fervor is the fact that winning products won’t be available in stores. Wine, the shade of Bobbi Brown lipstick that had the most votes in the United States, will be available only online via a Facebook link to start in October, while the winning shades of MAC products — a lipstick, lip gloss and eye shadow — will be available in August, also only on the company’s Web site. (Next February, Bobbi Brown will most likely hold another “Bring Back” campaign, this time with eye shadows, Ms. Sontag said.)It used to be that beauty retailers and manufacturers had to adhere to a strict “one in, one out” policy, with low-selling products discontinued to make room for new ones at counters. But selling these products online or on television — on Saturday for instance, Carol’s Daughter will reintroduce its Ocean collection, a three-product bath and body line, on the HSN network — changes the equation.“At the shelf, you have to think about turnover,” said David Lonczak, the division vice president for eCommerce and digital marketing for Drugstore.com, Beauty.com and Walgreens.com. “That doesn’t make it possible to carry these tertiary products, but there is still a reasonable amount of business there.”In 2009, Drugstore.com made a deal with Procter & Gamble to carry select Max Factor items after the company stopped sales in the United States. “When products go off the shelf, consumers go online,” Mr. Lonczak said.Another company trying to pre-empt frustrated customers is the Britain-based Lush, known for making beauty products by hand with fresh ingredients. It has a so-called Retro line, which most recently included a Pineapple Grunt soap and All That Jasmine Bath Bomb. (Once, the company brought back its Tramp shower gel because a customer wrote a note about how much her cat loved the smell.) “It’s not a hugely commercial thing for us,” Hilary Jones, the company’s ethics director in Britain, said of the program. “It’s about keeping the customer’s good will.”And, of course, her loyalty. After buying Erno Laszlo, the cult skin-care brand, last year with a group of investors, Charles Denton decided to pare the company’s 127 offerings down to fewer than 60. Rumors spread over the Internet about which products would make the cut and which wouldn’t, and eventually Mr. Denton, the company’s chief executive, began personally responding to e-mails — as many as 200 a day — from worried customers. Partly because of those communiqués, he decided to keep two powders that had been marked for discontinuation.“The consequence of a poor decision could take 18 months to two years to filter back to the head office,” Mr. Denton said. “With social media you can take an instant read. That’s fantastically valuable.”And beauty behemoths are heading the call, as well. Last year the French cosmetics giant Lancôme brought back Blush Subtil in Cosmopolitan Pink, available for purchase on its site, in response to consumer demand. Next up? Possibly Aroma Tonic, a citrus-scented body spray with its own “bring back” Facebook page, which has over 370 “likes.” “One person writes, then another person writes,” said Gracemarie Papaleo, an assistant vice president for Lancôme. “They rally together.”Perhaps Carolyn Park, 28, who works in business development at a law firm in Manhattan, should mobilize the troops. Upon discovering that Guardian Angel Heat Protect ’n Curl, a hair spray from Got 2 Be, was discontinued, Ms. Park, who stockpiles mascara and hand cream, among other products, snapped up four bottles for $7 each at Amazon.com.But “I’m on my last one,” she said. “And I haven’t found a replacement.”'"
"'12-05-03,'0','“How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes” (“The iEconomy” series, front page, April 29) was enlightening, but incomplete.In its latest annual report, Apple said that as of last September it had a staggering $54 billion parked offshore (since grown, as The Times points out, to $74 billion). Almost all of this huge hoard is accumulated in tax havens and has never been taxed by any government. More to the point, most of these untaxed profits are almost certainly United States profits that Apple has artificially shifted offshore to avoid its United States tax responsibilities.There’s a simple way to curb this kind of corporate tax dodging, of which Apple is only one prominent example: repeal the tax rule that indefinitely exempts offshore profits from United States corporate income tax. If those profits were taxable (with a credit for any foreign taxes paid), then Apple alone would have paid an additional $17 billion in federal income taxes over the past decade. That would have tripled the federal income taxes that Apple actually paid.Congressional scorekeepers estimate that ending the offshore corporate tax exemption would increase overall federal revenues by about $600 billion over the next decade. That’s money that could be put to good use in these times of strained budgets.As a shareholder of Apple, I’m very happy that it uses the tax code to reduce the taxes it pays to the United States, California and wherever. However, as an American citizen, I’m disappointed that our government provides so many opportunities for it to do so.'"

"'12-05-03,'0','Recent research by economists from the International Monetary Fund and academia offers some new insights about income inequality, with important implications.The researchers compared the top 5 percent of United States households from 1983 to 2007 with the remaining 95 percent. What they found is that as the rich got richer in the decades before the Great Recession, everyone else tried to maintain his standard of living by going deeper into debt. As income inequality grew over that period so did debt levels, because the rich increasingly invested their growing wealth in bonds and bank deposits, in effect providing money for ever more lending to the poor and middle class.The top group’s increasing wealth, and the bottom group’s increasing reliance on debt, spurred the growth of the financial sector. But with ever increasing debt, the financial system — and the broader economy — became ever more vulnerable to crisis.The data is eye-opening. In 1983, the top 5 percent had 80 cents of debt for every dollar of income, while the remaining 95 percent had 60 cents for every dollar. By 2007, after decades in which an increasing share of income flowed to the top, the situation had reversed. The top 5 percent had 65 cents of debt for every dollar of income, while the remaining 95 percent had $1.40 in debt for every dollar. The situation remains skewed today.The first step in restoring real stability to the economy is to lower the debt levels through what the researchers call “orderly debt reduction.” An example of that would be mortgage modifications. The second and more important step is to reduce income inequality by raising wages, possibly by strengthening collective bargaining.Income inequality and high household debt are not the only explanations of the financial crisis. But the researchers make a compelling case that greater equality and lower debt could make future crises less likely.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','More than a decade after 9/11, thousands of facilities that produce, store or use highly toxic chemicals remain vulnerable to a terrorist attack or accident that could kill or injure hundreds of thousands of people living downwind of an explosion. A Congressional Research Service report identifies 483 facilities in 43 states where a chemical disaster would put 100,000 or more people at risk.In 2002, Christine Todd Whitman, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for President George W. Bush, joined with other agencies and drafted a strong, comprehensive chemical safety law that, among other things, would have encouraged producers and users of high-risk chemicals to find safer alternatives or processes. Industry fought back, claiming that the law would be too cumbersome and costly. The White House caved and refused to submit the bill.What eventually emerged from a divided Congress was a weak law that exempted thousands of facilities from any regulation and required little more than “vulnerability assessments” from the rest.Ms. Whitman has rejoined the fight, with a letter to the present administrator, Lisa Jackson, urging her to invoke the general duty clause in the Clean Air Act to require companies that produce, use or store toxic chemicals to seek out “safer cost-effective processes” and otherwise improve security “before a tragedy of historic proportions occurs.” Ms. Whitman’s letter followed an identical recommendation from the E.P.A.’s National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which weighed in because chemical plants are often located near poorer neighborhoods that would be disproportionately affected by an explosion.The general duty clause — known as the “Bhopal amendment” in reference to the 1984 Union Carbide disaster in India — requires facilities to take steps to prevent accidental releases of dangerous chemicals and to “minimize” the consequences of such a release.Despite what industry may claim, that is not an impossible task. In 2009, largely on its own initiative, the Clorox Company announced that it would convert all its factories that use lethal, chlorine gas to more efficient and safer manufacturing processes that use a less volatile substitute. But, according to Greenpeace, an environmental group in the forefront of efforts to require safer plants, relatively few facilities have followed Clorox’s lead, even though alternatives for dangerous gases, including ammonia and hydrogen fluoride are available.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','Mr. Obama barely won this county in 2008 — 48.9 percent to John McCain’s 48.7 percent. Four years earlier, John Kerry had an easier time here, winning 52.3 percent to 47.2 percent over George W. Bush. Given Ohio’s critical importance as a swing state that will most likely be won or lost by the narrowest of margins, the fact that Mr. Obama’s race is a deal-breaker for even a small number of otherwise loyal Democrats could have implications for the final results.Obama advisers acknowledged that some areas of the state presented more political challenges than others, but said that the racial sentiment was not a major source of worry. The campaign’s strategy relies in large part on a strong performance in cities and suburban areas to make up for any falloff elsewhere among Democrats in this or other corners of Ohio.The Obama campaign aggressively monitors any racial remarks made against the president, but officials rarely openly discuss Mr. Obama’s race. The president released his birth certificate last year in an effort to quell a growing controversy about whether he is a United States citizen. He said last month that race in America was still “complicated.”“I never bought into the notion that by electing me, somehow we were entering into a post-racial period,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with Rolling Stone.“I’ve seen in my own lifetime how racial attitudes have changed and improved, and anybody who suggests that they haven’t isn’t paying attention or is trying to make a rhetorical point,” he said. “Because we all see it every day, and me being in this Oval Office is a testimony to changes that have been taking place.”Researchers have long struggled to quantify racial bias in electoral politics, in part because of the reliance on surveys, a forum in which respondents rarely admit to prejudice. In 50 interviews in this county over three days last week, 5 people raised race directly as a reason they would not vote for Mr. Obama. In those conversations, voters were not asked specifically about race, but about their views on the candidates generally. Those who raised the issue did so of their own accord.“I’ll just come right out and say it: he was elected because of his race,” said Sara Reese, a bank employee who said she voted for Ralph Nader in 2008, even though she usually votes Democrat.Did her father, a staunch Democrat and retired mill worker, vote for Mr. Obama? “I’d have to say no. I don’t think he could do it,” she said.But the main quarrels Democratic voters here have with Mr. Obama have nothing to do with race. They include his rejection of one proposed route for the Keystone pipeline, a stance they say will harm this area, whose backbone, the Ohio River, is lined with metal mills and coal mines.And the economy, on the rise nationally, is still stuck here. About one in three residents in Steubenville live in poverty, double the national rate. Shale gas, which has begun to bring profits to some counties in Ohio, has yet to take off here, and downtown is a grid of empty storefronts behind dusty glass.“The big word was ‘change,’ but there’s not been much of that,” said Christopher Brown, a union leader in Steubenville, who said more than 200 of his members were still out of work. “Members are saying, ‘What has President Obama done for us?’ ”As for race, he said, “It’s not on the front table, it’s in the back seat.”Just how far back is a question no one can definitively answer. “Race in America is always a work in progress,” said Clement A. Price, a professor of history at Rutgers-Newark. “It’s often a proxy for social anxieties, such as this long recession, joblessness and the war abroad.”Stephanie Montgomery, who is black and a graduate of Franciscan University in Steubenville, said her race came up so often in her job search in this area that she developed a technique for recognizing when it was happening. The sign: when warmth on the phone turns cool in person, and “they lose eye contact with you.”“You almost need a corporate environment to get  a fair shot,” she said while standing at a job fair in the Steubenville mall. She said that she did not vote for Mr. Obama in 2008 because she preferred Mr. McCain’s more conservative platform, but that Mr. Obama seemed to be a lightning rod for criticism, in part because of his race.“He’s everything they hate,” she said, referring to ultraconservatives. “An affirmative-action baby. Got the Nobel Prize without deserving it.”Many who raised race as a concern cast Mr. Obama as a flawed candidate carried to victory by blacks voting for the first time. Others expressed concerns indirectly, through suspicions about Mr. Obama’s background and questions about his faith.“He was like, ‘Here I am, I’m black and I’m proud,’ ” said Lesia Felsoci, a bank employee drinking a beer in an Applebee’s. “To me, he didn’t have a platform. Black people voted him in, that’s why he won. It was black ignorance.”Louis Tripodi, a baker in Steubenville who voted for Mr. Obama, blames talk radio and Republican rhetoric for encouraging such attitudes. “ ‘He’s a Muslim, he’s a socialist, he’s not born in this country,’ ” he said. “It’s got a lot to do with race.”Race has also helped Mr. Obama. It increased voter turnout among blacks in 2008, and some younger voters said it was part of why they voted for him. But now that history has been made, it is less of a pull.“It was kind of like a bandwagon that a lot of young people jumped on because it was history,” said Dee Kirkland, a 22-year-old working in a pizza shop in nearby Yorkville. “It was a fad to like him,” she said, adding that “race shouldn’t hinder you, but it also shouldn’t help you.”Mr. Obama still has a number of enthusiastic supporters here. Diane Woods, the owner of Pee Dee’s Brunch and Bar, a diner in downtown Steubenville, described him as “regal, and presidential,” and said she would vote for him again because “when he talks, it makes sense to me.”The fact that race came up at all in 2008 “really showed how divided we still are,” she said, cooking eggs one gray morning last week. “Blacks came out to vote for the first time because he was black, and you had all these whites saying, ‘Oh, there’s another vote from some drug addict.’ ”Mr. Corrigan, who supports Mr. Obama, said he believed that the president would ultimately win this mostly Democratic county but that it would be very close, a prediction he said was underscored by a recent flurry of Republican visits. Rick Santorum came here twice during his campaign, and Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican, gave his annual address here this winter.“It’s going to be a nail-biter,” said Mr. Brown, the union official.'"

"'12-05-03,'0','TAKE a floppy-haired Muppet. Dress it as a waiter. Rearrange its face until its features slope to one side. Throw it across the room. Repeatedly. If that puppet came to life it might look something like the actor Tom Edden in the British comedy “One Man, Two Guvnors,” now on Broadway at the Music Box Theater.Although Mr. Edden has a scant 20 or so lines and just one big set piece in the two-and-a-half-hour show, he is doing some old-fashioned scene stealing and getting some of the biggest laughs of the season. Dressed in a ratty outfit, with a head of wispy white hair and heaps of makeup, Mr. Edden plays Alfie, a wild-eyed but slow-moving octogenarian waiter who is enlisted to help Francis (played by James Corden) serve his two bosses a pub lunch of soup, cold meats and chicken balls. The problem? It’s Alfie’s first day on the job. That and he has cataracts, is just this side of deaf, leans to one side, slurs his speech (it’s that contorted mouth), has a pacemaker and the shakes. Or as the script describes it, he’s “old, slow and doddery.”Mr. Edden said: “He finds stairs and doors and plates and everyday objects a bit of a herculean trial. He’s doing his best.”Set in 1963 “One Man, Two Guvnors” comes from an English tradition of lowbrow comedy that’s naughty, playfully mean and slapstick happy. (The playwright Richard Bean based it on “The Servant of Two Masters,” an 18th-century Italian farce by Carlo Goldoni.) Over the course of the 25-minute dinner scene that ends Act I, Mr. Edden is put through a physical comedy regimen that would tax even the most seasoned clown. He gets dragged by the legs face down; takes a door, a cricket bat and bottle opener to the face; careers offstage on a cart; and takes a piggyback ride.“The whole show is a kind of reinvention of universal traditions of great comic archetypes of physical clowning and the indestructible old guy,” said Nicholas Hytner, the director of “One Man, Two Guvnors” and the artistic director of the National Theater in London, where the show had its premiere last year. “He’s playing a cartoon grotesque but he’s playing it for real.”'"
"'12-05-03,'0','“Taking into account a missile-defense system’s destabilizing nature, that is, the creation of an illusion that a disarming strike can be launched with impunity, a decision on pre-emptive use of the attack weapons available will be made when the situation worsens,” General Makarov said.Alexander Vershbow, NATO’s deputy secretary general, played down the general’s speech. He said NATO was trying to resolve what he called “differences in perception regarding the capability of the NATO shield” and hoped to find grounds for cooperation with Moscow.“I think a lot of the countermeasures described by General Makarov were familiar ones, but I’d have to go back and do research,” he said at a news conference in Moscow. “Clearly it is not something we welcome, by any means. We think the system we are developing poses no threat to Russia, so the whole notion of retaliation or countermeasures has no foundation.”Mr. Vershbow said NATO interceptors would not be able to be launched quickly enough to intercept a Russian intercontinental ballistic missile as it traveled toward the United States, calling it “a question of science and geography.” He noted that some Russian scientists and policy experts agreed with this assessment.President George W. Bush proposed the system for Eastern Europe after withdrawing from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty over Russia’s objections. President Obama first stalled the Eastern European program as part of the so-called reset in relations and then revived it in a new format, called the Phased Adaptive Approach.Russian generals floated a number of objections to the revised plan. General Makarov, in his speech, said the United States was refusing to offer written guarantees that the interceptor missiles directed at Iran would not have the capacity to hit a Russian ICBM in flight as it streaked toward the United States with a nuclear warhead. American officials have said the proposed system will not have that capability.Still, the Russian generals are not “completely misguided” in their suspicions, said Andrew C. Kuchins, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is an element in the U.S. elite that does want complete invulnerability,” he said in a telephone interview.Ellen O. Tauscher, the American special envoy for strategic stability and missile defense, who is attending the conference, told journalists in a briefing on Thursday that the American delegation would hear out the Russian objections but was unlikely to make concessions. In an election year the Obama administration might welcome the general’s remarks, to insulate it from criticisms that it is going soft on Russia.“The Russian concerns are concerns that we’re willing to listen to. But at the same time they cannot be concerns that we will mitigate by offering any kind of limitations,” Ms. Tauscher said. “There’s nothing I can imagine that will stop us making these deployments on time.”'"
"'12-05-03,'0','JAMES MADISON never played with an iPhone, but he might have had something to say about the news last weekend about Apple. Over the last few years, the company has avoided paying billions of dollars in state and federal taxes by routing profits through subsidiaries based in tax havens from Reno, Nev., to the Caribbean.This is a common practice among major American businesses, and back in 1787, Madison saw it coming. Someday, he warned, companies could grow so large they “would pass beyond the authority of a single state, and would do business in other states.” To make sure the companies remained accountable to government, he said the federal government should “grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them, and the authority of a single state may be incompetent.”Such an act would create a common corporate architecture for all American companies doing business across state lines and internationally. It would establish not only uniform tax policies but also national standards for the structure of corporate boards, the power of chief executives, the relations of management with workers and shareholders and the interaction of American companies with other nations. National companies would have to abide by national rules, and the option of shopping around for the most favorable laws or tax policies simply wouldn’t exist.It’s an idea that has been proposed and pursued many times, particularly during the early 1900s, when companies like Standard Oil, which was a collection of companies incorporated in various states and assembled into a national “trust,” were becoming increasingly powerful. Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson and, later, Franklin D. Roosevelt all supported the creation of a national companies law, but the measures were consistently opposed by the business community and eventually defeated.Today, however, considering how much effort and money American companies expend on keeping a competitive advantage by figuring out which loopholes to exploit from the bewildering array of rules now in effect, they might not entirely oppose reform. In an era of global competition, it could help to have a clear set of standards. It’s certainly what other nations have. In Germany, for example, national legislation established rules for the structure of corporate boards. Britain’s Parliament establishes how a corporation can be created and what its rights and responsibilities are.Legally, there is little doubt that the United States Congress could impose similar rules under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Although the states have traditionally been the main arena for corporate rules, the federal government has long created national corporations, from the First Bank of the United States in 1791 to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1967. Congress could use this same power to require that companies doing business across state lines have national corporate charters, which would subject them to federal rules. Alternatively, it could simply set rules for corporate organization and conduct that would apply to all interstate companies of a certain size.Passing a National Companies Act won’t be easy. Companies would hire lobbyists to push for favorable rules. And some states with particularly easy incorporation terms, like Delaware, might resist. Around 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware, and the state earns a great deal in fees and tax revenues as a result.'"

"'12-05-03,'0','The drilling involves injecting vast amounts of water and chemicals into underground shale to release the gas. Should it begin in New York, the gas wells could generate hundreds of millions of gallons of toxic wastewater annually, and it is not clear where it could go.Federal officials have warned that New York should not count on the disposal options that it now uses for salty wastewater from conventional gas wells, which produce far less waste than fracking. Most of the state’s conventional drilling waste stays in New York and is sent to sewage-treatment plants like one in Auburn, N.Y., near Syracuse or is used to de-ice roads or tamp down dust on them, state regulators said. The state also sends waste to privately owned treatment plants in Pennsylvania and Ohio. In written comments on New York’s proposed fracking rules, the federal Environmental Protection Agency has said that the state should ban the use of fracking brine on roads because pollutants could make their way into aquifers and waterways through infiltration and storm runoff.The agency also warned that there was probably not enough capacity at out-of-state treatment plants to handle polluted water from New York.The E.P.A. is currently working on national pretreatment standards for waste headed for municipal sewage-treatment plants or private treatment plants, after finding that many of them are not properly equipped to treat this type of wastewater and may be discharging pollutants to rivers and other streams.Building new treatment plants for the fracking industry is another option, but industry representatives say that doing so would depend on whether the investment makes economic sense. Complicating matters, antifracking sentiment has already led to dozens of bans or limits on fracking-related operations, like the measure in Niagara Falls.“Wastewater management represents a challenge to the industry,” said John Conrad, a co-owner of P. V. E. Sheffler, an engineering and environmental consultant to energy companies that are already drilling in Pennsylvania and other states. “A lot of treatment capacity still remains to be built.”Environmental groups, arguing that the state is already lax in policing wastewater disposal, say that the State Environmental Conservation Department, which would issue drilling permits, must come up with an exhaustive plan to make sure that it is handled safely.“For the D.E.C. to sidestep this issue would be an abdication of its responsibility,” said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council and a member of a panel advising Joe Martens, the commissioner of the Environmental Conservation Department, on the fracking proposal. “The industry’s environmental track record in other states does not inspire confidence.”The state environmental agency has already made clear that specific disposal plans must be in place before any drilling permits will be issued — and that finding sites will be up to the gas industry.“This is the industry’s problem,” Mr. Martens said in an interview. “It’s not the state’s responsibility to identify disposal sites.”Some industry officials played down the challenges, saying that technological advances are allowing them to recycle most of the waste. Along with more traditional methods like injection wells, which involve pumping waste into underground rock formations, new treatment plants are already coming online in Pennsylvania.“As the development moves to New York, the infrastructure will be developed here,” said John Holko, president of Lanape Resources, a company with interests in 500 conventional gas wells in New York, who is a spokesman for the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York.Casella Waste Systems, a landfill operator that is building a recycling and disposal plant for fracking waste in McKean County, in Pennsylvania, said it could easily build similar plants at two of its landfills in New York if there is sufficient demand for treatment.Some environmental groups argue that, based on how New York now handles waste from conventional drilling, the state would be ill-prepared to deal with the enormous amount of wastewater produced by thousands of fracked wells.Environmental Advocates of New York, a group based in Albany, plans to release a report on Friday asserting that the state does not adequately track where the waste from more than 6,800 conventional wells now operating goes. In a review of nearly 100 drilling permits, the group found that New York requests minimal information on waste disposal.Asked about disposal plans, companies in many cases replied in vague terms, like “hauled to an approved disposal facility,” Environmental Advocates said.“Following the waste stream from a well to ultimate disposal is nearly impossible,” the group said.State officials counter that their proposed drilling rules will impose a stringent waste tracking system.Stuart Gruskin, a former deputy commissioner of the Environmental Conservation Department, who worked on the first draft of the rules and now does consulting work, said he had no doubt that fracking waste could in principle be disposed of safely. But finding adequate treatment capacity will be a challenge, he said.“This is going to be a limiting factor in New York,” he said.'"

"'12-05-03,'0','With Mr. Chen expressing fears for his safety and pleading for President Obama to intercede on his behalf, the administration faced a barrage of criticism from Republican lawmakers and human rights activists that its bungled handling of the case had left one of China’s most prominent dissidents at the mercy of the Chinese police.The Chen case has rapidly become an issue on the campaign trail, with Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, accusing the American diplomats of racing to reach an agreement with China and then failing to verify it.“We’ve heard some disturbing things from across the world that suggest that, potentially, if the reports are true, some very troubling developments there,” he said on Thursday in Portsmouth, Va. “If these reports are true, this is a dark day for freedom and it’s a day of shame for the Obama administration.”The administration defended its actions, saying it had made extraordinary efforts to bring Mr. Chen to safety inside the embassy and honor his wishes once there. Mr. Chen, officials said, had left of his own free will after a plan had been worked out with the Chinese government that he and his family could relocate to a city close to Beijing where he would pursue his law studies.“At no point during his time in the embassy did Mr. Chen ever request political asylum in the U.S.,” said the White House press secretary, Jay Carney. “And at every opportunity, he expressed his desire to stay in China, reunify with his family, continue his education and work for reforming his country. All of our diplomacy was directed at putting him in the best possible position to achieve his objectives.”Guo Yushan, a friend of Mr. Chen’s who spoke to him by phone Thursday night, said Mr. Chen was not interested in seeking asylum outside the country; his desire, he said, was to go to the United States for a few months and then return to China. “He never complained, either directly or indirectly, that the American Embassy had ‘forced’ or induced him to leave the embassy,” Mr. Guo wrote on Twitter and Weibo, a Chinese microblog service. “He left the embassy voluntarily and appreciates from his heart the American Embassy’s help during the past week.”The messy fraying of the diplomacy has put the administration’s top China advisers under scrutiny — as well as its broader policy, which has treated human rights concerns as one issue among many in the complex relationship between the United States and China.The two Americans who led the negotiations — Kurt M. Campbell, assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and Harold H. Koh, the State Department’s legal adviser — are seasoned diplomats. Mr. Koh, a former dean of Yale Law School, is a prominent legal scholar on human rights issues. Mr. Campbell has deep Asian experience, though he is viewed as more of an expert on Japan than China.Gary Locke, the American ambassador to China who was also a crucial negotiator, is a Chinese-American lawyer, former Commerce secretary and governor of Washington. But he is working in China for the first time.In Washington, the Obama administration lost two of its most experienced China experts with the departure this year of Jeffrey A. Bader as senior director for Asia at the National Security Council, and James B. Steinberg as deputy secretary of state.By contrast, the lead negotiator for China, Cui Tiankai, the vice minister for foreign affairs, has worked on the United States for more than three decades.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers and human-rights activists questioned the administration’s actions and assailed China’s record of human-rights abuses. Speaking at a hearing of a commission on China, Representative Frank R. Wolf, Republican of Virginia, said, “it is hard to comprehend why the administration would accept at face value assurances that Chen would be safe upon exiting U.S. protection.”At one point, the commission’s chairman, Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, left the room and returned to announce that Mr. Chen was on the phone from his hospital room in Beijing.Mr. Chen reiterated his desire to travel to the United States, though not necessarily to seek asylum. “I want to meet with the Secretary Clinton,” he said in remarks translated by Bo Fu, a Christian pastor who has championed Mr. Chen and others facing repression in China. “I hope I can get more help from her.”Several China experts noted that the State Department team also could have anticipated that a verbal agreement with China’s Foreign Ministry, which is not considered among the most powerful organizations inside the Chinese bureaucracy, would not necessarily constrain the actions of security forces. Plainclothes security officers moved in and restricted access to Mr. Chen shortly after he left the American Embassy and entered a Beijing hospital, causing him to worry for his safety soon after he gave up American protection.Privately, administration officials acknowledged they had not followed through at the hospital, where Mr. Chen, after talking to his wife, began to fear for the safety of his family, and where their access to him remained restricted on Thursday.In retrospect, the officials said, the American negotiators could also have paid more attention to Mr. Chen’s wife, Yuan Weijing, and the effects of her reunification with her husband in the hospital, American officials said.Mr. Chen told reporters and friends in telephone calls from the hospital that he was outraged by threats his wife had received from security guards at their house after he escaped.“The opportunity for a tactical victory was very powerful,” said Christopher K. Johnson of the Center for Strategic and International Studies who until recently was a senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency. “Looking at the possible strategic downside didn’t occur to them.”Mr. Cohen, the lawyer and an expert in Chinese law, said Mr. Chen’s mood swung wildly at the hospital, something the Americans failed to anticipate. “They may have relied too much on his emotional stability,” he said. “And they should have at least negotiated to have stayed with him at the hospital overnight.”One person who knows Mr. Chen said it was not surprising that he became unnerved once American officials left, after days of marathon negotiations, all conducted through translators.After years of living in semi-solitary confinement, his fears appeared to have been magnified in the unfamiliar environment. He was also upset that his dinner was not delivered by 9 p.m. Wednesday, telling a friend that “retaliation” had begun.On Thursday night, Mr. Chen appeared to temper some of his earlier statements, in particular his assertion that American diplomats had pressured him into leaving the embassy. The comments suggested that Mr. Chen was not fully aware of the crisis his comments caused the day before. “He was totally astonished by this and felt very sorry for the pressure on the American Embassy created by these reports,” Mr. Guo wrote.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','Some homeowners decide it makes more sense to stay with their current mortgage, especially if the savings are small or they plan to move within a year or two. “There is a hassle to refinancing — all this paperwork,” said Sheila Walker Hartwell, a financial planner in Manhattan. One of her clients, she noted, recently decided against refinancing because she was already building equity in her home, which she hoped to use on her next home purchase.“When you refinance, you’re not building equity,” Ms. Walker Hartwell said. “You’re starting at the beginning” of the amortization tables.Amortization schedules work like this: In the first few years, almost all of the payment goes toward interest, so the longer you have the loan, the more is put toward the principal.“That’s very important,” said Edward Ades, a partner in Universal Mortgage in Brooklyn. He noted, for example, that in the first year of a $300,000 30-year mortgage at 4 percent, a borrower would have paid off 1.76 percent of the balance; in the fifth year, that rises to 2.06 percent.Those who refinanced in the last year or two don’t have to consider amortization tables, but they do need to know their equity position — and when the refinancing would begin to pay off.To calculate that, start with a rundown of all the closing costs, then divide the closing costs by the amount you expect to save on each monthly payment. So if closing costs total $5,000, and your monthly savings are $400, it will take you 12.5 months to break even on refinancing.If it takes you, say, three years to recoup the costs and you hope to move within two years, then refinancing does not make sense, said John J. Vento, a Staten Island financial planner.Depending on your lender, you probably need to have 20 percent equity, and maybe a little more, if you want to wrap your closing costs into the new mortgage. Those who are underwater — shorthand for owing more than the home is worth — may consider the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, which is now widely available, Mr. Cecala noted.Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com, suggests homeowners start with their current lender, and ask if they can streamline the process. You may be able to avoid a second appraisal and title insurance reports and fees, he said, adding, “That would save not only time but also money.”He also suggests that borrowers check out new lenders and consider a shorter loan term, to “shave years off the payments” and build equity faster.'"
"'12-05-03,'0','In a drawing from 1966, “Heaps of Language,” Robert Smithson assembled a pyramid of words about words: “Language” at the apex, supported by “phraseology speech,” “tongue lingo vernacular,” and on down through a base of synonyms. The playful exhibition “Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language,” opening on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, borrows Smithson’s title and runs wild with his vision of words as materials.Organized by the MoMA painting and sculpture curator Laura Hoptman, with help from the curatorial assistant Eleonore Hugendubel, it assembles works by artists and artist’s groups who make written and spoken communication intensely physical. Like most shows at MoMA these days, “Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language” comes with a series of performances.It also has a print component, the work of the puckish publishing collaborative Dexter Sinister. Free online and $5 in the MoMA shop, this volume mixes abstruse semiotics theory (an essay on the “meta-font”) with personal and institutional history (an article published in The New York Times on the evolution of MoMA’s logo).The first half of the show has the same scrappy-intellectual voice. The hall leading to the special exhibition galleries has been turned into a timeline of Dada wordplay and concrete poetry: spiraling puns by Duchamp, a phonetic poem by Schwitters, typewriter drawings by Henri Chopin and Christopher Knowles. A silkscreened PVC floor runner by Ferdinand Kriwet, from 1969, leads the way. Its bold white-on-black text issues two simple directives: “Walk Talk Walk Talk Walk Talk....”At the end of this corridor the poet John Giorno (filmed by the artist Rirkrit Tiravanija) is mostly talking; as he reads from his oeuvre, his body convulses with each syllable. Other voices emanate from a reprise of Mr. Giorno’s “Dial-a-Poem” of the late ’60s, a set of black phones connected to recordings of poetry by the likes of John Ashbery, Allen Ginsberg and Patti Smith. (Visitors can access the project from any phone by calling a local New York phone number — 347-763-8001.)One could spend a long time here, listening to poets and staring at Bruce Nauman’s hypnotic flashing neon piece “Raw War.” But that’s all prologue; the show begins, in earnest, with a short printed text by Sharon Hayes — one of five woven through the galleries and installed so close to the floor that you have to crouch down to read them. In these paragraphs Ms. Hayes puts herself forth as Virgil to the viewer’s Dante, though she also assumes the roles of spurned lover, diarist and political agitator.'"

"'12-05-04,'0','Two former executives at Rupert Murdoch’s British tabloid newspapers, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, pivotal figures in the phone hacking scandal with strong links to Prime Minister David Cameron, will give evidence to a public inquiry next week, according to schedules released Thursday. Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year. He has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials. Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron. She has been arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice. The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links — described by critics as improperly cozy — between Mr. Murdoch’s media empire and Mr. Cameron’s government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested “on suspicion of misconduct in a public office” as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into the payments to public officials, the police said. The arrest was made, the police said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation.'"

"'12-05-04,'0','Mr. Obama barely won this county in 2008 — 48.9 percent to John McCain’s 48.7 percent. Four years earlier, John Kerry had an easier time here, winning 52.3 percent to 47.2 percent over George W. Bush. Given Ohio’s critical importance as a swing state that will most likely be won or lost by the narrowest of margins, the fact that Mr. Obama’s race is a deal-breaker for even a small number of otherwise loyal Democrats could have implications for the final results.Obama advisers acknowledged that some areas of the state presented more political challenges than others, but said that the racial sentiment was not a major source of worry. The campaign’s strategy relies in large part on a strong performance in cities and suburban areas to make up for any falloff elsewhere among Democrats in this or other corners of Ohio.The Obama campaign aggressively monitors any racial remarks made against the president, but officials rarely openly discuss Mr. Obama’s race. The president released his birth certificate last year in an effort to quell a growing controversy about whether he is a United States citizen. He said last month that race in America was still “complicated.”“I never bought into the notion that by electing me, somehow we were entering into a post-racial period,” Mr. Obama said in an interview with Rolling Stone.“I’ve seen in my own lifetime how racial attitudes have changed and improved, and anybody who suggests that they haven’t isn’t paying attention or is trying to make a rhetorical point,” he said. “Because we all see it every day, and me being in this Oval Office is a testimony to changes that have been taking place.”Researchers have long struggled to quantify racial bias in electoral politics, in part because of the reliance on surveys, a forum in which respondents rarely admit to prejudice. In 50 interviews in this county over three days last week, 5 people raised race directly as a reason they would not vote for Mr. Obama. In those conversations, voters were not asked specifically about race, but about their views on the candidates generally. Those who raised the issue did so of their own accord.“I’ll just come right out and say it: he was elected because of his race,” said Sara Reese, a bank employee who said she voted for Ralph Nader in 2008, even though she usually votes Democrat.Did her father, a staunch Democrat and retired mill worker, vote for Mr. Obama? “I’d have to say no. I don’t think he could do it,” she said.But the main quarrels Democratic voters here have with Mr. Obama have nothing to do with race. They include his rejection of one proposed route for the Keystone pipeline, a stance they say will harm this area, whose backbone, the Ohio River, is lined with metal mills and coal mines.And the economy, on the rise nationally, is still stuck here. About one in three residents in Steubenville live in poverty, double the national rate. Shale gas, which has begun to bring profits to some counties in Ohio, has yet to take off here, and downtown is a grid of empty storefronts behind dusty glass.“The big word was ‘change,’ but there’s not been much of that,” said Christopher Brown, a union leader in Steubenville, who said more than 200 of his members were still out of work. “Members are saying, ‘What has President Obama done for us?’ ”As for race, he said, “It’s not on the front table, it’s in the back seat.”Just how far back is a question no one can definitively answer. “Race in America is always a work in progress,” said Clement A. Price, a professor of history at Rutgers-Newark. “It’s often a proxy for social anxieties, such as this long recession, joblessness and the war abroad.”Stephanie Montgomery, who is black and a graduate of Franciscan University in Steubenville, said her race came up so often in her job search in this area that she developed a technique for recognizing when it was happening. The sign: when warmth on the phone turns cool in person, and “they lose eye contact with you.”“You almost need a corporate environment to get  a fair shot,” she said while standing at a job fair in the Steubenville mall. She said that she did not vote for Mr. Obama in 2008 because she preferred Mr. McCain’s more conservative platform, but that Mr. Obama seemed to be a lightning rod for criticism, in part because of his race.“He’s everything they hate,” she said, referring to ultraconservatives. “An affirmative-action baby. Got the Nobel Prize without deserving it.”Many who raised race as a concern cast Mr. Obama as a flawed candidate carried to victory by blacks voting for the first time. Others expressed concerns indirectly, through suspicions about Mr. Obama’s background and questions about his faith.“He was like, ‘Here I am, I’m black and I’m proud,’ ” said Lesia Felsoci, a bank employee drinking a beer in an Applebee’s. “To me, he didn’t have a platform. Black people voted him in, that’s why he won. It was black ignorance.”Louis Tripodi, a baker in Steubenville who voted for Mr. Obama, blames talk radio and Republican rhetoric for encouraging such attitudes. “ ‘He’s a Muslim, he’s a socialist, he’s not born in this country,’ ” he said. “It’s got a lot to do with race.”Race has also helped Mr. Obama. It increased voter turnout among blacks in 2008, and some younger voters said it was part of why they voted for him. But now that history has been made, it is less of a pull.“It was kind of like a bandwagon that a lot of young people jumped on because it was history,” said Dee Kirkland, a 22-year-old working in a pizza shop in nearby Yorkville. “It was a fad to like him,” she said, adding that “race shouldn’t hinder you, but it also shouldn’t help you.”Mr. Obama still has a number of enthusiastic supporters here. Diane Woods, the owner of Pee Dee’s Brunch and Bar, a diner in downtown Steubenville, described him as “regal, and presidential,” and said she would vote for him again because “when he talks, it makes sense to me.”The fact that race came up at all in 2008 “really showed how divided we still are,” she said, cooking eggs one gray morning last week. “Blacks came out to vote for the first time because he was black, and you had all these whites saying, ‘Oh, there’s another vote from some drug addict.’ ”Mr. Corrigan, who supports Mr. Obama, said he believed that the president would ultimately win this mostly Democratic county but that it would be very close, a prediction he said was underscored by a recent flurry of Republican visits. Rick Santorum came here twice during his campaign, and Gov. John R. Kasich, a Republican, gave his annual address here this winter.“It’s going to be a nail-biter,” said Mr. Brown, the union official.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','Recent research by economists from the International Monetary Fund and academia offers some new insights about income inequality, with important implications.The researchers compared the top 5 percent of United States households from 1983 to 2007 with the remaining 95 percent. What they found is that as the rich got richer in the decades before the Great Recession, everyone else tried to maintain his standard of living by going deeper into debt. As income inequality grew over that period so did debt levels, because the rich increasingly invested their growing wealth in bonds and bank deposits, in effect providing money for ever more lending to the poor and middle class.The top group’s increasing wealth, and the bottom group’s increasing reliance on debt, spurred the growth of the financial sector. But with ever increasing debt, the financial system — and the broader economy — became ever more vulnerable to crisis.The data is eye-opening. In 1983, the top 5 percent had 80 cents of debt for every dollar of income, while the remaining 95 percent had 60 cents for every dollar. By 2007, after decades in which an increasing share of income flowed to the top, the situation had reversed. The top 5 percent had 65 cents of debt for every dollar of income, while the remaining 95 percent had $1.40 in debt for every dollar. The situation remains skewed today.The first step in restoring real stability to the economy is to lower the debt levels through what the researchers call “orderly debt reduction.” An example of that would be mortgage modifications. The second and more important step is to reduce income inequality by raising wages, possibly by strengthening collective bargaining.Income inequality and high household debt are not the only explanations of the financial crisis. But the researchers make a compelling case that greater equality and lower debt could make future crises less likely.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','More than a decade after 9/11, thousands of facilities that produce, store or use highly toxic chemicals remain vulnerable to a terrorist attack or accident that could kill or injure hundreds of thousands of people living downwind of an explosion. A Congressional Research Service report identifies 483 facilities in 43 states where a chemical disaster would put 100,000 or more people at risk.In 2002, Christine Todd Whitman, then the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency for President George W. Bush, joined with other agencies and drafted a strong, comprehensive chemical safety law that, among other things, would have encouraged producers and users of high-risk chemicals to find safer alternatives or processes. Industry fought back, claiming that the law would be too cumbersome and costly. The White House caved and refused to submit the bill.What eventually emerged from a divided Congress was a weak law that exempted thousands of facilities from any regulation and required little more than “vulnerability assessments” from the rest.Ms. Whitman has rejoined the fight, with a letter to the present administrator, Lisa Jackson, urging her to invoke the general duty clause in the Clean Air Act to require companies that produce, use or store toxic chemicals to seek out “safer cost-effective processes” and otherwise improve security “before a tragedy of historic proportions occurs.” Ms. Whitman’s letter followed an identical recommendation from the E.P.A.’s National Environmental Justice Advisory Council, which weighed in because chemical plants are often located near poorer neighborhoods that would be disproportionately affected by an explosion.The general duty clause — known as the “Bhopal amendment” in reference to the 1984 Union Carbide disaster in India — requires facilities to take steps to prevent accidental releases of dangerous chemicals and to “minimize” the consequences of such a release.Despite what industry may claim, that is not an impossible task. In 2009, largely on its own initiative, the Clorox Company announced that it would convert all its factories that use lethal, chlorine gas to more efficient and safer manufacturing processes that use a less volatile substitute. But, according to Greenpeace, an environmental group in the forefront of efforts to require safer plants, relatively few facilities have followed Clorox’s lead, even though alternatives for dangerous gases, including ammonia and hydrogen fluoride are available.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','Kraft Foods reported on Thursday that its first-quarter net income rose 1.8 percent as it charged higher prices for its packaged foods and its sales rose in developing markets.Kraft, the parent company of Nabisco, Velveeta, Miracle Whip and other brands, said it earned $813 million, or 46 cents a share, in the first three months of the year. A year earlier, its net income was $799 million, or 45 cents a share.Excluding one-time items like revamping costs, the company earned 57 cents a share. That was a penny more than analysts expected, according to FactSet.Net revenue for the quarter rose 4 percent to $13.1 billion, from $12.57 billion a year ago.Higher costs for ingredients reduced Kraft’s gross profit margin to 35.6 percent from 36.9 percent. But other costs fell, including selling, general and administrative expenses, which declined 4 percent, to $2.82 billion, for the quarter.Kraft Foods is preparing to split into two publicly traded companies this year. One company will focus on its international snack brands, like Cadbury. The other will concentrate on its North American grocery business, which includes Oscar Mayer meats.In North America, the company said, net revenue rose 1.3 percent with help from the price increases and the timing of Easter. Net revenue from Europe rose 4.5 percent, while net revenue from developing markets rose 8.5 percent as a result of both higher pricing and increased volume.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','JAMES MADISON never played with an iPhone, but he might have had something to say about the news last weekend about Apple. Over the last few years, the company has avoided paying billions of dollars in state and federal taxes by routing profits through subsidiaries based in tax havens from Reno, Nev., to the Caribbean.This is a common practice among major American businesses, and back in 1787, Madison saw it coming. Someday, he warned, companies could grow so large they “would pass beyond the authority of a single state, and would do business in other states.” To make sure the companies remained accountable to government, he said the federal government should “grant charters of incorporation in cases where the public good may require them, and the authority of a single state may be incompetent.”Such an act would create a common corporate architecture for all American companies doing business across state lines and internationally. It would establish not only uniform tax policies but also national standards for the structure of corporate boards, the power of chief executives, the relations of management with workers and shareholders and the interaction of American companies with other nations. National companies would have to abide by national rules, and the option of shopping around for the most favorable laws or tax policies simply wouldn’t exist.It’s an idea that has been proposed and pursued many times, particularly during the early 1900s, when companies like Standard Oil, which was a collection of companies incorporated in various states and assembled into a national “trust,” were becoming increasingly powerful. Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson and, later, Franklin D. Roosevelt all supported the creation of a national companies law, but the measures were consistently opposed by the business community and eventually defeated.Today, however, considering how much effort and money American companies expend on keeping a competitive advantage by figuring out which loopholes to exploit from the bewildering array of rules now in effect, they might not entirely oppose reform. In an era of global competition, it could help to have a clear set of standards. It’s certainly what other nations have. In Germany, for example, national legislation established rules for the structure of corporate boards. Britain’s Parliament establishes how a corporation can be created and what its rights and responsibilities are.Legally, there is little doubt that the United States Congress could impose similar rules under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Although the states have traditionally been the main arena for corporate rules, the federal government has long created national corporations, from the First Bank of the United States in 1791 to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 1967. Congress could use this same power to require that companies doing business across state lines have national corporate charters, which would subject them to federal rules. Alternatively, it could simply set rules for corporate organization and conduct that would apply to all interstate companies of a certain size.Passing a National Companies Act won’t be easy. Companies would hire lobbyists to push for favorable rules. And some states with particularly easy incorporation terms, like Delaware, might resist. Around 60 percent of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated in Delaware, and the state earns a great deal in fees and tax revenues as a result.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','“How Apple Sidesteps Billions in Taxes” (“The iEconomy” series, front page, April 29) was enlightening, but incomplete.In its latest annual report, Apple said that as of last September it had a staggering $54 billion parked offshore (since grown, as The Times points out, to $74 billion). Almost all of this huge hoard is accumulated in tax havens and has never been taxed by any government. More to the point, most of these untaxed profits are almost certainly United States profits that Apple has artificially shifted offshore to avoid its United States tax responsibilities.There’s a simple way to curb this kind of corporate tax dodging, of which Apple is only one prominent example: repeal the tax rule that indefinitely exempts offshore profits from United States corporate income tax. If those profits were taxable (with a credit for any foreign taxes paid), then Apple alone would have paid an additional $17 billion in federal income taxes over the past decade. That would have tripled the federal income taxes that Apple actually paid.Congressional scorekeepers estimate that ending the offshore corporate tax exemption would increase overall federal revenues by about $600 billion over the next decade. That’s money that could be put to good use in these times of strained budgets.As a shareholder of Apple, I’m very happy that it uses the tax code to reduce the taxes it pays to the United States, California and wherever. However, as an American citizen, I’m disappointed that our government provides so many opportunities for it to do so.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','In a drawing from 1966, “Heaps of Language,” Robert Smithson assembled a pyramid of words about words: “Language” at the apex, supported by “phraseology speech,” “tongue lingo vernacular,” and on down through a base of synonyms. The playful exhibition “Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language,” opening on Sunday at the Museum of Modern Art, borrows Smithson’s title and runs wild with his vision of words as materials.Organized by the MoMA painting and sculpture curator Laura Hoptman, with help from the curatorial assistant Eleonore Hugendubel, it assembles works by artists and artist’s groups who make written and spoken communication intensely physical. Like most shows at MoMA these days, “Ecstatic Alphabets/Heaps of Language” comes with a series of performances.It also has a print component, the work of the puckish publishing collaborative Dexter Sinister. Free online and $5 in the MoMA shop, this volume mixes abstruse semiotics theory (an essay on the “meta-font”) with personal and institutional history (an article published in The New York Times on the evolution of MoMA’s logo).The first half of the show has the same scrappy-intellectual voice. The hall leading to the special exhibition galleries has been turned into a timeline of Dada wordplay and concrete poetry: spiraling puns by Duchamp, a phonetic poem by Schwitters, typewriter drawings by Henri Chopin and Christopher Knowles. A silkscreened PVC floor runner by Ferdinand Kriwet, from 1969, leads the way. Its bold white-on-black text issues two simple directives: “Walk Talk Walk Talk Walk Talk....”At the end of this corridor the poet John Giorno (filmed by the artist Rirkrit Tiravanija) is mostly talking; as he reads from his oeuvre, his body convulses with each syllable. Other voices emanate from a reprise of Mr. Giorno’s “Dial-a-Poem” of the late ’60s, a set of black phones connected to recordings of poetry by the likes of John Ashbery, Allen Ginsberg and Patti Smith. (Visitors can access the project from any phone by calling a local New York phone number — 347-763-8001.)One could spend a long time here, listening to poets and staring at Bruce Nauman’s hypnotic flashing neon piece “Raw War.” But that’s all prologue; the show begins, in earnest, with a short printed text by Sharon Hayes — one of five woven through the galleries and installed so close to the floor that you have to crouch down to read them. In these paragraphs Ms. Hayes puts herself forth as Virgil to the viewer’s Dante, though she also assumes the roles of spurned lover, diarist and political agitator.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','“Taking into account a missile-defense system’s destabilizing nature, that is, the creation of an illusion that a disarming strike can be launched with impunity, a decision on pre-emptive use of the attack weapons available will be made when the situation worsens,” General Makarov said.Alexander Vershbow, NATO’s deputy secretary general, played down the general’s speech. He said NATO was trying to resolve what he called “differences in perception regarding the capability of the NATO shield” and hoped to find grounds for cooperation with Moscow.“I think a lot of the countermeasures described by General Makarov were familiar ones, but I’d have to go back and do research,” he said at a news conference in Moscow. “Clearly it is not something we welcome, by any means. We think the system we are developing poses no threat to Russia, so the whole notion of retaliation or countermeasures has no foundation.”Mr. Vershbow said NATO interceptors would not be able to be launched quickly enough to intercept a Russian intercontinental ballistic missile as it traveled toward the United States, calling it “a question of science and geography.” He noted that some Russian scientists and policy experts agreed with this assessment.President George W. Bush proposed the system for Eastern Europe after withdrawing from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty over Russia’s objections. President Obama first stalled the Eastern European program as part of the so-called reset in relations and then revived it in a new format, called the Phased Adaptive Approach.Russian generals floated a number of objections to the revised plan. General Makarov, in his speech, said the United States was refusing to offer written guarantees that the interceptor missiles directed at Iran would not have the capacity to hit a Russian ICBM in flight as it streaked toward the United States with a nuclear warhead. American officials have said the proposed system will not have that capability.Still, the Russian generals are not “completely misguided” in their suspicions, said Andrew C. Kuchins, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “There is an element in the U.S. elite that does want complete invulnerability,” he said in a telephone interview.Ellen O. Tauscher, the American special envoy for strategic stability and missile defense, who is attending the conference, told journalists in a briefing on Thursday that the American delegation would hear out the Russian objections but was unlikely to make concessions. In an election year the Obama administration might welcome the general’s remarks, to insulate it from criticisms that it is going soft on Russia.“The Russian concerns are concerns that we’re willing to listen to. But at the same time they cannot be concerns that we will mitigate by offering any kind of limitations,” Ms. Tauscher said. “There’s nothing I can imagine that will stop us making these deployments on time.”'"

"'12-05-04,'0','It was not clear when Mr. Chen and his family would be able to leave China, senior American officials said, but he would not be allowed to join Mrs. Clinton, as he had requested, on her departure for Bangladesh and India on Saturday. Still, the Americans appeared confident that the Chinese would abide by the accord, largely because Beijing was eager to see Mr. Chen go.Indeed, as part of their negotiating tactics with the Chinese government, State Department officials seemed to have used the argument that Mr. Chen’s departure would ease a major for Beijing both abroad and at home. Unlike the former Soviet Union, China has encouraged outspoken dissidents to go into exile, knowing that they would lose their influence inside China once they left.Whether Mr. Chen would be able to return to China was not addressed by American officials Friday. It is almost unheard of for Chinese dissidents who leave China to return.The negotiations with the Chinese government to allow Mr. Chen to leave China were conducted privately as Mrs. Clinton and Secretary attended the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue on Thursday and Friday.The formal meetings were overshadowed by the crisis over the dissident, but American officials said the forums were useful for pushing forward a host of hot-button issues.Mr. Geithner praised China at the closing session on Friday for “significant and promising” currency reforms that, over time, would lead to further appreciation of against and other major currencies.China announced that it would let foreigners own bigger stakes in its securities firms and promised to limit export subsidies. The cap on foreign ownership of joint ventures involving investment firms would be raised to 49 percent. The two governments said they would begin talks on limits to export credits.In the foreign policy realm, Mrs. Clinton urged China to join Washington in considering additional sanctions against . She praised China for supporting a resolution backing an peace plan for and . Overall, Mrs. Clinton said that the relationship between the United States and China “will determine the course of history in the 21st century,” and therefore it was up to the leaders to get it right.But behind the lofty talk, the Chen case had intensified to a point on Friday morning where it was clear that Mrs. Clinton and her aides had only a day to find a solution, unless she was prepared to leave China with a very disturbing human rights case hanging over her and the Obama administration.The situation was volatile because Mr. Chen was criticizing the United States government from his hospital bed. Under the original deal worked out by some of Mrs. Clinton’s top officials, including , the United States ambassador to China, and Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East and Pacific affairs, Mr. Chen was to move from his provincial home to a big city, probably Tianjin, to study law. The Americans believed they had secured pledges that Mr. Chen and his family would not be mistreated, and they were proud of what they called “a new model” for a Chinese dissident to stay in China.But after his release from the United States Embassy into a hospital for treatment of an injured foot, Mr. Chen said he feared for his life. His wife, who met him at the hospital, had been threatened after his escape, he said. Moreover, he felt abandoned at the hospital, where security officers prevented American diplomats from coming to see him.A friend, Jiang Tianyong, said in an interview on Friday that plainclothes police officers had abducted him and beat him when he tried to visit Mr. Chen.As Mrs. Clinton moved from one session to another at the high-level gathering, she and her top aides messaged each other about how to persuade the Chinese to fulfill Mr. Chen’s new wish to go the United States, senior officials said.Mrs. Clinton met the two top Chinese leaders, President and Prime Minister , at the Great Hall of the People in the late morning on Friday. They did not discuss the Chen case, officials said.A few hours later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that Mr. Chen, as a Chinese citizen, could apply for a passport in the same manner as the 340,000 students who studied abroad last year. It was the first public sign that a deal was in motion.The Clinton entourage, aware that they needed to maximize Mrs. Clinton’s presence in Beijing, still seemed unsure, however, whether everything would come together in time for her scheduled news conference in the early evening.Criticized for not getting a written agreement in their earlier arrangement, State Department officials made sure their statement detailed the basic terms for how the departure of Mr. Chen would work. The release said the Chinese government would “make accommodations for his medical condition,” a reference to the fact that Mr. Chen is blind and would not have to travel to his hometown for his passport application. In most cases, Chinese citizens must apply for a passport in their home jurisdiction. Mr. Chen had been badly mistreated by local officials.The statement said that once Mr. Chen had his passport, the United States would expedite visa requests from him and his family. The statement ended, “This matter has been handled in the spirit of a cooperative U.S.-China partnership.”United States officials said an American doctor visited Mr. Chen in the hospital on Friday, and reported that his foot, injured as he escaped his house arrest two weeks ago, had three broken bones. The hospital staff gave Mr. Chen’s two children clothes and haircuts, the Americans said. His son received a birthday cake.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','In its original proposal that oil companies disclose the chemicals they intend to use in drilling before starting a well, the Interior Department was seeking to address the concerns of landowners and communities about potential pollution of groundwater.But the industry objected, saying that the additional paperwork would slow the permitting process and potentially jeopardize trade secrets. The government then agreed to allow companies to reveal the contents of drilling fluids after the operation had been completed.Interior Department officials said that having a record would allow scientists to trace any future contamination and that it did not matter whether the fluids were disclosed before or after drilling.Last month Mr. Obama ordered the creation of an interagency task force to streamline federal regulation of natural gas drilling, and the Environmental Protection Agency issued revised air quality rules for oil and gas wells that gave drillers extra time to comply and lowered their costs. Industry officials praised both moves.The draft rule affects drilling operations on the 700 million acres of public land administered by the Bureau of Land Management, as well as 56 million acres of Indian lands. The Interior Department estimates that 90 percent of the 3,400 wells drilled each year on public and Indian lands use hydraulic fracturing, commonly known as fracking, in which large volumes of water, sand and chemicals are injected under high pressure into shale rock formations to stimulate the flow of oil and gas.The process has raised concerns about contamination of groundwater, well integrity and the treatment of the tainted water that flows out of wells during and after fracking operations.A majority of the 13,000 wells drilled each year by fracking are on private lands and thus fall primarily under state regulation, as they have for 60 years. Although rules and the rigor of enforcement vary from state to state, there have been efforts in recent years to standardize reporting under government and industry bodies like the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission.The federal government’s rules regarding oil and gas fracturing on public lands were last revised in 1988, before many modern techniques were adopted. The states where much of the activity takes place on public and private lands — including Arkansas, Colorado, North Dakota, Texas and Wyoming — have updated their rules and require disclosure of fracking chemicals at a Web site called FracFocus.The new federal rule seeks to integrate the state and federal reporting efforts, although environmental and citizen groups say the state database is difficult to use.The new regulation also broadens the definition of waters to be protected during drilling operations from “fresh waters” to “usable waters,” encompassing water used for construction, agriculture and other purposes.The Interior Department said that the rule imposed few new regulatory requirements that were not already being met at the state level and that it would not slow the granting of drilling permits. Barry Russell, president of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said that companies were already having trouble getting permission to drill on public land.Referring to the Bureau of Land Management, Mr. Russell said in a statement: “B.L.M.’s proposed regulations, which would mandate one-size-fits-all regulations on well construction and hydraulic fracturing operations on these lands, are redundant. They will undoubtedly insert an unnecessary layer of rigidity into the permitting and development process.”'"

"'12-05-04,'0','“This,” Mayweather insisted, is normal, all the chaos and the turbulence, even if these circumstances are without precedent. Even if preparations for this fight, while typical, serve a different purpose: to distract from the reality, jabs instead of jail.“My life has always been a roller-coaster ride,” Mayweather said. “Seven in one bedroom. Mother on drugs. Father being shot. Dad going to prison. Never having a stable home. I know you’re talking about jail. Me going to prison in June. I’m going to do the same thing: bob and weave. That’s what I’m going to do.”The night before, Mayweather rented a local amusement park. Friends and family gathered after midnight, in accordance with his odd schedule. (A typical dinner is consumed between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., and breakfast is eaten before bed, usually around 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. “I’m a vampire” is one of Mayweather’s new catchphrases.)As they waited for Mayweather’s workout arrival, those who had participated in the amusement park diversion wiped sleep from their eyes. Like the champion, they found comfort here, in numbers and family and routine.Preparations began immediately. Handlers laid out 13 matching sets of brightly colored gloves and headgear, gloves painted every color, painted with Mayweather’s face, the bottoms made to look like alligator skin. The sounds of rap on the stereo rose in volume until the gym vibrated. The room temperature nosed above 80 degrees, among the conditions mandated by Mayweather, along with the beverage selection (Pepsi, water, orange Powerade). Ricki Brazil, a childhood friend, said Mayweather had already planned for his time in prison. Some 10 people are involved in carrying out his wishes and ensuring that the corporation Mayweather has become will run smoothly. Brazil’s task is to update the registration on each of Mayweather’s 29 cars. Others have access to his bank accounts. Still others will check on his father, uncle and children.“Right now, he tries not to think about it, so we try not to think about it,” Brazil said. “He can block it out as long as he gets attention. As long as they’re talking about him, he’s happy. He knows he’s relevant, which means he’s doing something right.”Inside the gym, Roger Mayweather, uncle and trainer, said he last saw his nephew this sharp years ago, before he regularly took long layoffs between fights. Roger lost his belt after a 16-month break. That his nephew battered Victor Ortiz into submission in September meant Mayweather required less time to round into form.“When you lay off, you lose something,” Roger said. “That’s what boxing is.”Roger spit out the word, his favorite, “boxing,” with a heavy emphasis on box. No, he was not concerned that Cotto could weigh 154 pounds at superwelterweight. “Weight ain’t never won no boxing fight! Skills pay the bills!” Yes, he believed his nephew merited mention with the boxer he considers the best ever, Sugar Ray Robinson, whether Mayweather ever fights Pacquiao or not.The subject of jail time drew a more animated response.“It ain’t the first time my nephew ever been in trouble,” Roger said. “He ain’t never been in no real bad trouble. And he ain’t going to no real jail. If it bothers him, I can’t see how he’s knocking these guys out. He’s knocking these guys dead. Jail? Forget jail. Cotto will see the truth. That’s boxing.”As Mayweather pulled into his front parking spot, his personal chef, Jourdan Cha’Taun Atkinson, said the boxer scolded members of his staff who read commentary on his case. She spoke candidly of how Mayweather helped one of his drivers open a tattoo parlor in New York, that he sent Brazil to business school and that he enjoys spaghetti with turkey meat sauce, smothered chicken and rice — “basically, grandma stuff,” Atkinson said.She tensed, however, when the subject turned to legal matters. Like others in Mayweather’s inner circle, Atkinson said Judge Melissa Saragosa acted hypocritically in delaying Mayweather’s sentence for this fight, so he could earn hundreds of millions for the city, the state and, of course, himself.Mayweather faced 34 years in jail on felony charges of domestic violence, coercion and grand larceny for an incident in which prosecutors claim that he grabbed a former girlfriend — who is also the mother of three of his children — threatened to kill her and make her boyfriend “disappear,” twisted her arm and punched her head. The sentence: 180 days in jail, 90 suspended, credit for 3 served; 100 hours community service; $2,500 fine.Oh, and counseling. “Going great!” Mayweather said with unexpected enthusiasm.Inside the ring, a blow to the hip briefly silenced Mayweather. He retreated to a corner and instructed HBO to shut off its cameras.Soon activity resumed. Mayweather moved to the heavy bag, only to be interrupted again when another fighter was knocked out. The fighter lay flat on his back, eyes closed, as Mayweather and the rapper 50 Cent joined the chorus of raucous cheers. “Welcome to the doghouse!” Mayweather shouted. “Where anyone can get it!”Mayweather turned back to the heavy bag, then the speed bag, and his punches provided a drumbeat — tap, tap, tap, tap; thud, thud, thud, thud. Mayweather’s hype man added words to the soundtrack: “Right now, Champ! Get it, Champ! You ain’t got nothing but time! Nothing but time on your hands!”No one seemed to catch the double meaning.Mayweather’s oldest sister, Deltricia Howard, said it was impossible not to think about the sentence. She picked her words carefully, said she felt sorry for both her brother and his former girlfriend.“You’re supposed to learn,” Howard said. “You get all the red flags, and if you don’t pay attention to them, this is what happens. It’s my brother. I wish he wasn’t in this situation. But sometimes you see stuff. So you feel bad. But you don’t feel bad.”She added, “Controversy is part of his life.”Mayweather required a lengthy hearing to obtain his license from the Nevada Athletic Commission for this fight. The commission granted the license, but with six conditions, including no further arrests and full compliance with the judge’s order.“We’ve had all kinds of issues over the years in regard to licenses,” said Keith Kizer, the commission’s executive director. “But nothing where a guy is basically going to jail.”Back in the ring, Mayweather banished the sentence if not from his mind than from his gym. He talked and punched, talked and punched, with 50 Cent both among the crowd and blaring from the speakers. “Uh-huh!” the hype man continued. “Good! Good! All day! Keeping it coming! That’s right, Champ!”Finished, Mayweather retreated to his locker room, where he instructed one assistant to fetch clothes from his trunk, and turn the car around and on. Sitting on a bench, surrounded by his entourage, Mayweather turned reflective. He said he hoped to repair his relationship with his father. He said he wanted only one more megafight after this one. He said he cared about his legacy, the pay-per-view and gate records, the envious financial fight structure, the zero in the loss column. He said the boxing public would appreciate him more in 20 years.“No one has a perfect life,” Mayweather said. “I’m thankful. To whoever is reading this story, thanks for the support. And if you don’t know me, you know, Google me.”'"

That doesn’t work with a combo platter of old and new.”His worst shot came at No. 5, a par-5, 570-yard hole where his approach sailed wide left into a grove of trees and disappeared. Woods and several fans spent more than five minutes searching the thick pine straw for the ball. A marshal found one, but it was not Woods’s.Witnesses said they saw the ball hit the ground and disappear among a group of people, although no one saw anyone remove the ball. P.G.A. officials granted Woods a drop without penalty, ruling that a fan must have taken it. Had the P.G.A. ruled it was a lost ball, Woods would have been assessed a one-stroke penalty and returned to where he made his last shot. Instead, he shot from the woods and saved par on the hole.“A very strange situation,” said Mark Russell, P.G.A.’s vice president of rules and competition. “Nobody had any evidence that they saw the ball picked up, but there was no other place the ball could be if it bounced and went in there. Based on the evidence we had, I didn’t see anything else we could do. I think I would have been more wrong telling him he had to go back.”Playing in the group behind Woods, Rory McIlroy saw several instances in which Woods struggled.“It’s tough to scramble your way around this golf course all the time,” said McIlroy, who was six strokes out of the lead after shooting a 68. “It’s going to take its toll on you. These things take time, working on your swing. There are going to be weeks of where you see glimpses of it like at Bay Hill where he obviously played great, and there are going to be weeks where you’re a little off. It just so happens that these days his little bit off isn’t quite as good as it used to be.”When he needed it most, Woods’s putter failed. He two-putted from within 15 feet seven times, including twice from within 4 feet. Woods had 33 putts during his round and said the greens looked fast but were not.“I just don’t hit it hard enough because what my sight sees and what my feel is telling me are not what it is, and they’re not marrying up,” Woods said. “Consequently all my putts were left short.”Vijay Singh, who won this event in 2005, also missed the cut by shooting five-over par in the final four holes, including a triple-bogey on his final hole, to finish his round at 77 and the tournament at one-over 145. Anthony Kim, the 2008 winner, withdrew from his third consecutive event. He cited pain in his right wrist and elbow, along with his left thumb.Watney and Ben Crane were low for the day with 64s. Watney had seven birdies, an eagle and a bogey. Crane’s round also featured seven birdies, an eagle and a bogey. Crane moved him into a tie for third at 10 under with Stewart Cink, D. A. Points and John Senden. Lucas Glover failed to make the cut, the third consecutive year the event’s defending champion did not reach the weekend.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','The Metro-North Railroad and the Long Island Rail Road, both operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, carry more than 570,000 people every day. As presidents of these railroads, we make operating a safe and reliable system for our passengers our absolute priority. Thus, our railroads have invested over $1 billion on a signaling system providing a level of safety greater than that of many rail systems today.We have made great strides in implementing Positive Train Control (P.T.C.), designed to prevent collisions, on our systems. However, factors beyond our control make it extremely challenging for our railroads to meet the 2015 deadline required by law.Installing P.T.C. technology on the nation’s busiest and most congested commuter rail systems requires retrofitting 1,200 miles of track and more than 1,000 rail cars, as well as acquiring currently unavailable radio spectrum.P.T.C. cannot simply be bought off the shelf; much of the software and hardware to operate the system in high-traffic environments is not yet fully developed, let alone approved or in production.Nor has P.T.C. technology ever been tested or operated on a commuter railroad as large as our systems. It’s critically important that any additional safety technology installed on our railroads be fully tested first and not undermine our existing safety system.The nation’s largest commuter railroads, their customers and the region’s taxpayers would benefit from an extension of the 2015 deadline to make sure this major P.T.C. investment will work safely and effectively.'"

"'12-05-04,'0','Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week put out his revised proposal for the next city budget — a $68.7 billion plan that spares teachers, police and firefighters but slashes vital programs for needy children. That is not the way to balance a budget.The mayor’s budget and other changes will result in losses of about $150 million to city day-care and after-school programs. The programs are a lifeline for the working poor — without them many parents would have to give up their jobs and stay home to care for their children. They are also vital for children and young people who need the extra preparation the programs provide. The City Council can usually be counted on to restore some of these cuts. But it must fight even harder to expand the programs, not allow them to diminish every year.The city’s child-care and after-school programs have been cut from 137,000 places in 2009 to 94,000 today. The new budget would reduce that further to about 53,000. In these hard economic times, the need, and the waiting lists, are growing.Mayor Bloomberg on Friday announced that a program called Early Learn NYC would cover about 43,000 of the 50,000 children now in city child care and Head Start programs. The program sounds promising, with nutrition and health care provided along with childhood education. But 7,000 children should not be dropped from the rolls.On Thursday the mayor boasted that this budget had no new taxes and no cuts for teachers, police officers and firefighters. When pressed about the cut in children’s programs, he said, “The city cannot do everything for everybody.” That is true. But Mr. Bloomberg and the Council need to do a lot more for the city’s neediest children.'"

The hypocrisy and the political shamelessness are blatant here.There is a silver lining for advocates of sustainable development in your article.For climate-change deniers to rally behind Dr. Richard S. Lindzen’s premise — that as the earth’s temperature rises, fewer cirrus clouds will form, allowing more heat to escape the earth’s atmosphere — deniers must first accept that the earth’s temperature is in fact rising.

They are formidable competitors in some global markets and have a lock on many domestic ones.United States officials attending the annual meeting, the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, were clearly eager to report some good news from China amid a furor over mishandled efforts by the United States to assist a leading Chinese dissident, Chen Guangcheng.Treasury Secretary Timothy F.

"'12-05-04,'0','CAN YOU BUILD A BETTER BRAIN?As a researcher interested in procrastination and as an educator with years of experience, I know that the real limit to human potential is mainly the issue of engagement. Once engaged, just about anything that we practice at with focused attention will increase our “intelligence” — as there is truly a wide variety of intelligences that matter in life.Can I make myself smarter? Why would I want to do that? Many years ago, my mother used to frequently remind me that I was already too smart for my own good (typically highlighted by an expletive).The brain is like any other muscle: it gets stronger with use and more versatile with challenges. I had to work at developing spatial visualization, which didn’t come nearly as easily to me as verbal facility, but I did develop it. Same with math. I doubt the exercises described in the article increase I.Q. so much as train one in its uses. More important, it develops discipline. If you want to develop working memory, try writing a novel or a play. Keeping track of your characters’ actions and interactions and all the other elements that go into halfway-interesting and believable fiction will exercise every brain cell you have; more so if your characters are in a setting unfamiliar to you. (Disclosure: I’m a life member of Mensa.)It’s so depressing that the accompanying graphics for articles like these always show a jumble of nonsense mathematical formulas (usually on the board behind some smart scientist). It’s as if the math is just some kind of empty sign that indicates that we’re talking about intelligence. Why not try to do something more numerate and interesting instead of promoting the same old tired “math = indecipherable smart stuff” line?A KALEIDOSCOPE AT THE END OF THE TUNNELI think there’s another reason we don’t have legal access to entheogenic substances in addition to the three the story’s author, Lauren Slater, presented: our society’s profound fear of transcendence. It’s instructive to note that it was the early Christian Church that prohibited the Eleusinian Mysteries, during which ancient Greek and Roman people, for many hundreds of years, experienced a transcendent religious experience through the skillful use of myth, ritual and some sort of psychoactive drug. The church felt threatened by the ability of individuals to have spiritual experiences outside of its domain.Kudos to Lauren Slater for publishing a refreshingly objective article on the promise of psychedelic therapy. The categorical ban on psychedelic substances forces individuals like myself — an intellectually curious, politically involved student whose primary motivations for psychedelic use are idealistic and moral — into an unforgiving quandary. Should I use substances known to be conducive toward profound creativity and intellectual growth, thereby risking being defined as a criminal and alienated by mainstream society?Dear future caretaker, please take this as my written approval to dose me for the last several years of my life.My fear would be that taking something like psilocybin would prompt me to change my life. Would I realize that I am not really happy in my marriage? That my children really are that selfish? My problem is that I fear the delusions that allow me to manage my life would be diminished. And that the changes I would make might create unstoppable ripples. Life is a precarious balance. Would enlightenment destroy the balance I have created?Why can’t scientists do a study that shows that eating steak and chips and other good foodis good for your brain and your health? All they check is exercise and going vegan. Who wants to do that?Of course mice must run around to survive in nature. A lethargic mouse would, therefore, be a very stupid one. But human beings have used their brains to figure out how to avoid this constant scampering around to find food, obtain shelter, escape predators, etc. Two different kinds of existences. Is exercise good for the brain? Sure. Is it a panacea? Doubt it.If this is really a breakthrough discovery, it makes one wonder why jocks and athletes don’t rule the world or discover cures for cancer. Einstein never looked like he was in such good shape. Exercise is good for you, obviously — got to keep it all circulating — but leading people to believe that they’ll be “smarter” if they play ball instead of pick up a book might just help make rodents of us all.I started taking my cat on daily little hikes a few weeks ago. The changes I’ve noted already have been remarkable. She yowls for her halter and lead, paws at the door, then looks at me fiercely until I open it, hops downstairs slowly enough so I don’t fall, goes where directed on the walk, and when she gets back in her room, sits and waits for me to remove her gear before jumping on her bed for her nap. She’s probably gained 35 feline I.Q. points already. Me, I’m still forgetting my sunscreen and tripping over roots.I have no problem whatsoever with a woman being a priest in a Christian church; there is no male or female in Jesus Christ. I have no problem with a woman entering a bodybuilding competition in a rhinestone bikini. I don’t even have a problem with a man entering a bodybuilding contest in a rhinestone bikini. I do have a problem with a priest entering a bodybuilding competition in a rhinestone bikini. Why? Well, isn’t Christianity based on a spirit-flesh dichotomy in which the spirit is exalted over the flesh? What message does a priest preening in a bikini send about the Church?THE MANIAC IN MEI feel Daniel Smith’s pain, because I, too, am a worrywart. Like him, I imagine that if I had a big religion, I could pray and believe, and that would take care of all the worries. But how does an atheist pray? I worry about everything from whether my dog is bored to decapitation by ceiling fan. A friend calls my worries “white-girl worries,” and I worry about that.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','“These new rules are the biggest development in protection of the financial interests of state and local governments since the M.S.R.B. was established in 1975,” said Alan D. Polsky, chairman of the rulemaking board.The guidance, which takes effect in August, does not ban outright the complex and risky transactions.Under the original rule, the underwriters were required to treat “all persons” fairly, which many took to mean they had only to charge a fair price to investors who bought a municipality’s bonds – not to pay fair prices to the states and cities that issued the debt. The board said that the new guidance was the first in which the  fairness requirement was “fully articulated.”Many bond deals over the last decade were so complex it was hard for local officials to even understand how they worked, much less confirm that the terms were fair.Underwriters will also be required to tell their municipal clients about any payments received from other firms, like bond insurers taking part in bond transactions, derivatives advisers, lawyers and others.That requirement responds to episodes like the long-running bribery case in Jefferson County, Ala., now the biggest municipal bankruptcy case in United States history. Two officials of J. P. Morgan Securities, eager to underwrite a $5 billion bond and derivatives deal in 2003, paid more than $8 million to broker-dealers in Alabama who did no work on the transaction but could help steer the business to J. P. Morgan. The bankers then charged the cost of their illicit payments to the county’s taxpayers by inflating the interest rate the county paid on an interest-rate swap.The two bankers were fired. Charges against them are pending.The rules against wining and dining officials, then sending their taxpayers the bills, grow out of the practice of flying local officials to New York to meet with the credit analysts who would rate their communities’ bonds. Such meetings might take a day or two, but some underwriters invited the municipal officials to bring their wives, children and other relatives, stay on for the week and be taken to Broadway shows, sports events and expensive restaurants.The rule-makers cited a 2009 case in which the S.E.C. fined RBC Capital Markets $125,000 for factoring the cost of such entertainment into the debt being taken on by Mesquite, Tex.The S.E.C. has only limited authority over state and local finances, but in the last few years federal officials have sought ways to expand their oversight, saying the municipal bond market had grown too big to be so lightly regulated.The S.E.C. could act in the municipal market only in cases of fraud, when it could prove intent. Now it will be able to act without that burden of proof.Some of the most forceful calls for more federal involvement in municipal bond issuing came from California, which issues more bonds and debt most years than any other state.The state treasurer there, Bill Lockyer, discovered during the turmoil of 2008 that Goldman Sachs had issued a research report telling clients how they might bet against the creditworthiness of states, including California, by using derivatives known as credit-default swaps.The report ranked states by the degree of distress they were in, and by which appeared to have the most unsustainable public pension funds.California was having difficulty issuing short-term debt that fall because the markets were nearly frozen. Mr. Lockyer was incensed to learn that Goldman Sachs, an important underwriter of California’s debt, was telling clients how they might take a position against it.Goldman and half a dozen other financial institutions responded to Mr. Lockyer’s questions by confirming that they were dealing in credit-default swaps but arguing that the swaps had many valid uses and might even lower California’s borrowing costs.Mr. Lockyer did not believe it and began lobbying the architects of the 2010 financial reform legislation to ban the use of credit-default swaps for speculation.The new guidance does not ban such activity but requires underwriters to give cities and states current information about their involvement in it, in time for local officials to decide whether to find a different underwriter.“I’d like to see an outright ban against having the investment bank bet against the bond issuer with whom they’re working,” Mr. Lockyer said in an interview on Friday. “But if we can’t have that, robust disclosure is at least a good start.”'"
"'12-05-04,'0','Ten months clean and only weeks away from completing a drug rehabilitation program, Anders is spending the day in Oslo, and his back story and the extent of his pain emerge in a series of awkward encounters. A job interview goes off the rails when he’s asked about the gaps on his résumé. His sister declines to see him, suggesting the depths of the family scars. A visit to a close friend reveals the tedium of domesticity, an ambiguous ideal that in any case remains out of reach.It bears noting that off screen Mr. Danielsen Lie, 33, is an almost absurd high achiever: a practicing physician (who put in time at an addiction clinic while researching the role) and a singer-songwriter (who last year released his first record, a concept album called “This Is Autism”). Anders, on the other hand, is a privileged screw-up, who could and did rely on family and friends when nearing bottom and became an enormous psychic burden to many of them. Mr. Danielsen Lie isn’t afraid to reveal Anders’s uglier tendencies, but in capturing the character’s tragic self-awareness and his profound loneliness, he also shows us the depths of his alienation, not least from his own life.Among the many improbabilities of Benh Zeitlin’s Sundance hit “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” not least is that its two lead performers are a 6-year-old girl and a beloved New Orleans baker, neither of whom had acted before. Pitched as timeless myth as much as post-Katrina allegory, “Beasts of the Southern Wild” (June 27) revolves around the ragtag inhabitants of a southern Louisiana bayou village on the wrong side of a levee, bracing for an all-but-biblical flood and coming together in the aftermath. While the movie’s imaginative flights, its visions of ecological apocalypse and furry ice-age creatures come from its precocious heroine, Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis), it’s the little girl’s ailing father, Wink, played by Dwight Henry, who provides its anguished heart.Mr. Zeitlin found Ms. Wallis through the grueling process of auditioning more than 3,000 candidates over a nine-month period. But for the role of Wink, he gravitated to Mr. Henry, a charismatic chef whose determination to stay and rebuild after the devastation of Katrina mirrored a major theme of the film (and whose pastries and soul food Mr. Zeitlin and his associates knew well). Mr. Henry had just opened a new shop (his first was destroyed during the hurricane) when he was offered the role in “Beasts,” and his busy schedule required a whirlwind of multitasking, working with acting coaches in the pre-dawn hours as he prepared his bakery’s signature doughnuts.Mr. Henry’s inclusion in a film about the power of community speaks volumes, but beyond his totemic presence he happens also to be a screen natural and the movie’s best hedge against sentimentality. Wink is hardly a paragon of fatherhood, frequently absent and prone to benders and angry outbursts, which only makes his moments of sober clarity all the more piercing. Beneath Wink’s gruff exterior, Mr. Henry suggests a world of hurt, the ache of a man preparing his only child for a life without him.Craig Zobel’s “Compliance” is inspired both by a bizarre true story of a prank caller who targeted the employees of rural fast-food restaurants and by the famous Milgram experiment on obedience to authority. Accordingly, most of the characters here are human guinea pigs, not least Sandra, the frumpy middle-aged manager of a chicken franchise who, in the middle of a bad day and a busy shift, gets a call from someone claiming to be a policeman, accusing Becky (Dreama Walker), the pretty teenager working the counter, of stealing a customer’s money. The voice on the phone, saying he has alerted Sandra’s boss, instructs her to subject Becky to a series of escalating humiliations — confine her to the stockroom, seize her belongings, conduct a strip search and on and on — all of which, as the title suggests, she obeys.By design “Compliance” (Aug. 17) is not easy to sit through. It was heckled, and it set off heated arguments at Sundance this year. But as its defenders have noted, the film has an unmistakable political dimension (as an allegory applicable to, say, Nazi Germany or Abu Ghraib), and its tightrope balance between squirm fest and morality play would not have been possible without a performance as bold and incisive as the one the veteran character actress Ann Dowd delivers as Sandra. A familiar face onstage and screen (she’s had small parts in dozens of movies, including “Garden State” and “Flags of Our Fathers”), Ms. Dowd, in the meatiest film role of her three-decade career, pulls off an exceedingly tricky feat: a thoughtful interpretation of a character who embodies the dangers of mindlessness.It’s easy to condemn Sandra for her gullibility and lack of empathy, but Ms. Dowd, fully inhabiting the fatigued body and mind of a harried service-industry worker, never lets us forget the context that compels her to act as she does. With her nose-to-the-grindstone efficiency, her brisk mother-hen manner, her determination to get through the day with a minimum of disruption, Sandra would never think to upset the established order.Devoid of vanity and shorn of caricature, Ms. Dowd’s performance redeems the character from villainy but also reminds us that compliance is second nature in a corporate culture and economic structure based on upholding the status quo. (It’s also why the hapless Becky submits so readily.) When Sandra’s mask of zombie professionalism slips, allowing her to take stock of her actions, it’s a moment of both pathos and horror — and it’s topped only by a chilling final scene that shows her with that mask back on.Mere months after President Nicolas Sarkozy declared multiculturalism a failure, French audiences were lining up around the block for a movie about the unlikely friendship between a black hoodlum and a white aristocrat. More than a box office sensation at home (it’s the second-highest-grossing French film of all time), the odd-couple comedy “The Intouchables” (May 25) rose to the level of cultural event last year, spawning innumerable op-ed articles and other think pieces. A buddy movie that in one broad stroke both affirms and denies the divisions of present-day France, the film is all eager, feel-good bonhomie, and its not-so-secret weapon is the irrepressible Omar Sy, who plays Driss, a recently paroled petty criminal who finds himself working as caretaker to a quadriplegic Parisian millionaire.As Driss, who is of Senegalese descent and from the suburban projects known as the banlieues, strikes up a rapport with his boss, Philippe (François Cluzet), whose existence is one of physical confinement and lily-white privilege, the movie, directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, leaves few stereotypes unprodded. (Chamber music cedes to Earth, Wind and Fire.)Some American reviewers have questioned its simplistic view of race relations, but it’s not hard to see the wish-fulfilling appeal of “The Intouchables” in France (and elsewhere in Europe), where mainstream cinema has largely ignored the increasingly thorny subject of race. That appeal has almost everything to do with Mr. Sy, a graceful goofball with a ready grin and an easy physicality that can brighten even the stalest material.The French have embraced Mr. Sy, previously best known as one half of a television sketch comedy duo, as their Eddie Murphy. In terms of cultural significance Sidney Poitier may be closer: for some the image of Driss and Philippe strapped together while paragliding will evoke memories of Mr. Poitier and Tony Curtis in the 1958 chain-gang message movie “The Defiant Ones.”Just as Mr. Poitier once broke down Hollywood barriers, Mr. Sy became the first black actor to win a César, and he has lined up a lead role in the next Michel Gondry film. France is no doubt long overdue for a black movie star. But Mr. Sy’s achievement is more than symbolic. The movies can always use a star with this much charm to spare.'"

That officer, Anthony Carelli, and several others were sent to Mr. Chamberlain’s apartment after his medical-alert pendant went off and he did not respond to a call from a medical-alert agency operator.When officers arrived, Mr. Chamberlain was “acting irrational,” the police said. Officers broke down his front door and fired a Taser weapon and a shotgun loaded with beanbag ammunition before Officer Carelli pulled the trigger on his .40-caliber pistol.According to documents the police released on Thursday, Mr. Chamberlain was rushing toward a sergeant with a butcher knife when Officer Carelli shot him.Ms. Davis issued a statement about the inquiry hours after a lawyer for Mr. Chamberlain’s family, Randolph M. McLaughlin, wrote to the United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., seeking an investigation.“We are, frankly, thrilled” at the prospect of a federal review, Mr. McLaughlin said. “We think that when a full and fair look at the evidence here is conducted, they will come to the same conclusion that we have come to: that Mr. Chamberlain’s civil rights were violated by the White Plains police.”'"
"'12-05-04,'0','Two former executives at Rupert Murdoch’s British tabloid newspapers, Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, pivotal figures in the phone hacking scandal with strong links to Prime Minister David Cameron, will give evidence to a public inquiry next week, according to schedules released Thursday. Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year. He has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials. Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron. She has been arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice. The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links — described by critics as improperly cozy — between Mr. Murdoch’s media empire and Mr. Cameron’s government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested “on suspicion of misconduct in a public office” as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into the payments to public officials, the police said. The arrest was made, the police said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation.'"

Core participants may also discuss the wording of redactions in material to be published on the inquiry’s Web site.But, he said, the inquiry imposes strict conditions and, for instance, requires core participants to sign confidentiality agreements to prevent premature disclosure of material provided to them.According to its Web site, the status is available to those who “played a direct and significant role” in the scandal, had a “significant interest” in the hearings or “may be subject to explicit or significant criticism during the inquiry proceedings or in its report.”The inquiry scheduled its session on the government’s request days before Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, pivotal figures in the phone hacking scandal with strong links to Prime Minister David Cameron, are set to give evidence next week.Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007 and was closed last year by Mr. Murdoch, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year.He was arrested and later released on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials.Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron and is already listed as a core participant in the inquiry.She was also arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice.The Leveson inquiry is one of three overlapping inquiries into British press ethics and practices since the disclosure last year that The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid which Mr. Murdoch ordered closed because of the scandal, had hacked into the voice mail of a murdered British teenager, Milly Dowler, after she was abducted and before her body was found.Both Rupert Murdoch and his son James testified at the inquiry last week that they were unaware of the extent of the hacking when it first came to light and was investigated in 2007.But, separately from the judicial inquiry, a parliamentary investigation concluded in a finding split along partisan lines that Mr. Murdoch was “not a fit person” to run a huge international corporation and censured three former executives of News International.It also alleged that his company sought to cover up widespread phone hacking used to gather information about politicians, celebrities and other people in the news.At the same time the police are conducting their own interwoven criminal inquiries into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and corruption.The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links — described by critics as improperly close — between Mr. Murdoch’s media empire and Mr. Cameron’s government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested “on suspicion of misconduct in a public office” as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into payments to public officials, police officials said.The arrest was made, police officials said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation.'"
"'12-05-04,'0','So I called them all — and their mothers and fathers, too — to ask for some parenting advice.Turns out there were no compound-interest workbooks in any of their homes. Nor was there reading aloud from credit card terms or “The Millionaire Next Door.” But all of the offspring had a visceral memory of a habit or tactic they learned from their parents, which formed the foundation for the advice they give to other young adults today.THE NOTEBOOK The Rev. Keith Oglesby, Ms. Lyons Cole’s father, paid his way through Georgia State University in part by running a by-the-pound business called the Coffee Bean Barn in Atlanta.And he did it by tracking every cent he spent. “I was able to make a dollar last,” he said. “And when I sold the business, that money seeded some of the life my wife and I made together.”When Lauren, his eldest child, went off to college, he handed her a small spiral notebook to track her own spending, not really thinking she would do it.Ms. Lyons Cole, who is now 30, still has that notebook tucked in her apartment in East Harlem, along with all the others she filled out from the first day of college until she started tracking her expenses on Mint.com in 2007. The early entries from her freshman year at the University of Florida include $1 given to a homeless man and multiple entries for fast food at Chick-fil-A.“This will make me sound like a money anorexic or something, but it was about having a sense of control, of knowing what was happening,” she said. “There was something about that routine that gave me a foundation at a time when everything was changing around me.”Ms. Lyons Cole said she realized that financial planning was the right career choice after years of being the person at the party who meets new people and finds out their salary, rent and student loan payment in the first conversation. And part of the reason she has succeeded may be because her clients want to mimic the way she manages to afford to travel for at least a couple of months each year.“I don’t believe in budgeting and don’t put limits on myself, but I do have awareness around my spending,” she said. “Like someone who eats healthily, it’s just a consciousness.”THE FLOOR MATS A running theme throughout Ramit Sethi’s book, blog and courses is the idea that we should all negotiate like Indians do. When I asked his mother, Neelam Sethi, whether anyone might take offense to the idea, she seemed surprised.“That’s the way we grew up,” she said. “You never purchased anything without bargaining, whether it was milk or eggs or fruit.”It’s the big purchases, however, that had the most impact on the 29-year-old Mr. Sethi, a Stanford University graduate who often tells the story of watching his father, Prab, a mechanical engineer, negotiate for days in pursuit of a fair price on a Honda.And why was the teenage Ramit dragged along for all the negotiating sessions? “When we were growing up in India, big purchases were very rare,” said Mrs. Sethi, a teacher who moved to the United States in 1982. “You had saved up for it and talked about it for years, so you would take the family along. Then, you’d stop at the temple before you went home to say blessings for being able to buy something.”Or perhaps the blessings were to say thanks for having the strength to outlast the salesman. There had been multiple trips to the auto dealership for this particular Honda, and a deal seemed near until the dealer tried to charge the Sethis for floor mats.“Every car he showed me had the mats in there,” Mr. Sethi said. “He said I could go to Walmart, but if I was getting a name-brand car, I was not going to buy Walmart floor mats.”Mr. Sethi got his floor mats, and the lesson stuck with Ramit. “He didn’t mind being a little uncomfortable,” he said.And so the “What would an Indian do?” question is now part of a variety of Ramit Sethi’s sample scripts, from getting a bank fee waived to much more consequential negotiations over things like salary. “If you bargain like an Indian, what you’re saying is that I’m willing to ask for what I want,” he said.COUPONS Brittney Castro found her calling as a financial planner while she was still a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but it was her mother who helped start her down that path.Brittney’s most powerful money memory? “Waking up early and clipping coupons” with her mother on Sundays, said the 28-year-old financial planner, who works in Los Angeles.The Castros managed to raise their three children mostly on Mike Castro’s salary working for the Los Angeles Police Department. One of their biggest splurges over the decades was a new minivan when he retired from the financial crimes unit.“I think it’s hard for us to splurge,” Brittney’s mother, Linda, said. “We love going to T.G.I. Friday’s at happy hour and getting half off of wine and using a buy-one-get-one-free coupon. I’d rather go twice than once.”FLEA MARKETS Ms. Castro’s thirst for a bargain will be familiar to Zac Bissonnette’s mother, Beth Wechsler. Zac’s father is a carpenter, and she made a modest salary as a licensed independent social worker.She wanted to work part time to spend as much time as possible with her two sons. So she spent years seeking bargains at flea markets and took young Zac along. “I would start to feel guilty,” his mother said this week. “We lived on Cape Cod, we should have been going home to go to the beach. And he’d say, ‘Please, Mom, just one more.’ ”“I loved it,” said Mr. Bissonnette, who still haunts flea markets and is a contributing editor for the magazine Antique Trader.For years, Mr. Bissonnette got most of his clothes, toys and books from flea markets, and it changed his outlook on spending as an adult. “When you grow up shopping that way,” he writes in his new book, “everything in stores seems that much more expensive and you really think twice about parting with money.” It’s also, he noted in an interview this week, a really good reminder of how many things people buy that they didn’t really want.To him, the lessons of the flea market speak not just to money but to values, a theme throughout his book. “The idea that things that you own — and acquiring more and better of those things — can improve your life, there is such overwhelming evidence that it doesn’t work,” he said.And his advice for parents may not be something that they want to hear. “Do I think parents who drive luxury cars set a bad image for kids?” he said. “It sets the idea that this stuff is important in life. They’re learning that this stuff can make you happier, and you can rely on mass-produced goods for some sort of fulfillment. And you can’t.”For all of the fun he makes of his parents — and a sad scene or two in the book depicting his family’s occasional financial troubles — Mr. Bissonnette struggled to remember a single time when they splurged on things they shouldn’t have. He had strong memories, though, of a trip to the Cape Cod Mall when he was about 8 years old and his parents chose not to buy an enticing television set.“The people who exhibit anti-materialistic tendencies,” he said, “are the ones with the profiles of a typical American millionaire.”'"
"'12-05-04,'0','And if history is any guide, the Chinese authorities are unlikely to allow Mr. Chen, a self-taught legal advocate who had been silenced by seven years of prison and house arrest, to return home after his studies, especially if he continues his full-throated criticisms of the country’s authoritarian political system.It was the prospect of just such irrelevancy that prompted Mr. Chen to reject any discussion of asylum when he arrived at the American Embassy in Beijing last week after escaping smothering house arrest in rural Shandong Province.During six days of talks that ended on Wednesday, American diplomats sought to negotiate with their counterparts in the Chinese Foreign Ministry over how to meet Mr. Chen’s unusual demand: to stay in China, further his legal education and live “like a normal Chinese citizen,” as he put it.Both sides apparently thought they had found a way to satisfy Mr. Chen, but the arrangement fell apart after he left the embassy and fellow activists helped convince him that he and his family would be in danger if they stayed in China.Shaken by accusations that they had rushed a flawed resolution, State Department officials on Friday came up with the new arrangement, which would allow Mr. Chen to travel to the United States on a student visa.Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who helped broker the deal, said he hoped Mr. Chen would scale back his political activism while focusing on his education. “If he wants to stay here after his studies, then he’ll have to ask for political asylum,” Mr. Cohen said. “I’ll be disappointed in a way, but I’ll understand.”If Mr. Chen receives a green light to depart for the United States, he will arrive to find a fractured tribe of Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy advocates shouting over one another.Some analysts say that divisiveness hobbles the movement’s overall effectiveness and is one reason the Chinese government has allowed so many prominent intellectuals and political reformers to leave the country.“I’ve had discussions with Chinese officials who thanked me for convincing them to release people because they ended up spending more time fighting other dissidents than fighting the Chinese government,” said John Kamm, the executive director of the Dui Hua Foundation, which has negotiated freedom for a number of political prisoners.Such disputes, he and others say, are partly borne of the frustration that comes from toiling for so long without much result.Most exiles arrived in the late 1980s and early 1990s, after the government crackdown on protests in Tiananmen Square sent scores of students seeking sanctuary abroad. Huang Ciping, 50, an engineer who volunteers with the foundation established by Mr. Wei, said many exiles lack marketable skills and speak halting English.The Chinese government, Ms. Huang added, does not make their lives any easier, often refusing to allow politically outspoken citizens to return home. “The Communist Party wants to see you suffer,” said Ms. Huang, who has not been to China since 1998. “When my father died, they wouldn’t even let me attend the funeral.”There are, of course, a great many exiles who find success as lobbyists, lecturers and professional agitators. Mr. Fu, the Texas activist who helped advise Mr. Chen, has significant influence in Washington, thanks in part to the largess of Christian Americans.Harry Wu, the éminence grise of Chinese dissidents, who spent 19 years in labor camps, frequently testifies before Congress about prison conditions in China.More recently, Rebiya Kadeer, once a wealthy entrepreneur, has became an internationally recognized leader for China’s ethnic Uighurs.The Internet has amplified the voices of many dissidents and eased their isolation. Yu Jie, 38, a writer who was given permission to leave China in January, said he looks forward to writing books that are not censored. In recent days, he has used Twitter to ridicule the notion that Mr. Chen could fight for legal reform by staying in China. “The first thing we need to do is stay alive,” wrote Mr. Yu, who says he nearly died from torture by the police. “Then we can carry on with our missions.”Or as another activist put it: What good is a voice when it is trapped behind bars?But Tseten Wangchuk, a former researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said he has seen many compatriots grow embittered after the initial rush of freedom. He said part of the problem stemmed from the personality of the typical dissident. “These are not people who easily compromise,” said Mr. Wangchuk, an ethnic Tibetan who works for Voice of America in Washington. “When they come here, everyone thinks they are going to be the leader, but it doesn’t work out that way.”'"
"'12-05-04,'0','Syria’s government risked stoking a new source of rebellion on Friday when its forces fired on a mass demonstration in Aleppo, the country’s largest city, where activist groups said thousands of people had massed to demonstrate against the violent closing of the main university there the day before. At least four demonstrators were said to be killed.The allegiances in Aleppo have been closely monitored by experts on Syrian politics because it has remained a source of support for President Bashar al-Assad during the 14-month-old uprising against him, even as other major cities, including Homs, Hama and Idlib, have become increasingly hostile and subjected to harsh military crackdowns. A turn in Aleppo, the country’s commercial capital, could present new complications for Mr. Assad, who has deftly maneuvered to stay in power throughout the uprising.Some analysts said the willingness of Mr. Assad’s military to fire on protesters in Aleppo — a blatant violation of a cease-fire plan brokered by the United Nations and the Arab League — not only reflected his worry about that city’s political leanings, but also laid bare his intention to subvert the cease-fire plan, which took effect nearly three weeks ago.“This proves that they’re not about to allow that kind of assembly in the future,” said Andrew J. Tabler, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and an expert on Syria. He said the Assad government considered Aleppo to be “one of the trigger cities. They’re very scared about Aleppo. That’s a real weakness for them.”The genesis of the Friday protest was the abrupt and violent shutdown on Thursday of Aleppo University, attended by 60,000 students. Many people in Aleppo were incensed by the closing, which was carried out by uniformed and plainclothes security forces, according to Internet videos and witness accounts. At least four students were killed, including one who activists said had been hurled from the window of a high-rise dormitory.'"

"'12-05-05,'0','Mayor Michael Bloomberg this week put out his revised proposal for the next city budget — a $68.7 billion plan that spares teachers, police and firefighters but slashes vital programs for needy children. That is not the way to balance a budget.The mayor’s budget and other changes will result in losses of about $150 million to city day-care and after-school programs. The programs are a lifeline for the working poor — without them many parents would have to give up their jobs and stay home to care for their children. They are also vital for children and young people who need the extra preparation the programs provide. The City Council can usually be counted on to restore some of these cuts. But it must fight even harder to expand the programs, not allow them to diminish every year.The city’s child-care and after-school programs have been cut from 137,000 places in 2009 to 94,000 today. The new budget would reduce that further to about 53,000. In these hard economic times, the need, and the waiting lists, are growing.Mayor Bloomberg on Friday announced that a program called Early Learn NYC would cover about 43,000 of the 50,000 children now in city child care and Head Start programs. The program sounds promising, with nutrition and health care provided along with childhood education. But 7,000 children should not be dropped from the rolls.On Thursday the mayor boasted that this budget had no new taxes and no cuts for teachers, police officers and firefighters. When pressed about the cut in children’s programs, he said, “The city cannot do everything for everybody.” That is true. But Mr. Bloomberg and the Council need to do a lot more for the city’s neediest children.'"

"'12-05-05,'0','Federal prosecutors in Manhattan will begin a review of whether civil rights laws were violated in the case of a 68-year-old man who was shot to death last year by a police officer in his apartment in White Plains, N.Y., a spokeswoman for the United States attorney in Manhattan said on Friday.The spokeswoman, Ellen Davis, said prosecutors would examine “all of the available evidence” about the death of Kenneth Chamberlain Sr., a former Westchester County correction officer and Marine.On Thursday, a Westchester County grand jury voted not to indict the officer who fired the fatal shot. That officer, Anthony Carelli, and several others were sent to Mr. Chamberlain’s apartment after his medical-alert pendant went off and he did not respond to a call from a medical-alert agency operator.When officers arrived, Mr. Chamberlain was “acting irrational,” the police said. Officers broke down his front door and fired a Taser weapon and a shotgun loaded with beanbag ammunition before Officer Carelli pulled the trigger on his .40-caliber pistol.According to documents the police released on Thursday, Mr. Chamberlain was rushing toward a sergeant with a butcher knife when Officer Carelli shot him.Ms. Davis issued a statement about the inquiry hours after a lawyer for Mr. Chamberlain’s family, Randolph M. McLaughlin, wrote to the United States attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., seeking an investigation.“We are, frankly, thrilled” at the prospect of a federal review, Mr. McLaughlin said. “We think that when a full and fair look at the evidence here is conducted, they will come to the same conclusion that we have come to: that Mr. Chamberlain’s civil rights were violated by the White Plains police.”'"

Thus, our railroads have invested over $1 billion on a signaling system providing a level of safety greater than that of many rail systems today.We have made great strides in implementing Positive Train Control (P.T.C.), designed to prevent collisions, on our systems. However, factors beyond our control make it extremely challenging for our railroads to meet the 2015 deadline required by law.Installing P.T.C. technology on the nation’s busiest and most congested commuter rail systems requires retrofitting 1,200 miles of track and more than 1,000 rail cars, as well as acquiring currently unavailable radio spectrum.P.T.C. cannot simply be bought off the shelf; much of the software and hardware to operate the system in high-traffic environments is not yet fully developed, let alone approved or in production.Nor has P.T.C. technology ever been tested or operated on a commuter railroad as large as our systems. It’s critically important that any additional safety technology installed on our railroads be fully tested first and not undermine our existing safety system.The nation’s largest commuter railroads, their customers and the region’s taxpayers would benefit from an extension of the 2015 deadline to make sure this major P.T.C. investment will work safely and effectively.'"

"'12-05-05,'0','“This,” Mayweather insisted, is normal, all the chaos and the turbulence, even if these circumstances are without precedent. Even if preparations for this fight, while typical, serve a different purpose: to distract from the reality, jabs instead of jail.“My life has always been a roller-coaster ride,” Mayweather said. “Seven in one bedroom. Mother on drugs. Father being shot. Dad going to prison. Never having a stable home. I know you’re talking about jail. Me going to prison in June. I’m going to do the same thing: bob and weave. That’s what I’m going to do.”The night before, Mayweather rented a local amusement park. Friends and family gathered after midnight, in accordance with his odd schedule. (A typical dinner is consumed between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m., and breakfast is eaten before bed, usually around 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. “I’m a vampire” is one of Mayweather’s new catchphrases.)As they waited for Mayweather’s workout arrival, those who had participated in the amusement park diversion wiped sleep from their eyes. Like the champion, they found comfort here, in numbers and family and routine.Preparations began immediately. Handlers laid out 13 matching sets of brightly colored gloves and headgear, gloves painted every color, painted with Mayweather’s face, the bottoms made to look like alligator skin. The sounds of rap on the stereo rose in volume until the gym vibrated. The room temperature nosed above 80 degrees, among the conditions mandated by Mayweather, along with the beverage selection (Pepsi, water, orange Powerade). Ricki Brazil, a childhood friend, said Mayweather had already planned for his time in prison. Some 10 people are involved in carrying out his wishes and ensuring that the corporation Mayweather has become will run smoothly. Brazil’s task is to update the registration on each of Mayweather’s 29 cars. Others have access to his bank accounts. Still others will check on his father, uncle and children.“Right now, he tries not to think about it, so we try not to think about it,” Brazil said. “He can block it out as long as he gets attention. As long as they’re talking about him, he’s happy. He knows he’s relevant, which means he’s doing something right.”Inside the gym, Roger Mayweather, uncle and trainer, said he last saw his nephew this sharp years ago, before he regularly took long layoffs between fights. Roger lost his belt after a 16-month break. That his nephew battered Victor Ortiz into submission in September meant Mayweather required less time to round into form.“When you lay off, you lose something,” Roger said. “That’s what boxing is.”Roger spit out the word, his favorite, “boxing,” with a heavy emphasis on box. No, he was not concerned that Cotto could weigh 154 pounds at superwelterweight. “Weight ain’t never won no boxing fight! Skills pay the bills!” Yes, he believed his nephew merited mention with the boxer he considers the best ever, Sugar Ray Robinson, whether Mayweather ever fights Pacquiao or not.The subject of jail time drew a more animated response.“It ain’t the first time my nephew ever been in trouble,” Roger said. “He ain’t never been in no real bad trouble. And he ain’t going to no real jail. If it bothers him, I can’t see how he’s knocking these guys out. He’s knocking these guys dead. Jail? Forget jail. Cotto will see the truth. That’s boxing.”As Mayweather pulled into his front parking spot, his personal chef, Jourdan Cha’Taun Atkinson, said the boxer scolded members of his staff who read commentary on his case. She spoke candidly of how Mayweather helped one of his drivers open a tattoo parlor in New York, that he sent Brazil to business school and that he enjoys spaghetti with turkey meat sauce, smothered chicken and rice — “basically, grandma stuff,” Atkinson said.She tensed, however, when the subject turned to legal matters. Like others in Mayweather’s inner circle, Atkinson said Judge Melissa Saragosa acted hypocritically in delaying Mayweather’s sentence for this fight, so he could earn hundreds of millions for the city, the state and, of course, himself.Mayweather faced 34 years in jail on felony charges of domestic violence, coercion and grand larceny for an incident in which prosecutors claim that he grabbed a former girlfriend — who is also the mother of three of his children — threatened to kill her and make her boyfriend “disappear,” twisted her arm and punched her head. The sentence: 180 days in jail, 90 suspended, credit for 3 served; 100 hours community service; $2,500 fine.Oh, and counseling. “Going great!” Mayweather said with unexpected enthusiasm.Inside the ring, a blow to the hip briefly silenced Mayweather. He retreated to a corner and instructed HBO to shut off its cameras.Soon activity resumed. Mayweather moved to the heavy bag, only to be interrupted again when another fighter was knocked out. The fighter lay flat on his back, eyes closed, as Mayweather and the rapper 50 Cent joined the chorus of raucous cheers. “Welcome to the doghouse!” Mayweather shouted. “Where anyone can get it!”Mayweather turned back to the heavy bag, then the speed bag, and his punches provided a drumbeat — tap, tap, tap, tap; thud, thud, thud, thud. Mayweather’s hype man added words to the soundtrack: “Right now, Champ! Get it, Champ! You ain’t got nothing but time! Nothing but time on your hands!”No one seemed to catch the double meaning.Mayweather’s oldest sister, Deltricia Howard, said it was impossible not to think about the sentence. She picked her words carefully, said she felt sorry for both her brother and his former girlfriend.“You’re supposed to learn,” Howard said. “You get all the red flags, and if you don’t pay attention to them, this is what happens. It’s my brother. I wish he wasn’t in this situation. But sometimes you see stuff. So you feel bad. But you don’t feel bad.”She added, “Controversy is part of his life.”Mayweather required a lengthy hearing to obtain his license from the Nevada Athletic Commission for this fight. The commission granted the license, but with six conditions, including no further arrests and full compliance with the judge’s order.“We’ve had all kinds of issues over the years in regard to licenses,” said Keith Kizer, the commission’s executive director. “But nothing where a guy is basically going to jail.”Back in the ring, Mayweather banished the sentence if not from his mind than from his gym. He talked and punched, talked and punched, with 50 Cent both among the crowd and blaring from the speakers. “Uh-huh!” the hype man continued. “Good! Good! All day! Keeping it coming! That’s right, Champ!”Finished, Mayweather retreated to his locker room, where he instructed one assistant to fetch clothes from his trunk, and turn the car around and on. Sitting on a bench, surrounded by his entourage, Mayweather turned reflective. He said he hoped to repair his relationship with his father. He said he wanted only one more megafight after this one. He said he cared about his legacy, the pay-per-view and gate records, the envious financial fight structure, the zero in the loss column. He said the boxing public would appreciate him more in 20 years.“No one has a perfect life,” Mayweather said. “I’m thankful. To whoever is reading this story, thanks for the support. And if you don’t know me, you know, Google me.”'"
"'12-05-05,'0','So I called them all — and their mothers and fathers, too — to ask for some parenting advice.Turns out there were no compound-interest workbooks in any of their homes. Nor was there reading aloud from credit card terms or “The Millionaire Next Door.” But all of the offspring had a visceral memory of a habit or tactic they learned from their parents, which formed the foundation for the advice they give to other young adults today.THE NOTEBOOK The Rev. Keith Oglesby, Ms. Lyons Cole’s father, paid his way through Georgia State University in part by running a by-the-pound business called the Coffee Bean Barn in Atlanta.And he did it by tracking every cent he spent. “I was able to make a dollar last,” he said. “And when I sold the business, that money seeded some of the life my wife and I made together.”When Lauren, his eldest child, went off to college, he handed her a small spiral notebook to track her own spending, not really thinking she would do it.Ms. Lyons Cole, who is now 30, still has that notebook tucked in her apartment in East Harlem, along with all the others she filled out from the first day of college until she started tracking her expenses on Mint.com in 2007. The early entries from her freshman year at the University of Florida include $1 given to a homeless man and multiple entries for fast food at Chick-fil-A.“This will make me sound like a money anorexic or something, but it was about having a sense of control, of knowing what was happening,” she said. “There was something about that routine that gave me a foundation at a time when everything was changing around me.”Ms. Lyons Cole said she realized that financial planning was the right career choice after years of being the person at the party who meets new people and finds out their salary, rent and student loan payment in the first conversation. And part of the reason she has succeeded may be because her clients want to mimic the way she manages to afford to travel for at least a couple of months each year.“I don’t believe in budgeting and don’t put limits on myself, but I do have awareness around my spending,” she said. “Like someone who eats healthily, it’s just a consciousness.”THE FLOOR MATS A running theme throughout Ramit Sethi’s book, blog and courses is the idea that we should all negotiate like Indians do. When I asked his mother, Neelam Sethi, whether anyone might take offense to the idea, she seemed surprised.“That’s the way we grew up,” she said. “You never purchased anything without bargaining, whether it was milk or eggs or fruit.”It’s the big purchases, however, that had the most impact on the 29-year-old Mr. Sethi, a Stanford University graduate who often tells the story of watching his father, Prab, a mechanical engineer, negotiate for days in pursuit of a fair price on a Honda.And why was the teenage Ramit dragged along for all the negotiating sessions? “When we were growing up in India, big purchases were very rare,” said Mrs. Sethi, a teacher who moved to the United States in 1982. “You had saved up for it and talked about it for years, so you would take the family along. Then, you’d stop at the temple before you went home to say blessings for being able to buy something.”Or perhaps the blessings were to say thanks for having the strength to outlast the salesman. There had been multiple trips to the auto dealership for this particular Honda, and a deal seemed near until the dealer tried to charge the Sethis for floor mats.“Every car he showed me had the mats in there,” Mr. Sethi said. “He said I could go to Walmart, but if I was getting a name-brand car, I was not going to buy Walmart floor mats.”Mr. Sethi got his floor mats, and the lesson stuck with Ramit. “He didn’t mind being a little uncomfortable,” he said.And so the “What would an Indian do?” question is now part of a variety of Ramit Sethi’s sample scripts, from getting a bank fee waived to much more consequential negotiations over things like salary. “If you bargain like an Indian, what you’re saying is that I’m willing to ask for what I want,” he said.COUPONS Brittney Castro found her calling as a financial planner while she was still a student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, but it was her mother who helped start her down that path.Brittney’s most powerful money memory? “Waking up early and clipping coupons” with her mother on Sundays, said the 28-year-old financial planner, who works in Los Angeles.The Castros managed to raise their three children mostly on Mike Castro’s salary working for the Los Angeles Police Department. One of their biggest splurges over the decades was a new minivan when he retired from the financial crimes unit.“I think it’s hard for us to splurge,” Brittney’s mother, Linda, said. “We love going to T.G.I. Friday’s at happy hour and getting half off of wine and using a buy-one-get-one-free coupon. I’d rather go twice than once.”FLEA MARKETS Ms. Castro’s thirst for a bargain will be familiar to Zac Bissonnette’s mother, Beth Wechsler. Zac’s father is a carpenter, and she made a modest salary as a licensed independent social worker.She wanted to work part time to spend as much time as possible with her two sons. So she spent years seeking bargains at flea markets and took young Zac along. “I would start to feel guilty,” his mother said this week. “We lived on Cape Cod, we should have been going home to go to the beach. And he’d say, ‘Please, Mom, just one more.’ ”“I loved it,” said Mr. Bissonnette, who still haunts flea markets and is a contributing editor for the magazine Antique Trader.For years, Mr. Bissonnette got most of his clothes, toys and books from flea markets, and it changed his outlook on spending as an adult. “When you grow up shopping that way,” he writes in his new book, “everything in stores seems that much more expensive and you really think twice about parting with money.” It’s also, he noted in an interview this week, a really good reminder of how many things people buy that they didn’t really want.To him, the lessons of the flea market speak not just to money but to values, a theme throughout his book. “The idea that things that you own — and acquiring more and better of those things — can improve your life, there is such overwhelming evidence that it doesn’t work,” he said.And his advice for parents may not be something that they want to hear. “Do I think parents who drive luxury cars set a bad image for kids?” he said. “It sets the idea that this stuff is important in life. They’re learning that this stuff can make you happier, and you can rely on mass-produced goods for some sort of fulfillment. And you can’t.”For all of the fun he makes of his parents — and a sad scene or two in the book depicting his family’s occasional financial troubles — Mr. Bissonnette struggled to remember a single time when they splurged on things they shouldn’t have. He had strong memories, though, of a trip to the Cape Cod Mall when he was about 8 years old and his parents chose not to buy an enticing television set.“The people who exhibit anti-materialistic tendencies,” he said, “are the ones with the profiles of a typical American millionaire.”'"
"'12-05-05,'0','The inquiry lists 10 individuals and groups — including victims of phone hacking — who have already been given the special status. They include News International, the British newspaper subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation.John Toker, a spokesman for the inquiry, said core participant status would give the government the right to see documents and witness statements in advance and enable it to question other witnesses through its lawyers. Core participants may also discuss the wording of redactions in material to be published on the inquiry’s Web site.But, he said, the inquiry imposes strict conditions and, for instance, requires core participants to sign confidentiality agreements to prevent premature disclosure of material provided to them.According to its Web site, the status is available to those who “played a direct and significant role” in the scandal, had a “significant interest” in the hearings or “may be subject to explicit or significant criticism during the inquiry proceedings or in its report.”The inquiry scheduled its session on the government’s request days before Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, pivotal figures in the phone hacking scandal with strong links to Prime Minister David Cameron, are set to give evidence next week.Mr. Coulson, who resigned as the editor of the tabloid The News of the World, which was at the center of the scandal in 2007 and was closed last year by Mr. Murdoch, became a senior adviser to Mr. Cameron before being forced to step down last year.He was arrested and later released on suspicion of conspiracy in the hacking case and of corruption in approving payments from journalists to public officials.Ms. Brooks, who was chief executive of Mr. Murdoch’s British newspaper company News International, also has close ties to Mr. Cameron and is already listed as a core participant in the inquiry.She was also arrested on the same grounds as Mr. Coulson and on suspicion of obstructing justice.The Leveson inquiry is one of three overlapping inquiries into British press ethics and practices since the disclosure last year that The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid which Mr. Murdoch ordered closed because of the scandal, had hacked into the voice mail of a murdered British teenager, Milly Dowler, after she was abducted and before her body was found.Both Rupert Murdoch and his son James testified at the inquiry last week that they were unaware of the extent of the hacking when it first came to light and was investigated in 2007.But, separately from the judicial inquiry, a parliamentary investigation concluded in a finding split along partisan lines that Mr. Murdoch was “not a fit person” to run a huge international corporation and censured three former executives of News International.It also alleged that his company sought to cover up widespread phone hacking used to gather information about politicians, celebrities and other people in the news.At the same time the police are conducting their own interwoven criminal inquiries into phone hacking, e-mail hacking and corruption.The appearances are likely to deepen scrutiny of the links — described by critics as improperly close — between Mr. Murdoch’s media empire and Mr. Cameron’s government. Separately, a former Scotland Yard special operations officer was arrested “on suspicion of misconduct in a public office” as part of Operation Elveden, the investigation into payments to public officials, police officials said.The arrest was made, police officials said, as a result of information provided by Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation.'"
"'12-05-05,'0','It was not clear when Mr. Chen and his family would be able to leave China, senior American officials said, but he would not be allowed to join Mrs. Clinton, as he had requested, on her departure for Bangladesh and India on Saturday. Still, the Americans appeared confident that the Chinese would abide by the accord, largely because Beijing was eager to see Mr. Chen go.Indeed, as part of their negotiating tactics with the Chinese government, State Department officials seemed to have used the argument that Mr. Chen’s departure would ease a major for Beijing both abroad and at home. Unlike the former Soviet Union, China has encouraged outspoken dissidents to go into exile, knowing that they would lose their influence inside China once they left.Whether Mr. Chen would be able to return to China was not addressed by American officials Friday. It is almost unheard of for Chinese dissidents who leave China to return.The negotiations with the Chinese government to allow Mr. Chen to leave China were conducted privately as Mrs. Clinton and Secretary attended the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue on Thursday and Friday.The formal meetings were overshadowed by the crisis over the dissident, but American officials said the forums were useful for pushing forward a host of hot-button issues.Mr. Geithner praised China at the closing session on Friday for “significant and promising” currency reforms that, over time, would lead to further appreciation of against and other major currencies.China announced that it would let foreigners own bigger stakes in its securities firms and promised to limit export subsidies. The cap on foreign ownership of joint ventures involving investment firms would be raised to 49 percent. The two governments said they would begin talks on limits to export credits.In the foreign policy realm, Mrs. Clinton urged China to join Washington in considering additional sanctions against . She praised China for supporting a resolution backing an peace plan for and . Overall, Mrs. Clinton said that the relationship between the United States and China “will determine the course of history in the 21st century,” and therefore it was up to the leaders to get it right.But behind the lofty talk, the Chen case had intensified to a point on Friday morning where it was clear that Mrs. Clinton and her aides had only a day to find a solution, unless she was prepared to leave China with a very disturbing human rights case hanging over her and the Obama administration.The situation was volatile because Mr. Chen was criticizing the United States government from his hospital bed. Under the original deal worked out by some of Mrs. Clinton’s top officials, including , the United States ambassador to China, and Kurt Campbell, the assistant secretary of state for East and Pacific affairs, Mr. Chen was to move from his provincial home to a big city, probably Tianjin, to study law. The Americans believed they had secured pledges that Mr. Chen and his family would not be mistreated, and they were proud of what they called “a new model” for a Chinese dissident to stay in China.But after his release from the United States Embassy into a hospital for treatment of an injured foot, Mr. Chen said he feared for his life. His wife, who met him at the hospital, had been threatened after his escape, he said. Moreover, he felt abandoned at the hospital, where security officers prevented American diplomats from coming to see him.A friend, Jiang Tianyong, said in an interview on Friday that plainclothes police officers had abducted him and beat him when he tried to visit Mr. Chen.As Mrs. Clinton moved from one session to another at the high-level gathering, she and her top aides messaged each other about how to persuade the Chinese to fulfill Mr. Chen’s new wish to go the United States, senior officials said.Mrs. Clinton met the two top Chinese leaders, President and Prime Minister , at the Great Hall of the People in the late morning on Friday. They did not discuss the Chen case, officials said.A few hours later, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that Mr. Chen, as a Chinese citizen, could apply for a passport in the same manner as the 340,000 students who studied abroad last year. It was the first public sign that a deal was in motion.The Clinton entourage, aware that they needed to maximize Mrs. Clinton’s presence in Beijing, still seemed unsure, however, whether everything would come together in time for her scheduled news conference in the early evening.Criticized for not getting a written agreement in their earlier arrangement, State Department officials made sure their statement detailed the basic terms for how the departure of Mr. Chen would work. The release said the Chinese government would “make accommodations for his medical condition,” a reference to the fact that Mr. Chen is blind and would not have to travel to his hometown for his passport application. In most cases, Chinese citizens must apply for a passport in their home jurisdiction. Mr. Chen had been badly mistreated by local officials.The statement said that once Mr. Chen had his passport, the United States would expedite visa requests from him and his family. The statement ended, “This matter has been handled in the spirit of a cooperative U.S.-China partnership.”United States officials said an American doctor visited Mr. Chen in the hospital on Friday, and reported that his foot, injured as he escaped his house arrest two weeks ago, had three broken bones. The hospital staff gave Mr. Chen’s two children clothes and haircuts, the Americans said. His son received a birthday cake.'"
"'12-05-05,'0','Studies have shown that building low-income housing in higher-income areas can significantly improve the life chances of poorer families, who benefit from better schools and safer neighborhoods, for instance. But advocates of inner-city housing say families who make that move can also lose the benefits of public transportation, and can lose touch with their extended families and community support networks.“It is going to limit the diversity of the types of projects that are built,” said John Greenan, executive director of the Central Dallas Community Development Corporation. “We’re going to see projects in exurban areas where they have good schools and where it doesn’t have a high minority population.”The Rev. Donald Parish, a South Dallas pastor involved in the Hatcher Square project, said he understood that the state had shifted its rules in an attempt to correct problems with its policies. “But this makes it impossible to do a development in situations like ours,” he said, “where you have decades of redlining and the only way to get a development done is to have help.”Historically, developers have won the most coveted government incentive — known as a 9 percent tax credit subsidy — in two ways.First, the state housing agency rates projects on a complex scoring system. The highest-scoring projects in each region then win tax-credit subsidies for 10 years, which developers can sell on the open market to raise financing for their projects. In return, projects must keep housing units affordable and available to low-income tenants for at least 30 years.The 222-point scale rates projects on everything from financial backing to neighborhood support. The competition among projects is fierce.“One or two points is absolutely critical,” Mr. Greenan said. “It is that tight.”For projects that do not win on their scores, there has long been another way to be subsidized by the government: by direct action of the state housing board. Through the years, an increasing number of projects have been subsidized in that way, despite a past scandal involving a board member’s conviction for bribery for her role in helping developers win tax credits.But both ways of gaining tax subsidies changed drastically late last year.In the wake of a federal lawsuit challenging the concentration of affordable housing in low-income areas, the state shifted its scoring to reward projects in higher-income or downtown areas. Under the new scoring, developers miss out on four possible points by building in lower-income areas.Simultaneously, Gov. Rick Perry stripped the authority of the state board to grant tax subsidies outside the scoring system.Originally, these so-called forward commitments were intended to facilitate the quick construction of housing after natural disasters like hurricanes. The subsidies are called forward commitments because they are drawn from a pot of money allocated for one year after a board grants the award. The “forward” is good for 10 years’ worth of tax assistance.Over the years, the board leaned more heavily on the discretionary awards — and not just in emergency cases — drawing questions about whether the process was open to influence by politically connected developers. The percent of annual tax-credit financing awarded in forward commitments peaked in 2010 at 27 percent, or $15 million of the roughly $57 million allocated for the following year. That was up from 7 percent just five years earlier. The amount dipped back down to 19 percent in 2011, amid growing concerns about the practice, but it was still higher than all but two years in the previous decade.At the housing board’s meeting in September, at least a dozen state lawmakers showed up or wrote letters requesting discretionary tax credits for their local projects. But at the meeting, there were also complaints about the forward-commitment process from the board’s vice chairman and the housing department’s deputy executive director and from two developers who called the system unfair.Two Democratic state representatives from El Paso, Joe Pickett and Marisa Marquez, sent letters to the housing agency suggesting that the practice end.Mr. Pickett said in an interview that he had grown tired of the same few developers fighting over El Paso tax credits and showing up in his office begging for letters of support, letters developers need to boost their scores on tax-credit applications.“It just smelled funny,” Mr. Pickett said. “It seemed like some friendly board wanted to give them something.”Ms. Marquez said forward commitments had not allowed the region to plan for the unforeseen because available subsidies had been overbooked. “It just didn’t seem equitable, didn’t seem fair, wasn’t transparent,” she said. “It didn’t give us any flexibility for any kind of growth.”In October, a controversy arose in Dallas over claims that the board had unfairly favored one developer over another.The accusations came after the board cast a split vote to grant $20 million in forward-commitment subsidies to Copperridge, a low-income apartment project near the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.At the time, Copperridge was represented by Bill Fisher, a developer best known for testifying for the government in a recent housing subsidy scandal at Dallas City Hall. When the board selected Copperridge, it passed over higher-scoring projects, including Hatcher Square, which supporters viewed as a capstone in the Fair Park redevelopment project.Backers of Hatcher Square cried foul, asking state housing officials and Mr. Perry’s office to review the circumstances surrounding the award to the company Mr. Fisher worked for. They also raised questions about Mr. Fisher’s past.Mr. Fisher quickly separated himself from his longtime employer and from the project, but not before both the governor’s office and the state board had begun looking more carefully at the award. Copperridge became the final straw. In December, Mr. Perry issued a halt to forward commitments.In January, the board backed away from giving Copperridge a tax subsidy.Kathy Walt, Mr. Perry’s deputy chief of staff, said in an interview that she had never seen any evidence of wrongdoing around the Copperridge award. But questions about it raised enough concerns that she had instructed her staff to take a fresh look at the entire forward-commitment process, she said.“Certainly, there was a feeling among those who didn’t get forward commitments that it was unfair,” Ms. Walt said. “When you’re looking to try to develop a very level and fair playing field in an agency that years ago had been marked with scandal, in a program that is highly coveted by developers, you want to eliminate the nonobjective criteria to make sure it’s above reproach — that there is absolute confidence that this is a fair system.”Late last year, as the governor’s office was preparing to end the forward-commitment process, top officials in the state housing department were reworking the scoring system. Their goal was to tip the scale toward projects proposed in higher-income areas or in the central business districts of large cities.Those changes can also be traced to Dallas. In 2008, Inclusive Communities Project, a local nonprofit group based in Dallas, sued the state housing agency on grounds that it promoted racial segregation by drafting rules that pushed low-income developments into minority areas.In March, Chief Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater of the Federal District Court in Dallas ruled that the agency and its board had unintentionally discriminated against minorities through its policies and decisions. He ordered it to submit to him a plan for corrective action by late May.Because of the lawsuit, state housing agency staff and board members declined to comment for this article.But many developers and housing advocates said they believe that the new rules the agency submitted to the governor’s office for approval late last year amount to a first draft of the changes Judge Fitzwater will see from the housing agency this month. The huge changes for subsidies — the new scoring and the halt to direct awards by the board — have widespread implications for the locations of future affordable-housing projects, several developers said.For one thing, the path to build projects in lower-income areas will be much tougher. The agency will reward projects in “high-opportunity areas,” defined as census tracts with higher median incomes and good schools or access to transportation.Dorothy Hopkins, president of the nonprofit group Frazier Revitalization Inc., said the changes had made it all but impossible to win subsidies for Hatcher Square.Ms. Hopkins said that low-income housing tax credits should be for low-income housing, “but if you’re in a low-income area, you get penalized.”For the short term, there will be some push to build projects in downtown areas. But Mr. Greenan, the developer already connected to two low-income projects in downtown Dallas, noted that the downtown point advantage is temporary. Once a subsidized project is built in a census tract, the points a new project can earn for building in that same tract are reduced or eliminated. When points can no longer be gained for building downtown, he said, developers will shop higher-income areas for competitive sites.But do not expect them to seek properties in wealthy suburban areas, several developers agreed. Land costs are too high. And projects are still penalized under the points system if neighborhood groups oppose them.“There is a stigma,” said Dan Allgeier, vice president of the affordable-housing developer NuRock Companies. “The neighbors don’t want it. The school district doesn’t want it. There is always an issue.”'"

"'12-05-05,'0','What it showed was this: While places like Seattle and Denver and Brooklyn and Delaware can claim impressive craft brewing scenes, and a weirdly large number of people nationwide now speak of hop fetishes and beer crushes, Bend is a per capita powerhouse. With 80,000 people surrounded by not much of anything — with no Interstate and the closest major city 160 miles away across steep and snowy mountains — beer has had room to make a difference.And it has.“Deschutes County breweries and brew pubs reported 450 jobs in 2010,” Carolyn B. Eagan, a state economist, wrote last fall. “That is 15 percent of all of the brewing employment in the state. For a county that had 4 percent (one of every 25 jobs) of the state’s total employment that year, one out of seven jobs in Oregon brewing is quite impressive.”Just four or five years ago, Bend was a New West boomtown, one of the fastest growing municipalities in the United States, luring Californians and others rich with real estate equity to buy relatively inexpensive homes here. Then it all fell apart. The housing market collapsed, employment plummeted. People who had been wealthy enough to live off investments and rental income no longer could.“What we did for so long was just take advantage of the land we have,” Ms. Eagan said in an interview, noting that, although Bend is slowly growing, people are not flocking here the way they once were. “Well, you can’t export land, but you sure can export beer.”Of course, much of the appeal of beer in Bend is being here to drink it. Eric King, the city manager, said that since last year the city has collected more in hotel taxes than surrounding Deschutes County, where people might stay to ski or bike.“Now we’re sort of seeing this shift of people coming to Bend as an urban environment and coming here specifically for beer,” Mr. King said.Gary Fish founded Deschutes Brewery with a single brew pub in 1988, a few booms and busts back. Bend was a struggling timber town, “a desolate place,” he recalled.Over the years, Mr. Fish became increasingly involved with local business leaders, joining and then helping lead Chamber of Commerce and economic development groups. He also fostered what became something of a salon for aspiring brewers, who in turn went on to found breweries of their own.Bend had become a Black Mountain, a Silicon Valley, a Napa. Spinoff ventures emerged: the Cycle Pub, which has expanded to other cities; an Ale Trail through town; Silipints, a company that makes silicone beer glasses.“You have to thank Gary Fish for kind of creating that culture,” said Larry Sidor, a former brew master at Deschutes who left last year to open a brewery of his own this summer, CRUX Fermentation Project. “It’s been kind of a training ground, a spawning ground for the craft movement.”Purists worry that the culture is being diluted, of course. Some even fear a “beer bubble.”“They’re trying to make it Beer City, U.S.A.,” said Rob Leonig, a regular customer stopping at Boneyard on a Friday afternoon. “There’s always other breweries opening up, and I’m worried at some point somebody’s going to start making some junk.”Then Mr. Leonig handed over his growler bottles for a refill.“But I do love beer,” he said.'"

But a bankruptcy inside a financial holding company that also owns a bank could be particularly ugly. What might be the unintended consequences? Taxpayers might wonder, for instance, whether a ResCap bankruptcy would hurt Ally’s other operations — and its ability to pay them back.Granted, the old GMAC has had some success rebuilding itself as Ally Financial.

"'12-05-05,'0','In Travis County, which many consider the liberal hub of Texas, a controversial immigration-enforcement policy is at the forefront of the sheriff’s race.Sheriff Greg Hamilton, first elected in 2004, is coming under increasing fire from his Democratic primary challenger, John Sisson, a retired Austin Police Department lieutenant, for his use of Secure Communities. The program, administered by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and in place statewide, compares the fingerprints of arrested individuals to a federal database to determine whether those individuals are eligible for deportation. If a person is found to be in violation, ICE requests that a detainer be placed on the individual for 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays.The federal government says the program is needed to ferret out violent immigrants or repeat immigration violators for deportation. But critics say that the system focuses on lower-level offenders rather than the more violent criminals. Mr. Sisson said Sheriff Hamilton grants detainers on every immigrant who is booked.“I was appalled to see what it was doing to the Hispanic community and the immigrant community here,” Mr. Sisson said. “I felt like it was very inhumane to be lazy and not do the research and say, ‘We’ll just hold everybody for deportation and not even mess with the particulars.’ ”Sheriff Hamilton said that he is merely following the law.“The only one that can deport and put an immigration detainer on an individual is an ICE agent, not us,” he said. “At the Travis County Jail, we follow the law, and the law says that when an ICE detainer is put on, the law enforcement agency shall maintain that individual for 48 hours.”'"

"'12-05-06,'0','In victory, Mayweather added to his copious belt collection the W.B.A. super welterweight belt and the vacant W.B.C. one. On this night, it seemed as if the fight that actually took place was more interesting than the one that did not. It did not seem to matter if Mayweather was not fighting Manny Pacquiao.On this night, Cotto did some damage. The more Cotto landed right hooks to the body, the more he pinned Mayweather in corners, the more the crowd rose and screamed for him. Yet as Cotto continued his onslaught, Mayweather continued to shake his head.By the ninth round, it was fair to consider whether Cotto could win the fight, whether he could knock Mayweather from the ranks of the undefeated. Before the round, when Mayweather’s picture flashed across the big screen here, his lip busted, his face bloody, the crowd erupted in applause.As the bell for the 12th round sounded, the bout was too close for an obvious call. Again, Cotto pinned Mayweather in the corner. Again, they traded blows. With two minutes left, the crowd stood on its feet, chanting Cotto’s name. Mayweather landed one combination, then another. When the final bell sounded, the fighters hugged.Cotto (37-3) had come close. But Mayweather (43-0) had done enough. He landed more total punches, more jabs and more power punches and at equal or higher rates.On Saturday, Mayweather did what Mayweather does best. He put on a show, the usual mixture of sports and entertainment, another pageant of the absurd, another series of moments best summarized with “only Mayweather.”If the lights that flashed and the crowd that booed served as a distraction, the din would fade by Sunday morning. Once the fight finished, another date of utmost importance loomed larger than before. On Friday, June 1, Mayweather is scheduled to report to jail for misdemeanor domestic violence and harassment charges reached in a plea bargain.For the superstar with the 18-room mansion, a 10-by-6-foot cell awaits.Mayweather, because he is Mayweather, sauntered into the ring flanked by Justin Bieber and 50 Cent, with celebrities as divergent as Sean Combs and Triple H in the stands. Because he is Mayweather, he wore what looked like red leather shorts.Early on, it appeared Cotto wanted to force the action, to steer Mayweather, the most brilliant technical boxer of his generation, toward a brawl. Cotto was the aggressor, even as he wore pink socks. In the second round, he lifted Mayweather off the canvas in a bear hug. At the very least, Cotto made Mayweather look uncomfortable, forced him to fight in tight quarters and bounce around the ring.In the fourth, Mayweather landed a series of stinging right hands. The first snapped Cotto’s head back. So did the fourth, and the fifth, until it was as if Mayweather controlled Cotto’s head like a puppet master, snapping it back and forth.But Cotto remained patient. He stalked Mayweather into corners, kept aiming for the body, both hands pummeling Mayweather’s ribs. After one furious exchange in the fifth round, Mayweather emerged from the corner and shook his head, as if to say Cotto had not hurt him.“The judges said I lost the fight,” Cotto said. “I have to take my defeat.”Mayweather had approached this fight with the usual aplomb. He seemed relaxed even, perhaps boosted by a short, by his standards, layoff between bouts. It was only September when Mayweather floored Victor Ortiz with a legal but not necessarily sporting combination when Ortiz was not looking and should have been.Some seven months later, as Mayweather trained for Cotto, his uncle and trainer, Roger, said that it had been years since he last saw his nephew this sharp.Mayweather entered the fight as a heavy favorite, the odds tilted as high as 7 to 1 early in the week. His favored status ended there, though. The crowd at the weigh-in showered him with boos, as did those assembled at Grand Garden Arena for the fight.Not that Mayweather showed an ounce of concern over the growing villain status he helped to perpetuate. “We want to see the Floyd Mayweather with the flashy money,” he said earlier in training. “We want to see Floyd Mayweather with a diamond necklace. We want to see Floyd Mayweather with the nice cars.”And there it was: an average of one third-person reference per sentence.Another day in the life. Mayweather essentially paid himself $32 million guaranteed for the fight, a record for the sport certain to increase when other revenue streams come in.At the weigh-in, the fighters conducted the usual staring contest as if attempting a world record. It lasted for maybe 20 seconds, which seemed like 20 minutes, with Mayweather furiously chewing gum less than an inch from Cotto’s face.On the surface, Cotto provided respectable opposition. His two losses came against Antonio Margarito, who was later caught with hardened hand wraps, and Manny Pacquiao, who fought — and decimated — Cotto. In his last fight, Cotto avenged his loss to Margarito.“Cotto is a future Hall of Famer,” Mayweather would say Saturday. “He’s no pushover. He’s a tough competitor, and he came to fight. I dug down and fought him back.”As Mayweather conducted his postfight interview in the ring, the crowd drowned him out with boos. Mayweather, an athlete as divisive and polarizing as any in recent memory, much of it by his own design, just smiled.Jail? On Saturday, that could wait.'"

"'12-05-06,'0','Studies have shown that building low-income housing in higher-income areas can significantly improve the life chances of poorer families, who benefit from better schools and safer neighborhoods, for instance. But advocates of inner-city housing say families who make that move can also lose the benefits of public transportation, and can lose touch with their extended families and community support networks.“It is going to limit the diversity of the types of projects that are built,” said John Greenan, executive director of the Central Dallas Community Development Corporation. “We’re going to see projects in exurban areas where they have good schools and where it doesn’t have a high minority population.”The Rev. Donald Parish, a South Dallas pastor involved in the Hatcher Square project, said he understood that the state had shifted its rules in an attempt to correct problems with its policies. “But this makes it impossible to do a development in situations like ours,” he said, “where you have decades of redlining and the only way to get a development done is to have help.”Historically, developers have won the most coveted government incentive — known as a 9 percent tax credit subsidy — in two ways.First, the state housing agency rates projects on a complex scoring system. The highest-scoring projects in each region then win tax-credit subsidies for 10 years, which developers can sell on the open market to raise financing for their projects. In return, projects must keep housing units affordable and available to low-income tenants for at least 30 years.The 222-point scale rates projects on everything from financial backing to neighborhood support. The competition among projects is fierce.“One or two points is absolutely critical,” Mr. Greenan said. “It is that tight.”For projects that do not win on their scores, there has long been another way to be subsidized by the government: by direct action of the state housing board. Through the years, an increasing number of projects have been subsidized in that way, despite a past scandal involving a board member’s conviction for bribery for her role in helping developers win tax credits.But both ways of gaining tax subsidies changed drastically late last year.In the wake of a federal lawsuit challenging the concentration of affordable housing in low-income areas, the state shifted its scoring to reward projects in higher-income or downtown areas. Under the new scoring, developers miss out on four possible points by building in lower-income areas.Simultaneously, Gov. Rick Perry stripped the authority of the state board to grant tax subsidies outside the scoring system.Originally, these so-called forward commitments were intended to facilitate the quick construction of housing after natural disasters like hurricanes. The subsidies are called forward commitments because they are drawn from a pot of money allocated for one year after a board grants the award. The “forward” is good for 10 years’ worth of tax assistance.Over the years, the board leaned more heavily on the discretionary awards — and not just in emergency cases — drawing questions about whether the process was open to influence by politically connected developers. The percent of annual tax-credit financing awarded in forward commitments peaked in 2010 at 27 percent, or $15 million of the roughly $57 million allocated for the following year. That was up from 7 percent just five years earlier. The amount dipped back down to 19 percent in 2011, amid growing concerns about the practice, but it was still higher than all but two years in the previous decade.At the housing board’s meeting in September, at least a dozen state lawmakers showed up or wrote letters requesting discretionary tax credits for their local projects. But at the meeting, there were also complaints about the forward-commitment process from the board’s vice chairman and the housing department’s deputy executive director and from two developers who called the system unfair.Two Democratic state representatives from El Paso, Joe Pickett and Marisa Marquez, sent letters to the housing agency suggesting that the practice end.Mr. Pickett said in an interview that he had grown tired of the same few developers fighting over El Paso tax credits and showing up in his office begging for letters of support, letters developers need to boost their scores on tax-credit applications.“It just smelled funny,” Mr. Pickett said. “It seemed like some friendly board wanted to give them something.”Ms. Marquez said forward commitments had not allowed the region to plan for the unforeseen because available subsidies had been overbooked. “It just didn’t seem equitable, didn’t seem fair, wasn’t transparent,” she said. “It didn’t give us any flexibility for any kind of growth.”In October, a controversy arose in Dallas over claims that the board had unfairly favored one developer over another.The accusations came after the board cast a split vote to grant $20 million in forward-commitment subsidies to Copperridge, a low-income apartment project near the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.At the time, Copperridge was represented by Bill Fisher, a developer best known for testifying for the government in a recent housing subsidy scandal at Dallas City Hall. When the board selected Copperridge, it passed over higher-scoring projects, including Hatcher Square, which supporters viewed as a capstone in the Fair Park redevelopment project.Backers of Hatcher Square cried foul, asking state housing officials and Mr. Perry’s office to review the circumstances surrounding the award to the company Mr. Fisher worked for. They also raised questions about Mr. Fisher’s past.Mr. Fisher quickly separated himself from his longtime employer and from the project, but not before both the governor’s office and the state board had begun looking more carefully at the award. Copperridge became the final straw. In December, Mr. Perry issued a halt to forward commitments.In January, the board backed away from giving Copperridge a tax subsidy.Kathy Walt, Mr. Perry’s deputy chief of staff, said in an interview that she had never seen any evidence of wrongdoing around the Copperridge award. But questions about it raised enough concerns that she had instructed her staff to take a fresh look at the entire forward-commitment process, she said.“Certainly, there was a feeling among those who didn’t get forward commitments that it was unfair,” Ms. Walt said. “When you’re looking to try to develop a very level and fair playing field in an agency that years ago had been marked with scandal, in a program that is highly coveted by developers, you want to eliminate the nonobjective criteria to make sure it’s above reproach — that there is absolute confidence that this is a fair system.”Late last year, as the governor’s office was preparing to end the forward-commitment process, top officials in the state housing department were reworking the scoring system. Their goal was to tip the scale toward projects proposed in higher-income areas or in the central business districts of large cities.Those changes can also be traced to Dallas. In 2008, Inclusive Communities Project, a local nonprofit group based in Dallas, sued the state housing agency on grounds that it promoted racial segregation by drafting rules that pushed low-income developments into minority areas.In March, Chief Judge Sidney A. Fitzwater of the Federal District Court in Dallas ruled that the agency and its board had unintentionally discriminated against minorities through its policies and decisions. He ordered it to submit to him a plan for corrective action by late May.Because of the lawsuit, state housing agency staff and board members declined to comment for this article.But many developers and housing advocates said they believe that the new rules the agency submitted to the governor’s office for approval late last year amount to a first draft of the changes Judge Fitzwater will see from the housing agency this month. The huge changes for subsidies — the new scoring and the halt to direct awards by the board — have widespread implications for the locations of future affordable-housing projects, several developers said.For one thing, the path to build projects in lower-income areas will be much tougher. The agency will reward projects in “high-opportunity areas,” defined as census tracts with higher median incomes and good schools or access to transportation.Dorothy Hopkins, president of the nonprofit group Frazier Revitalization Inc., said the changes had made it all but impossible to win subsidies for Hatcher Square.Ms. Hopkins said that low-income housing tax credits should be for low-income housing, “but if you’re in a low-income area, you get penalized.”For the short term, there will be some push to build projects in downtown areas. But Mr. Greenan, the developer already connected to two low-income projects in downtown Dallas, noted that the downtown point advantage is temporary. Once a subsidized project is built in a census tract, the points a new project can earn for building in that same tract are reduced or eliminated. When points can no longer be gained for building downtown, he said, developers will shop higher-income areas for competitive sites.But do not expect them to seek properties in wealthy suburban areas, several developers agreed. Land costs are too high. And projects are still penalized under the points system if neighborhood groups oppose them.“There is a stigma,” said Dan Allgeier, vice president of the affordable-housing developer NuRock Companies. “The neighbors don’t want it. The school district doesn’t want it. There is always an issue.”'"

For a county that had 4 percent (one of every 25 jobs) of the state’s total employment that year, one out of seven jobs in Oregon brewing is quite impressive.”Just four or five years ago, Bend was a New West boomtown, one of the fastest growing municipalities in the United States, luring Californians and others rich with real estate equity to buy relatively inexpensive homes here. Then it all fell apart. The housing market collapsed, employment plummeted. People who had been wealthy enough to live off investments and rental income no longer could.“What we did for so long was just take advantage of the land we have,” Ms. Eagan said in an interview, noting that, although Bend is slowly growing, people are not flocking here the way they once were. “Well, you can’t export land, but you sure can export beer.”Of course, much of the appeal of beer in Bend is being here to drink it. Eric King, the city manager, said that since last year the city has collected more in hotel taxes than surrounding Deschutes County, where people might stay to ski or bike.“Now we’re sort of seeing this shift of people coming to Bend as an urban environment and coming here specifically for beer,” Mr. King said.Gary Fish founded Deschutes Brewery with a single brew pub in 1988, a few booms and busts back. Bend was a struggling timber town, “a desolate place,” he recalled.Over the years, Mr. Fish became increasingly involved with local business leaders, joining and then helping lead Chamber of Commerce and economic development groups. He also fostered what became something of a salon for aspiring brewers, who in turn went on to found breweries of their own.Bend had become a Black Mountain, a Silicon Valley, a Napa. Spinoff ventures emerged: the Cycle Pub, which has expanded to other cities; an Ale Trail through town; Silipints, a company that makes silicone beer glasses.“You have to thank Gary Fish for kind of creating that culture,” said Larry Sidor, a former brew master at Deschutes who left last year to open a brewery of his own this summer, CRUX Fermentation Project. “It’s been kind of a training ground, a spawning ground for the craft movement.”Purists worry that the culture is being diluted, of course. Some even fear a “beer bubble.”“They’re trying to make it Beer City, U.S.A.,” said Rob Leonig, a regular customer stopping at Boneyard on a Friday afternoon. “There’s always other breweries opening up, and I’m worried at some point somebody’s going to start making some junk.”Then Mr. Leonig handed over his growler bottles for a refill.“But I do love beer,” he said.'"
"'12-05-06,'0','Ten months clean and only weeks away from completing a drug rehabilitation program, Anders is spending the day in Oslo, and his back story and the extent of his pain emerge in a series of awkward encounters. A job interview goes off the rails when he’s asked about the gaps on his résumé. His sister declines to see him, suggesting the depths of the family scars. A visit to a close friend reveals the tedium of domesticity, an ambiguous ideal that in any case remains out of reach.It bears noting that off screen Mr. Danielsen Lie, 33, is an almost absurd high achiever: a practicing physician (who put in time at an addiction clinic while researching the role) and a singer-songwriter (who last year released his first record, a concept album called “This Is Autism”). Anders, on the other hand, is a privileged screw-up, who could and did rely on family and friends when nearing bottom and became an enormous psychic burden to many of them. Mr. Danielsen Lie isn’t afraid to reveal Anders’s uglier tendencies, but in capturing the character’s tragic self-awareness and his profound loneliness, he also shows us the depths of his alienation, not least from his own life.Among the many improbabilities of Benh Zeitlin’s Sundance hit “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” not least is that its two lead performers are a 6-year-old girl and a beloved New Orleans baker, neither of whom had acted before. Pitched as timeless myth as much as post-Katrina allegory, “Beasts of the Southern Wild” (June 27) revolves around the ragtag inhabitants of a southern Louisiana bayou village on the wrong side of a levee, bracing for an all-but-biblical flood and coming together in the aftermath. While the movie’s imaginative flights, its visions of ecological apocalypse and furry ice-age creatures come from its precocious heroine, Hushpuppy (Quvenzhané Wallis), it’s the little girl’s ailing father, Wink, played by Dwight Henry, who provides its anguished heart.Mr. Zeitlin found Ms. Wallis through the grueling process of auditioning more than 3,000 candidates over a nine-month period. But for the role of Wink, he gravitated to Mr. Henry, a charismatic chef whose determination to stay and rebuild after the devastation of Katrina mirrored a major theme of the film (and whose pastries and soul food Mr. Zeitlin and his associates knew well). Mr. Henry had just opened a new shop (his first was destroyed during the hurricane) when he was offered the role in “Beasts,” and his busy schedule required a whirlwind of multitasking, working with acting coaches in the pre-dawn hours as he prepared his bakery’s signature doughnuts.Mr. Henry’s inclusion in a film about the power of community speaks volumes, but beyond his totemic presence he happens also to be a screen natural and the movie’s best hedge against sentimentality. Wink is hardly a paragon of fatherhood, frequently absent and prone to benders and angry outbursts, which only makes his moments of sober clarity all the more piercing. Beneath Wink’s gruff exterior, Mr. Henry suggests a world of hurt, the ache of a man preparing his only child for a life without him.Craig Zobel’s “Compliance” is inspired both by a bizarre true story of a prank caller who targeted the employees of rural fast-food restaurants and by the famous Milgram experiment on obedience to authority. Accordingly, most of the characters here are human guinea pigs, not least Sandra, the frumpy middle-aged manager of a chicken franchise who, in the middle of a bad day and a busy shift, gets a call from someone claiming to be a policeman, accusing Becky (Dreama Walker), the pretty teenager working the counter, of stealing a customer’s money. The voice on the phone, saying he has alerted Sandra’s boss, instructs her to subject Becky to a series of escalating humiliations — confine her to the stockroom, seize her belongings, conduct a strip search and on and on — all of which, as the title suggests, she obeys.By design “Compliance” (Aug. 17) is not easy to sit through. It was heckled, and it set off heated arguments at Sundance this year. But as its defenders have noted, the film has an unmistakable political dimension (as an allegory applicable to, say, Nazi Germany or Abu Ghraib), and its tightrope balance between squirm fest and morality play would not have been possible without a performance as bold and incisive as the one the veteran character actress Ann Dowd delivers as Sandra. A familiar face onstage and screen (she’s had small parts in dozens of movies, including “Garden State” and “Flags of Our Fathers”), Ms. Dowd, in the meatiest film role of her three-decade career, pulls off an exceedingly tricky feat: a thoughtful interpretation of a character who embodies the dangers of mindlessness.It’s easy to condemn Sandra for her gullibility and lack of empathy, but Ms. Dowd, fully inhabiting the fatigued body and mind of a harried service-industry worker, never lets us forget the context that compels her to act as she does. With her nose-to-the-grindstone efficiency, her brisk mother-hen manner, her determination to get through the day with a minimum of disruption, Sandra would never think to upset the established order.Devoid of vanity and shorn of caricature, Ms. Dowd’s performance redeems the character from villainy but also reminds us that compliance is second nature in a corporate culture and economic structure based on upholding the status quo. (It’s also why the hapless Becky submits so readily.) When Sandra’s mask of zombie professionalism slips, allowing her to take stock of her actions, it’s a moment of both pathos and horror — and it’s topped only by a chilling final scene that shows her with that mask back on.Mere months after President Nicolas Sarkozy declared multiculturalism a failure, French audiences were lining up around the block for a movie about the unlikely friendship between a black hoodlum and a white aristocrat. More than a box office sensation at home (it’s the second-highest-grossing French film of all time), the odd-couple comedy “The Intouchables” (May 25) rose to the level of cultural event last year, spawning innumerable op-ed articles and other think pieces. A buddy movie that in one broad stroke both affirms and denies the divisions of present-day France, the film is all eager, feel-good bonhomie, and its not-so-secret weapon is the irrepressible Omar Sy, who plays Driss, a recently paroled petty criminal who finds himself working as caretaker to a quadriplegic Parisian millionaire.As Driss, who is of Senegalese descent and from the suburban projects known as the banlieues, strikes up a rapport with his boss, Philippe (François Cluzet), whose existence is one of physical confinement and lily-white privilege, the movie, directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, leaves few stereotypes unprodded. (Chamber music cedes to Earth, Wind and Fire.)Some American reviewers have questioned its simplistic view of race relations, but it’s not hard to see the wish-fulfilling appeal of “The Intouchables” in France (and elsewhere in Europe), where mainstream cinema has largely ignored the increasingly thorny subject of race. That appeal has almost everything to do with Mr. Sy, a graceful goofball with a ready grin and an easy physicality that can brighten even the stalest material.The French have embraced Mr. Sy, previously best known as one half of a television sketch comedy duo, as their Eddie Murphy. In terms of cultural significance Sidney Poitier may be closer: for some the image of Driss and Philippe strapped together while paragliding will evoke memories of Mr. Poitier and Tony Curtis in the 1958 chain-gang message movie “The Defiant Ones.”Just as Mr. Poitier once broke down Hollywood barriers, Mr. Sy became the first black actor to win a César, and he has lined up a lead role in the next Michel Gondry film. France is no doubt long overdue for a black movie star. But Mr. Sy’s achievement is more than symbolic. The movies can always use a star with this much charm to spare.'"
"'12-05-06,'0','CAN YOU BUILD A BETTER BRAIN?As a researcher interested in procrastination and as an educator with years of experience, I know that the real limit to human potential is mainly the issue of engagement. Once engaged, just about anything that we practice at with focused attention will increase our “intelligence” — as there is truly a wide variety of intelligences that matter in life.Can I make myself smarter? Why would I want to do that? Many years ago, my mother used to frequently remind me that I was already too smart for my own good (typically highlighted by an expletive).The brain is like any other muscle: it gets stronger with use and more versatile with challenges. I had to work at developing spatial visualization, which didn’t come nearly as easily to me as verbal facility, but I did develop it. Same with math. I doubt the exercises described in the article increase I.Q. so much as train one in its uses. More important, it develops discipline. If you want to develop working memory, try writing a novel or a play. Keeping track of your characters’ actions and interactions and all the other elements that go into halfway-interesting and believable fiction will exercise every brain cell you have; more so if your characters are in a setting unfamiliar to you. (Disclosure: I’m a life member of Mensa.)It’s so depressing that the accompanying graphics for articles like these always show a jumble of nonsense mathematical formulas (usually on the board behind some smart scientist). It’s as if the math is just some kind of empty sign that indicates that we’re talking about intelligence. Why not try to do something more numerate and interesting instead of promoting the same old tired “math = indecipherable smart stuff” line?A KALEIDOSCOPE AT THE END OF THE TUNNELI think there’s another reason we don’t have legal access to entheogenic substances in addition to the three the story’s author, Lauren Slater, presented: our society’s profound fear of transcendence. It’s instructive to note that it was the early Christian Church that prohibited the Eleusinian Mysteries, during which ancient Greek and Roman people, for many hundreds of years, experienced a transcendent religious experience through the skillful use of myth, ritual and some sort of psychoactive drug. The church felt threatened by the ability of individuals to have spiritual experiences outside of its domain.Kudos to Lauren Slater for publishing a refreshingly objective article on the promise of psychedelic therapy. The categorical ban on psychedelic substances forces individuals like myself — an intellectually curious, politically involved student whose primary motivations for psychedelic use are idealistic and moral — into an unforgiving quandary. Should I use substances known to be conducive toward profound creativity and intellectual growth, thereby risking being defined as a criminal and alienated by mainstream society?Dear future caretaker, please take this as my written approval to dose me for the last several years of my life.My fear would be that taking something like psilocybin would prompt me to change my life. Would I realize that I am not really happy in my marriage? That my children really are that selfish? My problem is that I fear the delusions that allow me to manage my life would be diminished. And that the changes I would make might create unstoppable ripples. Life is a precarious balance. Would enlightenment destroy the balance I have created?Why can’t scientists do a study that shows that eating steak and chips and other good foodis good for your brain and your health? All they check is exercise and going vegan. Who wants to do that?Of course mice must run around to survive in nature. A lethargic mouse would, therefore, be a very stupid one. But human beings have used their brains to figure out how to avoid this constant scampering around to find food, obtain shelter, escape predators, etc. Two different kinds of existences. Is exercise good for the brain? Sure. Is it a panacea? Doubt it.If this is really a breakthrough discovery, it makes one wonder why jocks and athletes don’t rule the world or discover cures for cancer. Einstein never looked like he was in such good shape. Exercise is good for you, obviously — got to keep it all circulating — but leading people to believe that they’ll be “smarter” if they play ball instead of pick up a book might just help make rodents of us all.I started taking my cat on daily little hikes a few weeks ago. The changes I’ve noted already have been remarkable. She yowls for her halter and lead, paws at the door, then looks at me fiercely until I open it, hops downstairs slowly enough so I don’t fall, goes where directed on the walk, and when she gets back in her room, sits and waits for me to remove her gear before jumping on her bed for her nap. She’s probably gained 35 feline I.Q. points already. Me, I’m still forgetting my sunscreen and tripping over roots.I have no problem whatsoever with a woman being a priest in a Christian church; there is no male or female in Jesus Christ. I have no problem with a woman entering a bodybuilding competition in a rhinestone bikini. I don’t even have a problem with a man entering a bodybuilding contest in a rhinestone bikini. I do have a problem with a priest entering a bodybuilding competition in a rhinestone bikini. Why? Well, isn’t Christianity based on a spirit-flesh dichotomy in which the spirit is exalted over the flesh? What message does a priest preening in a bikini send about the Church?THE MANIAC IN MEI feel Daniel Smith’s pain, because I, too, am a worrywart. Like him, I imagine that if I had a big religion, I could pray and believe, and that would take care of all the worries. But how does an atheist pray? I worry about everything from whether my dog is bored to decapitation by ceiling fan. A friend calls my worries “white-girl worries,” and I worry about that.'"
"'12-05-06,'0','Some homeowners decide it makes more sense to stay with their current mortgage, especially if the savings are small or they plan to move within a year or two. “There is a hassle to refinancing — all this paperwork,” said Sheila Walker Hartwell, a financial planner in Manhattan. One of her clients, she noted, recently decided against refinancing because she was already building equity in her home, which she hoped to use on her next home purchase.“When you refinance, you’re not building equity,” Ms. Walker Hartwell said. “You’re starting at the beginning” of the amortization tables.Amortization schedules work like this: In the first few years, almost all of the payment goes toward interest, so the longer you have the loan, the more is put toward the principal.“That’s very important,” said Edward Ades, a partner in Universal Mortgage in Brooklyn. He noted, for example, that in the first year of a $300,000 30-year mortgage at 4 percent, a borrower would have paid off 1.76 percent of the balance; in the fifth year, that rises to 2.06 percent.Those who refinanced in the last year or two don’t have to consider amortization tables, but they do need to know their equity position — and when the refinancing would begin to pay off.To calculate that, start with a rundown of all the closing costs, then divide the closing costs by the amount you expect to save on each monthly payment. So if closing costs total $5,000, and your monthly savings are $400, it will take you 12.5 months to break even on refinancing.If it takes you, say, three years to recoup the costs and you hope to move within two years, then refinancing does not make sense, said John J. Vento, a Staten Island financial planner.Depending on your lender, you probably need to have 20 percent equity, and maybe a little more, if you want to wrap your closing costs into the new mortgage. Those who are underwater — shorthand for owing more than the home is worth — may consider the Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, which is now widely available, Mr. Cecala noted.Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com, suggests homeowners start with their current lender, and ask if they can streamline the process. You may be able to avoid a second appraisal and title insurance reports and fees, he said, adding, “That would save not only time but also money.”He also suggests that borrowers check out new lenders and consider a shorter loan term, to “shave years off the payments” and build equity faster.'"
"'12-05-06,'0','TAKE a floppy-haired Muppet. Dress it as a waiter. Rearrange its face until its features slope to one side. Throw it across the room. Repeatedly. If that puppet came to life it might look something like the actor Tom Edden in the British comedy “One Man, Two Guvnors,” now on Broadway at the Music Box Theater.Although Mr. Edden has a scant 20 or so lines and just one big set piece in the two-and-a-half-hour show, he is doing some old-fashioned scene stealing and getting some of the biggest laughs of the season. Dressed in a ratty outfit, with a head of wispy white hair and heaps of makeup, Mr. Edden plays Alfie, a wild-eyed but slow-moving octogenarian waiter who is enlisted to help Francis (played by James Corden) serve his two bosses a pub lunch of soup, cold meats and chicken balls. The problem? It’s Alfie’s first day on the job. That and he has cataracts, is just this side of deaf, leans to one side, slurs his speech (it’s that contorted mouth), has a pacemaker and the shakes. Or as the script describes it, he’s “old, slow and doddery.”Mr. Edden said: “He finds stairs and doors and plates and everyday objects a bit of a herculean trial. He’s doing his best.”Set in 1963 “One Man, Two Guvnors” comes from an English tradition of lowbrow comedy that’s naughty, playfully mean and slapstick happy. (The playwright Richard Bean based it on “The Servant of Two Masters,” an 18th-century Italian farce by Carlo Goldoni.) Over the course of the 25-minute dinner scene that ends Act I, Mr. Edden is put through a physical comedy regimen that would tax even the most seasoned clown. He gets dragged by the legs face down; takes a door, a cricket bat and bottle opener to the face; careers offstage on a cart; and takes a piggyback ride.“The whole show is a kind of reinvention of universal traditions of great comic archetypes of physical clowning and the indestructible old guy,” said Nicholas Hytner, the director of “One Man, Two Guvnors” and the artistic director of the National Theater in London, where the show had its premiere last year. “He’s playing a cartoon grotesque but he’s playing it for real.”'"
"'12-05-06,'0','He knows from experience. Diamond joined his father in the going-broke business more than half a century ago. In its early years, Republic was based in New York, in proximity to the Northern textile factories that were closing. Diamond closed his first factory in his early 20s, staying in Shamokin, Pa., for six months to sell off the pieces­ of a plant that made fabric for bras and girdles. In 1972, Republic moved to South Carolina to follow the movement of the textile industry from New England to the Piedmont region. Soon after, Diamond started selling used textile machinery to Gamal Omar’s father in Egypt.For about 50 years, Diamond has supplied used textile machinery to more than 40 countries and played a central part in the gradual movement of textile production from rich countries to poorer ones. Diamond remembers dismantling several yarn-spinning mills in New England and reassembling them in Tito’s Yugoslavia. He picked up other American mills, piece by piece, and put them back together in the Philippines, China and India. Even within a single country, textile production gradually shifts to poorer regions — just as it has in the United States — usually in search of lower labor costs. It’s a good business to be in.Yet the past several years have been tough. Republic has laid off more than half its employees, and the 30 or so daily inquiries that Diamond now receives from Asia are down from about 100 before the recession. Many of Diamond’s overseas customers couldn’t get financing when the financial markets seized up. Consumers weren’t buying textiles and apparel anyway, so factories like Omar’s needed fewer machines. And then businesses everywhere in the apparel chain — from U.S. retailers to Republic — were hit by cotton prices that were driven to record levels by freakish weather and by Chinese government policies.Omar, however, remains optimistic about his business in Egypt. He has a contract to produce logoed sports apparel, and rising labor costs in China have made his prices more competitive. And more orders from U.S. customers meant it was time to upgrade his machinery. We kept losing him as he circled one machine after another, snapping pictures and peppering Diamond with questions. Omar had heard of a newer heat-setting machine that quickly dried and set the dye on Lycra fabric.“You don’t need that,” Diamond said. “Doesn’t really work.”“I’m sorry, Gamal. Nothing’s left in the whole country. China took them all.”Omar then stopped to admire the Italian cutting machine and a circular knitting machine that could make T-shirts without side seams. Seamless T-shirt technology was a major advance, Diamond explained, because it allows manufacturers to cut most of the labor-intensive sewing from the production process. Omar also stopped to look at a set of five-year-old “QuickWash” machines, a technology that can simulate a product’s lifetime of laundering in just 30 minutes to test for durability. He might have use for this. A shirt that doesn’t hold up in the wash means an unhappy customer, particularly in the more demanding U.S. market.Omar wasn’t in the bed-linen business, but we stopped anyway to admire a massive pillowcase-making machine that, brand-new, sold for more than $1 million. Labor costs have been a significant cause of the demise of certain segments of the U.S. textile industry, and here was a worker-free machine that took in fabric and spit out neatly folded pillowcases at the rate of 15 per minute. Diamond thought he might have a customer for the machine in Pakistan.We soon lost Omar again and found him taking pictures of the Main Knitting cutting machine. At its peak, the company employed about 1,700 workers, but it struggled against foreign competition for years and finally went broke in 2008. As I watched Omar, I thought back to 1972, when I purchased my first car. It was a beat-up used Fiat, but I was giddy at the promise of a future with wheels. On the school bus I told one of the rich mean girls that I had a car. I knew I’d never catch up with her, but at least I now could be in the race.“Is your car new?” the mean girl asked.“Well,” I said, “it’s new to me.”'"
"'12-05-06,'0','Hallwalls, the first multidisciplinary artist-run space in Buffalo, was founded by a group that included Cindy Sherman and Michael Zwack in an ice-packing warehouse where they all had studios. But it was driven by Charles Clough and Robert Longo, a student at Buffalo State. (Mr. Clough’s mixed-media work “Eyes 2,” above, is an expanded version of the photographs of eyes he glued to walls throughout the building.)“Hallwalls was a better school than we could buy out there in the education market,” Mr. Clough said. The concept, he added, was to “figure out which artists ahead of us we were interested in and bring them in, and those artists got to know who we were, so that when we went to New York, we’d have an audience. And the fact that we were in proximity to the Albright and Artpark and Media Studies meant that we could bait them.”In late 1974 Mr. Longo approached Robert Irwin, who, to his surprise, offered to visit. “I basically called everybody and told them to come on over,” Mr. Longo recalled. “We talked about what we wanted to do, and he helped push it along.” Soon after, Mr. Clough mounted a huge works-on-paper show in the hallway (inviting “anybody who had any sort of avant-garde reputation,” he said), and Hallwalls was born. After that, Mr. Longo said, “contacting artists would become our M.O.”Among the many they lured were Jonathan Borofsky, whom Mr. Longo stalked through SoHo. Mr. Clough bagged Sol LeWitt, who handed over instructions for a piece that the group labored over for one beer- and marijuana-filled evening. “They had incredible enthusiasm,” said Vito Acconci, who created an installation there in 1975. “They seemed so involved that it was impossible not to get swept up.” (Two years later, when Mr. Longo moved to New York with Ms. Sherman, his girlfriend at the time, Mr. Acconci was so swept up that he hired Mr. Longo as a studio assistant.)The early ’70s was a time of transformation for Lewiston State Park, on 172 acres alongside the Niagara River Gorge, into a cultural oasis. It reopened as Artpark in 1974, its first season dedicated to the memory of the land artist Robert Smithson, offering a vast array of performances and public workshops. Artpark also ran a summer residency program in which artists made projects on site.That’s how Gordon Matta-Clark came to carry out his renowned 1974 house deconstruction, “Bingo,” on an abandoned building in Niagara Falls. In 1975 the earth artist Alan Saret built “Ghosthouse,” a teepeelike structure of wire mesh, and tried to live there until the freezing weather drove him out. The first artist invited was Charles Simonds, known for building miniature dwellings for an imaginary civilization on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which he continued in the park. He collaborated with local teenagers to build a stone house and cairns (above) in the ruins of a railway tunnel.But Artpark had a darker history. Part of it had been used as an industrial waste dump, and when he arrived weeks before the opening, he found construction workers complaining of chemical burns. That’s when he realized that “Artpark was a cosmetic overlay on what could have become another Love Canal,” he said. (That’s why he sited his project further into the gorge.)Buffalo’s first photography gallery, the Center for Exploratory and Perceptual Arts was founded by the photographer Robert Muffoletto in 1974 — a time when, according to Ellen Carey, there was virtually “no platform to show new work and no place to talk about photography.” It soon became a go-to place for anyone interested in the field (and also offered talks, poetry readings and music performances). Ms. Carey exhibited her work there for the first time, in a group show with Cindy Sherman, then a student at Buffalo State.The two also showed together in 1976, in the center’s first Metro Bus series, which put artists’ photographs in the slots on buses normally reserved for advertisements. Ms. Sherman contributed a series of photographs of fictional passengers in which she played each role. Ms. Carey offered a group of experimental portraits, including the self-portrait at left. (She made it by sitting in front of a camera set for a long exposure and drawing in the air with a light pen, a technique borrowed from Man Ray.)Although Mr. Muffoletto warned them they might lose their work, “people were very respectful,” Ms. Carey said. “I got it all back.”Steina Vasulka, “Allvision,” 1976 (seen in the exhibition “The Vasulkas,” 1978)Although the Albright-Knox had shown new art in the past, the museum made a commitment to it in 1975 by hiring the young curator Linda Cathcart. Formerly an intern at the Whitney Museum of American Art, where she worked with Marcia Tucker (the founder of the New Museum), Ms. Cathcart gave early museum shows to Bruce Nauman, Ed Ruscha (then known mostly on the West Coast), Hannah Wilke, Gilbert & George and the video pioneers Steina and Woody Vasulka. (Ms. Vasulka’s robotic video sculpture “Allvision,” shown above in the couple’s 1978 show, has been refurbished for the exhibition.)But Ms. Cathcart’s most significant move was to collaborate with other Buffalo arts groups, notably Hallwalls, mounting joint shows of artists like Charles Simonds and the sculptor Joel Shapiro. She also changed the museum’s annual regional art survey, adding an invitational section that gave many young artists, including Robert Longo and Charles Clough, their first chance to show in a museum. “We had to make pieces for the show,” Mr. Longo recalled. “It was this really incredible breakthrough.” It was also life changing. In the survey Mr. Longo was discovered by Douglas Crimp, the curator of the 1977 “Pictures” show at Artists Space, which made his name in New York.Buffalo’s avant-garde began taking shape in the early 1960s, when the private University of Buffalo was absorbed by the State University of New York. Ms. Pesanti said the resulting influx of students came with a surge of government financing, which opened up scores of faculty positions. One went to Gerald O’Grady, a medieval literature specialist who also had a burning interest in media studies, a field then in its infancy.In 1971 Mr. O’Grady founded Media Study/Buffalo, a nonprofit exhibition space that offered film and video workshops and access to equipment. Two years later he persuaded the university to start its own Center for Media Study, one of the first film and video departments in the country. His first faculty hires were the structuralist film pioneers Hollis Frampton and Paul Sharits. (Mr. Sharits’s groundbreaking four-projector film “Dream Displacement,” above, was recreated for the exhibition.) Then came Steina and Woody Vasulka, the founders of the Kitchen in New York, and Tony Conrad, the Minimalist musician, experimental filmmaker and video artist.“I could have been in New York City, but it was almost the same thing to be in Buffalo,” said Mr. Conrad, who joined the faculty in 1976 and remains there. “In fact there were things that were better, because of the funding resources, and the animated spirit of the young people in our program and other places in the city.” Bill Viola, who also visited frequently in the 1970s, agreed. “Everybody managed to go through Buffalo,” he said. “It was kind of the mecca.”'"
"'12-05-06,'0','PROS Tingo offers an extensive hotel inventory (powered by the Affiliate Network) of tens of thousands of hotels in major destinations. The automatic refund process means travelers do nothing but reserve and then wait for a refund if the price drops. There are no booking fees involved. Tingo doesn’t charge a cancellation fee, either; only the hotel’s cancellation policy applies.CONS You may miss out on a cheaper price that the hotel offers directly. For example, a search on Tingo for a three-day mid-May hotel stay in turned up 125 hotels, including the Hotel of South Beach for about $312 a night including and fees — about $35 a night more than the hotel itself was offering for the same “designer” standard room. Refunds are not available for prepaid, nonrefundable hotels, which are also listed on the site.BOTTOM LINE It’s a no-brainer. Even if you later find a cheaper nonrefundable rate on the hotel’s own Web site, you can cancel your Tingo reservation without being charged if it is within the refund time frame, and go with the cheaper rate.HOW IT WORKS This airfare booking site has a Price Drop Payback program, which reimburses customers the fare difference if they find a lower rate for the same coach ticket on the site before their trip.PROS The service offers reassurance to diligent customers who check the site regularly after they book (which requires a $9.95 fee) that they won’t miss out on a lower price if one becomes available. Customers can easily check prices with one click to see if they have dropped.CONS Payouts are not automatic. While the site makes it easy for customers to see if the fare has dropped by clicking the “Price Drop Payback” button on their itinerary page, customers must do the work — monitoring the price by checking back often and then requesting reimbursement. Price Drop Payback does not apply to airfares on other Web sites. Customers don’t get cash back, either. Rather, reimbursements, which start at $10 and are capped at $100 per ticket, are issued in the form of a voucher for future bookings on the site. Another obstacle: each ticket is eligible for only one Price Drop Payback . So if the price drops even more after you accept a travel credit, you will not be eligible for additional credits for further price drops on the same itinerary.BOTTOM LINE CheapAir’s payback program makes price drops transparent by allowing travelers to track the flight themselves with a click of the mouse. But getting that refund involves repeatedly returning to the site to monitor price drops, and using what amounts to guesswork when it comes to determining when to claim the credit.HOW IT WORKS This online travel agency offers a refund service called Price Assurance for airfare and hotel bookings. Unlike Tingo, which refunds customers when the price drops, has a hurdle: to receive a refund when the price goes down, another Orbitz customer must have subsequently reserved the same flight (and type of ticket) or the same category room in the same hotel (and on the same date) on Orbitz for less. For example, let’s say you book a hotel on Orbitz for $200 a night. A few days later the hotel lowers the rate listed on Orbitz to $150, and another Orbitz customer reserves the room for the same night at the lower rate. Then Orbitz would automatically refund you $50. If no Orbitz customer books at the lower rate, then you don’t get the refund. Since it started the service for flights in 2008 and hotels in 2009, Orbitz says it has sent out more than 170,000 checks totaling more than $10 million.PROS Unlike Tingo, which offers money back only for fully refundable bookings, you can book a prepaid, nonrefundable hotel or flight and get a refund — as long as another Orbitz customer subsequently books it at a lower price. As with Tingo, there are no fees and no work on your part other than the initial booking. Orbitz continues tracking until your trip, and each time the price drops and another customer reserves your same room or flight for a lower amount, your refund increases.CONS Customers don’t get any money back when the price goes down unless another Orbitz customer books that same type of hotel room or flight for less than the price you paid. Price Assurance doesn’t apply to packages that bundle airfare and hotel together. And refunds, which are cut as a check and typically take about six to eight weeks to arrive after your trip, are capped at $250 per airline ticket and $500 per hotel room.BOTTOM LINE Some travelers might prefer Tingo’s money-back service for hotel bookings because its refunds aren’t based on someone else booking the same hotel room, and the amount that can be refunded isn’t capped. But there is no better option for flights than Orbitz if you want to avoid the chore of constantly checking prices in order to finagle a refund.'"

"'12-05-06,'0','In victory, Mayweather added to his copious belt collection the W.B.A. super welterweight belt and the vacant W.B.C. one. On this night, it seemed as if the fight that actually took place was more interesting than the one that did not. It did not seem to matter if Mayweather was not fighting Manny Pacquiao.On this night, Cotto did some damage. The more Cotto landed right hooks to the body, the more he pinned Mayweather in corners, the more the crowd rose and screamed for him. Yet as Cotto continued his onslaught, Mayweather continued to shake his head.By the ninth round, it was fair to consider whether Cotto could win the fight, whether he could knock Mayweather from the ranks of the undefeated. Before the round, when Mayweather’s picture flashed across the big screen here, his lip busted, his face bloody, the crowd erupted in applause.As the bell for the 12th round sounded, the bout was too close for an obvious call. Again, Cotto pinned Mayweather in the corner. Again, they traded blows. With two minutes left, the crowd stood on its feet, chanting Cotto’s name. Mayweather landed one combination, then another. When the final bell sounded, the fighters hugged.Cotto (37-3) had come close. But Mayweather (43-0) had done enough. He landed more total punches, more jabs and more power punches and at equal or higher rates.On Saturday, Mayweather did what Mayweather does best. He put on a show, the usual mixture of sports and entertainment, another pageant of the absurd, another series of moments best summarized with “only Mayweather.”If the lights that flashed and the crowd that booed served as a distraction, the din would fade by Sunday morning. Once the fight finished, another date of utmost importance loomed larger than before. On Friday, June 1, Mayweather is scheduled to report to jail for misdemeanor domestic violence and harassment charges reached in a plea bargain.For the superstar with the 18-room mansion, a 10-by-6-foot cell awaits.Mayweather, because he is Mayweather, sauntered into the ring flanked by Justin Bieber and 50 Cent, with celebrities as divergent as Sean Combs and Triple H in the stands. Because he is Mayweather, he wore what looked like red leather shorts.Early on, it appeared Cotto wanted to force the action, to steer Mayweather, the most brilliant technical boxer of his generation, toward a brawl. Cotto was the aggressor, even as he wore pink socks. In the second round, he lifted Mayweather off the canvas in a bear hug. At the very least, Cotto made Mayweather look uncomfortable, forced him to fight in tight quarters and bounce around the ring.In the fourth, Mayweather landed a series of stinging right hands. The first snapped Cotto’s head back. So did the fourth, and the fifth, until it was as if Mayweather controlled Cotto’s head like a puppet master, snapping it back and forth.But Cotto remained patient. He stalked Mayweather into corners, kept aiming for the body, both hands pummeling Mayweather’s ribs. After one furious exchange in the fifth round, Mayweather emerged from the corner and shook his head, as if to say Cotto had not hurt him.“The judges said I lost the fight,” Cotto said. “I have to take my defeat.”Mayweather had approached this fight with the usual aplomb. He seemed relaxed even, perhaps boosted by a short, by his standards, layoff between bouts. It was only September when Mayweather floored Victor Ortiz with a legal but not necessarily sporting combination when Ortiz was not looking and should have been.Some seven months later, as Mayweather trained for Cotto, his uncle and trainer, Roger, said that it had been years since he last saw his nephew this sharp.Mayweather entered the fight as a heavy favorite, the odds tilted as high as 7 to 1 early in the week. His favored status ended there, though. The crowd at the weigh-in showered him with boos, as did those assembled at Grand Garden Arena for the fight.Not that Mayweather showed an ounce of concern over the growing villain status he helped to perpetuate. “We want to see the Floyd Mayweather with the flashy money,” he said earlier in training. “We want to see Floyd Mayweather with a diamond necklace. We want to see Floyd Mayweather with the nice cars.”And there it was: an average of one third-person reference per sentence.Another day in the life. Mayweather essentially paid himself $32 million guaranteed for the fight, a record for the sport certain to increase when other revenue streams come in.At the weigh-in, the fighters conducted the usual staring contest as if attempting a world record. It lasted for maybe 20 seconds, which seemed like 20 minutes, with Mayweather furiously chewing gum less than an inch from Cotto’s face.On the surface, Cotto provided respectable opposition. His two losses came against Antonio Margarito, who was later caught with hardened hand wraps, and Manny Pacquiao, who fought — and decimated — Cotto. In his last fight, Cotto avenged his loss to Margarito.“Cotto is a future Hall of Famer,” Mayweather would say Saturday. “He’s no pushover. He’s a tough competitor, and he came to fight. I dug down and fought him back.”As Mayweather conducted his postfight interview in the ring, the crowd drowned him out with boos. Mayweather, an athlete as divisive and polarizing as any in recent memory, much of it by his own design, just smiled.Jail? On Saturday, that could wait.'"

"'12-05-06,'0','Many market experts say the biggest reason for the shrinking volume is that traders and investors remain leery that the economy will suddenly turn on them in the wake of the financial crisis, the wild swings in stock prices and the European debt troubles.Investors and financial industry professionals are struggling to understand what the decline could mean, particularly if it continues. Less rapid trading by short-term speculators could be a good thing for buy-and-hold investors tired of being burned by the market. But the decline could also signal a broader turn away from the domestic stock market by investors who want to hold less of their nest eggs in stocks and by companies that opt for raising capital in bond markets instead of issuing shares.“My expectation was that we would see people go back to the stock market,” said Charles Rotblut, a vice president of the American Association of Individual Investors. “It remains to be seen whether there will be a core group of people that is just turned off of the stock markets altogether.”The New York-based system of stock trading has been showing the strain of the slowdown. The New York Stock Exchange said last week that trading in the first quarter fell 23 percent from a year earlier. A few days earlier, Nasdaq announced that its first-quarter revenues from stock trading in the United States were down 7 percent from a year ago. Both exchange companies have aggressively moved to capture other businesses that do not rely on stock trading, but they have also embarked on cost-cutting programs.“We can’t be certain as to when or whether the volume is going to recover,” said Lee Shavel, chief financial officer at the Nasdaq OMX Group.The recent slowdown has occurred not only on the nation’s 13 official exchanges and trading platforms. Dozens of off-exchange operations have captured a larger proportion of all stock trades in recent years, but even their overall trading numbers have been trending down.The decline in trading has not sent the prices of stocks down. Though there is less buying and selling, the people who have remained in the market are willing to pay higher prices, driving the value of the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index up 102 percent since the market hit a bottom in the spring of 2009.But the recent falloff in trading is striking because data from the New York Stock Exchange shows that volumes have not declined for three consecutive years in records going back to 1960. For an explanation of the lower trading volumes, many market-watchers have looked to the high-speed traders, who use computers algorithms to take advantage of small price discrepancies and who have accounted for an increasing share of all trading in recent years.These firms have been curtailed slightly by recent regulations aimed at making the markets less volatile. But more fundamentally, industry participants say high-speed traders rely on transacting with slower, traditional traders like retail investors and mutual funds. When those groups pull back, the high-speed firms have little choice but to scale back as well.“On a typical trade, two high-frequency trading firms will not trade against each other,” said Manoj Narang. His New Jersey high-speed trading firm, Tradeworx, is still growing, he said, but for most established firms, if ordinary investors “don’t want to trade, there’s really simply nothing for us to do.”Among retail investors, the most reliable source of trading volume has been the day traders who were given access to cheaper trading by discount brokers like E*Trade and TD Ameritrade.Steve Quirk, a senior vice president at TD Ameritrade, said these investors were still scarred by the financial crisis in 2008-9, which followed the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2001. More recently, share prices have steadily risen but with jarring short-term reversals.Stock trading now accounts for 16 percent fewer customer trades at TD Ameritrade than it did in 2009. “We’ve had instances where it looked like things were clearing up,” said Mr. Quirk. The company’s clients in some recent months tiptoed back into stocks, he said, “but then they rather surprisingly just quit.” Among the broader population, the most common investment in stocks has been through mutual funds. The most conspicuous sign that these investors have grown disenchanted with American stocks has been the flow of money out of domestic stock mutual funds, which were drained of more than $400 billion since the start of 2008, compared with an inflow of $52 billion in the four years before that, according to the Investment Company Institute. The outflow has continued into 2012.The shift is partly attributable to the growing number of seniors moving from stocks to bonds, which is typical in retirement. But surveys by the institute have shown that investors young and old have grown less willing to invest in domestic stocks, even with interest rates on bonds at record lows in recent years.Some of this money has flowed into increasingly popular exchange-traded funds, which are baskets of assets that trade like stocks. But even more has flowed into bonds. Some financial advisers worry that Americans preparing for retirement are giving up the investment gains that are possible in stocks and ignoring the possible future risks in bonds.“We worry that our investors are trading one form of risk for another,” said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a senior investment strategist at Vanguard.The departure of long-term investors does not always lead to lower trading volumes. When people are pulling money out it can lead to spikes in trading, as it did in August when the European debt crisis heated up. But when long-term players exit the market it can lead to a reduction in trading over time, which has many market participants watching the behavior of ordinary Americans like Fred Lines, a retired electrical contractor who lives on Long Island.Mr. Lines, who is 75, said he used to trade stocks regularly, and had most of his money in stocks even after retiring and many of his peers pulled back. He started to retreat after the demise of the investment bank Bear Stearns in 2008 and has continued to retreat, most recently in December when he shifted funds from preferred stocks in blue-chip companies to corporate bonds. The recent positive returns have not dispelled his fears that the market will suddenly turn on him.“If it goes up, I know it’s going to go down again,” Mr. Lines said. “I used to just buy the stock and hold it — after a few years it was always up. Now you can’t trust that.”'"
"'12-05-06,'0','Under the departing president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the deficit has declined, but at 5.2 percent of gross domestic product, it is one of the largest shortfalls in the euro area. At least one ratings agency has stripped France of its sterling triple-A sovereign debt rating because of concern about its finances.Mr. Hollande has vowed to restore social equilibrium in France, in part by pushing back against the austerity championed by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi. Mr. Hollande’s plans include rolling back tax breaks that Mr. Sarkozy gave to the wealthy, and increasing state-sponsored investment, in part by creating tens of thousands of civil sector jobs.His talk has already had the effect of unnerving some investors, who drove France’s borrowing costs higher recently on concern he was underestimating how costly some of his spending programs might be.More than 55 percent of France’s gross domestic product is made up of public spending, the highest in the euro zone.“That shows that the only way to change things is to reduce public spending, but François Hollande is still willing to increase it to finance his measures and balance the budget through higher taxes,” said Evariste Lefeuvre, chief Americas economist in New York for the French bank Natixis. “It’s something that will frighten markets a bit.”Another concern is that Mr. Hollande may not be able to halt an erosion of competitiveness in the corporate sector, which is dominated by many small and midsize businesses that do not export much, and where profitability is generally low. France also faces declining exports and a widening current-account deficit that is one of the euro zone’s highest.These troubles have investors fretting that France is drifting from the “core” of strong European economies that include Germany and the Nordic countries. These days, many are starting to lump France with the weak large economies of Spain and Italy, along Europe’s troubled southern rim.With a large public deficit and a sharply diminished manufacturing sector that has eroded under globalization, “France can already be considered part of the south,” Mr. Lefeuvre said.As throngs shouted and blared horns, Mr. Hollande, in his acceptance speech, said he was on “a mission to give the European construction a growth dimension,” and addressed Germany directly to act with him “in the name of our common responsibility.”He has jolted the German establishment by vowing to press for a renegotiation of a European treaty on budget discipline into more of a pact by Europe to promote growth, amid criticism of austerity measures that has swept through the euro union. “Austerity cannot remain fatal!” he shouted to the crowd.Few think Mr. Hollande will try to split from Ms. Merkel, even as she is forced to soften her hard line on austerity. His first foreign trip will be to Berlin, where he will try to smooth over differences.For all his populist talk, Mr. Hollande knows where the boundaries are, economists say. At the end of the day, he is not repudiating a fiscal contract, and is unlikely to push outsize spending increases that would invite financial markets to attack France the way they have recently in Spain.Mr. Hollande has proved to be unlike any of his Socialist predecessors, by campaigning partly on a pledge to balance the budget by the end of the presidential term in 2017.“French Socialists want balanced public accounts in the medium-term, which is quite new,” said Dominique Barbet, an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris.“But how to get there is a different story,” he said. “Certainly markets would probably be more comfortable with a conservative approach of spending cuts and tax hikes rather than a classic Socialist approach, which is more widely based on tax increases.”Whether Mr. Hollande gets all he wants will also depend on the makeup of the new French Parliament, which will be voted in next month. He will have to start making good right away on some of his promises, but things could get trickier if his Socialists party must work with the far-right as a coalition to get measures passed.But perhaps the biggest flash point is the state of French labor markets and the lack of a greater overall competitive environment for businesses in the country.France has a wealthy, diversified, resilient economy and a highly skilled and productive labor force. It boasts a cadre of world-class companies, including Airbus, Dassault, Renault, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The list goes on.Despite a 35-hour workweek that has recently been softened, high payroll taxes and a militant work force, France is the fifth-largest economy in the world and has one of the highest inflows of foreign direct investment in all of Europe.But many economists are skeptical France will be able to move toward greater openness, especially in its rigid labor markets. High social charges that companies pay to help finance France’s generous welfare system, combined with lengthy hiring and firing processes, deter employers from adding significant numbers of new jobs.Labor market costs are among the highest of any country in the 17-member euro monetary union. Even the World Bank, which has criticized the German-driven austerity policy that Mr. Sarkozy had embraced, has warned that France has driven labor costs too high given the relatively small numbers of hours people work. The bank said the French situation was not sustainable amid fast-rising competition from Asia, Eastern Europe and other low-cost countries.What is more, while French labor unions have shrunk in membership over the years, they still wield outsize influence. Employers say they can paralyze companies that need to shed jobs or cut other expenses to adapt to worsening economic conditions.Analysts say Mr. Hollande needs to give unions more of an incentive to work with management to prevent confrontations that can lead businesses to consider moving work toward other cost-competitive destinations.“There’s a sort of ‘Nixon goes to China’ element where, as a Socialist, he will be able to pressure the unions toward more concessions on various labor market reforms,” said Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute. “But it still means he’s got to be willing to take the confrontation. That will determine where France goes from here.”'"
"'12-05-06,'0','But their efforts also encompassed immense, pseudo-encyclopedic, seemingly random accumulations of still or video images. In 1995 they represented Switzerland at the Venice Biennale with 96 hours of video of everyday life in Zurich, shown on a dozen monitors. Their 1998 series “Flowers” was more focused in subject matter, but its 111 close-ups of blossoms were all double-exposed, adding an abstract, unpredictable beauty to otherwise typical homages to nature. “There is something right about clichés,” Mr. Weiss once said in an interview.In sculpture, they approached this passive acceptance by casting everyday objects in black rubber or painstakingly replicating them in carved and painted polyurethane, often with special emphasis on studio tools, supplies and detritus. A more active involvement is reflected in the “Equilibrium” photographs, begun in 1984, which record breathtaking balancing acts recasting selected vegetables, kitchen utensils, furniture, wine bottles and other household objects as virtuoso acrobats.As their orchestrations became more elaborate, inevitably collapsing once photographed, they concentrated on setting them in motion. This led to a two-year process of trial and error that resulted in “The Way Things Go,” a carefully choreographed 30-minute chain reaction combining small objects, explosions and bits of lumber; cascading, sometimes flammable liquids; improvised carts on tracks; and combinations of everything (a steaming teakettle on a roller skate, for example) that slid, bumped, fell and catapulted through an array of seemingly unending incidents.The film, which involved a few nearly seamless cuts, was a hit from its debut at the “Documenta 8” exhibition in Kassel, Germany, in 1987. For their retrospective at the Tate Modern in 2006, Fischli/Weiss unveiled “Making Things Go,” a documentary that gave some inkling of the many experiments, rehearsals and failures behind the controlled catastrophes of “The Way Things Go.” It was shot over three days in 1985 by a friend, the Swiss writer and publisher Patrick Frey, but went unreleased for 20 years.The son of a Protestant minister, Mr. Weiss was born in Zurich on June 21, 1946. Between 1963 and 1965 he studied at arts-and-crafts schools in Zurich and Basel, training as a stone carver and a draftsman. In 1967 he traveled to San Francisco to experience hippie culture and to New York, where he became familiar with Minimalist art. In the 1970s, he concentrated on drawing in ink and had several solo exhibitions, starting with “The Desert Is Across the Street,” at Galerie Stähli in Zurich in 1975.Mr. Weiss met Mr. Fischli, another Zurich artist who was six years younger, in 1977. In 1978 the two friends formed a short-lived rock band, Migros.After their 1981 debut with the sculpture series “Suddenly This Overview” at the Galerie Stähli, Fischli/Weiss became regulars on the international art scene. Their first solo exhibition in the United States was at the Sonnabend Gallery in SoHo in 1986. In 1996, a retrospective of their work organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis toured to three American museums.Mr. Weiss, whose marriage to Caro Niederer ended in divorce, is survived by two sisters, Salome Weiss and Kathrin Havolli-Weiss; a son, Oskar Weiss; and a daughter, Charlotte Weiss.'"
"'12-05-06,'0','A bad bank, Mr. Botín said, “would be something that would cost the taxpayer money and will not lead to providing more loans.” Instead, he called for “completing the restructuring” of the sector.Many economists, however, consider that keeping afloat the most troubled savings banks, or cajas, will require fresh capital rather than more mergers and cost cutting. Bankia, a caja that is the result of a seven-way merger, is sitting on about €32 billion, or $41.9 billion, of troubled assets. Overall, the consolidation has already cut the number of cajas to 15 from 45 in the past two years.Such mergers, however, “don’t remove the holes but simply pass them on from one institution to another,” Xavier Sala-i-Martín, an economics professor at Columbia University in New York, wrote recently on his blog. “The only thing that will work is fresh money, to recapitalize some banks that have no capital left, and since it’s clear that banks cannot raise sufficient private capital, that means there are only two solutions: bankruptcy or public money,” he added.In February, Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, ordered banks to make an additional €50 billion in provisions against bad loans. Lenders are facing a sharp rise in mortgage defaults, with overall nonperforming loans recently reaching their highest level since 1994.Last week, the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded 11 Spanish banks, notably cutting to junk level Banco Sabadell, a commercial bank that took over a troubled caja as part of the government’s consolidation drive.Meanwhile, in a report published last month, the International Monetary Fund warned that 10 banks — widely believed by analysts to include Bankia — needed “swift and decisive measures to strengthen their balance sheets and improve management and governance practices.”The I.M.F. also encouraged Spain to consider taking over toxic assets from troubled banks.Robert Tornabell, a professor of banking at the Esade business school in Barcelona, estimates that a state agency will need to take over and guarantee at least €130 billion of assets from Spain’s ailing banks.By comparison, Ireland’s national asset management agency was set up to take over as much as €90 billion of toxic loans.“The big commercial banks, Santander and BBVA, don’t want to be linked to the creation of a bad bank, and the government is clearly under their influence,” Mr. Tornabell said. “Instead of delaying further, Spain should bail out its banks as soon as possible to avoid further problems, not only for its banks but also for its reputation and overall economy.”Indeed, the Spanish government is struggling on other fronts, notably how to enforce stricter fiscal targets on regional governments that accounted for two-thirds of Spain’s budget deficit slippage last year.On Friday, S.&P. downgraded nine regional governments, including Catalonia, whose rating was cut by four notches to BBB- from A, bringing it close to junk status.Some analysts, meanwhile, are warning that, even if Spain can salvage its banks alone, it must also ease the pressure on its sovereign borrowing costs by convincing international investors that their investments will not be threatened by a Greek-style bailout.“Managing the fiscal imbalances and the banking-sector fallout of the ongoing credit cycle alone does not, in our view, require external official support,” analysts at Barclays Capital wrote in a report published Friday. “However, what the Spanish authorities cannot manage on their own is sustained, large capital outflows of the sort that have recently been experienced. If foreign investors continue to reduce their exposure to Spain at an economically disruptive rate, the country will require external financial support to manage this adjustment.”'"

"'12-05-07,'0','But their efforts also encompassed immense, pseudo-encyclopedic, seemingly random accumulations of still or video images. In 1995 they represented Switzerland at the Venice Biennale with 96 hours of video of everyday life in Zurich, shown on a dozen monitors. Their 1998 series “Flowers” was more focused in subject matter, but its 111 close-ups of blossoms were all double-exposed, adding an abstract, unpredictable beauty to otherwise typical homages to nature. “There is something right about clichés,” Mr. Weiss once said in an interview.In sculpture, they approached this passive acceptance by casting everyday objects in black rubber or painstakingly replicating them in carved and painted polyurethane, often with special emphasis on studio tools, supplies and detritus. A more active involvement is reflected in the “Equilibrium” photographs, begun in 1984, which record breathtaking balancing acts recasting selected vegetables, kitchen utensils, furniture, wine bottles and other household objects as virtuoso acrobats.As their orchestrations became more elaborate, inevitably collapsing once photographed, they concentrated on setting them in motion. This led to a two-year process of trial and error that resulted in “The Way Things Go,” a carefully choreographed 30-minute chain reaction combining small objects, explosions and bits of lumber; cascading, sometimes flammable liquids; improvised carts on tracks; and combinations of everything (a steaming teakettle on a roller skate, for example) that slid, bumped, fell and catapulted through an array of seemingly unending incidents.The film, which involved a few nearly seamless cuts, was a hit from its debut at the “Documenta 8” exhibition in Kassel, Germany, in 1987. For their retrospective at the Tate Modern in 2006, Fischli/Weiss unveiled “Making Things Go,” a documentary that gave some inkling of the many experiments, rehearsals and failures behind the controlled catastrophes of “The Way Things Go.” It was shot over three days in 1985 by a friend, the Swiss writer and publisher Patrick Frey, but went unreleased for 20 years.The son of a Protestant minister, Mr. Weiss was born in Zurich on June 21, 1946. Between 1963 and 1965 he studied at arts-and-crafts schools in Zurich and Basel, training as a stone carver and a draftsman. In 1967 he traveled to San Francisco to experience hippie culture and to New York, where he became familiar with Minimalist art. In the 1970s, he concentrated on drawing in ink and had several solo exhibitions, starting with “The Desert Is Across the Street,” at Galerie Stähli in Zurich in 1975.Mr. Weiss met Mr. Fischli, another Zurich artist who was six years younger, in 1977. In 1978 the two friends formed a short-lived rock band, Migros.After their 1981 debut with the sculpture series “Suddenly This Overview” at the Galerie Stähli, Fischli/Weiss became regulars on the international art scene. Their first solo exhibition in the United States was at the Sonnabend Gallery in SoHo in 1986. In 1996, a retrospective of their work organized by the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis toured to three American museums.Mr. Weiss, whose marriage to Caro Niederer ended in divorce, is survived by two sisters, Salome Weiss and Kathrin Havolli-Weiss; a son, Oskar Weiss; and a daughter, Charlotte Weiss.'"
"'12-05-07,'0','Many market experts say the biggest reason for the shrinking volume is that traders and investors remain leery that the economy will suddenly turn on them in the wake of the financial crisis, the wild swings in stock prices and the European debt troubles.Investors and financial industry professionals are struggling to understand what the decline could mean, particularly if it continues. Less rapid trading by short-term speculators could be a good thing for buy-and-hold investors tired of being burned by the market. But the decline could also signal a broader turn away from the domestic stock market by investors who want to hold less of their nest eggs in stocks and by companies that opt for raising capital in bond markets instead of issuing shares.“My expectation was that we would see people go back to the stock market,” said Charles Rotblut, a vice president of the American Association of Individual Investors. “It remains to be seen whether there will be a core group of people that is just turned off of the stock markets altogether.”The New York-based system of stock trading has been showing the strain of the slowdown. The New York Stock Exchange said last week that trading in the first quarter fell 23 percent from a year earlier. A few days earlier, Nasdaq announced that its first-quarter revenues from stock trading in the United States were down 7 percent from a year ago. Both exchange companies have aggressively moved to capture other businesses that do not rely on stock trading, but they have also embarked on cost-cutting programs.“We can’t be certain as to when or whether the volume is going to recover,” said Lee Shavel, chief financial officer at the Nasdaq OMX Group.The recent slowdown has occurred not only on the nation’s 13 official exchanges and trading platforms. Dozens of off-exchange operations have captured a larger proportion of all stock trades in recent years, but even their overall trading numbers have been trending down.The decline in trading has not sent the prices of stocks down. Though there is less buying and selling, the people who have remained in the market are willing to pay higher prices, driving the value of the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index up 102 percent since the market hit a bottom in the spring of 2009.But the recent falloff in trading is striking because data from the New York Stock Exchange shows that volumes have not declined for three consecutive years in records going back to 1960. For an explanation of the lower trading volumes, many market-watchers have looked to the high-speed traders, who use computers algorithms to take advantage of small price discrepancies and who have accounted for an increasing share of all trading in recent years.These firms have been curtailed slightly by recent regulations aimed at making the markets less volatile. But more fundamentally, industry participants say high-speed traders rely on transacting with slower, traditional traders like retail investors and mutual funds. When those groups pull back, the high-speed firms have little choice but to scale back as well.“On a typical trade, two high-frequency trading firms will not trade against each other,” said Manoj Narang. His New Jersey high-speed trading firm, Tradeworx, is still growing, he said, but for most established firms, if ordinary investors “don’t want to trade, there’s really simply nothing for us to do.”Among retail investors, the most reliable source of trading volume has been the day traders who were given access to cheaper trading by discount brokers like E*Trade and TD Ameritrade.Steve Quirk, a senior vice president at TD Ameritrade, said these investors were still scarred by the financial crisis in 2008-9, which followed the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2001. More recently, share prices have steadily risen but with jarring short-term reversals.Stock trading now accounts for 16 percent fewer customer trades at TD Ameritrade than it did in 2009. “We’ve had instances where it looked like things were clearing up,” said Mr. Quirk. The company’s clients in some recent months tiptoed back into stocks, he said, “but then they rather surprisingly just quit.” Among the broader population, the most common investment in stocks has been through mutual funds. The most conspicuous sign that these investors have grown disenchanted with American stocks has been the flow of money out of domestic stock mutual funds, which were drained of more than $400 billion since the start of 2008, compared with an inflow of $52 billion in the four years before that, according to the Investment Company Institute. The outflow has continued into 2012.The shift is partly attributable to the growing number of seniors moving from stocks to bonds, which is typical in retirement. But surveys by the institute have shown that investors young and old have grown less willing to invest in domestic stocks, even with interest rates on bonds at record lows in recent years.Some of this money has flowed into increasingly popular exchange-traded funds, which are baskets of assets that trade like stocks. But even more has flowed into bonds. Some financial advisers worry that Americans preparing for retirement are giving up the investment gains that are possible in stocks and ignoring the possible future risks in bonds.“We worry that our investors are trading one form of risk for another,” said Francis M. Kinniry Jr., a senior investment strategist at Vanguard.The departure of long-term investors does not always lead to lower trading volumes. When people are pulling money out it can lead to spikes in trading, as it did in August when the European debt crisis heated up. But when long-term players exit the market it can lead to a reduction in trading over time, which has many market participants watching the behavior of ordinary Americans like Fred Lines, a retired electrical contractor who lives on Long Island.Mr. Lines, who is 75, said he used to trade stocks regularly, and had most of his money in stocks even after retiring and many of his peers pulled back. He started to retreat after the demise of the investment bank Bear Stearns in 2008 and has continued to retreat, most recently in December when he shifted funds from preferred stocks in blue-chip companies to corporate bonds. The recent positive returns have not dispelled his fears that the market will suddenly turn on him.“If it goes up, I know it’s going to go down again,” Mr. Lines said. “I used to just buy the stock and hold it — after a few years it was always up. Now you can’t trust that.”'"

"'12-05-07,'0','The 120-board final of the trial to select the United States open team for this year’s World Mind Sports Games was played on Saturday and Sunday in Schaumburg, Ill.After 45 boards the second seeds, John Diamond-Brian Platnick, Fred Gitelman-Brad Moss and Eric Greco-Geoff Hampson, led by 126 international match points to 72.

"'12-05-07,'0','A bad bank, Mr. Botín said, “would be something that would cost the taxpayer money and will not lead to providing more loans.” Instead, he called for “completing the restructuring” of the sector.Many economists, however, consider that keeping afloat the most troubled savings banks, or cajas, will require fresh capital rather than more mergers and cost cutting. Bankia, a caja that is the result of a seven-way merger, is sitting on about €32 billion, or $41.9 billion, of troubled assets. Overall, the consolidation has already cut the number of cajas to 15 from 45 in the past two years.Such mergers, however, “don’t remove the holes but simply pass them on from one institution to another,” Xavier Sala-i-Martín, an economics professor at Columbia University in New York, wrote recently on his blog. “The only thing that will work is fresh money, to recapitalize some banks that have no capital left, and since it’s clear that banks cannot raise sufficient private capital, that means there are only two solutions: bankruptcy or public money,” he added.In February, Luis de Guindos, the Spanish economy minister, ordered banks to make an additional €50 billion in provisions against bad loans. Lenders are facing a sharp rise in mortgage defaults, with overall nonperforming loans recently reaching their highest level since 1994.Last week, the credit ratings agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded 11 Spanish banks, notably cutting to junk level Banco Sabadell, a commercial bank that took over a troubled caja as part of the government’s consolidation drive.Meanwhile, in a report published last month, the International Monetary Fund warned that 10 banks — widely believed by analysts to include Bankia — needed “swift and decisive measures to strengthen their balance sheets and improve management and governance practices.”The I.M.F. also encouraged Spain to consider taking over toxic assets from troubled banks.Robert Tornabell, a professor of banking at the Esade business school in Barcelona, estimates that a state agency will need to take over and guarantee at least €130 billion of assets from Spain’s ailing banks.By comparison, Ireland’s national asset management agency was set up to take over as much as €90 billion of toxic loans.“The big commercial banks, Santander and BBVA, don’t want to be linked to the creation of a bad bank, and the government is clearly under their influence,” Mr. Tornabell said. “Instead of delaying further, Spain should bail out its banks as soon as possible to avoid further problems, not only for its banks but also for its reputation and overall economy.”Indeed, the Spanish government is struggling on other fronts, notably how to enforce stricter fiscal targets on regional governments that accounted for two-thirds of Spain’s budget deficit slippage last year.On Friday, S.&P. downgraded nine regional governments, including Catalonia, whose rating was cut by four notches to BBB- from A, bringing it close to junk status.Some analysts, meanwhile, are warning that, even if Spain can salvage its banks alone, it must also ease the pressure on its sovereign borrowing costs by convincing international investors that their investments will not be threatened by a Greek-style bailout.“Managing the fiscal imbalances and the banking-sector fallout of the ongoing credit cycle alone does not, in our view, require external official support,” analysts at Barclays Capital wrote in a report published Friday. “However, what the Spanish authorities cannot manage on their own is sustained, large capital outflows of the sort that have recently been experienced. If foreign investors continue to reduce their exposure to Spain at an economically disruptive rate, the country will require external financial support to manage this adjustment.”'"
"'12-05-07,'0','Under the departing president, Nicolas Sarkozy, the deficit has declined, but at 5.2 percent of gross domestic product, it is one of the largest shortfalls in the euro area. At least one ratings agency has stripped France of its sterling triple-A sovereign debt rating because of concern about its finances.Mr. Hollande has vowed to restore social equilibrium in France, in part by pushing back against the austerity championed by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi. Mr. Hollande’s plans include rolling back tax breaks that Mr. Sarkozy gave to the wealthy, and increasing state-sponsored investment, in part by creating tens of thousands of civil sector jobs.His talk has already had the effect of unnerving some investors, who drove France’s borrowing costs higher recently on concern he was underestimating how costly some of his spending programs might be.More than 55 percent of France’s gross domestic product is made up of public spending, the highest in the euro zone.“That shows that the only way to change things is to reduce public spending, but François Hollande is still willing to increase it to finance his measures and balance the budget through higher taxes,” said Evariste Lefeuvre, chief Americas economist in New York for the French bank Natixis. “It’s something that will frighten markets a bit.”Another concern is that Mr. Hollande may not be able to halt an erosion of competitiveness in the corporate sector, which is dominated by many small and midsize businesses that do not export much, and where profitability is generally low. France also faces declining exports and a widening current-account deficit that is one of the euro zone’s highest.These troubles have investors fretting that France is drifting from the “core” of strong European economies that include Germany and the Nordic countries. These days, many are starting to lump France with the weak large economies of Spain and Italy, along Europe’s troubled southern rim.With a large public deficit and a sharply diminished manufacturing sector that has eroded under globalization, “France can already be considered part of the south,” Mr. Lefeuvre said.As throngs shouted and blared horns, Mr. Hollande, in his acceptance speech, said he was on “a mission to give the European construction a growth dimension,” and addressed Germany directly to act with him “in the name of our common responsibility.”He has jolted the German establishment by vowing to press for a renegotiation of a European treaty on budget discipline into more of a pact by Europe to promote growth, amid criticism of austerity measures that has swept through the euro union. “Austerity cannot remain fatal!” he shouted to the crowd.Few think Mr. Hollande will try to split from Ms. Merkel, even as she is forced to soften her hard line on austerity. His first foreign trip will be to Berlin, where he will try to smooth over differences.For all his populist talk, Mr. Hollande knows where the boundaries are, economists say. At the end of the day, he is not repudiating a fiscal contract, and is unlikely to push outsize spending increases that would invite financial markets to attack France the way they have recently in Spain.Mr. Hollande has proved to be unlike any of his Socialist predecessors, by campaigning partly on a pledge to balance the budget by the end of the presidential term in 2017.“French Socialists want balanced public accounts in the medium-term, which is quite new,” said Dominique Barbet, an economist at BNP Paribas in Paris.“But how to get there is a different story,” he said. “Certainly markets would probably be more comfortable with a conservative approach of spending cuts and tax hikes rather than a classic Socialist approach, which is more widely based on tax increases.”Whether Mr. Hollande gets all he wants will also depend on the makeup of the new French Parliament, which will be voted in next month. He will have to start making good right away on some of his promises, but things could get trickier if his Socialists party must work with the far-right as a coalition to get measures passed.But perhaps the biggest flash point is the state of French labor markets and the lack of a greater overall competitive environment for businesses in the country.France has a wealthy, diversified, resilient economy and a highly skilled and productive labor force. It boasts a cadre of world-class companies, including Airbus, Dassault, Renault, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton. The list goes on.Despite a 35-hour workweek that has recently been softened, high payroll taxes and a militant work force, France is the fifth-largest economy in the world and has one of the highest inflows of foreign direct investment in all of Europe.But many economists are skeptical France will be able to move toward greater openness, especially in its rigid labor markets. High social charges that companies pay to help finance France’s generous welfare system, combined with lengthy hiring and firing processes, deter employers from adding significant numbers of new jobs.Labor market costs are among the highest of any country in the 17-member euro monetary union. Even the World Bank, which has criticized the German-driven austerity policy that Mr. Sarkozy had embraced, has warned that France has driven labor costs too high given the relatively small numbers of hours people work. The bank said the French situation was not sustainable amid fast-rising competition from Asia, Eastern Europe and other low-cost countries.What is more, while French labor unions have shrunk in membership over the years, they still wield outsize influence. Employers say they can paralyze companies that need to shed jobs or cut other expenses to adapt to worsening economic conditions.Analysts say Mr. Hollande needs to give unions more of an incentive to work with management to prevent confrontations that can lead businesses to consider moving work toward other cost-competitive destinations.“There’s a sort of ‘Nixon goes to China’ element where, as a Socialist, he will be able to pressure the unions toward more concessions on various labor market reforms,” said Mr. Kirkegaard of the Peterson Institute. “But it still means he’s got to be willing to take the confrontation. That will determine where France goes from here.”'"
"'12-05-07,'0','“The glaring and rather tawdry truth,” Judge Rakoff said, “is that Mr. Rosen, over a period of many years, knowingly and intentionally bribed one state legislator after another. To achieve his ends, however laudable, he sought to help make this a government not of the people but of the debauched.”The judge added that “to the morally depraved legislators who approached him for bribes,” Mr. Rosen’s response had been — as he had once told an undercover F.B.I. agent — “‘You gotta push a lot of buttons.’“In other words, ‘Sure, bring it on,’ ” Judge Rakoff continued. “ ‘If this is what I have to do to achieve what I want, however laudable, I’ll make those payments and cover them up and lie about them.’ ”In court, a prosecutor, Glen G. McGorty, said Mr. Rosen had violated “his responsibility to his hospital and to his employees, and he corrupted the process.”The sentence was substantially less than the term recommended under the advisory sentencing guidelines, which the court’s probation office had calculated at roughly 15 to 19 years. It had recommended a 10-year term. The office of Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, without specifying a number of years, had asked the judge to impose “a substantial” term “commensurate with the significance and gravity” of Mr. Rosen’s criminal conduct.In court, Mr. Rosen’s lawyer, Elkan Abramowitz, argued that his client’s crime had not been the product of greed, and that Mr. Rosen had lost his job, his career, his reputation — “everything.”Mr. Abramowitz pushed for a sentence of community service where Mr. Rosen, as he put it, could use his talents to “really do some good” for the community. Mr. Rosen, reading a statement to the judge, asked him to take into account what he called his four decades of commitment to people who cannot “advocate for themselves.”Mr. Abramowitz told the judge that he would be filing an expeditious appeal on Mr. Rosen’s behalf; the lawyer said later that his client maintained his innocence.Prosecutors had charged that Mr. Rosen used sham consulting deals to funnel hundreds of thousands of dollars to two Democratic assemblymen — William F. Boyland Jr. from Brooklyn and Anthony S. Seminerio of Queens — and that he directed business to a hospice care company from which Mr. Kruger, a Brooklyn Democrat, received a cut.Mr. Kruger resigned and pleaded guilty to corruption charges in December, and was sentenced to seven years in prison. Assemblyman Boyland was acquitted in a jury trial in November, but was later arrested on new bribery charges, and faces trial in Brooklyn. Mr. Seminerio, who pleaded guilty to fraud in an earlier case, died in prison in January 2011.'"

"'12-05-07,'0','“They teach us to lie about stopping people. They teach us to lie about tickets, and ruin lives,” said Officer Polanco, who after about a decade on the force is suspended with pay. “I’ve never been a disciplinary problem. The only problem came when I decided to open my mouth.”This, too, is Mr. Kelly’s police force, a department that can claim many victories but is consumed by a single imperative: crime and homicide rates must keep falling. Question this and top police officials offer a catchall answer: Do you want to return to the bad old days?There’s no definitive proof that top officials systematically manipulate crime data and set arrest quotas. But officers have stepped forward in recent years to talk of such practices in widely scattered precincts: Adrian Schoolcraft in the 81st in , and Chris Bienz in . All of them, along with Officer Polanco, spoke first to Graham Rayman of The Village Voice and Jim Hoffer of the local ABC affiliate. Two officers from Brooklyn detailed near-identical complaints for me recently, although they requested anonymity. The department has said repeatedly that it is examining the many accusations of manipulation of crime data, though an internal report vindicated Officer Schoolcraft.Officer Polanco, who was suspended more than two years ago, and five former officers gathered last week in Greenwich Village at a forum organized by the Police Reform Organizing Project. They talked not of petty grievances but, with passionate and pained words, of good police practices trampled.“Make no mistake: There are quotas, and that is illegal,” a former New York City police captain, John A. Eterno, told the audience.Mr. Eterno, as it happens, is a particularly difficult critic to dismiss. Once he trained officers to . Now a professor at Molloy College, he and Professor Eli Silverman of surveyed more than 100 retired police captains, and detail their findings in their recent book “The Crime Numbers Game: Management by Manipulation.”The former captains spoke of an unrelenting, often unethical pressure to manipulate crime statistics. In addition, the professors studied police and health data and found weird divergences. City hospital data shows a 90 percent increase in emergency room visits for assaults from 1999 to 2006. But police data for the same period records a nearly 50 percent decrease in assaults.The Police Department launched a counterattack against the professors. Mayor offered a shrug. “There’s always going to be some fudging of the numbers, but it is tiny,” he said, adding that the study “was paid for by one of the unions.”As it happens, the mayor is incorrect. Molloy College paid for the study. “Any suggestion of a chink in the armor of the ‘ success story’ is very threatening. You’re excommunicated,” says Mr. Silverman. “It’s the holy of holies.”Officer Polanco knows the life of a heretic. He has surrendered his badge and gun. Once, as a child in crime-ravaged Washington Heights, he dreamed of being a police officer. Now he passes restless days, fighting anger as he cares for three sons.“It’s a shame to get paid for doing nothing,” he says. “How can I live with myself, how could I face my wife, if I didn’t speak up?” That might be a reasonable question for a commissioner contemplating a mayoral run.'"
"'12-05-07,'0','“He is caught in the understanding that he is the savior of Russia, that everything depends on him,” Mr. Rahr said. “He sees himself as a historical figure already, a man who prevented the collapse of the country. The problem is, now he has to meet the real demands of people who are 30 years younger than him.”The eve of Mr. Putin’s inauguration brought violent clashes between the police and protesters — a jarring development in a city that in recent months has become accustomed to large, peaceful rallies.A buoyant march on Sunday turned violent after a group of radical activists tried to break through a police column apparently in an effort to reach the Kremlin. Police officers in riot gear charged into the crowd trying to drag out people they thought had pelted them with smoke bombs and rocks, and beat them fiercely with nightsticks.Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, responded by saying that the police reaction was too gentle and that he would have liked to see them crack down harder.By Monday evening, more than 700 protesters had been detained, though some were released almost immediately. Officials said 29 officers were injured on Sunday, and state-controlled television — the primary source of information for most of the country — featured sympathetic interviews with uniformed officers lying on beds in a hospital ward.Officials made it clear that the authorities would hesitate to permit future marches. Nevertheless, scattered groups of protesters staged actions timed to Mr. Putin’s inauguration.“Up until now, all was peaceful,” said Aleksei Yeryomin, 40, an art director for a magazine. “But the first blood has been spilled, and knowing the Russian character, the situation will now be unpredictable.”The police seemed to arrest people all over the city.Nikita Volkov, 28, a computer programmer, said he was walking down the street with a white ribbon on his belt when the police detained him with no explanation, gave him an official warning, videotaped him and recorded his personal information. At an evening gathering that had been publicized over the Internet, the police simply walked through the crowd, identified everyone who was not a journalist, and put them in a van.“People are being arrested for nothing at all, simply for standing on the sidewalk,” said Oleg Orlov of Memorial, a human rights organization. “They even started detaining people who are sitting and drinking beer. I think this is to show who is boss. A new czar has come and wants to show his face, his mug, I would say.”The chaotic scene came in contrast with the president’s inauguration, an event that has accrued grandeur since ’s stripped-down swearing-in.Mr. Putin’s motorcade glided soundlessly through a city whose streets had been virtually emptied for the occasion. Once inside the Grand Kremlin Palace, Mr. Putin walked over a long red carpet through a series of packed halls, until he reached the innermost hall, which is as lustrous and intricate as a jewel box. He took his place under a huge gilded sunburst, the “All-Powerful Eye,” which was hung so it could cast its rays onto the throne of the czar.Mr. Putin looked grave — even burdened — as he delivered a short address to a roomful of dignitaries that included a close friend, the former Italian prime minister .“I will do my best to justify the trust of millions of our citizens,” he said. “I think it is the meaning of my whole life, and it is my duty to serve our country, serve our people, whose support inspires me and helps me solve the most complex and difficult problems.”Mr. Putin immediately fulfilled his promise to , his predecessor, by recommending him to Parliament as Russia’s next prime minister. One of his first decrees ordered the privatization of all state-owned companies outside the natural resources and defense sectors by 2016, suggesting that he plans to pick up the banner of Mr. Medvedev’s modernization push.The decree also asked the government to raise Russia’s ranking on a index of nations for ease of doing business to 20th by the end of the decade from 120th place today.Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Mr. Putin clearly has his mind fixed on upgrading Russia — perhaps following in the steps of the czarist prime minister Pyotr A. Stolypin, who brooked little dissent but pushed through historic reforms.“This is a guy who tries to do what has eluded all his predecessors,” Mr. Trenin said. “He sees himself as a guy with a mission, and a mission of historic proportions.”That vision does not likely account for a sharp rise in dissent, or a sustained one. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, several hundred young people had formed what they called an “indefinite street party” in a central square, where the blogger Aleksei Navalny called for “guitars, harmonicas, harps, trombones and drums.” The police were standing by quietly., the leader of Russia’s Communist Party, said he thought it was all just the beginning.“The authorities need to understand that the split in society is growing, that there is stronger dissatisfaction with dishonest elections and the absence of normal dialogue,” Mr. Zyuganov told Interfax. “In this situation, radicalism is inevitable. The attempt to shut everyone’s mouths with a police baton is senseless and extremely dangerous.”'"
"'12-05-07,'0','Austin, Tex.At the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner last month, President Obama playfully referenced a passage in his memoir in which he told of eating dog meat as a child in Indonesia. Riffing on Sarah Palin’s line — and responding to Republican criticism — he said, “What’s the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.” (Of course, Republicans have had their own canine issues, given Mitt Romney’s predilection for fastening his Irish setter to the top of the family car in the 1980s.)Although dog-eating is taboo in the United States, personal consumption of dog meat is legal in most states. Likewise, Americans find horse-eating offensive; a five-year federal ban on slaughtering horses for human consumption was lifted last year. (Chicken-fried horse steak with onion gravy was on the menu at the Harvard Faculty Club until 1985.) Horse meat is consumed in France, just as dog meat is eaten in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Tonga, parts of Asia and even Switzerland. In Poland, some ingest dog fat as a curative. The status of dog meat as a hard-luck food is also well documented — Germans during the two world wars referred to it as “blockade mutton.”Yet in the United States, dog-eating has been a longstanding flashpoint for anxieties about race and citizenship. In 1904, a group of scantily clad Philippine Igorots from the Luzon highlands reenacted a daily “Bow Wow Feast” at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. Loosely based on the custom of sumang, in which a dog was sacrificed and eaten after military victory, the dog-eating spectacle was a sensation. Touring Los Angeles in 1906, the Igorots, now suspiciously “fat and glossy,” were blamed for an “epidemic of thefts” of over 200 “high-class dogs,” according to The Los Angeles Times.No dog theft was ever substantiated, but American politicians readily declared that the Igorots were “unfit” for American citizenship, a pressing matter in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War, when the United States defeated Spain, claimed its empire and annexed the Philippines. Moreover, the arrival of millions of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and the rise of Jim Crow laws in the South fueled white nativist fears of racial mongrelization. Between 1901 and 1904, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution need not “follow the Flag”; the country could legally annex an overseas territory and deny its people citizenship. New American humane education programs in Philippine public schools stressed the importance of animal kindness, including the proper care of pet dogs, as a keystone of civilization, moral agency and, perhaps, future independence.Like the Igorots, dog-eating American Indians appeared in popular culture as inassimilable and alien. In 1913, D. W. Griffith directed “The Battle at Elderbush Gulch,” a silent Western in which the cavalry annihilated a tribe of dog-eating Indians who attempted to steal puppies belonging to white settler children for a ritual dog feast. American Indian boarding school curricula included directives for merciful animal stewardship. Like the Filipinos, Indians were not United States citizens: under the terms of the 1831 case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, they were still “domestic dependent nations.”The strange relationship between dog-eating and anxieties over race, assimilation and citizenship reemerged into public view immediately after the Vietnam War in 1975. The federal Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act helped relocate approximately 130,000 Indochinese refugees to America as permanent residents. Stories of ravenous bands of canine-eating refugees quickly flooded the media.In November 1979, animal welfare authorities in St. Paul investigated complaints that refugees were stealing and eating neighborhood pets. Southeast Asian residents vigorously denied the charges, but the director of the Ramsey County Humane Society persisted: “There have been too many calls from too many people to say that it’s just a rumor or there’s nothing to it.” Resettlement organizations included programs on “cultural differences in attitudes toward pets” to cultivate proper American values in a people deemed inscrutable.'"

"'12-05-07,'0','Pouring donor money into fighting AIDS in a poor African country does not necessarily detract from addressing other medical problems there, like malaria, malnutrition and infections, a six-year study in Rwanda has found.But the authors said their findings were applicable mostly to Rwanda, where a foresighted government deliberately moved to prevent a flood of donor money for AIDS from undermining other public health goals.The study by Brandeis University health policy analysts, published this month in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, compared 25 rural Rwandan clinics that offered AIDS treatment with 25 similar clinics that did not.Both sets of clinics improved in medical care as Rwanda rolled out $2-a-year national health insurance in 1999. But the AIDS clinics improved more rapidly, even by measures not related to AIDS, like giving vaccines, curing other illnesses and moving patients to hospitals. Extra training for AIDS doctors and nurses made them better doctors and nurses over all.Wu Zeng, a study author, said the government of President Paul Kagame, which has been in power since the 1994 genocide, recognized that donor money could inflate salaries for AIDS specialists and decreed that other doctors would be paid equally.Asked whether Rwanda, a poor but compact and well-organized country, was a realistic model for Africa, Donald S. Shepard, the study’s lead author, responded: “What they’re doing isn’t rocket science. Other countries can apply these ideas.”'"
"'12-05-07,'0','While the plan now is to stay put, the non-F.B.S. Big East programs lost a comfortable partner in Marinatto, who, as a former Providence athletic director, knew their perspective.But the basketball universities wield an unusual amount of power, and if they pull out, it could start a chain reaction that would doom the remaining programs.The F.B.S. universities — assuming Notre Dame would not be among them — have not been together long enough under N.C.A.A. guidelines to retain the league’s automatic bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament, meaning at the very least they would be forced to appease those basketball universities on some issues. The basketball universities could also make a play for the league’s most valuable remaining asset — the five-day Big East men’s tournament at Madison Square Garden.No one is sure if people will pine to go to the Garden to watch Houston and Central Florida play. Could the core of Catholic universities — Villanova, St. John’s and Georgetown — lure a few like-minded basketball-centric partners — Xavier, Dayton, Richmond, St. Joseph’s or Butler? — for a Garden party each March and plenty of N.C.A.A. tournament bids?“I just don’t know,” Tranghese said. “That’s probably a question, if they haven’t already, they’re going to have to ask themselves.”The surprising reality with the Big East — if it stays together in its intended 13-team and 18-team formats — is that it could still be a lucrative league. Football drives the financial bus, and basketball provides boundless inventory. While there have been plenty of jokes about who would want to watch San Diego State and Connecticut play football, apparently someone is willing to pay to find out.Neal Pilson, a media consultant and former president of CBS Sports, predicted that the Big East could surpass the deal it turned down last year, which was considered similar in value to the A.C.C.’s $155 million annual deal.“I think if they stay together and negotiate as a single unit, I think they can come away with a reasonably favorable result,” Pilson said. “Even more than what ESPN offered a year and a half ago. I think the competition will drive it.”The Big East is a bit like the game Jenga, a stack of wooden blocks haphazardly arranged atop one another. The most likely piece to be removed is Louisville. It is not a matter of whether it wants to go to the Big 12 as much as if it will be invited. If the Big 12, which has 10 teams, decides to expand to 12, would it invite Cincinnati to go with Louisville?“The critical thing is that they have to stay together,” Pilson said of the Big East.The next critical Jenga piece is Notre Dame, which would definitely leave if the basketball universities left — and could possibly leave even if they don’t. The A.C.C. is the most likely destination. The Irish’s television contract with NBC, currently under negotiation, will go a long way in determining their future — as will how they fare as a stakeholder in the new college football playoff. That appears to be safe and stable for now.If Notre Dame leaves for the A.C.C., its only realistic destination, the A.C.C. will take Connecticut or Rutgers to make it a 16-team league. And that would send all the Big East blocks tumbling.In a future filled with obstacles and potential stumbling blocks, perhaps the biggest one facing the Big East will be cleaning up the internal culture and bonding a group of universities whose common denominators have become survival and money instead of history and tradition.Marinatto hinted at the culture issue in a telephone interview Monday, saying how he saw people whom the league had long-term relationships with “suddenly become untrustworthy.” He added, “It’s discouraging and disappointing, and it’s not part of what you think intercollegiate athletics or higher education is about.”Marinatto later told The Associated Press, “Clearly, the collegiate model is dead.”Tranghese was more blunt, blaming the university presidents who have a huge stake in athletics but little background in sports.“If the presidents are making the decision, they’re in trouble,” Tranghese said. “The presidents don’t know enough. That’s been proven time and again.”The presidents better choose their next leader wisely. (Joe Bailey, a former Miami Dolphins chief executive is the interim commissioner.) If the Big East doesn’t make a smart choice, it could be picking up the pieces of a broken league again.'"
"'12-05-07,'0','Some 7,200 candidates, including 710 women, were competing for 250 seats across 15 electoral constituencies, according to SANA, the state news agency. Nearly 15 million people were eligible to vote, it said, out of a population of 23 million.President Bashar al-Assad has promised reform since he inherited the presidency from his late father in 2000, but he has never implemented any substantial political change. Every minor step he has taken in that direction over the last year has been dismissed as too little, too late by his opponents, fueling the current crisis.There was no public comment from Mr. Assad throughout the day about the election. Instead, the headline story in the state-run news media was Mr. Assad congratulating Vladimir V. Putin, who has been Russia’s prime minister for the last four years, on returning to the presidency. Many analysts believe it was Mr. Putin who formulated the Russian policy of shielding Syria from international pressure over the domestic violence.Even with the polls open, the Syrian military was attacking towns and killing people, noted Mohamed Sarmini, a member of the Syrian National Council reached in Istanbul. “You cannot really call it an election,” he said. “The regime is killing people at the same time it is announcing elections and reforms.”The council’s call for a boycott seemed to be carried out in some of the most embattled cities, despite what the government-run press hailed as a “wide turnout.” Another group announced the formation of a 120-member “transitional Parliament” of opposition members who would remain underground until the Assad government was toppled.Videos posted online from Deraa, where the uprising started in March 2011, and in Aleppo’s old marketplace, showed empty streets and all shops closed in a protest against the elections. State television carried a report that it said was from Deraa, showing people voting. The Syrian government severely limits the number of independent reporters allowed into the country and where they can go, making authentication of reports from either side difficult.In central Hama, eastern Deir al-Zour and some other cities, the opposition prevented election posters from being hung, instead printing the ubiquitous pictures of people killed by the government and labeling them their “candidates,” according to activists and videos.“The regime is occupying our city, there are no democratic elections under Kalashnikovs and tanks,” said Hayan, an activist in Hama’s old city who, like others who spoke, asked not to be identified in full out of fear of retribution. “But our battle is not to change an M.P. here or there. Our battle is to change the Assad regime completely.”Omar, a young activist in the Khaldiya neighborhood in Homs, which has been heavily shelled by government forces, said there were no polling places set up there or in similar Sunni Muslim neighborhoods — which had been virtually emptied anyway. The only voting was taking place in four neighborhoods mostly populated by Alawites, the sect President Assad belongs to, he said.Even in the government stronghold of Damascus, a visit to numerous polling places indicated a light turnout except in government offices where voting was mandatory. Large numbers of security forces were deployed all around the city.“Why should I go — there has not been a fair election in Syria since the Baath Party took power,” said Abu Adel, 50, a shopkeeper in Midan, a suburb that is a center of the opposition.But Habib, a 30-year-old government supporter, said in downtown Damascus that he was voting because he believed change had to come through the ballot box. “Today’s elections show how Syria is a democratic state,” he said, noting various changes implemented over the last year by Mr. Assad, including the creation of a new Constitution. “Those who get money from Qatar and Saudi Arabia and implement American-Israeli agendas will attack the election because they have nothing else to do.”The elections were delayed since last September by the promulgation of the new Constitution, which passed three months ago through a referendum held under similarly strained circumstances, with many cities under fire. Among the changes, the Constitution was supposed to pave the way for new political parties and to limit the president to two seven-year terms.Mostly the election seemed to feed the creative side of the opposition, with a constant stream of YouTube videos showing mock polling places.One, from the Damascus suburb of Saqba, said it was an exercise in “Ramacracy” combining the word “democracy” with “rama,” the Arabic verb meaning “to throw things in the trash.” A steady stream of voters were shown throwing ballots for the president and the government’s thuggish enforcers in the trash while putting the names of famous victims in the ballot box.Another video, from a village near Aleppo, showed a ballot box mounted on the back of a donkey, and villagers with their faces covered lining up to put their shoes in the box, insulting government figures from Mr. Assad on down as they did. “This is for the dogs of the regime,” one man said, while the background voice-over commented, “The polls are all very crowded.”One man who ambled along tried to put two shoes in the box, but the monitor reached in and handed one shoe back. “This is a clean election,” he said. “You can only vote once.”'"
"'12-05-07,'0','In France, the Socialist François Hollande, who has been critical of the austerity-only mind-set championed by Germany, defeated President Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday.David Joy, chief market strategist with Ameriprise Financial, said the vote would reposition the debate with Germany over what direction to navigate between austerity and growth.“On balance, markets will take this in stride,” Mr. Joy said. “I do, however, think it increases the level of uncertainty in terms of what type of accommodation will be reached between France and Germany in approaching the fiscal path.”Voters in Greece used the ballot box to react to the crushing austerity measures demanded by Europe and the International Monetary Fund as the price for a series of economic bailouts. The entry into Parliament of parties on the far left and far right renewed fears that Greece would eventually leave the euro. In Greece, the benchmark A.S.E. stock index slid 6.7 percent.Douglas Cote, chief market strategist for ING Investment Management, said the election results in France were within expectations.“From a market perspective, it is replacing one Socialist with another Socialist,” he said. “The bigger thing is Greece. They have to meet their targets on austerity, or they are not going to get their I.M.F. loans that have already been agreed on.”He was referring to the agreement made with the monetary fund and other creditors to address Greece’s sovereign debt crisis.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed 1.55 percent higher, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.65 percent. The DAX in Frankfurt was down during the day but closed with a 0.1 percent gain. London markets were closed for a holiday.The muted response in the United States followed the biggest weekly decline this year for the S.& P. 500, which was weighed down by the jobs report on Friday.The French result “was much anticipated; there was no surprise,” Valérie Cazaban, a fund manager at Stratège Finance, said. The bigger question, she said, was the June parliamentary elections, which will determine whether Mr. Hollande wins the majority he needs to carry out his program.The market reaction has been “very calm,” she said, noting that French bond yields were only slightly higher.Ms. Cazaban said Greece was more of a concern than France, but that there, too, the message was that “people don’t want just austerity — they want to balance it with growth, which is hard but not impossible.”“I think Germany is isolated for the moment,” she said. “The solution may be found in the next few weeks as Germany and the European Central Bank respond” to the changed circumstances.Asian markets declined. In Tokyo, the Japanese benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.8 percent. In Sydney, the S.& P./ASX 200 index fell 2.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.6 percent. Asian shares were also catching up to the news that the United States economy created only 115,000 jobs in April, fewer than analysts had expected and far fewer than needed to clear the backlog of jobless Americans.In the currency market, the dollar was mixed against its peers. The euro fell to $1.3062 from $1.3083 late Friday in New York, having dropped as low as $1.2931 for the first time since late January.The European elections affirmed a “political backlash against fiscal austerity, with Germany and France potentially on a collision course,” analysts at DBS in Singapore summarized in a research note Monday. The French and Greek elections, they added, “sent a common message that voters no longer have the stomach for tough austerity measures.”Interest rates were steady. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 1/32, to 101 4/32, and the yield slipped to 1.87 percent from 1.88 percent late Friday.'"
"'12-05-07,'0','Of course, it all depends on the meaning of systematically. For over a decade, travel managers have painstakingly negotiated corporate rates with select airlines, hotels and other suppliers, at discounted prices in exchange for guaranteeing a specified amount of annual business. Such deals are the foundation of travel policies, which also typically lay out policies for expenses on meals, business entertainment and incidentals.There are various reasons many travelers have opted to make choices outside of policy. Airlines, for example, have been busily tacking on ever more à la carte options during the reservation or check-in process.“With the options to choose for premium seats and all those other things, the challenge is definitely more on the air travel side” for travel managers, Ms. Rheem said.Business travel accounted for more than $251 billion in spending last year in the United States. About 31 million individuals made at least one business trip, according to PhoCusWright. Big companies with over 5,000 employees account for the vast majority of business trips and the bulk of annual spending, and two-thirds have corporate travel policies in place, PhoCusWright said.Travelers who book outside policy often do so because it makes more sense for a specific trip. The preferred airline may require connections that take all day to get to a destination, while another airline that’s not within policy may offer a shorter route at a competitive fare. A hotel that’s within policy may be a $50 taxicab ride from the hotel across town that’s closer to the traveler’s convention or meeting.Travel managers often try to impose sanctions, but many business travelers tend to be valued, high-performing employees who aren’t easily intimidated by a stern memo.“One thing we found is, the higher up you go in the organization the more likely they are to go rogue,” Ms. Rheem said.Most travel policies often have some flexibility to allow employees “some discretion over which travel brands they use,” the PhoCusWright report says.In general, travel managers are working to accommodate travelers’ need for more control on the road, as more work is packed into each trip. And the managers do realize that the airlines, struggling to maintain profitability, are cutting routes and services, while offering better service for extra fees — seats with more legroom, priority boarding and the like.So travelers and travel managers are not natural enemies. Rather, the struggle is to get the most out of business travel spending in a shaky economy, while airfares and hotel rates are rising, and while conditions on the road are generally tougher than ever. Better information is crucial.“At PhoCusWright, we’re absolutely neutral; we have clients across the entire spectrum of the travel industry,” Ms. Rheem said. “I see my role as helping everyone in the industry better understand the conditions.”Meanwhile, the airlines are increasing the pressure on travelers to pay the base fare and then choose from various for-fee extra services. And not everybody thinks that’s a bad thing. Airlines depend mightily on ancillary fees to stay in business.Travelers “are better served when they are free to pick and purchase services based on individual preference,” according to a recent report by the consulting firm IdeaWorks and the travel reservations company Amadeus. Airlines, the report says, “are trying to become savvy retailers.”But then, said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorks, choices and prices “must be delivered in an open and honest manner, and that’s a lesson still sadly lost on some airlines.”'"
"'12-05-07,'0','“How Apple Sidesteps Millions in Taxes” (“The iEconomy Series,” front page, April 29) suggests that Luxembourg-based iTunes S.à.r.l. is part of a grand scheme run by Apple to deprive the United States and European governments of billions of income tax dollars or euros. You assert that Luxembourg “has promised to tax the payments collected by Apple and numerous other tech corporations at low rates if they route transactions through Luxembourg.”In the European Union, every iTunes customer, or customer of any other Luxembourg-based business to consumer e-service provider, pays value-added tax (VAT) — a consumption tax similar to the United States sales tax — at the same, lowest possible rate. This is not the result of these e-service providers’ intent to cheat the taxman. Rather, it is the consequence of a combination of these factors:¶A well-functioning E.U. internal market, which allows for cross-border trade of all e-services from a single location to all other 26 national markets.¶The lowest tax rate in the applicable 15 to 25 percent range for standard VAT rates in the 27 European Union member states.

"'12-05-08,'0','Of course, it all depends on the meaning of systematically. For over a decade, travel managers have painstakingly negotiated corporate rates with select airlines, hotels and other suppliers, at discounted prices in exchange for guaranteeing a specified amount of annual business. Such deals are the foundation of travel policies, which also typically lay out policies for expenses on meals, business entertainment and incidentals.There are various reasons many travelers have opted to make choices outside of policy. Airlines, for example, have been busily tacking on ever more à la carte options during the reservation or check-in process.“With the options to choose for premium seats and all those other things, the challenge is definitely more on the air travel side” for travel managers, Ms. Rheem said.Business travel accounted for more than $251 billion in spending last year in the United States. About 31 million individuals made at least one business trip, according to PhoCusWright. Big companies with over 5,000 employees account for the vast majority of business trips and the bulk of annual spending, and two-thirds have corporate travel policies in place, PhoCusWright said.Travelers who book outside policy often do so because it makes more sense for a specific trip. The preferred airline may require connections that take all day to get to a destination, while another airline that’s not within policy may offer a shorter route at a competitive fare. A hotel that’s within policy may be a $50 taxicab ride from the hotel across town that’s closer to the traveler’s convention or meeting.Travel managers often try to impose sanctions, but many business travelers tend to be valued, high-performing employees who aren’t easily intimidated by a stern memo.“One thing we found is, the higher up you go in the organization the more likely they are to go rogue,” Ms. Rheem said.Most travel policies often have some flexibility to allow employees “some discretion over which travel brands they use,” the PhoCusWright report says.In general, travel managers are working to accommodate travelers’ need for more control on the road, as more work is packed into each trip. And the managers do realize that the airlines, struggling to maintain profitability, are cutting routes and services, while offering better service for extra fees — seats with more legroom, priority boarding and the like.So travelers and travel managers are not natural enemies. Rather, the struggle is to get the most out of business travel spending in a shaky economy, while airfares and hotel rates are rising, and while conditions on the road are generally tougher than ever. Better information is crucial.“At PhoCusWright, we’re absolutely neutral; we have clients across the entire spectrum of the travel industry,” Ms. Rheem said. “I see my role as helping everyone in the industry better understand the conditions.”Meanwhile, the airlines are increasing the pressure on travelers to pay the base fare and then choose from various for-fee extra services. And not everybody thinks that’s a bad thing. Airlines depend mightily on ancillary fees to stay in business.Travelers “are better served when they are free to pick and purchase services based on individual preference,” according to a recent report by the consulting firm IdeaWorks and the travel reservations company Amadeus. Airlines, the report says, “are trying to become savvy retailers.”But then, said Jay Sorensen, the president of IdeaWorks, choices and prices “must be delivered in an open and honest manner, and that’s a lesson still sadly lost on some airlines.”'"
"'12-05-08,'0','“They teach us to lie about stopping people. They teach us to lie about tickets, and ruin lives,” said Officer Polanco, who after about a decade on the force is suspended with pay. “I’ve never been a disciplinary problem. The only problem came when I decided to open my mouth.”This, too, is Mr. Kelly’s police force, a department that can claim many victories but is consumed by a single imperative: crime and homicide rates must keep falling. Question this and top police officials offer a catchall answer: Do you want to return to the bad old days?There’s no definitive proof that top officials systematically manipulate crime data and set arrest quotas. But officers have stepped forward in recent years to talk of such practices in widely scattered precincts: Adrian Schoolcraft in the 81st in , and Chris Bienz in . All of them, along with Officer Polanco, spoke first to Graham Rayman of The Village Voice and Jim Hoffer of the local ABC affiliate. Two officers from Brooklyn detailed near-identical complaints for me recently, although they requested anonymity. The department has said repeatedly that it is examining the many accusations of manipulation of crime data, though an internal report vindicated Officer Schoolcraft.Officer Polanco, who was suspended more than two years ago, and five former officers gathered last week in Greenwich Village at a forum organized by the Police Reform Organizing Project. They talked not of petty grievances but, with passionate and pained words, of good police practices trampled.“Make no mistake: There are quotas, and that is illegal,” a former New York City police captain, John A. Eterno, told the audience.Mr. Eterno, as it happens, is a particularly difficult critic to dismiss. Once he trained officers to . Now a professor at Molloy College, he and Professor Eli Silverman of surveyed more than 100 retired police captains, and detail their findings in their recent book “The Crime Numbers Game: Management by Manipulation.”The former captains spoke of an unrelenting, often unethical pressure to manipulate crime statistics. In addition, the professors studied police and health data and found weird divergences. City hospital data shows a 90 percent increase in emergency room visits for assaults from 1999 to 2006. But police data for the same period records a nearly 50 percent decrease in assaults.The Police Department launched a counterattack against the professors. Mayor offered a shrug. “There’s always going to be some fudging of the numbers, but it is tiny,” he said, adding that the study “was paid for by one of the unions.”As it happens, the mayor is incorrect. Molloy College paid for the study. “Any suggestion of a chink in the armor of the ‘ success story’ is very threatening. You’re excommunicated,” says Mr. Silverman. “It’s the holy of holies.”Officer Polanco knows the life of a heretic. He has surrendered his badge and gun. Once, as a child in crime-ravaged Washington Heights, he dreamed of being a police officer. Now he passes restless days, fighting anger as he cares for three sons.“It’s a shame to get paid for doing nothing,” he says. “How can I live with myself, how could I face my wife, if I didn’t speak up?” That might be a reasonable question for a commissioner contemplating a mayoral run.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','Austin, Tex.At the White House Correspondents’ Association dinner last month, President Obama playfully referenced a passage in his memoir in which he told of eating dog meat as a child in Indonesia. Riffing on Sarah Palin’s line — and responding to Republican criticism — he said, “What’s the difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull? A pit bull is delicious.” (Of course, Republicans have had their own canine issues, given Mitt Romney’s predilection for fastening his Irish setter to the top of the family car in the 1980s.)Although dog-eating is taboo in the United States, personal consumption of dog meat is legal in most states. Likewise, Americans find horse-eating offensive; a five-year federal ban on slaughtering horses for human consumption was lifted last year. (Chicken-fried horse steak with onion gravy was on the menu at the Harvard Faculty Club until 1985.) Horse meat is consumed in France, just as dog meat is eaten in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, Tonga, parts of Asia and even Switzerland. In Poland, some ingest dog fat as a curative. The status of dog meat as a hard-luck food is also well documented — Germans during the two world wars referred to it as “blockade mutton.”Yet in the United States, dog-eating has been a longstanding flashpoint for anxieties about race and citizenship. In 1904, a group of scantily clad Philippine Igorots from the Luzon highlands reenacted a daily “Bow Wow Feast” at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis. Loosely based on the custom of sumang, in which a dog was sacrificed and eaten after military victory, the dog-eating spectacle was a sensation. Touring Los Angeles in 1906, the Igorots, now suspiciously “fat and glossy,” were blamed for an “epidemic of thefts” of over 200 “high-class dogs,” according to The Los Angeles Times.No dog theft was ever substantiated, but American politicians readily declared that the Igorots were “unfit” for American citizenship, a pressing matter in the aftermath of the Spanish-American War, when the United States defeated Spain, claimed its empire and annexed the Philippines. Moreover, the arrival of millions of immigrants from southern and eastern Europe and the rise of Jim Crow laws in the South fueled white nativist fears of racial mongrelization. Between 1901 and 1904, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution need not “follow the Flag”; the country could legally annex an overseas territory and deny its people citizenship. New American humane education programs in Philippine public schools stressed the importance of animal kindness, including the proper care of pet dogs, as a keystone of civilization, moral agency and, perhaps, future independence.Like the Igorots, dog-eating American Indians appeared in popular culture as inassimilable and alien. In 1913, D. W. Griffith directed “The Battle at Elderbush Gulch,” a silent Western in which the cavalry annihilated a tribe of dog-eating Indians who attempted to steal puppies belonging to white settler children for a ritual dog feast. American Indian boarding school curricula included directives for merciful animal stewardship. Like the Filipinos, Indians were not United States citizens: under the terms of the 1831 case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, they were still “domestic dependent nations.”The strange relationship between dog-eating and anxieties over race, assimilation and citizenship reemerged into public view immediately after the Vietnam War in 1975. The federal Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act helped relocate approximately 130,000 Indochinese refugees to America as permanent residents. Stories of ravenous bands of canine-eating refugees quickly flooded the media.In November 1979, animal welfare authorities in St. Paul investigated complaints that refugees were stealing and eating neighborhood pets. Southeast Asian residents vigorously denied the charges, but the director of the Ramsey County Humane Society persisted: “There have been too many calls from too many people to say that it’s just a rumor or there’s nothing to it.” Resettlement organizations included programs on “cultural differences in attitudes toward pets” to cultivate proper American values in a people deemed inscrutable.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','“How Apple Sidesteps Millions in Taxes” (“The iEconomy Series,” front page, April 29) suggests that Luxembourg-based iTunes S.à.r.l. is part of a grand scheme run by Apple to deprive the United States and European governments of billions of income tax dollars or euros. You assert that Luxembourg “has promised to tax the payments collected by Apple and numerous other tech corporations at low rates if they route transactions through Luxembourg.”In the European Union, every iTunes customer, or customer of any other Luxembourg-based business to consumer e-service provider, pays value-added tax (VAT) — a consumption tax similar to the United States sales tax — at the same, lowest possible rate. This is not the result of these e-service providers’ intent to cheat the taxman. Rather, it is the consequence of a combination of these factors:¶A well-functioning E.U. internal market, which allows for cross-border trade of all e-services from a single location to all other 26 national markets.¶The lowest tax rate in the applicable 15 to 25 percent range for standard VAT rates in the 27 European Union member states. So, iTunes S.à.r.l. collects 15 eurocents for every euro spent on iTunes services in VAT from each and every customer, wherever he or she is in the European Union.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','Pouring donor money into fighting AIDS in a poor African country does not necessarily detract from addressing other medical problems there, like malaria, malnutrition and infections, a six-year study in Rwanda has found.But the authors said their findings were applicable mostly to Rwanda, where a foresighted government deliberately moved to prevent a flood of donor money for AIDS from undermining other public health goals.The study by Brandeis University health policy analysts, published this month in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, compared 25 rural Rwandan clinics that offered AIDS treatment with 25 similar clinics that did not.Both sets of clinics improved in medical care as Rwanda rolled out $2-a-year national health insurance in 1999. But the AIDS clinics improved more rapidly, even by measures not related to AIDS, like giving vaccines, curing other illnesses and moving patients to hospitals. Extra training for AIDS doctors and nurses made them better doctors and nurses over all.Wu Zeng, a study author, said the government of President Paul Kagame, which has been in power since the 1994 genocide, recognized that donor money could inflate salaries for AIDS specialists and decreed that other doctors would be paid equally.Asked whether Rwanda, a poor but compact and well-organized country, was a realistic model for Africa, Donald S. Shepard, the study’s lead author, responded: “What they’re doing isn’t rocket science. Other countries can apply these ideas.”'"
"'12-05-08,'0','While the plan now is to stay put, the non-F.B.S. Big East programs lost a comfortable partner in Marinatto, who, as a former Providence athletic director, knew their perspective.But the basketball universities wield an unusual amount of power, and if they pull out, it could start a chain reaction that would doom the remaining programs.The F.B.S. universities — assuming Notre Dame would not be among them — have not been together long enough under N.C.A.A. guidelines to retain the league’s automatic bid to the N.C.A.A. tournament, meaning at the very least they would be forced to appease those basketball universities on some issues. The basketball universities could also make a play for the league’s most valuable remaining asset — the five-day Big East men’s tournament at Madison Square Garden.No one is sure if people will pine to go to the Garden to watch Houston and Central Florida play. Could the core of Catholic universities — Villanova, St. John’s and Georgetown — lure a few like-minded basketball-centric partners — Xavier, Dayton, Richmond, St. Joseph’s or Butler? — for a Garden party each March and plenty of N.C.A.A. tournament bids?“I just don’t know,” Tranghese said. “That’s probably a question, if they haven’t already, they’re going to have to ask themselves.”The surprising reality with the Big East — if it stays together in its intended 13-team and 18-team formats — is that it could still be a lucrative league. Football drives the financial bus, and basketball provides boundless inventory. While there have been plenty of jokes about who would want to watch San Diego State and Connecticut play football, apparently someone is willing to pay to find out.Neal Pilson, a media consultant and former president of CBS Sports, predicted that the Big East could surpass the deal it turned down last year, which was considered similar in value to the A.C.C.’s $155 million annual deal.“I think if they stay together and negotiate as a single unit, I think they can come away with a reasonably favorable result,” Pilson said. “Even more than what ESPN offered a year and a half ago. I think the competition will drive it.”The Big East is a bit like the game Jenga, a stack of wooden blocks haphazardly arranged atop one another. The most likely piece to be removed is Louisville. It is not a matter of whether it wants to go to the Big 12 as much as if it will be invited. If the Big 12, which has 10 teams, decides to expand to 12, would it invite Cincinnati to go with Louisville?“The critical thing is that they have to stay together,” Pilson said of the Big East.The next critical Jenga piece is Notre Dame, which would definitely leave if the basketball universities left — and could possibly leave even if they don’t. The A.C.C. is the most likely destination. The Irish’s television contract with NBC, currently under negotiation, will go a long way in determining their future — as will how they fare as a stakeholder in the new college football playoff. That appears to be safe and stable for now.If Notre Dame leaves for the A.C.C., its only realistic destination, the A.C.C. will take Connecticut or Rutgers to make it a 16-team league. And that would send all the Big East blocks tumbling.In a future filled with obstacles and potential stumbling blocks, perhaps the biggest one facing the Big East will be cleaning up the internal culture and bonding a group of universities whose common denominators have become survival and money instead of history and tradition.Marinatto hinted at the culture issue in a telephone interview Monday, saying how he saw people whom the league had long-term relationships with “suddenly become untrustworthy.” He added, “It’s discouraging and disappointing, and it’s not part of what you think intercollegiate athletics or higher education is about.”Marinatto later told The Associated Press, “Clearly, the collegiate model is dead.”Tranghese was more blunt, blaming the university presidents who have a huge stake in athletics but little background in sports.“If the presidents are making the decision, they’re in trouble,” Tranghese said. “The presidents don’t know enough. That’s been proven time and again.”The presidents better choose their next leader wisely. (Joe Bailey, a former Miami Dolphins chief executive is the interim commissioner.) If the Big East doesn’t make a smart choice, it could be picking up the pieces of a broken league again.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','Other Asian horror movies have been exported to the U.S. with varying degrees of success, but they did not attract major audiences until they were remade for American viewers. Among them were “The Ring” (from “Ringu,” a Japanese film), “The Grudge” (from “Ju-on,” also Japanese) and “The Uninvited” (from “A Tale of Two Sisters,” a South Korean film).If the debut of “The Road” hits the mark with American audiences, it could open the door to the lucrative North American market and revitalize a national film industry in the Philippines that by all accounts is in need of help.From the 1960s through the 1990s, about 140 locally produced films a year were shown in the Philippines. It was during that time that Joseph Estrada shot to stardom and rode his on-screen charisma to the presidency.But in the past decade, the number of locally made films has plunged by nearly half, to an average of 73 a year, according to a report by the country’s National Statistical Coordination Board.In 2011, only about a third of the 229 films shown commercially in the Philippines were locally produced, the report noted. The vast majority were the Hollywood movies loved by many people in this former U.S. colony, where English is widely spoken. Last year, the top-grossing film in the Philippines was “Transformers: Dark of the Moon.”“Why is the local film industry dying?” asked the report.As in many other developing Asian countries, rampant piracy has been a major factor undercutting development of the homegrown movie business. In the Philippines, a film that can be seen in the theater for a ticket that costs 120 pesos, or about $2.80, can often be bought at the same time from vendors of pirated DVDs for 40 pesos. The Film Academy of the Philippines estimates that the industry lost about 4 billion pesos last year to piracy.Illustrating the pervasiveness of the problem, Ronald Llamas, the political adviser to President Benigno S. Aquino III, was photographed in January buying about 2,000 pesos’ worth of pirated DVDs at a local market in Manila. He later apologized.Many also blame the decline of the local film business on a 30 percent tax on gross revenues that was instituted in the 1990s. Adding in a 12 percent value-added tax, Philippine movie producers were paying a tax rate of 42 percent for much of the past two decades.“That killed the industry,” said Pepe Diokno, a producer and director whose film “Clash” won the Luigi De Laurentiis Award at the Venice Film Festival in 2009.“The tax killed innovation and killed the chance that producers would take risks with narratives and unknown stars,” he said. “Producers went with formula, with melodrama and slapstick, because they had to be sure it would sell.”In 2009, the revenue tax was lowered to a more manageable 10 percent. That was not the only major change in recent years. The advent of affordable digital equipment has allowed a boom in the production of independent films in the Philippines.More than half of the local films shown in the past three years have been independent productions, according to the statistics board.“There has been a revolution in technology,” said Yam Laranas, the director of “The Road.” “Ten years ago, few people could afford to make an independent film in the Philippines. A nontraditional story was not economically viable.”“Things are changing,” he said, noting that he had shot “The Road” to U.S. theatrical release standards on Red Digital Cinema equipment that cost a small fraction of the price of traditional video cameras. “A lot of independent directors and studios are making innovative films because the costs are so much lower. It is less of a risk.”According to Mr. Laranas, the proliferation of independent digital movie producers has had an effect on studios. He said that while “The Road” had been backed by a major mainstream studio in the Philippines, it shared many of the traits of independent films, including an unconventional story line.“It used to be that producers and studios in the Philippines took the attitude, ‘They will eat what we feed them,”’ he said. “Now, more movies are coming out that are not your usual fare, and mass audiences are excited to see these films.”In 2009, studios were put on notice by the release of the movie “Zombadings,” an independently produced horror comedy about the struggles of gay zombies.Rather than simply mocking gay characters, a common feature of Philippine films, the movie delivered a message of tolerance wrapped in over-the-top comedy and gruesome visual effects.It was a surprising success, bringing in more than 30 million pesos at the box office. That pales in comparison with the more than 400 million pesos that a Hollywood blockbuster can earn in the Philippines, but it was a substantial sum for a local, independent film.Despite the success of such independent films, mainstream Philippine studios have been slow to emulate them, Mr. Diokno said. But Filipino filmgoers are becoming more sophisticated, and the studios neglect this development at their peril, he said.“When we go around to schools and provincial areas and show independent films, audiences are very involved,” he said. “The reaction they give local independent movies is even more visceral than they give Hollywood movies.”“I don’t understand why studio heads don’t realize that audiences can take nonlinear stories, flawed characters and subtleties,” Mr. Diokno said. “They haven’t picked up on it yet, but the audience is there for those kinds of movies.”The Philippine audience was there for “The Road,” which unravels a grim mystery with a story told in reverse. Made for 20 million pesos, it grossed 47 million pesos in the first three weeks of its release.However, establishing an American audience for the film will be no simple task, said David Chu, managing director of Asian Media Rights, a New York-based company that distributes Asian films in North America. He noted that only a few Asian films were typically widely released theatrically in the United States and that they were usually top action and martial arts films.Successfully promoting a film that is being released in North American theaters is a significant investment and risk, he said.“Some theaters require that you advertise in local newspapers,” he said. “There are billboards and bus stop advertisements. And it is not just a dollar investment. It requires personnel. It takes a lot of effort to promote a theatrical release.”He noted that on the bright side, the film was being released simultaneously on multiple digital platforms, a form of distribution that his company prefers.“Producers often equate success with how well their film did at the box office,” Mr. Chu said. “But there is a growing market outside of the theaters. You don’t need to be in the theaters to be a success.”Backers of “The Road” are betting that one way or another — in theaters or via downloads — they can bridge the gap in tastes between Philippine and American audiences.“Universally, people like to be scared,” Mr. Laranas said. “We wanted to do that with a clear narrative, not relying on jump scares, cats jumping out of nowhere. Anyone from Lima to New Jersey can appreciate this film.”'"
"'12-05-08,'0','“He is caught in the understanding that he is the savior of Russia, that everything depends on him,” Mr. Rahr said. “He sees himself as a historical figure already, a man who prevented the collapse of the country. The problem is, now he has to meet the real demands of people who are 30 years younger than him.”The eve of Mr. Putin’s inauguration brought violent clashes between the police and protesters — a jarring development in a city that in recent months has become accustomed to large, peaceful rallies.A buoyant march on Sunday turned violent after a group of radical activists tried to break through a police column apparently in an effort to reach the Kremlin. Police officers in riot gear charged into the crowd trying to drag out people they thought had pelted them with smoke bombs and rocks, and beat them fiercely with nightsticks.Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, responded by saying that the police reaction was too gentle and that he would have liked to see them crack down harder.By Monday evening, more than 700 protesters had been detained, though some were released almost immediately. Officials said 29 officers were injured on Sunday, and state-controlled television — the primary source of information for most of the country — featured sympathetic interviews with uniformed officers lying on beds in a hospital ward.Officials made it clear that the authorities would hesitate to permit future marches. Nevertheless, scattered groups of protesters staged actions timed to Mr. Putin’s inauguration.“Up until now, all was peaceful,” said Aleksei Yeryomin, 40, an art director for a magazine. “But the first blood has been spilled, and knowing the Russian character, the situation will now be unpredictable.”The police seemed to arrest people all over the city.Nikita Volkov, 28, a computer programmer, said he was walking down the street with a white ribbon on his belt when the police detained him with no explanation, gave him an official warning, videotaped him and recorded his personal information. At an evening gathering that had been publicized over the Internet, the police simply walked through the crowd, identified everyone who was not a journalist, and put them in a van.“People are being arrested for nothing at all, simply for standing on the sidewalk,” said Oleg Orlov of Memorial, a human rights organization. “They even started detaining people who are sitting and drinking beer. I think this is to show who is boss. A new czar has come and wants to show his face, his mug, I would say.”The chaotic scene came in contrast with the president’s inauguration, an event that has accrued grandeur since ’s stripped-down swearing-in.Mr. Putin’s motorcade glided soundlessly through a city whose streets had been virtually emptied for the occasion. Once inside the Grand Kremlin Palace, Mr. Putin walked over a long red carpet through a series of packed halls, until he reached the innermost hall, which is as lustrous and intricate as a jewel box. He took his place under a huge gilded sunburst, the “All-Powerful Eye,” which was hung so it could cast its rays onto the throne of the czar.Mr. Putin looked grave — even burdened — as he delivered a short address to a roomful of dignitaries that included a close friend, the former Italian prime minister .“I will do my best to justify the trust of millions of our citizens,” he said. “I think it is the meaning of my whole life, and it is my duty to serve our country, serve our people, whose support inspires me and helps me solve the most complex and difficult problems.”Mr. Putin immediately fulfilled his promise to , his predecessor, by recommending him to Parliament as Russia’s next prime minister. One of his first decrees ordered the privatization of all state-owned companies outside the natural resources and defense sectors by 2016, suggesting that he plans to pick up the banner of Mr. Medvedev’s modernization push.The decree also asked the government to raise Russia’s ranking on a index of nations for ease of doing business to 20th by the end of the decade from 120th place today.Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, said Mr. Putin clearly has his mind fixed on upgrading Russia — perhaps following in the steps of the czarist prime minister Pyotr A. Stolypin, who brooked little dissent but pushed through historic reforms.“This is a guy who tries to do what has eluded all his predecessors,” Mr. Trenin said. “He sees himself as a guy with a mission, and a mission of historic proportions.”That vision does not likely account for a sharp rise in dissent, or a sustained one. In the early hours of Tuesday morning, several hundred young people had formed what they called an “indefinite street party” in a central square, where the blogger Aleksei Navalny called for “guitars, harmonicas, harps, trombones and drums.” The police were standing by quietly., the leader of Russia’s Communist Party, said he thought it was all just the beginning.“The authorities need to understand that the split in society is growing, that there is stronger dissatisfaction with dishonest elections and the absence of normal dialogue,” Mr. Zyuganov told Interfax. “In this situation, radicalism is inevitable. The attempt to shut everyone’s mouths with a police baton is senseless and extremely dangerous.”'"
"'12-05-08,'0','Some 7,200 candidates, including 710 women, were competing for 250 seats across 15 electoral constituencies, according to SANA, the state news agency. Nearly 15 million people were eligible to vote, it said, out of a population of 23 million.President Bashar al-Assad has promised reform since he inherited the presidency from his late father in 2000, but he has never implemented any substantial political change. Every minor step he has taken in that direction over the last year has been dismissed as too little, too late by his opponents, fueling the current crisis.There was no public comment from Mr. Assad throughout the day about the election. Instead, the headline story in the state-run news media was Mr. Assad congratulating Vladimir V. Putin, who has been Russia’s prime minister for the last four years, on returning to the presidency. Many analysts believe it was Mr. Putin who formulated the Russian policy of shielding Syria from international pressure over the domestic violence.Even with the polls open, the Syrian military was attacking towns and killing people, noted Mohamed Sarmini, a member of the Syrian National Council reached in Istanbul. “You cannot really call it an election,” he said. “The regime is killing people at the same time it is announcing elections and reforms.”The council’s call for a boycott seemed to be carried out in some of the most embattled cities, despite what the government-run press hailed as a “wide turnout.” Another group announced the formation of a 120-member “transitional Parliament” of opposition members who would remain underground until the Assad government was toppled.Videos posted online from Deraa, where the uprising started in March 2011, and in Aleppo’s old marketplace, showed empty streets and all shops closed in a protest against the elections. State television carried a report that it said was from Deraa, showing people voting. The Syrian government severely limits the number of independent reporters allowed into the country and where they can go, making authentication of reports from either side difficult.In central Hama, eastern Deir al-Zour and some other cities, the opposition prevented election posters from being hung, instead printing the ubiquitous pictures of people killed by the government and labeling them their “candidates,” according to activists and videos.“The regime is occupying our city, there are no democratic elections under Kalashnikovs and tanks,” said Hayan, an activist in Hama’s old city who, like others who spoke, asked not to be identified in full out of fear of retribution. “But our battle is not to change an M.P. here or there. Our battle is to change the Assad regime completely.”Omar, a young activist in the Khaldiya neighborhood in Homs, which has been heavily shelled by government forces, said there were no polling places set up there or in similar Sunni Muslim neighborhoods — which had been virtually emptied anyway. The only voting was taking place in four neighborhoods mostly populated by Alawites, the sect President Assad belongs to, he said.Even in the government stronghold of Damascus, a visit to numerous polling places indicated a light turnout except in government offices where voting was mandatory. Large numbers of security forces were deployed all around the city.“Why should I go — there has not been a fair election in Syria since the Baath Party took power,” said Abu Adel, 50, a shopkeeper in Midan, a suburb that is a center of the opposition.But Habib, a 30-year-old government supporter, said in downtown Damascus that he was voting because he believed change had to come through the ballot box. “Today’s elections show how Syria is a democratic state,” he said, noting various changes implemented over the last year by Mr. Assad, including the creation of a new Constitution. “Those who get money from Qatar and Saudi Arabia and implement American-Israeli agendas will attack the election because they have nothing else to do.”The elections were delayed since last September by the promulgation of the new Constitution, which passed three months ago through a referendum held under similarly strained circumstances, with many cities under fire. Among the changes, the Constitution was supposed to pave the way for new political parties and to limit the president to two seven-year terms.Mostly the election seemed to feed the creative side of the opposition, with a constant stream of YouTube videos showing mock polling places.One, from the Damascus suburb of Saqba, said it was an exercise in “Ramacracy” combining the word “democracy” with “rama,” the Arabic verb meaning “to throw things in the trash.” A steady stream of voters were shown throwing ballots for the president and the government’s thuggish enforcers in the trash while putting the names of famous victims in the ballot box.Another video, from a village near Aleppo, showed a ballot box mounted on the back of a donkey, and villagers with their faces covered lining up to put their shoes in the box, insulting government figures from Mr. Assad on down as they did. “This is for the dogs of the regime,” one man said, while the background voice-over commented, “The polls are all very crowded.”One man who ambled along tried to put two shoes in the box, but the monitor reached in and handed one shoe back. “This is a clean election,” he said. “You can only vote once.”'"
"'12-05-08,'0','In France, the Socialist François Hollande, who has been critical of the austerity-only mind-set championed by Germany, defeated President Nicolas Sarkozy on Sunday.David Joy, chief market strategist with Ameriprise Financial, said the vote would reposition the debate with Germany over what direction to navigate between austerity and growth.“On balance, markets will take this in stride,” Mr. Joy said. “I do, however, think it increases the level of uncertainty in terms of what type of accommodation will be reached between France and Germany in approaching the fiscal path.”Voters in Greece used the ballot box to react to the crushing austerity measures demanded by Europe and the International Monetary Fund as the price for a series of economic bailouts. The entry into Parliament of parties on the far left and far right renewed fears that Greece would eventually leave the euro. In Greece, the benchmark A.S.E. stock index slid 6.7 percent.Douglas Cote, chief market strategist for ING Investment Management, said the election results in France were within expectations.“From a market perspective, it is replacing one Socialist with another Socialist,” he said. “The bigger thing is Greece. They have to meet their targets on austerity, or they are not going to get their I.M.F. loans that have already been agreed on.”He was referring to the agreement made with the monetary fund and other creditors to address Greece’s sovereign debt crisis.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed 1.55 percent higher, while the CAC 40 in Paris was up 1.65 percent. The DAX in Frankfurt was down during the day but closed with a 0.1 percent gain. London markets were closed for a holiday.The muted response in the United States followed the biggest weekly decline this year for the S.& P. 500, which was weighed down by the jobs report on Friday.The French result “was much anticipated; there was no surprise,” Valérie Cazaban, a fund manager at Stratège Finance, said. The bigger question, she said, was the June parliamentary elections, which will determine whether Mr. Hollande wins the majority he needs to carry out his program.The market reaction has been “very calm,” she said, noting that French bond yields were only slightly higher.Ms. Cazaban said Greece was more of a concern than France, but that there, too, the message was that “people don’t want just austerity — they want to balance it with growth, which is hard but not impossible.”“I think Germany is isolated for the moment,” she said. “The solution may be found in the next few weeks as Germany and the European Central Bank respond” to the changed circumstances.Asian markets declined. In Tokyo, the Japanese benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.8 percent. In Sydney, the S.& P./ASX 200 index fell 2.2 percent. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong dropped 2.6 percent. Asian shares were also catching up to the news that the United States economy created only 115,000 jobs in April, fewer than analysts had expected and far fewer than needed to clear the backlog of jobless Americans.In the currency market, the dollar was mixed against its peers. The euro fell to $1.3062 from $1.3083 late Friday in New York, having dropped as low as $1.2931 for the first time since late January.The European elections affirmed a “political backlash against fiscal austerity, with Germany and France potentially on a collision course,” analysts at DBS in Singapore summarized in a research note Monday. The French and Greek elections, they added, “sent a common message that voters no longer have the stomach for tough austerity measures.”Interest rates were steady. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 1/32, to 101 4/32, and the yield slipped to 1.87 percent from 1.88 percent late Friday.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','Mr. Ladsous described the deployment of soldiers in some cities as “intrusive,” he said, and there had been no progress on efforts to allow the monitors to use helicopters in their work.Mr. Annan again put the main onus on the government of President Assad, saying it had “greater responsibility in terms of its size to really do whatever it can to reduce the violence.” But he did not absolve the opposition.Syria’s 23 million people have “been taken prisoner,” Mr. Annan said, noting continuing human-rights abuses and stressing that moving ahead with the political dialogue envisioned in his six-point plan required respect for the cease-fire. “It will be extremely difficult to make good progress on dialogue if the current conditions persist,” he said.The assessment was not markedly different from his last report two weeks ago, nor was the reaction of ambassadors. They broke down along the fault lines that have long stymied any forceful international effort to halt the violence in Syria: The United States and its allies focused on the failures of the Syrian government to implement the plan, while the Russians and the Chinese focused on the limited progress.“Things are moving in a positive direction,” Vitaly I. Churkin, the Russian ambassador, was quoted as telling reporters outside the Council chamber. “Many obstacles, but I think they can be overcome.”Several ambassadors focused on the humanitarian situation. Senior United Nations officials have objected repeatedly to the Syrian government obstructing attempts to deliver aid to about one million people considered in need.The basic conclusion among the envoys was that although the implementation of the plan was clearly flawed, there was no real alternative. Mr. Annan stressed that himself. “The U.N. supervision mission is possibly the only remaining chance to stabilize the country,” he said, before the onslaught of a civil war that could destabilize the entire region.Inside Syria, only scattered violence was reported Tuesday, with residents in Rastan, a city near Homs held by defecting soldiers, reporting heavy government shelling.At the United Nations, outside the Security Council, Bashar Jaafari, the Syrian ambassador, waved what he said was a CD containing the confessions of 26 Arab fighters on the side of the opposition, adding that the government had killed 15 more. Over the course of 14 months of the uprising, at least 10,000 civilians have been killed, as well as hundreds of soldiers, the United Nations estimates.The Assad government has long maintained that the uprising had nothing to do with demands for political change, but was rather a foreign plot by the enemies of Syria to pay radical jihadis to destabilize the country. Mr. Jaafari accused Gulf Arab nations of harboring the religious sheiks who issued the religious writs, or fatwas, sanctioning the fight in Syria as a sacred duty.“We need to see these Qataris, the Saudis, the Turkish governments, as well as some other nations, stopping their incitement to violence, their sponsorship of the armed rebellion,” he said.While Saudi Arabia and Qatar are among the countries that have promised to finance the rebellion, there is little tangible evidence that significant funds have reached the rebels.Senior officials in the region and experts on radical groups also say that while there is all manner of talk about a holy war in Syria, it seems to exist now more on the individual level rather than as an organized effort. Many officials, including the American ambassador, Susan E. Rice, noted that Syria had abetted such jihadists when they passed through Syria to fight in Iraq and was now paying the price.“But this is substantially a diversion from the main point,” Ms. Rice said, while conceding that it was impossible to rule out the presence of foreign fighters. “The main point is that the government continues to kill its own people, and having done so over the course of more than a year, it has created a situation in which people have taken up arms to defend themselves.”'"
"'12-05-08,'0','Mr. de Blasio, in an interview on Tuesday, spoke far more critically. While he described the stop-and-frisk practice as a “valid tool,” he said its increasing use has been “corrosive” to community relations with the police, a development that he said has undermined public safety.“We can’t have the social fabric continuing to be torn,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding that the high number of stops, particularly among young black and Latino residents, has made many New Yorkers uncomfortable and distrustful of the police officers who patrol their neighborhoods.“It’s breaking down something very fundamental here,” Mr. de Blasio added.Two other possible candidates for mayor, Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, and John C. Liu, the comptroller, have also been critical of the stop-and-frisk practice.The Police Department, along with the mayor, has vociferously defended the tactic, saying it has helped reduce the city’s crime rate to record lows. “New York City continues to be the safest big city in America, and one of the safest of any size, with significantly less crime per capita than even small cities,” a police spokesman, Paul J. Browne, wrote in an e-mail on Tuesday.As a political issue, stop-and-frisk can be potent because “it’s illustrative and symbolic of mayoral candidates’ attitudes toward the Police Department’s relationship to the community,” said Scott Levenson, a Democratic political consultant who is not working for any of next year’s potential mayoral contenders.But there can also be an electoral calculus afoot. Political strategists say they believe that Mr. de Blasio’s path to City Hall is likely to require the support of black and Latino residents, who have been more critical of the stop-and-frisk practice, whereas Ms. Quinn may be more dependent on the votes of working- and middle-class whites, who are shown in polls to be less bothered about the policy.“It’s sad but important to note that the candidates’ policies often reflect the makeup of the folks they are trying to persuade,” Mr. Levenson said.The public advocate’s proposal, which he plans to describe on the steps of City Hall, calls for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to request an internal audit by the Police Department of its statistics on what occurs after each stop-and-frisk episode — for instance, whether an arrest was made.Mr. de Blasio said he wanted to ensure that all stops were warranted and based on reasonable suspicion on the part of the officer, and wanted statistics to be released to the public each week. Currently, the numbers are reported to the City Council every three months.Mr. de Blasio also criticized Mr. Bloomberg directly, saying the mayor “has ducked ownership” of the topic. “He has deferred to the police commissioner,” he said. “It’s time for him to assert his authority and change direction.”'"
"'12-05-08,'0','This could be due in part to the results of December parliamentary elections, which gave opposition parties their largest number of seats in years. United Russia, the governing party created by Mr. Putin and now led by Mr. Medvedev, lost its constitutional majority, and while it still managed to hang on to half of Parliament’s 450 seats, its popularity has been further eroded by accusations of widespread electoral fraud.But opposition parties, which for years have served at the Kremlin’s behest, have been largely restrained in their dissent so far. Their leaders, for instance, have kept their distance from a protest movement that has inspired tens of thousands to take to the streets in Moscow against Mr. Putin, though some party members have taken an active role.This appears to be changing slowly. After a large protest on Sunday turned violent and the police unleashed a broad crackdown on public dissent, Gennady A. Zyuganov, the long-serving leader of Russia’s Communist Party, vocally defended the demonstrators and blamed the authorities for aggravating what he said was a growing split in society in their attempt “to shut everyone’s mouths with a police baton.”The Communist Party, which has been the most critical of the Kremlin, voted unanimously against Mr. Medvedev on Tuesday. Ahead of the vote, Just Russia also vowed that its members would vote no. But in a sign that not all were prepared to flout the ruling authorities, four members of the faction joined United Russia and the Liberal Democratic Party, a Kremlin-friendly opposition bloc, in voting for Mr. Medvedev. Just Russia announced later that it might expel those who broke ranks.For Mr. Medvedev, who has been struggling for relevance in the face of Mr. Putin’s return, Tuesday’s confirmation proceedings were his first opportunity to begin rebuilding political capital. In speeches before the vote, opposition members attacked his signature programs, accusing him of failing in his campaigns to modernize the country and fight corruption.Mr. Medvedev, who spent the session scribbling notes, said he would not respond to the criticism “because it would not be humane,” drawing laughs.“I’d like to say only that as prime minister, I will be open to all political forces,” he said.Mr. Putin, whose tolerance for dissent seems less abundant than Mr. Medvedev’s, was not as conciliatory. Taking the lectern for a final word, he admonished the critical parliamentarians for what he said were inaccuracies in their statements and delivered what appeared to be a veiled threat.“I am sure that the work of the government and the Parliament will be constructive despite the well-known opposition of some deputies in this hall,” he said.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','CAIRO — Truckloads of armed men attacked the Tripoli headquarters of Libya’s interim prime minister on Tuesday, in a new demonstration of the lawlessness pervading the capital just weeks before a scheduled national election.Officials of the interim Libyan government said that at least four people were killed, and news agencies reported that ambulances had rushed to the scene. The prime minister, Abdel Rahim el-Keeb, was reportedly away from the building at the time of the attack.The attackers were believed to be militiamen from the Nafusah Mountains southwest of the capital, who were demanding payment for their work in fighting the forces of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and securing the area after his defeat. The interim government recently suspended a plan to pay such fighters because of rampant corruption, prompting protests.Municipal elections in Tripoli that were planned for last Saturday were postponed until after the scheduled voting next month for a national assembly.Security in the capital is negligible, and gunfights between armed groups from rival neighborhoods or towns are a frequent occurrence in its streets. In recent weeks, one militia shot up the lobby of the luxury hotel that serves as the de facto headquarters of the governing Transitional National Council because of an argument over an unpaid hotel bill. Another militia kidnapped and later released two of the council’s members.“You know that security here is a big joke,” Fathi Baja, a council member, said at the time. With an antiaircraft gun mounted on a pickup truck, he said, “you can do whatever you want — nobody can stop you.”'"

"'12-05-08,'0','A senior Environmental Protection Agency chemist who argued that she was removed from her job in retaliation for accusing the agency of underestimating the toxicity of dust at ground zero has been reinstated with back pay by an administrative board.The federal Merit Systems Protection Board ruled late last week in Washington that the agency violated the due process rights of the chemist, Cate Jenkins, when she was fired in 2010 because she was not informed of all the charges against her.The panel also found that an administrative judge who first heard the case did not give her an adequate opportunity to make her case that she was dismissed for acting as a whistle-blower.Dr. Jenkins sued under the federal Whistle-Blower Protection Act, saying she was being punished for charging that the agency had relied on data that it knew mismeasured the pH levels of the dust released by the World Trade Center collapse in 2001.The E.P.A. has said that Dr. Jenkins was fired for charges related to threatening a supervisor.Dr. Jenkins had a history of disagreeing with her superiors on scientific matters at the agency and in 2009 underwent a two-day suspension for “discourteous, unprofessional and bullying” conduct toward colleagues.The board did not decide if the E.P.A. fired Dr. Jenkins for her accusations. Instead, it said she was not given a full opportunity for a defense because she was not informed of a third charge used to justify her removal.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','The chairman of the United States regulator that inspects audit firms — an agency that has been frustrated by its inability to review audits of Chinese companies that turned out to be frauds — said Tuesday that he expected that his staff would soon be able to sit in on Chinese inspections of auditors.“We ought to be able to observe the inspections they conduct in the late summer or fall, and certainly by the end of the year,” said James R. Doty, the chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, in an interview after he returned from China. He was a member of the United States delegation at the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.American law requires that the accounting oversight board inspect all auditing firms that certify the books of companies whose securities trade in public markets in the United States, but it has been unable to do that in many countries, including China.Mr. Doty said the board had a number of inspectors who spoke and read Chinese and could observe such inspections. He said the Chinese had suggested that the Americans observe the inspections and that he hoped that would lead to joint inspections, as required under American law.A year ago, the joint statement following the U.S.-China dialogue said: “The United States and China welcome continued dialogue between the bilateral competent authorities on the oversight of accounting firms providing audit services for public companies in the two countries, so as to enhance mutual trust and strive to reach agreement on cross-border oversight cooperation. Both countries agree to make joint efforts to accelerate the process.”'"

"'12-05-08,'0','Officials said Tuesday night that the risk to the agent and his relatives had now been “mitigated,” evidently by moving both him and his family to safe locations.But American intelligence officials were angry about the disclosure of the Qaeda plot, first reported Monday by The Associated Press, which had held the story for several days at the request of the C.I.A. They feared the leak would discourage foreign intelligence services from cooperating with the United States on risky missions in the future, said Representative , a New York Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.“We are talking about compromising methods and sources and causing our partners to be leery about working with us,” said Mr. King, who spoke with reporters about the plot on Monday night and Tuesday after he was briefed by counterterrorism officials. Mr. King, who called the bomb plot “one of the most tightly held operations I’ve seen in my years in the House,” said he was told that government officials planned to investigate the source of the original leak. The C.I.A. declined to comment.Intelligence officials believe that the explosive is the latest effort of the group’s skilled bomb maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri. Mr. Asiri is also believed to have designed the explosives used in the failed bombing attempt on an airliner over on Dec. 25, 2009, and packed into printer cartridges and placed on cargo planes in October 2010.A senior American official said the new device was sewn into “custom-fit” underwear and would have been very hard to detect even in a careful pat-down. Unlike the device used in the unsuccessful 2009 attack, this bomb could be detonated in two ways, in case one failed, the official said.The main charge was a high-grade military explosive that “undoubtedly would have brought down an aircraft,” the official said.Forensic experts at the F.B.I.’s bomb laboratory are assessing whether the bomb could have evaded screening machines and security measures revamped after the failed 2009 plot. One American official said the bureau’s initial analysis indicated that if updated security protocols designed to detect a wider range of possible threats were properly conducted, the measures “most likely would have detected” the device.On Tuesday, the repeated a security message previously sent to airlines and foreign governments. The security guidance notes that still intends to attack the United States, probably using commercial aviation, and warns T.S.A. agents to look out for explosives in cargo, concealed in clothing or surgically implanted, officials said.Over the past eight months, American counterterrorism officials have monitored with growing alarm a rising number of electronic intercepts and tips from informants suggesting that Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen has been ramping up plots to attack the United States.“There was increasing concern about the chatter, more and more intelligence” that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula “was moving with renewed energy to carry out some kind of attack against homeland, using airliners and concealed explosives,” said one senior administration official. Working with foreign allies, the Obama administration quietly tightened airport security.The ominous signs followed months of political chaos in Yemen during which the Qaeda branch and its militant allies seized effective control over large areas of the country, giving the terrorist group a broader base from which to plot attacks against both the Yemeni government and the United States.Senior American counterterrorism and military officials have expressed concern that Al Qaeda’s growing number of training camps, including small compounds, have churned out dozens of new fighters who, in turn, help expand the area under the insurgents’ control. Officials fear that the camps could also train Qaeda operatives for external operations against targets in and the United States.“Certainly when they hold terrain, it makes training more safe and secure than on disputed terrain; therefore, more and better training,” said one senior American military official.The Yemeni government’s control over the hinterlands southeast of the capital, Sana, has always been tenuous, but over the past year it has receded almost entirely. With the authorities focused on political turmoil in the capital, many soldiers fled their posts, and jihadists began asserting control.For more than a year the town of Jaar — along with several smaller settlements — has been controlled by militants who operate under the banner Ansar al-Sharia, which is variously described as a wing of Al Qaeda’s Yemeni branch or as an allied group.One prominent tribal mediator from Shabwa Province, reached Tuesday by phone, said Ansar al-Sharia controlled all the checkpoints on Yemen’s southern coast between Aden and Balhaf, and as far north as Ataq. On Monday, militants attacked several army bases and outposts in the south, killing 20 soldiers and capturing 25, The Associated Press reported. Local tribal figures described the attacks as revenge for the killing of Mr. Quso on Sunday.Control in the south often appears to be shared between militants, local tribes and members of the southern independence movement, which is largely secular. But Qaeda militants and their allies appear to operate freely even in areas they do not fully control, possibly including Aden, the south’s major city. Aden has become a bastion of open opposition to the government, with the flag of the independence movement — once rigidly banned — now flying from houses across the city.'"
"'12-05-08,'0','The model and television personality Heidi Klum is the face — and hair — of the Clear women’s line in the introductory campaign, which carries the theme “Feed scalp. Feed beauty.” The ad campaign is being created by Lowe & Partners in London, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and its American agency, Deutsch in New York. Another Interpublic agency, Weber Shandwick, is handling public relations.Clear represents the second time in six years that Unilever has tried to extend to the United States a hair-care brand that it sells successfully overseas. That previous effort, involving a brand named Sunsilk, flopped, even with a reintroduction in 2008, and Sunsilk is no longer available in American stores.There were “lessons learned” from the demise of Sunsilk in the United States, said Gina Boswell, executive vice president for personal care at the Unilever North America unit of Unilever in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.“The strength of the insight” about consumers’ hair-care needs, and “the strength of the science” behind the products are paramount, she said.“I often think, does the world need yet another hair-care brand?” Ms. Boswell said. The answer, in this instance, is yes, she added, because “70 million Americans have scalp concerns” and Clear offers product technology that she described as “revolutionary.”There are a couple of other reasons for the arrival of Clear onto American store shelves. One is that hair-care products, and other personal-care products like skin lotions and deodorants, are “a growth engine for global Unilever,” Ms. Boswell said. Last year the personal-care category grew to become Unilever’s largest. (The company also sells food products, detergents and oral-care products.)The other reason is that the hair-care category enjoys a distinction from most others in marketing: Consumers are more willing to try new products and switch brands rather than make rote purchases of familiar favorites.“This is a category where women are always looking for another way, a better way, to get the look they want,” said David Rubin, brand-building director for United States hair care at Unilever North America. “The quest to get that is never-ending.”The other side of that coin is that if the quest is seemingly never satisfied, consumers may be skeptical about a new brand’s claims.“It’s really important that the whole package delivers,” Mr. Rubin said, referring to the Clear brand premise that “a well-nourished scalp is the foundation for beautiful hair.”“The products are really great,” he added, “and when you use them, they’ll do what they say they’ll do.”In the introductory commercial, Ms. Klum declares, “For years, we’ve been searching for the foundation for strong, beautiful hair,” then tells viewers the answer is “a well-nourished scalp.” That will come, she says, courtesy of Clear, which delivers “stronger, more beautiful hair in just seven days.” Those points are reiterated in the print ads, which also feature Ms. Klum.Too often, such a sales angle “feels like marketing-speak,” said Helen Bell, chief operating officer at Lowe & Partners, but “this is a very different story we’re telling, telling women they need to feed their scalp.”“Scalp is skin, after all,” she added, and “what we’re trying to do is stop consumers in their tracks” and prod them to “pause, engage and think again” about hair-care purchases.There was “a huge amount of testing, a huge amount of research” at Unilever and Lowe to determine “the right way to bring this proposition to the U.S.,” Ms. Bell said. That included hiring Ms. Klum because she could offer “a lot of cut-through,” which means her appearances in the ads would cut through the category clutter.And cluttered the category is, with P. & G. brands like Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences and Aussie; L’Oréal brands like Vive and Garnier Fructis; John Frieda, from Kao Brands; and the numerous brands that Unilever already markets.“Obviously, Clear is coming into a very crowded market,” Ms. Bell said, but “this is a brand that has a strong difference.”Strong enough to avoid the fate of Sunsilk with American consumers? Only time will make it clear.'"

"'12-05-09,'0','(Reuters) - In the weeks before Chesapeake Energy CEO Aubrey McClendon was stripped of his chairmanship over his personal financial dealings, he arranged an additional $450 million loan from a longtime backer, according to a person familiar with the transaction.That loan, previously undisclosed, was made by investment-management firm EIG Global Energy Partners, which was at the same time helping arrange a major $1.25 billion round of financing for Chesapeake itself.The new loan brings the energy executive’s total financing from EIG since 2010 to $1.33 billion and his current balance due to $1.1 billion, this person said. It was secured by McClendon’s personal stakes in wells that have yet to be drilled by Chesapeake - and by his own life-insurance policy.A spokesman for McClendon declined to comment; a spokesman for Chesapeake didn’t respond to a request for comment.The latest insight into McClendon’s personal financial deals comes in the wake of an April 18 Reuters investigation that found McClendon had borrowed heavily against his interests in wells owned by Chesapeake, mostly from EIG.Last week, Reuters reported that McClendon had co-owned and actively invested in a $200 million hedge fund that bought and sold the same commodities produced by Chesapeake.An outcry over potential conflicts of interest in the loans prompted inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Internal Revenue Service. It also spurred Chesapeake’s board on May 1 to remove McClendon as chairman (though not as chief executive) and to declare an early end to a controversial perk at the center of the borrowings.All told, McClendon has taken out loans worth $1.55 billion since 2009 from EIG and other lenders to fund his participation in Chesapeake’s Founders Well Participation Program. That perk enables him to receive a stake of up to 2.5 percent in all the wells Chesapeake drills in return for shouldering the same percentage of the wells’ costs.The latest McClendon loan was arranged in late March through a McClendon-controlled company called Pelican Energy LLC, which was formed on March 6.The deal was initially intended to be significantly larger, up to $750 million, said the person familiar with the transaction. It was scaled back last week after the Chesapeake board announced the early end to the well-stake perk, which is now slated to conclude in June 2014.The newest financing for McClendon closed shortly before EIG joined with other investment firms and hedge funds, such as TPG Capital and Magnetar Capital, in purchasing preferred shares in a newly formed Chesapeake subsidiary that has an interest in some of the company’s wells. EIG invested $100 million in that deal, called CHK Cleveland Tonkawa, which raised $1.25 billion for Chesapeake.An EIG spokeswoman declined to comment on the newest loan or on concerns of some analysts over EIG’s dual role as a financier to Chesapeake and its CEO.In an April 23 letter to investors in two of EIG’s investment funds, EIG chief executive officer R. Blair Thomas said it is “simply untrue” that there was any conflict of interest in its loans to McClendon and dealings with Chesapeake.The Securities and Exchange Commission has opened an informal inquiry into Chesapeake’s well program and the transactions involving McClendon.In the letter, Thomas discussed two earlier loan deals that EIG had done with McClendon, involving McClendon-controlled entities called Larchmont Resources LLC and Jamestown Resources LLC. There was no mention in the letter of the financing deal completed in March to Pelican Energy.The person familiar with the deal said Pelican was not mentioned in the letter because EIG clients “already knew about Pelican” and the loan hasn’t been disbursed yet.This person added that when Pelican was launched, EIG sent a letter and “information packet” to clients advising them of the new financing and opening the loan vehicle up to investor participation.EIG, which spun out of the Los Angeles-based bond shop TCW in 2011, has $13 billion of assets under management.In the latest $450 million financing, EIG secured as collateral all the assets of Pelican Energy LLC. These include McClendon’s interests in wells Chesapeake might drill in 2013 and the first half of 2014. The EIG financing to Pelican will be used to enable McClendon to continue in the Chesapeake well program through June 2014.For years, McClendon used companies he controls, including Larchmont, Jamestown and Arcadia Resources LP, to hold his stakes in the Chesapeake wells.EIG funded Larchmont and Jamestown at $375 million and $500 million, respectively. EIG did not lend any money to Arcadia, which borrowed as much as $225 million in 2009.The investors in the EIG funds that lent to McClendon include U.S. public pension funds, foundations and wealthy investors in Europe and Australia.In his April 23 letter to clients, Thomas of EIG defended the two prior loans to McClendon, writing: “The crux of the story as it relates to EIG seems to be that we got too good a deal for our investors.”'"

"'12-05-09,'0','Mrs. Clinton’s intervention ultimately resulted in a second arrangement to allow Mr. Chen to study at but not to seek asylum, which the Chinese considered an affront. Under terms that have not been disclosed, Mr. Chen is expected to leave in days. The outcome, said several officials who recounted the story, reflected a maturing relationship now able to weather a fraught diplomatic entanglement. The officials would discuss diplomatic talks only on the condition of anonymity.“At a strategic level I think the two sides will quietly take some confidence from this,” a senior administration official said.The agreement came at the cost of what the officials said was considerable strain on both sides, and it could still fall apart, though Mr. Chen said Tuesday that the authorities had accepted his application to travel abroad. Yet the frenzied days and sleepless nights seem to have averted a major embarrassment for the administration and defused a crisis that threatened to upend relations between the two countries.Mr. Chen’s case highlighted what the Americans view as an intensifying struggle within the Chinese leadership between hard-liners and reformers. At one point during the talks, the State Department’s legal adviser, , encountered officials from China’s powerful Ministry of State Security arguing in the hallway with their counterparts from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, saying Mr. Chen should be punished, not coddled by the Americans.At the center of it was Mr. Chen, who after his harrowing escape from Chinese security officials and arrival at the embassy experienced wild mood swings — crying at times — even as he bargained with the cunning of the lawyer he had taught himself to be.Once released to the hospital, he used three preprogrammed cellphones provided by the Americans to press his demands in public. He did not want asylum, he said, but rather an investigation by Chinese central government authorities into his mistreatment.The use of technology — posts on , a dramatic call to a Congressional hearing — boxed in the Chinese but also left Americans scrambling. After speaking to his lawyer and his wife, Mr. Chen abruptly changed his mind and decided he could not stay in China. At that point the American officials were in the dark about his shift.“It took us a little while — we were already unbelievably exhausted — to find our bearings,” the senior administration official said of Mr. Chen’s change of heart. What complicated the diplomacy was the fact that the Chinese considered the very notion of negotiations over a Chinese citizen unacceptable. They refused to make any binding commitments to the Americans, exposing the administration to criticism once Mr. Chen left the embassy. Even now, there is no official agreement, but simply a series of “understandings.”One of the senior American officials likened it to the Communiqué, the 1972 agreement that opened the door to relations between the United States and China but artfully left ambiguous the status of ., who was first notified when Mr. Chen was already in the embassy, refused to comment on his fate, even when asked directly. That and Mrs. Clinton’s avoidance of his case in her meetings with China’s leaders gave the Chinese space to resolve the matter quietly.“Even if we had negotiated a text, which would have taken six months, the Chinese could have nullified it,” this official said. “Face is more important in Asian society than any contract.”The Americans knew Mr. Chen’s plight well. He was jailed in 2006 after helping villagers in Shandong Province sue the local authorities for subjecting women to forced abortions and sterilizations. After his release in 2010, the authorities kept him under a form of extralegal house arrest.Even so, the officials said they knew nothing of his preparations to escape from his farmhouse on the night of April 22.They learned of it only when  a rights advocate called the embassy three days later and told officials there that he was in hiding on the outskirts of Beijing, his foot broken from a fall during the escape.After a late-night meeting at the State Department on April 25, Mrs. Clinton approved a plan to spirit him into the embassy, an operation that involved hustling him from one car to another twice. “Everyone understood the magnitude of the decision, how unpredictable it was, and that there would be consequences,” the senior official said.With Mr. Chen inside the embassy, the administration held a series of meetings in Washington to decide how to manage the crisis — with the State Department leading the effort and the White House overseeing it through frequent secure videoconference calls. On April 27, Mr. Campbell informed the Chinese ambassador in Washington, Zhang Yesui, of Mr. Chen’s whereabouts. The diplomat appeared stunned.Mr. Campbell then flew to Beijing, where he joined Ambassador , who cut short a vacation in , and Mr. Koh, who happened to be in China for a conference, to form the American negotiating team. Mr. Koh had been waiting to board a Yangtze River when Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff, Cheryl D. Mills, ordered him to find a secure phone. The closest one turned out to be four hours away in the United States Consulate in .An already complicated situation became grave when an embassy doctor examined Mr. Chen. In addition to the broken foot from his escape, he complained of severe . His stool contained so much blood that the doctor feared he might have . That fueled the urgency to get him to a hospital.The talks with the Chinese began on April 29, and did not start well. “We had to go through the process of him just ripping into us,” the senior official said, referring to Mr. Cui, who complained that the United States had violated diplomatic practice.China’s negotiators suggested that they would cancel the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which was scheduled to begin four days later with the arrival of Mrs. Clinton and Secretary . The Americans, in turn, hinted that they, too, were prepared to walk away, hoping to use the prospect of constructive talks as leverage.Mr. Koh, who composed a memorandum that made the case for taking in Mr. Chen, proposed having him study at East China Normal University in Shanghai in a program sponsored by New York University. The Chinese objected, considering the program “too Western.” The Americans were soon holding parallels sets of talks, with Mr. Campbell meeting with the Chinese and Mr. Locke and Mr. Koh effectively negotiating with a mercurial Mr. Chen.All along, the officials said, Mr. Chen said that he did not want to leave China, but that he feared leaving the embassy. At one point, Mr. Koh asked him if he was prepared to spend 30 years there, evoking the experience of other famous dissidents, like of , and telling him about the travails of his own father, a diplomat, who fled for the United States in 1961.Despite initial resistance, the Chinese appeared willing to consider options for Mr. Chen. One official said they wanted to resolve the case in 36 hours. They did not object to the possibility of his studying at seven other universities in China, but bristled at the idea of an investigation and were offended when the Americans presented a list of 13 people, including Mr. Chen’s brother and nephew, whom they wanted to protect from harassment. (Some have since been released.)One Chinese official lashed out: “The whole thing could be resolved in 36 minutes, not 36 hours. Just turn him over.”Mr. Chen, though, wanted a gesture. The Chinese authorities arranged for Mr. Chen’s wife, Yuan Weijing, and their two children to travel by train to Beijing. The American deputy chief of mission, Mr. Wang, met them and offered his phone to allow Mrs. Yuan to make the call that the Chinese agent monitored.When Mr. Chen again hesitated, the Chinese indicated that they would send his family back, which critics have interpreted as a threat, saying it was conveyed to Mr. Chen by American officials effectively to coerce him to leave. Mr. Locke, Mr. Campbell and other officials have publicly denied that. Even so, one official acknowledged, “We told him very clearly that there was only so far we could go with assurances.”The arrangement, reached hours after Mrs. Clinton arrived in Beijing that Wednesday, fell apart immediately. In the car, Mr. Chen called a lawyer, Teng Biao, who told him it was a mistake to leave the embassy. “No, no, I want to do this,” Mr. Chen replied, according to a person in the car. “It’s a good deal.”The scene at the hospital quickly became confused. The Chinese did not object to allowing an American diplomat to stay overnight, contrary to reports that prompted the criticism. As with much of the story, the moment turned less on geopolitics than on human relations. The diplomat, in fact, left because he believed that Mr. Chen wanted privacy with his wife.Thursday was chaotic, as reports that the agreement had fallen apart led Republican critics to castigate the administration. At the hospital, Mr. Chen underwent lengthy examinations, preventing the Americans from contacting him directly. Doctors found that he was suffering not from , but from .In her meeting with Mr. Dai, the foreign policy official, on Friday, Mrs. Clinton never explicitly asked for anything. She made it clear, however, that she would have to speak about Mr. Chen when she appeared before the press. The subtlety worked: within hours, the Chinese released a statement that Mr. Chen could travel to study abroad like any citizen, and the State Department announced that it would expedite any request for a visa.As one official put it, “The days of blowing up the relationship over a single guy are over.”'"
"'12-05-09,'0','The chairman of the United States regulator that inspects audit firms — an agency that has been frustrated by its inability to review audits of Chinese companies that turned out to be frauds — said Tuesday that he expected that his staff would soon be able to sit in on Chinese inspections of auditors.“We ought to be able to observe the inspections they conduct in the late summer or fall, and certainly by the end of the year,” said James R. Doty, the chairman of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, in an interview after he returned from China. He was a member of the United States delegation at the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue.American law requires that the accounting oversight board inspect all auditing firms that certify the books of companies whose securities trade in public markets in the United States, but it has been unable to do that in many countries, including China.Mr. Doty said the board had a number of inspectors who spoke and read Chinese and could observe such inspections. He said the Chinese had suggested that the Americans observe the inspections and that he hoped that would lead to joint inspections, as required under American law.A year ago, the joint statement following the U.S.-China dialogue said: “The United States and China welcome continued dialogue between the bilateral competent authorities on the oversight of accounting firms providing audit services for public companies in the two countries, so as to enhance mutual trust and strive to reach agreement on cross-border oversight cooperation. Both countries agree to make joint efforts to accelerate the process.”'"
"'12-05-09,'0','A senior Environmental Protection Agency chemist who argued that she was removed from her job in retaliation for accusing the agency of underestimating the toxicity of dust at ground zero has been reinstated with back pay by an administrative board.The federal Merit Systems Protection Board ruled late last week in Washington that the agency violated the due process rights of the chemist, Cate Jenkins, when she was fired in 2010 because she was not informed of all the charges against her.The panel also found that an administrative judge who first heard the case did not give her an adequate opportunity to make her case that she was dismissed for acting as a whistle-blower.Dr. Jenkins sued under the federal Whistle-Blower Protection Act, saying she was being punished for charging that the agency had relied on data that it knew mismeasured the pH levels of the dust released by the World Trade Center collapse in 2001.The E.P.A. has said that Dr. Jenkins was fired for charges related to threatening a supervisor.Dr. Jenkins had a history of disagreeing with her superiors on scientific matters at the agency and in 2009 underwent a two-day suspension for “discourteous, unprofessional and bullying” conduct toward colleagues.The board did not decide if the E.P.A. fired Dr. Jenkins for her accusations. Instead, it said she was not given a full opportunity for a defense because she was not informed of a third charge used to justify her removal.'"
"'12-05-09,'0','YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader, received her first passport in 24 years on Tuesday ahead of a planned trip to Norway and Britain.An aide to Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, Htin Kyaw, said the passport was received from the Home Ministry.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi applied for the passport after recent political changes that culminated in her election to Parliament last month. Last year, a long-ruling military junta handed over power to an elected, nominally civilian government. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, which won 43 seats in the April by-elections, will lead the small opposition bloc.The passport is valid for three years. She has not had one since she returned to Myanmar from Britain in 1988 to take care of her ailing mother, and was required by law then to hand it in.After becoming leader of the country’s pro-democracy movement, she was put under house arrest for 15 of the next 22 years of military rule. Her confinement kept her from attending the ceremony in Norway at which she was awarded the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize. She plans to visit the country in June.During intermittent periods of freedom, she declined opportunities to go abroad for fear she would not be allowed to re-enter Myanmar and so did not visit her British husband, Michael Aris, before he died in 1999. They last saw each other in 1995, after which the junta denied him a visa.'"
"'12-05-09,'0','Mr. de Blasio, in an interview on Tuesday, spoke far more critically. While he described the stop-and-frisk practice as a “valid tool,” he said its increasing use has been “corrosive” to community relations with the police, a development that he said has undermined public safety.“We can’t have the social fabric continuing to be torn,” Mr. de Blasio said, adding that the high number of stops, particularly among young black and Latino residents, has made many New Yorkers uncomfortable and distrustful of the police officers who patrol their neighborhoods.“It’s breaking down something very fundamental here,” Mr. de Blasio added.Two other possible candidates for mayor, Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, and John C. Liu, the comptroller, have also been critical of the stop-and-frisk practice.The Police Department, along with the mayor, has vociferously defended the tactic, saying it has helped reduce the city’s crime rate to record lows. “New York City continues to be the safest big city in America, and one of the safest of any size, with significantly less crime per capita than even small cities,” a police spokesman, Paul J. Browne, wrote in an e-mail on Tuesday.As a political issue, stop-and-frisk can be potent because “it’s illustrative and symbolic of mayoral candidates’ attitudes toward the Police Department’s relationship to the community,” said Scott Levenson, a Democratic political consultant who is not working for any of next year’s potential mayoral contenders.But there can also be an electoral calculus afoot. Political strategists say they believe that Mr. de Blasio’s path to City Hall is likely to require the support of black and Latino residents, who have been more critical of the stop-and-frisk practice, whereas Ms. Quinn may be more dependent on the votes of working- and middle-class whites, who are shown in polls to be less bothered about the policy.“It’s sad but important to note that the candidates’ policies often reflect the makeup of the folks they are trying to persuade,” Mr. Levenson said.The public advocate’s proposal, which he plans to describe on the steps of City Hall, calls for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to request an internal audit by the Police Department of its statistics on what occurs after each stop-and-frisk episode — for instance, whether an arrest was made.Mr. de Blasio said he wanted to ensure that all stops were warranted and based on reasonable suspicion on the part of the officer, and wanted statistics to be released to the public each week. Currently, the numbers are reported to the City Council every three months.Mr. de Blasio also criticized Mr. Bloomberg directly, saying the mayor “has ducked ownership” of the topic. “He has deferred to the police commissioner,” he said. “It’s time for him to assert his authority and change direction.”'"
"'12-05-09,'0','The model and television personality Heidi Klum is the face — and hair — of the Clear women’s line in the introductory campaign, which carries the theme “Feed scalp. Feed beauty.” The ad campaign is being created by Lowe & Partners in London, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, and its American agency, Deutsch in New York. Another Interpublic agency, Weber Shandwick, is handling public relations.Clear represents the second time in six years that Unilever has tried to extend to the United States a hair-care brand that it sells successfully overseas. That previous effort, involving a brand named Sunsilk, flopped, even with a reintroduction in 2008, and Sunsilk is no longer available in American stores.There were “lessons learned” from the demise of Sunsilk in the United States, said Gina Boswell, executive vice president for personal care at the Unilever North America unit of Unilever in Englewood Cliffs, N.J.“The strength of the insight” about consumers’ hair-care needs, and “the strength of the science” behind the products are paramount, she said.“I often think, does the world need yet another hair-care brand?” Ms. Boswell said. The answer, in this instance, is yes, she added, because “70 million Americans have scalp concerns” and Clear offers product technology that she described as “revolutionary.”There are a couple of other reasons for the arrival of Clear onto American store shelves. One is that hair-care products, and other personal-care products like skin lotions and deodorants, are “a growth engine for global Unilever,” Ms. Boswell said. Last year the personal-care category grew to become Unilever’s largest. (The company also sells food products, detergents and oral-care products.)The other reason is that the hair-care category enjoys a distinction from most others in marketing: Consumers are more willing to try new products and switch brands rather than make rote purchases of familiar favorites.“This is a category where women are always looking for another way, a better way, to get the look they want,” said David Rubin, brand-building director for United States hair care at Unilever North America. “The quest to get that is never-ending.”The other side of that coin is that if the quest is seemingly never satisfied, consumers may be skeptical about a new brand’s claims.“It’s really important that the whole package delivers,” Mr. Rubin said, referring to the Clear brand premise that “a well-nourished scalp is the foundation for beautiful hair.”“The products are really great,” he added, “and when you use them, they’ll do what they say they’ll do.”In the introductory commercial, Ms. Klum declares, “For years, we’ve been searching for the foundation for strong, beautiful hair,” then tells viewers the answer is “a well-nourished scalp.” That will come, she says, courtesy of Clear, which delivers “stronger, more beautiful hair in just seven days.” Those points are reiterated in the print ads, which also feature Ms. Klum.Too often, such a sales angle “feels like marketing-speak,” said Helen Bell, chief operating officer at Lowe & Partners, but “this is a very different story we’re telling, telling women they need to feed their scalp.”“Scalp is skin, after all,” she added, and “what we’re trying to do is stop consumers in their tracks” and prod them to “pause, engage and think again” about hair-care purchases.There was “a huge amount of testing, a huge amount of research” at Unilever and Lowe to determine “the right way to bring this proposition to the U.S.,” Ms. Bell said. That included hiring Ms. Klum because she could offer “a lot of cut-through,” which means her appearances in the ads would cut through the category clutter.And cluttered the category is, with P. & G. brands like Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Herbal Essences and Aussie; L’Oréal brands like Vive and Garnier Fructis; John Frieda, from Kao Brands; and the numerous brands that Unilever already markets.“Obviously, Clear is coming into a very crowded market,” Ms. Bell said, but “this is a brand that has a strong difference.”Strong enough to avoid the fate of Sunsilk with American consumers? Only time will make it clear.'"
"'12-05-09,'0','Officials said Tuesday night that the risk to the agent and his relatives had now been “mitigated,” evidently by moving both him and his family to safe locations.But American intelligence officials were angry about the disclosure of the Qaeda plot, first reported Monday by The Associated Press, which had held the story for several days at the request of the C.I.A. They feared the leak would discourage foreign intelligence services from cooperating with the United States on risky missions in the future, said Representative , a New York Republican and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee.“We are talking about compromising methods and sources and causing our partners to be leery about working with us,” said Mr. King, who spoke with reporters about the plot on Monday night and Tuesday after he was briefed by counterterrorism officials. Mr. King, who called the bomb plot “one of the most tightly held operations I’ve seen in my years in the House,” said he was told that government officials planned to investigate the source of the original leak. The C.I.A. declined to comment.Intelligence officials believe that the explosive is the latest effort of the group’s skilled bomb maker, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri. Mr. Asiri is also believed to have designed the explosives used in the failed bombing attempt on an airliner over on Dec. 25, 2009, and packed into printer cartridges and placed on cargo planes in October 2010.A senior American official said the new device was sewn into “custom-fit” underwear and would have been very hard to detect even in a careful pat-down. Unlike the device used in the unsuccessful 2009 attack, this bomb could be detonated in two ways, in case one failed, the official said.The main charge was a high-grade military explosive that “undoubtedly would have brought down an aircraft,” the official said.Forensic experts at the F.B.I.’s bomb laboratory are assessing whether the bomb could have evaded screening machines and security measures revamped after the failed 2009 plot. One American official said the bureau’s initial analysis indicated that if updated security protocols designed to detect a wider range of possible threats were properly conducted, the measures “most likely would have detected” the device.On Tuesday, the repeated a security message previously sent to airlines and foreign governments. The security guidance notes that still intends to attack the United States, probably using commercial aviation, and warns T.S.A. agents to look out for explosives in cargo, concealed in clothing or surgically implanted, officials said.Over the past eight months, American counterterrorism officials have monitored with growing alarm a rising number of electronic intercepts and tips from informants suggesting that Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen has been ramping up plots to attack the United States.“There was increasing concern about the chatter, more and more intelligence” that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula “was moving with renewed energy to carry out some kind of attack against homeland, using airliners and concealed explosives,” said one senior administration official. Working with foreign allies, the Obama administration quietly tightened airport security.The ominous signs followed months of political chaos in Yemen during which the Qaeda branch and its militant allies seized effective control over large areas of the country, giving the terrorist group a broader base from which to plot attacks against both the Yemeni government and the United States.Senior American counterterrorism and military officials have expressed concern that Al Qaeda’s growing number of training camps, including small compounds, have churned out dozens of new fighters who, in turn, help expand the area under the insurgents’ control. Officials fear that the camps could also train Qaeda operatives for external operations against targets in and the United States.“Certainly when they hold terrain, it makes training more safe and secure than on disputed terrain; therefore, more and better training,” said one senior American military official.The Yemeni government’s control over the hinterlands southeast of the capital, Sana, has always been tenuous, but over the past year it has receded almost entirely. With the authorities focused on political turmoil in the capital, many soldiers fled their posts, and jihadists began asserting control.For more than a year the town of Jaar — along with several smaller settlements — has been controlled by militants who operate under the banner Ansar al-Sharia, which is variously described as a wing of Al Qaeda’s Yemeni branch or as an allied group.One prominent tribal mediator from Shabwa Province, reached Tuesday by phone, said Ansar al-Sharia controlled all the checkpoints on Yemen’s southern coast between Aden and Balhaf, and as far north as Ataq. On Monday, militants attacked several army bases and outposts in the south, killing 20 soldiers and capturing 25, The Associated Press reported. Local tribal figures described the attacks as revenge for the killing of Mr. Quso on Sunday.Control in the south often appears to be shared between militants, local tribes and members of the southern independence movement, which is largely secular. But Qaeda militants and their allies appear to operate freely even in areas they do not fully control, possibly including Aden, the south’s major city. Aden has become a bastion of open opposition to the government, with the flag of the independence movement — once rigidly banned — now flying from houses across the city.'"
"'12-05-09,'0','This could be due in part to the results of December parliamentary elections, which gave opposition parties their largest number of seats in years. United Russia, the governing party created by Mr. Putin and now led by Mr. Medvedev, lost its constitutional majority, and while it still managed to hang on to half of Parliament’s 450 seats, its popularity has been further eroded by accusations of widespread electoral fraud.But opposition parties, which for years have served at the Kremlin’s behest, have been largely restrained in their dissent so far. Their leaders, for instance, have kept their distance from a protest movement that has inspired tens of thousands to take to the streets in Moscow against Mr. Putin, though some party members have taken an active role.This appears to be changing slowly. After a large protest on Sunday turned violent and the police unleashed a broad crackdown on public dissent, Gennady A. Zyuganov, the long-serving leader of Russia’s Communist Party, vocally defended the demonstrators and blamed the authorities for aggravating what he said was a growing split in society in their attempt “to shut everyone’s mouths with a police baton.”The Communist Party, which has been the most critical of the Kremlin, voted unanimously against Mr. Medvedev on Tuesday. Ahead of the vote, Just Russia also vowed that its members would vote no. But in a sign that not all were prepared to flout the ruling authorities, four members of the faction joined United Russia and the Liberal Democratic Party, a Kremlin-friendly opposition bloc, in voting for Mr. Medvedev. Just Russia announced later that it might expel those who broke ranks.For Mr. Medvedev, who has been struggling for relevance in the face of Mr. Putin’s return, Tuesday’s confirmation proceedings were his first opportunity to begin rebuilding political capital. In speeches before the vote, opposition members attacked his signature programs, accusing him of failing in his campaigns to modernize the country and fight corruption.Mr. Medvedev, who spent the session scribbling notes, said he would not respond to the criticism “because it would not be humane,” drawing laughs.“I’d like to say only that as prime minister, I will be open to all political forces,” he said.Mr. Putin, whose tolerance for dissent seems less abundant than Mr. Medvedev’s, was not as conciliatory. Taking the lectern for a final word, he admonished the critical parliamentarians for what he said were inaccuracies in their statements and delivered what appeared to be a veiled threat.“I am sure that the work of the government and the Parliament will be constructive despite the well-known opposition of some deputies in this hall,” he said.'"
"'12-05-09,'0','CAIRO — Truckloads of armed men attacked the Tripoli headquarters of Libya’s interim prime minister on Tuesday, in a new demonstration of the lawlessness pervading the capital just weeks before a scheduled national election.Officials of the interim Libyan government said that at least four people were killed, and news agencies reported that ambulances had rushed to the scene. The prime minister, Abdel Rahim el-Keeb, was reportedly away from the building at the time of the attack.The attackers were believed to be militiamen from the Nafusah Mountains southwest of the capital, who were demanding payment for their work in fighting the forces of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi and securing the area after his defeat. The interim government recently suspended a plan to pay such fighters because of rampant corruption, prompting protests.Municipal elections in Tripoli that were planned for last Saturday were postponed until after the scheduled voting next month for a national assembly.Security in the capital is negligible, and gunfights between armed groups from rival neighborhoods or towns are a frequent occurrence in its streets. In recent weeks, one militia shot up the lobby of the luxury hotel that serves as the de facto headquarters of the governing Transitional National Council because of an argument over an unpaid hotel bill. Another militia kidnapped and later released two of the council’s members.“You know that security here is a big joke,” Fathi Baja, a council member, said at the time. With an antiaircraft gun mounted on a pickup truck, he said, “you can do whatever you want — nobody can stop you.”'"

"'12-05-09,'0','This was a surprisingly intimate and affecting outcome for a show that has quite quickly, and quite inadvertently, become a cynic’s preserve. “The Voice” began life as a righter of wrongs — the wrongs of “American Idol,” the wrongs of discrimination based on looks and, last season, the wrongs of homogeneity, especially in regard to sexual orientation.But “The Voice” is, stealthily, an endorsement of the old way of doing things. Contestants may be chosen for their voices, but they are screened. And then, in the later rounds, they are voted on and eliminated like singers on any old competition show. The show’s amateurism is also a myth: this year each of the four finalists was a professional through and through. Chris Mann, from Christina Aguilera’s team, was a classically trained opera singer who had worked with the trad-pop swami David Foster; Mr. Green’s pick Juliet Simms fronted a band, Automatic Loveletter, that was signed to Epic; and Tony Lucca, Adam Levine’s selection, had been a member of “The Mickey Mouse Club” in his teenage years. (Last year’s top two finalists were pros too. Both Javier Colon, the winner, and Dia Frampton, the runner-up, were onetime major label artists, albeit only moderately successful ones.)Of the four only Ms. Simms actually fills a need in the marketplace: There are few female singers in hard rock (outside Christian rock, that is), and she’s a worthy one. For much of the season she was lost in a late-1960s Janis Joplin haze, both powerful and spacey. For her troubles she came in second and was saddled with performing alongside the charmless hip-hop exoskeleton Flo Rida on Tuesday’s finale show.The savagely dull soft rocker Mr. Lucca was an apt pairing with Mr. Levine, himself something of a pillow. Mr. Mann’s humility about the size of his voice rang consistently false. For him this show was less an opportunity to sing pop songs operatically than to sing them stiffly, a desire that’s disproportionately rewarded on televised singing competitions. (I asked Zachary Woolfe, who writes about classical music for The New York Times, for thoughts on Mr. Mann’s bona fides. “Not as rich and complex as you want an operatic voice to be,” he said. “And he tends flat.”)And even Mr. Paul, who is a nimble R&B singer with a flexible and sometimes thrilling tone, still doesn’t have a crisp identity. All season he was blank down to his look: clean-cut and clean-shaven (including his head), as if to not attract notice.Unlike “American Idol” — particularly this season — which can hit a snail’s pace midseason as singers are picked off one by one, often too slowly, “The Voice” operates at warp speed. Its need for balance and parity among the four teams often means that strong singers are ousted well before their time because they ended up on a team with stiff competition. This creates a field of good, even great singers, who, were they on “Idol,” would last longer and imprint more deeply, but here are collateral damage. As a result this competition can feel stakes-less and arbitrary.That the soulful rocker Jamar Rogers from Mr. Green’s team wasn’t in the finale had more to do with one poor song choice in the semifinal round than anything else; he could have easily outsung any of the finalists. He’s perhaps the most modern singer to have appeared on a reality competition; he should find a safe landing place following this show. Plenty of other impressive talents were gone before the finals: the soaring gospel-soul singer Jesse Campbell, cut by Ms. Aguilera, seemingly for impertinence; the lithe-voiced balladeer Katrina Parker; the wispy blue-eyed soul crooner James Massone; the teenage country singer RaeLynn, all honky-tonk spunk and grown-up attitude; and Lindsey Pavao, who landed a spot on the show with an outrageously odd and smoky version of Trey Songz’s “Say Aah.”Because the level of talent is so high on “The Voice,” each week’s elimination is a shocker, and therefore none are shockers. Perhaps that’s why ratings this season were a disappointment, dropping throughout the season. After the initial thrill of the blind auditions, which emphasize fairness and hope, the later rounds can be like “The Hunger Games,” brutal and off-putting, with little time to get attached to favorites before they’re axed. That environment demands some cutthroat decisions, which means Mr. Paul most likely won this show long before Tuesday’s finale.'"

She has denied the charges, and the West has condemned the verdict as politically motivated.'"
"'12-05-10,'1','The federal authorities said Wednesday that they planned to sue Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County and his office over claims of civil rights violations, including the racial profiling of Latinos. The Justice Department has been seeking an agreement requiring the sheriff’s office to train officers in how to make constitutional traffic stops, collect data on people arrested in traffic stops and reach out to Latinos to assure them that the department is there also to protect them. Sheriff Arpaio has denied the claims of racial profiling and has said that allowing a court monitor would mean that every policy decision would have to be cleared through an observer and would nullify his authority. Justice officials told a lawyer for the sheriff on April 3 that his refusal of a court-appointed monitor was a deal-breaker that would end settlement negotiations and result in a federal lawsuit. A “notice of intent to file civil action” came Wednesday from Thomas Perez, an assistant attorney general, in a letter to a lawyer for the sheriff.'"
"'12-05-10,'1','On Wednesday, the civil liberties group released its analysis of last year’s record number of street stops, providing a trove of statistics for prospective mayoral candidates eager to distinguish themselves from the policing tactics of the Bloomberg era.The analysis indicated that young black and Hispanic men continued to be stopped by the police in disproportionate numbers. Though they are only 4.7 percent of the city’s population, black and Latino males between the ages of 14 and 24 accounted for 41.6 percent of stops in 2011.The city’s public advocate, Bill de Blasio, cited the analysis on the steps of City Hall on Wednesday to criticize the effectiveness of street stops, and called on the mayor to order a reduction in the number of them. Comptroller John C. Liu said in a statement that the practice of street stops “should be abolished.” And the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, reiterated his belief that street stops were causing a rift in the relationship between the police and the city’s black and Latino residents.Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor, responded to Mr. Liu’s assessment with a post on Twitter: “A race to the left and a return to high crime.” To Mr. de Blasio, Mr. Wolfson said in a statement, “We will not continue to be the safest big city in America if Mr. de Blasio has his way.”Amid the criticism of stop-and-frisk encounters, three criminologists from George Mason University claimed in a recent academic study that street stops were concentrated on specific streets where crime was occurring.While the paper did not endorse street stops and noted that they may have “negative consequences for police legitimacy,” it provided empirical evidence to support the police’s assertion that street stops closely tracked criminal occurrences, a point that critics of the practice have often dismissed. One of the paper’s authors, David Weisburd, said that while critics had described street stops as being conducted in sweeps across entire neighborhoods, they were actually more geographically precise, occurring on some streets but skipping others in the same area.“There are many streets in what you would ordinarily think of as high-crime areas that don’t have stop-and-frisks,” Mr. Weisburd said.Mr. Weisburd and his co-authors, Cody W. Telep and Brian A. Lawton, received access to crime incident data that the Police Department does not release publicly.'"
"'12-05-10,'1','The very riskiness of what Mr. Obama did — some commentators were invoking Lyndon B. Johnson’s embrace of civil rights in 1964, with all the attendant political perils — made it hard to understate the historic significance of what took place at the White House on Wednesday.“If you are one of those who care about this issue, you will not forget where you were when you saw the president deliver those remarks,” said Chad Griffin, the incoming president of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy group. “Regardless of how old you are, it’s the first time you have ever seen a president of the United States look into a camera and say that a gay person should be treated equally under the law. The message that that sends, to a young gay or transgender  person struggling to come out, is life changing.”It also was a reminder of just how quickly public and political attitudes are changing. The first organizers of the modern gay-rights movement, after the June 1969 raid on the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village in New York City, considered themselves bold in hoping they could pass nondiscrimination acts. They did not seriously contemplate a day when members of the same sex would be permitted to marry.It has been only 16 years since Bill Clinton — the second Democratic presidential candidate to campaign before a gay audience at an event open to the news media — signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as the union of a man and a woman, permitting states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages conducted in other states.Mr. Clinton advocated the bill in the midst of a re-election campaign after his aides concluded that opposing it might be risky. Mr. Clinton has since said he regrets that decision; Mr. Obama instructed his Justice Department not to defend the act.In some ways, Mr. Obama is late to the party. Mr. Biden was just the latest prominent Democrat to announce his support, and many now say that it seems unthinkable that by 2016 any serious Democratic presidential candidate would oppose gay marriage. A series of significant Republican figures — Ken Mehlman, the former Republican Party chairman, Theodore Olson, who was solicitor general under Mr. Bush — have also been active in pushing gay marriage.The North Carolina vote in some ways distracts from what polling shows to be a steady increase in the percentage of Americans who say they support gay marriage or domestic partnerships; it is now a majority. The numbers are particularly high among younger Americans, suggesting that this is a wave likelier to grow than to recede.All of which suggests that there are, in addition to the risks, clear potential upsides for Mr. Obama. His announcement, while symbolic rather than carrying the force of law, could energize big parts of his base, particularly younger voters, and reassure liberal Democrats who had been disappointed with Mr. Obama on this issue. It will no doubt help with gay people, already among his biggest donors.And Mr. Obama’s announcement came as Mr. Romney has been seeking to shift to the middle; independent voters and women are two constituencies that tend to support gay marriage. Now, though, he is almost certainly going to face pressure from his base to take the fight on gay marriage to Mr. Obama.“President Obama has now made the definition of marriage a defining issue in the presidential contest, especially in swing states like Ohio, North Carolina, Virginia, Florida and Nevada,” said Brian S. Brown, the president of the National Organization for Marriage.In truth, Republicans and Democrats are hardly sure whether this will be a deciding issue in any state, given how pressing economic concerns are, particularly in the swing states.Polls show that gay marriage is not a huge concern to swing voters. Is Mr. Romney really going to want to spend the next five months talking about gay marriage, rather than the economy and jobs? And Mr. Obama may be no more eager to discuss the issue further, to be drawn into the weeds of this argument.Yet perhaps on this day, short-term political calculations are not what people are likely to recall in talking about Mr. Obama’s interview in years to come.“I don’t think it’s about particular states or particular demographics,” said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist.“He said the right thing,” he said. “He did the right thing. People are going to overanalyze the politics of this.”'"
"'12-05-10,'1','WASHINGTON (AP) — Wholesalers increased their stockpiles more slowly in March than in the prior month after a smaller growth in sales.The Commerce Department said Wednesday that wholesale stockpiles increased 0.3 percent in March from February, just one-third of the previous monthly increase. Monthly sales rose 0.5 percent in March, about half the gain from the previous month.Growth in restocking has slowed this year from the end of last year, contributing less to economic growth in the January-March quarter.It would take about five weeks to exhaust all wholesale stockpiles at the March sales pace. That is considered a healthy time frame and suggests that businesses will keep restocking to meet demand.Inventories are expected to keep growing this year. But the gains are not expected to be anywhere near the level reported at the end of last year.'"

"'12-05-10,'1','In a case predating the new law that nevertheless illustrates the fraud risk in such offerings, the S.E.C. recently charged a California man with violations of antifraud laws for promising to sell stakes to investors in technology start-ups — the “next Google.” Benedict Van of San Jose settled charges with the agency without admitting or denying guilt. Mr. Van was censured by the agency, which did not require him to pay back $7 million solicited from investors because he had spent it all on operating expenses and rent.Lou Straney, an instructor for certified fraud examiners, said he worried that retirees struggling to increase their incomes would fall prey to swindlers offering investments in start-ups. “This is incredibly dangerous,” said Mr. Straney. “Fraudsters will seize on this and try to sell promissory notes based on growth from fictitious companies.”Mr. Straney, who also investigates investment misconduct and fraud, said that in recent years promissory notes had dominated the list of swindles involving retirees. The premise is simple: a broker or adviser offers a high-yield note that could be linked to anything from a commodity to a life-insurance settlement. Once they have received a few million dollars from investors, they stop selling the notes, close their operations and disappear.Much of what propels retirees to take more risk is the search for yield. With all insured vehicles and short-term bonds still returning in the low single digits, millions of investors are tempted to chase products with higher returns. That may lead them into high-fee products that pay brokers from 2 to 10 percent in commissions, Mr. Straney said.News headlines also inspire fraud merchants to act. Whenever the price of a commodity soars, that creates an increased opportunity to sell investments. Two of the top investor traps seen by the North American Securities Administrators Association, a state regulators group, involved energy or gold and other precious metals.Some energy investments, for example, falsely promise to garner a share of profits from untapped oil and gas reserves. Precious-metals swindles have long relied upon special coins, stakes in dormant mines and new extraction equipment to hook unsuspecting investors.Even bad news attracts swindlers. Distressed real estate schemes have been common following the housing downturn. Foreclosed properties sold as investment pools are linked to promissory notes. In one Florida swindle last year, $2.3 million was solicited from investors to buy, refurbish and resell properties. The operator of the swindle later pleaded guilty to fraud.Protecting retirees from investment fraud requires a comprehensive effort. The Investor Protection Trust, along with other groups, has urged families to engage professionals to monitor and intervene when financial fraud is suspected.Part of a family intervention involves regular conversations with retired family members and friends. Are they being solicited for investments? What kinds of pitches are they receiving? Are the solicitors asking for Social Security numbers or bank account information? Those are glaring red flags.Many swindles involve outright identity theft or phishing, where personal information is used for such thievery as emptying bank accounts or stealing tax refunds.It is worthwhile to ask health care and legal professionals serving older investors to stay alert for any telltale signs of fraud and to report them to authorities. While victims are reluctant to talk about their misfortune once they have been cheated, they often boast of being offered superior returns while the swindle is unfolding.Due diligence is also essential. If any offer of abnormally high return is received, have it checked out by an independent third party, like a certified public accountant, chartered financial analyst or fee-only certified financial planner. Most responsible advisers are also fiduciaries, meaning they are legally responsible for representing a client’s interests above their own.Typically, inquiries like “How are outsized returns produced?” or “Can I see audited financial statements of a company making an offering?” can stop operators at the initial pitch. While any statement or document can be falsified, if the sellers evade a barrage of detailed questions, that is a good sign that they are not legitimate.The backgrounds of brokers and advisers should also be checked. State securities regulators will tell if brokers or advisers are registered and what is in their background files, like previous lawsuits or criminal charges. See the site nasaa.org for a list of regulators.With regulators and other watchdogs constantly outnumbered by would-be swindlers, the onus is on investors and their families to vet any potential vehicle. With more eyes on investors, many swindles can be avoided.'"

"'12-05-10,'1','A federal advisory panel recommended approval on Wednesday of a rheumatoid arthritis pill that could offer patients an alternative to the injectable medicines already on the market, but several members expressed concern about safety and urged the Food and Drug Administration to require rigorous follow-up studies.The arthritis advisory committee voted 8 to 2 that the drug, known as tofacitinib, offered enough benefits to overcome potential safety risks, including higher rates of lymphoma and other cancers and serious infections. The agency, which is scheduled to decide on approval by August, usually — but not always — follows the advice of advisory committees.Pfizer, which is developing tofacitinib, has hailed the drug as one of its most promising prospects as the company works to regain sales after its blockbuster cholesterol drug, Lipitor, lost its patent protection last year.If the drug is approved, it could prove to be a potent competitor to Humira, a drug made by Abbott that brought in nearly $2 billion in sales during the first quarter of this year.During Pfizer’s presentation to the panel, company officials said the drug’s safety risks were comparable to those of rheumatoid arthritis drugs already on the market. But an F.D.A. reviewer said his analysis showed that cancer rates in the study seemed to increase in higher doses of the drug and over time. It was these safety concerns that led two of the committee members to vote against approval.'"
"'12-05-10,'1','“We don’t have faith in the U.S. government being able to reconcile this,” Mr. Bergdahl said.Although Sergeant Bergdahl’s captivity has long been publicly known, the family had kept the prisoner exchange negotiations secret at the urging of the Obama administration and out of fear that their son might be harmed. But the Taliban suspended talks in March in large part because of their frustration with what they see as Washington’s dragging its feet over the exchange.American officials counter that the Taliban have not agreed to a major American demand: a travel ban intended to keep the transferred detainees from leaving Qatar and returning to the battlefields of Afghanistan or insurgent havens in Pakistan.Mr. Bergdahl, who said he wanted to bring more attention to his son’s plight and pressure the administration to revive the negotiations, decided to go public after a P.O.W. group asked him to speak in Washington during the coming Memorial Day weekend. “The rhetoric is that ‘We don’t negotiate with terrorists,’ ” Mr. Bergdahl said in the interview, describing political talk in Washington. “And therefore what do we do? Well, you push it hard with everything you have.”The talks encompass not only the prisoner exchange but also broader issues aimed at bringing the war to an end. Pentagon officials said in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, after Mr. Bergdahl’s comments became public, that they sympathized with the parents’ anguish and that they were working hard to gain Sergeant Bergdahl’s release, although they declined to offer details. “If they’re angry and/or frustrated, that’s certainly understandable,” said Col. David Lapan, a spokesman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “I would say our leaders are frustrated as well.”The Times learned late last year that Sergeant Bergdahl was part of the negotiations, but agreed to withhold the information at the request of the administration and his family over concerns for his safety. On Wednesday, though, a newspaper in Hailey, The Idaho Mountain Express, published an interview with Sergeant Bergdahl’s father describing the situation.Both Mr. Bergdahl and his wife, Jani, said they were upset that although they had had good relations with the State Department and the Pentagon during the three years that their son has been missing, they had never heard from President Obama. The two are Ron Paul supporters and have turned increasingly against the war in Afghanistan, although they support the president’s plan not to withdraw most American troops until 2014.“He has never contacted us,” Jani Bergdahl said about Mr. Obama. “We haven’t gotten a Hallmark card, we haven’t gotten a note signed by an aide, nothing. Is it because he thinks we’re not Democrats?”Mr. Bergdahl said that he had started to deal directly with the Taliban by e-mail in recent months, initially through a “contact us” tab on a Taliban Web site, but then through a member of the Taliban he believes has knowledge of his son’s circumstances. Mr. Bergdahl said he believed that the Taliban would not harm his son, and said that he had told them that their videos of his son have had little impact on the American public and that it would be more effective to direct their appeals to Mr. Obama. “I told them I am doing what I can to see that the president understands this issue,” Mr. Bergdahl said.Congress has to be given 30 days’ notice of any prisoner releases from Guantánamo. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a former prisoner of war, has been among the most opposed in Congress to transferring the five Taliban detainees. In January, when he thought the prisoners were to be exchanged for a Taliban statement renouncing violence, Mr. McCain lashed out at the deal, calling it “bizarre” and “highly questionable.”Through much of 2011, American negotiators engaged in a series of intensifying contacts with Taliban representatives, culminating in an announcement at the start of this year that the insurgents would soon open a negotiating office in Qatar. The office has not opened yet, however. Some American officials have pointed out as the talks stalled that there has been no movement by the Taliban toward fulfilling their promise to distance themselves publicly from Al Qaeda.Mr. Bergdahl, 26, who grew up in Hailey, a town of 6,000 in the Northern Rockies that is down the road from the Sun Valley ski resort, was captured in a mountainous region along the Pakistani border where the Taliban have a large presence. The circumstances of his capture remain unclear. Initially, American military officials said he had walked off his outpost, but in a video that the Taliban sent out a month later, he said he had been captured when he lagged behind during a patrol.'"
"'12-05-10,'1','This was a surprisingly intimate and affecting outcome for a show that has quite quickly, and quite inadvertently, become a cynic’s preserve. “The Voice” began life as a righter of wrongs — the wrongs of “American Idol,” the wrongs of discrimination based on looks and, last season, the wrongs of homogeneity, especially in regard to sexual orientation.But “The Voice” is, stealthily, an endorsement of the old way of doing things. Contestants may be chosen for their voices, but they are screened. And then, in the later rounds, they are voted on and eliminated like singers on any old competition show. The show’s amateurism is also a myth: this year each of the four finalists was a professional through and through. Chris Mann, from Christina Aguilera’s team, was a classically trained opera singer who had worked with the trad-pop swami David Foster; Mr. Green’s pick Juliet Simms fronted a band, Automatic Loveletter, that was signed to Epic; and Tony Lucca, Adam Levine’s selection, had been a member of “The Mickey Mouse Club” in his teenage years. (Last year’s top two finalists were pros too. Both Javier Colon, the winner, and Dia Frampton, the runner-up, were onetime major label artists, albeit only moderately successful ones.)Of the four only Ms. Simms actually fills a need in the marketplace: There are few female singers in hard rock (outside Christian rock, that is), and she’s a worthy one. For much of the season she was lost in a late-1960s Janis Joplin haze, both powerful and spacey. For her troubles she came in second and was saddled with performing alongside the charmless hip-hop exoskeleton Flo Rida on Tuesday’s finale show.The savagely dull soft rocker Mr. Lucca was an apt pairing with Mr. Levine, himself something of a pillow. Mr. Mann’s humility about the size of his voice rang consistently false. For him this show was less an opportunity to sing pop songs operatically than to sing them stiffly, a desire that’s disproportionately rewarded on televised singing competitions. (I asked Zachary Woolfe, who writes about classical music for The New York Times, for thoughts on Mr. Mann’s bona fides. “Not as rich and complex as you want an operatic voice to be,” he said. “And he tends flat.”)And even Mr. Paul, who is a nimble R&B singer with a flexible and sometimes thrilling tone, still doesn’t have a crisp identity. All season he was blank down to his look: clean-cut and clean-shaven (including his head), as if to not attract notice.Unlike “American Idol” — particularly this season — which can hit a snail’s pace midseason as singers are picked off one by one, often too slowly, “The Voice” operates at warp speed. Its need for balance and parity among the four teams often means that strong singers are ousted well before their time because they ended up on a team with stiff competition. This creates a field of good, even great singers, who, were they on “Idol,” would last longer and imprint more deeply, but here are collateral damage. As a result this competition can feel stakes-less and arbitrary.That the soulful rocker Jamar Rogers from Mr. Green’s team wasn’t in the finale had more to do with one poor song choice in the semifinal round than anything else; he could have easily outsung any of the finalists. He’s perhaps the most modern singer to have appeared on a reality competition; he should find a safe landing place following this show. Plenty of other impressive talents were gone before the finals: the soaring gospel-soul singer Jesse Campbell, cut by Ms. Aguilera, seemingly for impertinence; the lithe-voiced balladeer Katrina Parker; the wispy blue-eyed soul crooner James Massone; the teenage country singer RaeLynn, all honky-tonk spunk and grown-up attitude; and Lindsey Pavao, who landed a spot on the show with an outrageously odd and smoky version of Trey Songz’s “Say Aah.”Because the level of talent is so high on “The Voice,” each week’s elimination is a shocker, and therefore none are shockers. Perhaps that’s why ratings this season were a disappointment, dropping throughout the season. After the initial thrill of the blind auditions, which emphasize fairness and hope, the later rounds can be like “The Hunger Games,” brutal and off-putting, with little time to get attached to favorites before they’re axed. That environment demands some cutthroat decisions, which means Mr. Paul most likely won this show long before Tuesday’s finale.'"

"'12-05-11,'0','She said she feared she would lose her annual pension, which was about half of what she received before the death of her husband, Carl, a partner who worked at LeBoeuf for more than 40 years.A legal assistant who has worked at the firm for several years, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she still works at Dewey, said that employees who had 401(k) retirement plans — the firm matched their contributions up to 3 percent of their salary — could take those with them, but little else.“There are staff members who have been with the firm for over 30 years and are being ushered out without a proper package — well, without a package at all,” she said.Dewey & LeBoeuf would certainly not be the first law firm to fail in recent years. But it would be the largest — more than 2,000 employees worldwide at its height — with a stable of top lawyers in a range of fields. Dewey’s roots go back 100 years, while LeBoeuf’s date to 1929.Their merger in 2007 helped sow the seeds of the firm’s current problems, with top partners guaranteed lofty payouts worth millions of dollars that the firm, in the end, could not afford.Morton A. Pierce, a former vice chairman of the firm, underscored what was at stake for the top partners in his resignation letter last Friday. Mr. Pierce, one of the highest-paid partners, who had a contract paying him $8 million a year, informed Dewey that he was owed $61 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.At the same time, at least one group of retired partners from the legacy LeBoeuf firm has started to fight for their pensions. David P. Bicks, a partner at LeBoeuf for nearly 40 years who remains of counsel, meaning he is available for consultation, is acting as one of their representatives. He said the majority of their pensions were unfunded — meaning they were paid from revenue — and not backed by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. He said about 75 current and former partners were receiving payouts, and collected about $6 million in total last year.“I have been fielding calls from these people and it is just tragic,” Mr. Bicks said. “These are people who built a great institution and who had nothing remotely to do with the events that have brought the firm to its knees. Their questions to me are always, ‘How could this have happened?’ ”There are 1,788 participants in three Dewey & LeBoeuf pensions that are insured by the pension agency. Those pensions are 59 percent funded with unfunded liabilities of more than $8o million. On Thursday, the pension agency said that it would take over the plans to try to collect as much money as possible to fill that gap, and that many pensioners would be covered by its insurance, up to certain limits.As for the current partners at the firm, which was structured as a limited liability partnership, they are generally not individually responsible for the firm’s obligations. But in the event of a bankruptcy (or perhaps even outside of a bankruptcy), they could face certain claims. They are also last in line to be repaid anything owed them, behind banks and creditors.That means partners are unlikely to recover any money they were required to keep with the firm. (In recent years, partners had to keep 36 percent of their target compensation in the account, according to Mr. Bicks, although they sometimes borrowed the money to meet the requirement.) Normally, partners would take their funds with them when they left.It is also likely that partners may only be able to take losses on their tax returns in small increments, said Noel P. Brock, a tax lawyer, assistant professor at West Virginia University and the former partnership tax practice leader at Grant Thornton. He said the partners might also be required to pay taxes on canceled debts of the firms, since that is generally treated as income.And if the firm were found to be insolvent, say, at some point last year, the bankruptcy trustee or the firm’s creditors could make a claim that the partners were paid too much and try to recover the excess. Or creditors could try to collect profit made on cases that partners began at Dewey but took with them to a new employer — known as unfinished business, according to Allan B. Diamond, who served as the Chapter 11 trustee in the bankruptcy at Howrey L.L.P.There is not much the partners can do to shield themselves now. “In my experience, most of the time partners will end up settling with either a bankruptcy trustee or a creditor’s committee,” said Tracy L. Klestadt, a bankruptcy lawyer who represented former law partners at Thelen L.L.P. and Heller Ehrman L.L.P. in the bankruptcies of those firms.Annette W. Jarvis, a lawyer who is one of the co-heads of the finance and restructuring department at Dorsey & Whitney, represents about 45 of the 75 LeBoeuf retirees who stand to lose most of their pensions. She said a bankruptcy filing would at least lift the “cloak of secrecy.”“It’s a real problem that we can’t get any information from the firm to let us know if things are being done appropriately,” she said.Emily Bond, 79, has also had trouble getting answers. She retired in 1989 from legacy LeBoeuf, where she was the office administrator for nearly 30 years. Her annual pension is $63,000 but she said she might lose about two-thirds of that.“The partners are, I think, guilty at least of selfishness for not paying the required funding,” said Mrs. Bond, of Winter Park, Fla. “I hope they feel ashamed.”'"

"'12-05-11,'0','Hardly a question went unposed to Tebow, the Jets’ splashiest off-season acquisition.He was asked how he might handle his role as the backup quarterback: “It doesn’t change my mind-set or my attitude or anything. It’s just another opportunity and another challenge. Every day presents itself with enough of those. You just have to have a good attitude and approach it the right way.”He was asked what he thought about Giants quarterback Eli Manning’s “Tebowing” on “Saturday Night Live” last weekend: “I didn’t see it. I heard it was funny, though. I heard he did a good job.”He was even asked about his dog, a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Bronco. Tebow said he was considering changing the dog’s name to Bronx.And, of course, Tebow was quizzed about his relationship with Mark Sanchez, a subject that has prompted the sort of melodramatic speculation that might better befit a Broadway production.“It’s been great,” Tebow said. “We’re learning the same offense, something we haven’t been in before, and we’re really trying to learn together. It’s been fun.”Sanchez largely echoed those sentiments, complimenting Tebow’s work ethic, competitiveness and attitude. But when asked about potentially sharing considerable playing time with Tebow, Sanchez sounded a bit more defiant.“I’m not going to jump into hypotheticals,” Sanchez said. “Whatever is going to help us win, we’re all on board. Tim’s going to support me when I’m in there, I’ll be rooting for Tim when he’s in there. It’s all going to help the team.”Tebow’s new teammates watched the afternoon unfold with a mixture of shock and amusement. They sighed at the number of news media members on hand, but the only bickering came from cameramen fighting for positioning in front of Tebow’s locker.Linebacker Aaron Maybin, whose locker used to be on the side of the room where Tebow’s is now, did not seem too disappointed about his being moved to the opposite side.“I’m pretty good with it,” Maybin said with a smile. “I like to be away from the hustle and bustle.”Defensive tackle Mike DeVito compared the situation to when Brett Favre joined the team in 2008. “Everybody asking you, ‘What’s Favre doing?’ as if you live with him or something,” DeVito said.Wide receiver Santonio Holmes was initially complimentary of Tebow — “He’s a fun guy to be around” — but grew a bit testy after repeated questions regarding Tebow’s role. “I’m a wide receiver,” Holmes said. “I can’t tell you what the quarterbacks are going to do. I don’t play that position.”Tebow said he had not yet spoken to coaches about the possibility of his being used in different roles in the offense, saying that he too had only worked at one position — quarterback — and was still learning the playbook.“It’ll be interesting to see how teams try to attack us,” Tebow said. “We haven’t started game-planning — we haven’t done anything like that — so it’s a little premature to start thinking about that. But we’ve got so many weapons.”As Tebow was speaking, there was more movement, this time to his left. Burrowing out of the crush of reporters was defensive back Royce Adams, Tebow’s other locker neighbor.“There’s nothing I can do,” Tebow said with a smile about the attention. He added, with characteristic optimism, “I don’t really think teammates will have too big of a deal with any of this.”'"
"'12-05-11,'0','The Knicks, who went 36-30 in this compressed season, are headed for a busy and challenging off-season.They are already moving to re-sign Coach Mike Woodson, who compiled an 18-6 regular-season record after replacing Mike D’Antoni. Woodson has the enthusiastic support of his stars. A deal could be completed by next week.The Knicks also seem committed to re-signing Jeremy Lin, their young point guard sensation, who will be a restricted free agent. Woodson practically guaranteed it.“Will he back next year? Absolutely,” Woodson said. “He’s a big part of our ball club.”Woodson was less definitive about Lin returning as a starter, saying, “Only time will tell.”Lin, who revived the Knicks’ season in February and became an international star, said he wanted to return to the team that gave him his N.B.A. break.“I think it’d be great if I could come back,” Lin said, “but crazy things happen.”The Knicks will have to use their midlevel exception, worth $5 million, to retain Lin (salary-cap rules will prevent rivals from offering more). Yet once they do, the Knicks will have little flexibility to sign players for anything more than the minimum. And they are almost certain to encounter a new rule that effectively imposes a hard payroll cap at $74 million.Salary-cap constraints could prevent the Knicks from retaining their other top free agents, most notably Landry Fields, Steve Novak and J. R. Smith (if he opts out of his contract).Fields has the best chance of staying, as a restricted free agent with “Early Bird Rights.” Smith is widely expected to opt out of his $2.5 million deal, although he said he is undecided. The Knicks will be unable to match any richer offers.Then there is Novak, who is heading for his first big payday after leading the league in 3-point shooting. Novak is unrestricted, with no Bird rights. Assuming the Knicks use the midlevel exception for Lin, they will be left only with the biannual exception, worth $1.96 million, which might not be enough.“All I know is how much I’ve enjoyed playing here and how much I would love to be back,” said Novak, a fan favorite.The various cap restrictions will make it nearly impossible to sign an impact player, such as Steve Nash or Jason Kidd, unless he accepts a minimum salary. Or the Knicks would have to cut loose Lin, to keep their midlevel exception.As much as any personnel move, the need to blend the talents of Anthony and Stoudemire will dominate the Knicks’ agenda in the months to come. They are the franchise’s two highest-paid players — earning a combined $39.4 million next season — and their two best scorers. They are under contract for three more seasons, so the Knicks’ championship hopes are dependent on their partnership blossoming.“It definitely can work,” said Stoudemire, who contends the Knicks simply need time and stability.Indeed, the Knicks have had little of either commodity since Anthony and Stoudemire became teammates.The trade for Anthony came with 28 games left in the 2010-11 season. The lockout wiped out most of the 2011-12 preseason and shortened training camps. Injuries have limited their playing time together. And Anthony’s rejection of D’Antoni’s system forced the Knicks to essentially start over in mid-March, with a new coach and a new philosophy.“It’s just a matter of us having a consistent year,” Stoudemire said, adding, “We can’t point the finger at Carmelo and myself for not coexisting, because it’s been an up-and-down year since we’ve both been here. It’s a matter of time.”In the optimist’s view — one espoused by Anthony, Stoudemire, Tyson Chandler and Woodson — all the Knicks need is a full training camp and good health. With a little stability, they expect to contend with Miami and Chicago for Eastern Conference supremacy.“I don’t think it’s that big of a gap,” Chandler said. “We’re very explosive. We just need some fine-tuning.”With Lin or another skilled point guard at the helm, perhaps everything would fall into place. There is also a view that it is up to Anthony and Stoudemire, as the franchise stars, to broaden their games and become better playmakers. Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith all made that point emphatically on TNT’s postgame show Thursday.“Carmelo and Amar’e have to learn how to do other things,” Barkley said. “They only know how to help their team scoring-wise.”Smith added, “They can become better passers and make better decisions.”“I don’t really care about what them guys say,” he said. “I know what I have to do.”Asked what he needs to improve, Anthony said: “I can’t really say right now. I have time to reflect this off-season.”'"
"'12-05-11,'0','In the sculptured wilderness that is Central Park, nature’s rawer edge is not often apparent. But on Wednesday, a park ranger discovered a female mallard that had been mauled by an animal, apparently a dog. A local animal hospital euthanized the duck, which had lost most of its tongue and half its bill.The park ranger discovered the duck in the pond near 59th Street, at the southern edge of the park, and took it to Animal General, a veterinary hospital on the Upper West Side. The duck also had bite marks on the back of its neck. “There was no treating it,” said Karen Heidgerd, the hospital administrator, who determined that the wounds were consistent with a dog bite. “There was nothing else it could have been, based on the injuries.”The duck’s injuries were first reported (warning: graphic photo) on DNAinfo.com.In many areas of Central Park, as well as in parks across the city, dogs are allowed off-leash from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m., a privilege dog owners had sought for years. But in Central Park, dogs are prohibited from all water bodies, as well as playgrounds, ball fields and some meadows and woodlands.Supporters of off-leash privileges expressed dismay about the incident and said dog owners had to control their animals. “Off-leash does not mean that you just let the dog wander,” said Bob Marino, president of New York Council of Dog Owner Groups, an umbrella organization. “Dogs have to be in sight and be able to come back on voice command.”It is unclear how often such attacks occur. Ms. Heidgerd said that a year ago another mallard from Central Park was brought in with similar wounds and also had to be euthanized. Sometimes, wild animals are the aggressors: in 2000 a swan in Central Park killed a terrier.“This doesn’t happen frequently because people typically abide by the rules regarding dog behavior and control,” said Dena Libner, a spokeswoman for the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit group that manages the park. “When it does happen, it’s a very sad thing.”'"

"'12-05-11,'0','“The Risk From Chemical Plants” (editorial, May 4) uses scare tactics to frighten and confuse readers. Chemical and petrochemical facilities in the United States comply with strict federal regulations and standards to ensure the safety of their employees, operations and surrounding communities.Facilities throughout the country maintain a high level of security by working with the Department of Homeland Security and the Coast Guard to enforce the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards program and Marine Transportation Security Act regulations. And they regularly adopt even safer approaches when they preserve product quality and make financial sense.As private companies operating in the free market, our nation’s chemical and petrochemical companies thrive on innovation and ingenuity, and that provides the greatest benefit to their customers and the American people. The federal government should not be dictating engineering practices and advances. Physics and sound engineering practices — not politics and emotions — determine how chemical processes must be run.“The Risk From Chemical Plants” promotes solving a problem that no longer exists with an idea that was rejected long ago.There are a number of programs already in place that regulate safety and security at chemical facilities. Overlooking this progress, the editorial suggests that the Environmental Protection Agency should create a new program by using the general duty clause in the Clean Air Act.This is an old idea and a bad one, too. When this was proposed years ago, the Justice Department opposed the idea. The Labor Department believed that it was illegal. Even E.P.A. staff members conceded a host of legal and policy hurdles.The fact is that sensible federal regulation to control risks at chemical facilities is already in place. The “clear and present danger” that may still exist comes from the severe economic impacts that would result from duplicative and unnecessary regulations.'"
"'12-05-11,'0','Ultimately, Mr. Christie’s veto is largely symbolic. The federal law requires states to offer health care exchanges by January 2014, but provides that Washington will step in to administer them in states that fail to make progress by January 2013. In either case, the state pays to set up the health care exchange, but states that fail to create the exchanges lose the ability to oversee them.Democratic lawmakers accused the governor of playing politics with the needs of the most vulnerable residents.“It’s clear from his actions that he is more focused on winning praise from national Republican pundits than protecting New Jersey families’ access to health care,” said Assemblyman Louis Greenwald of Camden, the leader of the Democratic majority in the State Assembly.The Democrats warned that the governor’s veto would leave the state scrambling to comply with the federal law and could jeopardize future grant money. New Jersey had already received two federal grants, totaling $8.7 million, to prepare the exchange.Assemblyman Herb Conaway of Burlington, a doctor who was the lead sponsor of the legislation in the chamber, said the governor was sending a message that “he doesn’t care” about the 1.3 million state residents without health insurance.“By vetoing this bill, Governor Christie has failed New Jersey’s uninsured residents, hurt New Jersey’s chances of fully benefiting from federal health care reform and ignored the need to provide relief to hospitals for uncompensated care,” Dr. Conaway, a Democrat, said.Democrats in the Legislature had billed the exchange as one-stop shopping for people or businesses seeking health insurance, allowing consumers to compare the benefits and the costs of participating plans.The Web site it proposed would have also allowed people to apply for tax credits or other subsidies toward the cost of insurance.In his veto message, the governor said he was concerned about the potential costs of the exchange.The bill passed by the Legislature would have established a Medicaid-like plan for people with incomes between 133 percent and 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Mr. Christie argued that it was unclear whether there would be federal financing to support such a plan.In addition, he argued that the mechanism the bill set up to approve plans would limit the number of companies that could participate, which he said would both reduce options and increase costs.“In all, with basic issues regarding the future of the Affordable Care Act unresolved, it is impossible to know whether this legislation best suits the interests and needs of all New Jerseyans who will be required to finance these policy choices,” the governor wrote.Mr. Christie said that if the federal law was upheld, he would oversee the state’s compliance “in a responsible and cost-effective manner.”But while the governor cited the cost of putting the exchange into effect, Democrats in Washington and Trenton argued that the bigger cost was allowing so many residents to remain uninsured.“New Jersey taxpayers are on the hook every time someone without coverage shows up in an emergency room, whether it’s for life-threatening treatment or routine medical care,” United States Senator Robert Menendez said.'"
"'12-05-11,'0','“Just when you thought the conservative movement couldn’t be any more energized against President Obama, he gives us another gift,” said David Bossie, president of the conservative advocacy group Citizens United. “Add it to the list of atrocities.”The Obama campaign saw an opening to galvanize its backers as well. It released a new Web video that features Mr. Romney declaring his opposition to same-sex marriage and to some legal benefits for gay couples. Titled “Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality,” the video accuses Mr. Romney of wanting to “deny rights” and notes that “even President Bush supported civil unions.”While Mr. Obama only alluded to same-sex marriage in his initial appearances in Seattle, he had evidently struck a chord with some residents there.  “Thank You! Mr. President for standing up for my Mommys!” read a hand-written sign held by a woman with an infant as Mr. Obama’s motorcade passed en route to a fund-raiser.Still, the internal White House tension over Mr. Biden’s comments threatened to distract from the presidential endorsement that was seen as overdue in some circles of the gay and Democratic communities.In an interview with ABC News that aired Thursday morning, Mr. Obama said the vice president had gotten “a little bit over his skis.” But he said that he had done so “out of generosity of spirit.” And in their Oval Office meeting on Wednesday, the president told Mr. Biden, “I understand you were speaking from the heart,” according to a person briefed on the exchange.While the president bears Mr. Biden no ill will, several officials said, the episode enraged Mr. Obama’s senior political advisers and complicated the White House’s efforts to reap political dividends from the president’s declaration through a campaign e-mail, a video and a three-state fund-raising swing by Mr. Obama.It was easily the biggest instance of crossed wires between the garrulous vice president and his more buttoned-down boss, in a White House that has been marked by occasional eruptions from Mr. Biden. And the effect was magnified both because it involved a divisive social issue and because it came just as the general election is heating up.People who know both men said they did not believe that Mr. Biden had an ulterior motive in pre-empting the president, despite the fact that he has not ruled out running for president himself in 2016.Indeed, several gay-rights activists said whatever affection Mr. Biden’s candor might have won him with gay voters, he would still lag behind other potential Democratic candidates, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York or Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, both seen as champions of gay rights.Mr. Biden has said nothing publicly since his remarks on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” But he told staff members at the White House that he regretted putting the president in an awkward spot, several officials said.“The president has been the leader on this issue from Day 1, and the vice president never intended to distract from that,” a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden, Kendra Barkoff, said in a statement.A high-level campaign official called Mr. Biden’s comments as bad a mistake as he has made in a long time — arguably since October 2008, when he “guaranteed” at a Seattle fund-raiser that Mr. Obama would face an international crisis within six months of taking office. (“I think Joe sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes,” Mr. Obama said at the time.)This time, too, the president offered a modulated criticism. “Would I have preferred to have done this in my own way, in my own terms, without, I think, there being a lot of notice to everybody?” he said on ABC. “Sure. But all’s well that ends well.”The last 48 hours have been a heady period for Mr. Biden, according to people close to him. He has heard from many people — especially gay-rights advocates — that he is a hero who nudged a reluctant president on an issue of historic resonance.“There is no dancing in Delaware,” said former Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, referring to Mr. Biden’s penchant for bluntness bred in a home state known for its tradition of not dancing around issues.On the other hand, Mr. Biden upended a plan by Mr. Obama’s political brain trust to follow up last Saturday’s campaign rallies with a $25-million advertising purchase in nine battleground states to promote the administration’s accomplishments.“My view has always been that everybody’s strength is also their weakness,” said David Axelrod, a senior strategist. “I don’t think it’s terribly consequential.”Despite the White House friction, by Thursday there were signs that Mr. Obama’s comments had compelled a number of liberal donors, who had previously remained on the sidelines, to open their wallets.Juan Ahonen-Jover, a former technology executive, and his partner, Ken Ahonen-Jover, a doctor, donated a combined $10,000 to Mr. Obama’s campaign within minutes of learning that the president had changed course on gay marriage, pulling off the road on their way to Key West, Fla., to find an Internet cafe where they could make the contribution.On the Republican side, conservative political strategists do not envision their base flocking to the polls based on this issue alone — nothing like the effect in 2004 when voters in 11 states put initiatives to ban same-sex marriage on the ballot. But at the margins — especially in battleground states with large evangelical Christian populations, like Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia — they said that they believed that the president’s position could alienate some of the religious voters he won in 2008.Some conservative groups said they were already making plans to use marriage as part of their outreach efforts. The Faith and Freedom Coalition, the social conservative political organization led by Ralph Reed, said Thursday that it planned to include the president’s comments in its campaign to rally conservatives.But in a half-dozen interviews with Republicans who came to see Mr. Romney in Omaha on Thursday, not a single person voiced an objection at his decision not to dwell on the issue of same-sex marriage. “It’s none of my business. We don’t need to talk about it,” said Mo Birkel, 70, a retired custodian from nearby Papillion, Neb., when asked about gay marriage. “I can’t say if I’m for it or against it, because I don’t know what my grandkids will be.”'"
"'12-05-11,'0','BEIJING — Family members and lawyers representing Chen Guangcheng are facing increased harassment despite an international deal brokered to help Mr. Chen, a legal activist who escaped house arrest last month and sought refuge in the American Embassy here.According to lawyers and activists, the police in Mr. Chen’s hometown have put several of his family members under various forms of detention as part of an investigation into Mr. Chen’s nephew, who is accused of assaulting police officers. One of the lawyers set to defend the nephew is said to have been detained in a Beijing jail, and two others have been warned off the case.Nicholas Bequelin, in Human Rights Watch’s Hong Kong office, said these reports showed that officials in Mr. Chen’s hometown, Dongshigu, continue to exercise arbitrary power. Although the nephew’s actions — family members and the police agree that he brandished a kitchen cleaver at officers — should be investigated, the family is concerned that local officials will not give him a fair hearing.“The U.S. needs to keep raising these cases very strongly,” Mr. Bequelin said. “This is about justice in China; it’s larger than just Chen Guangcheng.”Last month, Mr. Chen, who is blind, escaped two years of house arrest and fled to the United States Embassy in Beijing. He left the embassy last week under a deal brokered by the United States State Department. After he expressed concerns about his and his family’s safety if he remained in China, Beijing agreed to allow him to study abroad in the United States.'"
"'12-05-11,'0','Two of the biggest global auditing firms are accepting a new directive from China to staff their local operations with Chinese citizens, saying they are already trending that way.Within three years, all senior partners for auditors’ operations in China must be Chinese citizens with local accountant certifications, according to rules posted on the Web site of China’s Ministry of Finance. Two of the so-called Big Four auditing firms, whose affiliates in the United States are Ernst & Young L.L.P. and PricewaterhouseCoopers L.L.P., said they supported the move.“Our business is well positioned for this transition,” Ernst & Young said in a statement. “The new measures are in line with E.Y.’s existing strategy to accelerate localization of our business in China.”China drew particular attention last year as dozens of Chinese companies disclosed auditor resignations or accounting irregularities, leading to the suspension or delisting of their shares.The Securities and Exchange Commission and the auditor watchdog group it supervises have met repeatedly with Chinese counterparts to discuss lifting barriers for inspectors to review auditors of United States-listed companies in China.PwC China, the local affiliate of PricewaterhouseCoopers, said in a statement that it had been “actively localizing its China practice by investing heavily in developing local talent and promoting local partners in past years.”'"

It released a new Web video that features Mr. Romney declaring his opposition to same-sex marriage and to some legal benefits for gay couples. Titled “Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality,” the video accuses Mr. Romney of wanting to “deny rights” and notes that “even President Bush supported civil unions.”While Mr. Obama only alluded to same-sex marriage in his initial appearances in Seattle, he had evidently struck a chord with some residents there.  “Thank You! Mr. President for standing up for my Mommys!” read a hand-written sign held by a woman with an infant as Mr. Obama’s motorcade passed en route to a fund-raiser.Still, the internal White House tension over Mr. Biden’s comments threatened to distract from the presidential endorsement that was seen as overdue in some circles of the gay and Democratic communities.In an interview with ABC News that aired Thursday morning, Mr. Obama said the vice president had gotten “a little bit over his skis.” But he said that he had done so “out of generosity of spirit.” And in their Oval Office meeting on Wednesday, the president told Mr. Biden, “I understand you were speaking from the heart,” according to a person briefed on the exchange.While the president bears Mr. Biden no ill will, several officials said, the episode enraged Mr. Obama’s senior political advisers and complicated the White House’s efforts to reap political dividends from the president’s declaration through a campaign e-mail, a video and a three-state fund-raising swing by Mr. Obama.It was easily the biggest instance of crossed wires between the garrulous vice president and his more buttoned-down boss, in a White House that has been marked by occasional eruptions from Mr. Biden. And the effect was magnified both because it involved a divisive social issue and because it came just as the general election is heating up.People who know both men said they did not believe that Mr. Biden had an ulterior motive in pre-empting the president, despite the fact that he has not ruled out running for president himself in 2016.Indeed, several gay-rights activists said whatever affection Mr. Biden’s candor might have won him with gay voters, he would still lag behind other potential Democratic candidates, like Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York or Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, both seen as champions of gay rights.Mr. Biden has said nothing publicly since his remarks on the NBC program “Meet the Press.” But he told staff members at the White House that he regretted putting the president in an awkward spot, several officials said.“The president has been the leader on this issue from Day 1, and the vice president never intended to distract from that,” a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden, Kendra Barkoff, said in a statement.A high-level campaign official called Mr. Biden’s comments as bad a mistake as he has made in a long time — arguably since October 2008, when he “guaranteed” at a Seattle fund-raiser that Mr. Obama would face an international crisis within six months of taking office. (“I think Joe sometimes engages in rhetorical flourishes,” Mr. Obama said at the time.)This time, too, the president offered a modulated criticism. “Would I have preferred to have done this in my own way, in my own terms, without, I think, there being a lot of notice to everybody?” he said on ABC. “Sure. But all’s well that ends well.”The last 48 hours have been a heady period for Mr. Biden, according to people close to him. He has heard from many people — especially gay-rights advocates — that he is a hero who nudged a reluctant president on an issue of historic resonance.“There is no dancing in Delaware,” said former Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat, referring to Mr. Biden’s penchant for bluntness bred in a home state known for its tradition of not dancing around issues.On the other hand, Mr. Biden upended a plan by Mr. Obama’s political brain trust to follow up last Saturday’s campaign rallies with a $25-million advertising purchase in nine battleground states to promote the administration’s accomplishments.“My view has always been that everybody’s strength is also their weakness,” said David Axelrod, a senior strategist. “I don’t think it’s terribly consequential.”Despite the White House friction, by Thursday there were signs that Mr. Obama’s comments had compelled a number of liberal donors, who had previously remained on the sidelines, to open their wallets.Juan Ahonen-Jover, a former technology executive, and his partner, Ken Ahonen-Jover, a doctor, donated a combined $10,000 to Mr. Obama’s campaign within minutes of learning that the president had changed course on gay marriage, pulling off the road on their way to Key West, Fla., to find an Internet cafe where they could make the contribution.On the Republican side, conservative political strategists do not envision their base flocking to the polls based on this issue alone — nothing like the effect in 2004 when voters in 11 states put initiatives to ban same-sex marriage on the ballot. But at the margins — especially in battleground states with large evangelical Christian populations, like Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia — they said that they believed that the president’s position could alienate some of the religious voters he won in 2008.Some conservative groups said they were already making plans to use marriage as part of their outreach efforts. The Faith and Freedom Coalition, the social conservative political organization led by Ralph Reed, said Thursday that it planned to include the president’s comments in its campaign to rally conservatives.But in a half-dozen interviews with Republicans who came to see Mr. Romney in Omaha on Thursday, not a single person voiced an objection at his decision not to dwell on the issue of same-sex marriage. “It’s none of my business. We don’t need to talk about it,” said Mo Birkel, 70, a retired custodian from nearby Papillion, Neb., when asked about gay marriage. “I can’t say if I’m for it or against it, because I don’t know what my grandkids will be.”'"

"'12-05-12,'0','JPMorgan officials declined to comment for this article. But in the company’s annual report, Mr. Dimon wrote: “If the intent of the Volcker Rule was to eliminate pure proprietary trading and to ensure that market making is done in a way that won’t jeopardize a financial institution, we agree.”He added: “We, however, do disagree with some of the proposed specifics because we think they could have huge negative unintended consequences for American competitiveness and economic growth.”JPMorgan wasn’t the only large institution making a special plea, but it stood out because of Mr. Dimon’s prominence as a skilled Washington operator and because of his bank’s nearly unblemished record during the financial crisis.“JPMorgan was the one that made the strongest arguments to allow hedging, and specifically to allow this type of portfolio hedging,” said a former Treasury official who was present during the Dodd-Frank debates.Those efforts produced “a big enough loophole that a Mack truck could drive right through it,” Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat who co-wrote the legislation that led to the Volcker Rule, said Friday after the disclosure of the JPMorgan loss.The loophole is known as portfolio hedging, a strategy that essentially allows banks to view an investment portfolio as a whole and take actions to offset the risks of the entire portfolio. That contrasts with the traditional definition of hedging, which matches an individual security or trading position with an inversely related investment — so when one goes up, the other goes down.Portfolio hedging “is a license to do pretty much anything,” Mr. Levin said. He and Senator Jeff Merkley, an Oregon Democrat who worked on the law with Mr. Levin, sent a letter to regulators in February, making clear that hedging on that scale was not their intention.“There is no statutory basis to support the proposed portfolio hedging language,” they wrote, “nor is there anything in the legislative history to suggest that it should be allowed.”While the banks lobbied furiously, they were in some ways pushing on an open door. Officials at the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve, the main overseer of the banks, as well as the Comptroller of the Currency, also wanted a loose set of restrictions, according to people who took part in the drafting of the Volcker Rule who spoke on the condition of anonymity because no regulatory agencies would officially talk about the rule on Friday.The Fed and the Treasury’s views prevailed in the face of opposition from both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which regulate markets and companies’ reporting of their financial positions. Both commissions and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which insures bank deposits, pushed for tighter restrictions, the people said.Even some of those who have said the Volcker Rule is fatally flawed agree that, in its current form, the rule would have allowed JPMorgan Chase to do what it did.“Would the Dodd-Frank law have stopped this?” asked Peter J. Wallison, a fellow in financial policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, who has been a consistent critic of the postfinancial crisis reforms. “No,” he answered. “Dodd-Frank specifically allows hedging and market-making transactions.”The Volcker Rule was not intended to offer such a broad exemption to the ban on proprietary trading. People involved with the drafting of the Dodd-Frank law itself say that the authors fought repeatedly to tighten the language, in part to specifically exclude portfolio hedging.In its earliest form, the Merkley-Levin amendment to the Dodd-Frank regulatory law said that any “risk-mitigating hedging activity” — or hedging positions that reduced a bank’s risk — would be allowed. Through several drafts, that exception was steadily narrowed. The final law permitted only hedges tied to specific investments.But when the proposed rules were released in October 2011, more than a year after Dodd-Frank went into effect, the exemptions were much broader, and allowing a bank to use hedging techniques in a portfolio was included as a potential loophole.The drafters recognized that the exemption could be a potential problem. In soliciting comments from bankers, they specifically asked if portfolio hedging created “the potential for abuse of the hedging exemption” or make it too difficult to tell whether certain bets are hedging or prohibited trading.Paul A. Volcker thinks there is a potential for abuse. Mr. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman whose advocacy for the proprietary trading ban was so fierce that his name was attached to it, told a Congressional hearing this year that with hundreds of trillions of dollars of derivatives being traded, “you have to wonder whether they’re all directed toward some explicit protection against some explicit risk.”Mr. Dimon said on Thursday that JPMorgan’s “synthetic credit portfolio,” an amalgam of derivatives and hedging bets that blew up in recent weeks, was part of “a strategy to hedge the firm’s overall credit exposure.” But “Volcker allows that,” he said.That was not the intent of the law, said Phil Angelides, who headed the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. “I think the regulators need to go back and sharpen their pencils,” Mr. Angelides said. “The intent of the law was to stop insured depositories from doing propriety trading with this kind of risk profile.” And whatever JPMorgan calls it, “it sure looks like proprietary trading, which Dodd-Frank was designed to stop insured depositories from engaging in.”'"

"'12-05-12,'0','Becoming a donor is relatively simple nowadays; only a cheek swab is needed to test for a match. Donating rarely requires the painful hip punctures that used to be routine. Instead, an intravenous blood line runs through a cell separator after the donor takes drugs to push the stem cells into the bloodstream. The process is no more burdensome than dialysis, experts say.But for African-Americans like Mr. Adebiyi, finding matches is particularly difficult. Blacks are less likely to register as donors; while blacks are 12.6 percent of the population, only 8 percent of registered donors are black.“It’s lack of education about it, and mistrust of the medical system after scandals like Tuskegee,” said Shauna Melius, co-founder of Preserve Our Legacy, citing the Tuskegee, Ala., experiment in which government doctors recruited black farmers for research and let those with syphilis go untreated for decades. Her organization recruits donors at Harlem Hospital and through drives featuring black celebrities.“Plus,” she added, “people are skeptical because you’re collecting DNA.”Complicating the problem, blacks are more genetically diverse than whites. Anatomically modern Homo sapiens existed in Africa for 200,000 years before migrating north to Europe a little over 40,000 years ago, so all Europeans descend from the shallower end of the gene pool.Although no expert would predict exactly how many American lives could be saved, because there are so many variables, several suggested that dozens of cancer patients would benefit — and some of the 1,000 Americans a year who face life-threatening sickle-cell disease could potentially be cured as well. “It could be useful to everybody to have a lot more people lined up as donors,” said Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute. “And it could help recruit minority Americans if you could point out that folks in Africa are signing up too.”Dr. Willis Navarro, medical director for the National Marrow Donor Program, called Mr. Adebiyi’s plan “amazing.” Susan L. Solomon, chief executive of the New York Stem Cell Foundation, said it was “a really big deal.”Because most African-Americans are descended from slaves from West Africa, a donor pool there will help, said Dr. Pablo Rubinstein, co-founder of the national cord-blood program at the New York Blood Center.Nigeria has 154 million people and more than 400 ethnic groups.It will particularly help those with more African genes. Most black Americans have some white ancestors and, on average, 35 percent European genes, but individuals vary widely.Umbilical cord blood is even more useful than bone marrow, because its stem cells are “more tolerant,” Dr. Rubinstein said. They have survived fewer bacterial and viral assaults and are less likely to counterattack with graft-versus-host disease.Before cord blood became common in the 1990s, blacks almost never found matches. “In 1990, we only found six matches for African-Americans, and all of them had typical European genes,” Dr. Rubinstein said.Mr. Adebiyi found out he had both lymphoblastic lymphoma and stem cell leukemia when he was working at Goldman Sachs. He had no full siblings to donate marrow and, as his search for a matching donor in the United States led nowhere, he said, “I realized that my only chance was within my own ethnic group in Nigeria.” He flew there and spoke to 300 law students. Most agreed to have their cheeks swabbed, “and I carried the saliva back with me on the plane,” he said.But before the testing was done, the cord match turned up.Back in 2003, he missed making Nigeria’s 2004 Olympic swim team by 0.12 seconds. Now, while on temporary disability retirement from Goldman because of the neurological effects of his chemotherapy, he is trying for the 2014 Winter Games in the skeleton luge, which flings competitors headfirst down an icy track. He has no Nigerian rivals, but he still has to make minimum qualifying times to compete. (And, yes, he said, one of his coaches did train Jamaica’s famous bobsled team.)He has spent $32,000 of his own Goldman money on computers and software for Nigeria’s donor registry. The University of Nigeria’s medical school does the DNA testing. He is now trying to raise enough to start the cord-blood bank. It needs liquid nitrogen storage and backup generators. Ideally, the operation would also have at least two apheresis machines, which extract stem cells from blood, so Nigerians would not have to travel to South Africa or London to donate. All together, he estimates, it could be started for $75,000 and in total would cost less than $300,000.Nigeria’s national bone marrow registry officially opened Feb. 24 with donations from several hundred medical, nursing and laboratory science students. Two University of Nigeria medical professors are donating their time as administrators.Ultimately, the program should be able to support itself easily, Mr. Adebiyi argued, because American insurers commonly reimburse registries up to $35,000 for the costs of finding the donor and extracting the cells.Direct payments to donors are illegal under American law; there is no Nigerian law yet. Mr. Adebiyi said he would not mind donors being paid modest fees.Dr. Ifeoma Okoye, a radiologist and one of the administrators, said cord blood should be easy to get, given Nigeria’s high birthrate. “There used to be cultural superstition around the cord, and families would demand it be buried,” she said. “But that practice is no longer held on to. We dispose of cords as medical waste every day in our hospital.”The administrators are aware that large reimbursements from Western insurance companies could make cord-blood banking a tempting target for corruption, which is endemic in Nigeria. To reduce that temptation, said Dr. Sunday Ocheni, another administrator, the bank will be registered as a nonprofit organization.Mr. Adebiyi said he did not intend to ask for even a salary. “I personally don’t plan to accept a penny from this; I’ve already been paid,” he said, referring to the donation that saved his life.“It’s unfortunate that someone just as deserving of life as me might die when the cure might be in the woman sitting next to them on the bus.”'"
"'12-05-12,'0','In an interview with Fox Radio on Thursday, Romney laughed as he said that he didn’t remember the incident, although he acknowledged that “back in high school, you know, I, I did some dumb things. And if anybody was hurt by that or offended, obviously I apologize.” He continued, “I participated in a lot of hijinks and pranks during high school, and some might have gone too far. And, for that, I apologize.”There is so much wrong with Romney’s response that I hardly know where to start.But let’s start here: If the haircutting incident happened as described, it’s not a prank or hijinks or even simple bullying. It’s an assault.Third, if it happened, Romney’s explanation that he doesn’t remember it doesn’t ring true. It is a searing account in the telling and would have been even more so in the doing. How could such a thing simply melt into the milieu of other misbehavior? How could the screams of his classmate not echo even now?Fourth, “if someone was hurt or offended, I apologize” isn’t a real apology. Even if no one felt hurt or offended, if you feel that you have done something wrong, you can apologize on that basis alone. Remorse is a sufficient motivator. Absolution is a sufficient objective. Whether the person who was wronged requests it is separate.Lastly, this would have been an amazing teaching moment about the impact of bullying if Romney had seized it. That is what a real leader would have done. That is what we would expect any adult to do.A 2010 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll found that 77 percent of Americans believed that bullying is a “serious problem that adults should try and stop whenever possible.” Romney passed on that chance.While I have real reservations about holding senior citizens to account for what they did as seniors in high school, I have no reservations about expecting presidential candidates to know how to properly address the mistakes they once made.This is where Romney falls short, once again.There was a malicious streak at the core of the high-school boy in these accounts. Romney’s muddled and confusing explanation and half-apologies only reinforce concerns that there is also something missing from the core of the man: sincerity and sensitivity.Targeting the vulnerable is an act of cowardice. The only way to vanquish cowardice is to brandish courage. Romney refused to do so. This is an amazing missed opportunity to exhibit a needed bit of humanity by a man who seems to lack it.People understand regret. Romney may have been applauded if he had chosen to express some to redeem himself, but he didn’t. He chose obfuscation and obliviousness. Romney has an uncanny ability to turn a bad thing into a worse thing by failing to be forthright.Americans want to know that the boy from that prep school grew up in knowledge and wisdom and grew deep in compassion and empathy. We want to know that his shoulders are now wide enough to bear blame and his heart is big enough to seek contrition.Americans want a president who doesn’t target the weak, but valiantly seeks to protect them.That is what courage looks like.'"
"'12-05-12,'0',', the chief executive of , can be clear as a bell when he denounces financial reform. But on an emergency conference call with analysts on Thursday to announce the bank’s stunning $2 billion trading loss, his message was frustratingly vague.The loss, according to Mr. Dimon, was in the bank’s “synthetic portfolio,” which presumably means it involved the same type of complex derivatives that played such a destructive role in the financial crisis. And Mr. Dimon said that sloppiness, bad judgment and stupidity — his own and his colleagues’ — had led to the loss.It was a stunning admission from a man who led JPMorgan through the crisis relatively unscathed, but it doesn’t explain what actually went wrong.What Mr. Dimon did not say is that the loss also occurred because of a continued lack, nearly four years after the crisis, of rules and regulators up to the task of protecting taxpayers and the economy from the excesses of too big to fail banks; and, yes, of protecting the banks from their executives’ and traders’ destructive risk-taking.The fact that JPMorgan’s loss — which Mr. Dimon has warned could “easily get worse” — is not enough to topple the bank, is not the point. What matters is that JPMorgan, like the nation’s other big banks, is still engaged in activities that can provoke catastrophic losses. If policy makers do not strengthen reform, then luck is the only thing preventing another meltdown.'"
"'12-05-12,'0','LONDON (Reuters) — Tension between Iran and the West is likely to keep oil prices high despite a significant improvement in world supply and a big buildup of oil stocks, the International Energy Agency said on Friday.The agency, which advises 28 industrialized nations on energy policy, said the soaring global oil supply from OPEC countries and the United States far outpaced global demand, curbed by poor economic activity in developed nations.The agency said global oil supply rose to 91 million barrels a day in April, an increase of 600,000 barrels a day from March. But it said in its monthly oil market report that uncertainty remained because of “geopolitical risks.”In March, North Sea Brent crude futures rose above $128 per barrel as investors worried that a conflict between Iran and the West could cut off oil supplies from the Middle East.But prices have fallen sharply over the past two months on the disappointing economic performances of European nations and the United States, and as geopolitical tensions have eased.“The oil market is still jittery, but it is much less uneasy now that supplies and stocks have improved,” said David Fyfe of the energy agency. “A lot will depend on how much Iranian crude is lost to the market.”'"
"'12-05-12,'0','There was no shortage of people who had a problem with Brian J. Weiss.A top official of a company based in southern Florida that marketed dietary and health supplements over the Internet, Mr. Weiss reeled in a fortune billing people for what had been promised as free samples of colon cleansers, red-wine extracts and anti-wrinkle creams, among other items.In 2009, the Better Business Bureau in Florida logged more than 4,000 complaints against the company, FWM Laboratories, and Florida’s attorney general forced it to return more than $34 million to people, “for products they neither ordered nor wanted,” according to a statement from the attorney general’s office.Even Dr. Mehmet Oz, the physician who has become a television personality, once sought redress against Mr. Weiss, contending that images of Dr. Oz and Oprah Winfrey had been wrongly inserted into the company’s online advertisements, portraying them as backers, according to a federal lawsuit filed in 2009.None of that trail of disgruntlement, however, offered an immediate answer to why Mr. Weiss was shot to death Thursday afternoon during a meeting at the Hilton Garden Inn near Kennedy International Airport in Queens. The man who shot him, Gary L. Zalevsky, then killed himself.Video surveillance footage obtained by detectives shows Mr. Zalevsky, 47, calmly standing up, a stolen .380-caliber Beretta pistol in his hand, walking over to Mr. Weiss, 31, and shooting him five times in the head in a room off the hotel lobby, the police said. Four other men in the meeting literally fell out of their chairs, the police said, and ran for the door.'"
"'12-05-12,'0','The trade cannot be fully evaluated for another few years, at least, but in the second week of May it is beginning to look as if Zduriencik pulled a fast one on Brian Cashman, the Yankees’ general manager.Both men insist that Zduriencik knew nothing of any problems with either pitcher, and Zduriencik said he cannot be blamed — or credited — for making such a seemingly lopsided deal.“I can’t control what people think or say,” Zduriencik said. “Fans are fans. They are going to rationalize whatever way they want. You respect them because they are your fans. You need them. In this case, there was nothing. Brian knows this and I know this and everybody involved in the deal knows it. It was just one of those unfortunate circumstances that happened.”But Cashman could not be faulted if he decided never to deal with Zduriencik again. In 2010, Cashman thought he had a deal sewn up with Zduriencik to bring the left-handed pitcher Cliff Lee to the Yankees, but Zduriencik pulled him back and sent him to the Texas Rangers, who increased their offer with first baseman Justin Smoak.Zduriencik is also known across town for sending reliever J. J. Putz to the Mets in 2009. After 29 games, Putz had season-ending elbow surgery to remove bone chips.The Yankees put Pineda through thorough medical examinations, including a magnetic resonance imaging test, before trading for him. They were also given access to all the medical records the Mariners had, and there was no indication that Pineda had an existing condition.Pitchers do not come with warning labels. Sometimes they break without notice.“I feel bad for Brian,” Zduriencik said. “I feel very bad for the Yankees. I wish this thing had been a little different.”Montero, 22, is already providing some rewards. He batted cleanup Friday and caught for the offensively challenged Mariners, going 1 for 4, lowering his average to .267. Noesi starts Saturday; he has a 6.30 earned run average.On Friday, Raul Ibanez and Andruw Jones, the two players Cashman signed to replace Montero at designated hitter, each homered to offset Montero’s solo shot to right, where his swing makes him such a threat here.“I was thinking all the time right field,” Montero said. “Since I stepped first time to the plate tonight, right field is right there.”Montero was shocked to hear about the trade when Zduriencik called him at his home in Venezuela with the news. Montero said he was happy now, but he cherishes his brief time with the Yankees. He is still wearing jersey No. 63, which he wore when the Yankees called him up last September. He said he would never forget last Sept. 5, when he hit two home runs at Yankee Stadium. He said he would always remember the way the fans cheered him. Because it was such a special time for him, he chose to wear the same number.“It’s to remember that time, and now I want to make this number famous in Seattle, like 51 and 34,” he said, referring to the numbers worn by Ichiro Suzuki and Friday night’s starter, Feliz Hernandez.Although most members of the Yankees’ organization were skeptical that Montero could ever catch for them, they all agree he will hit, especially in Seattle.“That’s the perfect place for him,” said Freddy Garcia, who played six years in Seattle. “It’s more relaxed. If he goes into a slump, nobody does nothing.”In other words, it is a good place to hide — especially good for somebody like Zduriencik, accused of stealing from New Yorkers.'"
"'12-05-12,'0','She said she feared she would lose her annual pension, which was about half of what she received before the death of her husband, Carl, a partner who worked at LeBoeuf for more than 40 years.A legal assistant who has worked at the firm for several years, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she still works at Dewey, said that employees who had 401(k) retirement plans — the firm matched their contributions up to 3 percent of their salary — could take those with them, but little else.“There are staff members who have been with the firm for over 30 years and are being ushered out without a proper package — well, without a package at all,” she said.Dewey & LeBoeuf would certainly not be the first law firm to fail in recent years. But it would be the largest — more than 2,000 employees worldwide at its height — with a stable of top lawyers in a range of fields. Dewey’s roots go back 100 years, while LeBoeuf’s date to 1929.Their merger in 2007 helped sow the seeds of the firm’s current problems, with top partners guaranteed lofty payouts worth millions of dollars that the firm, in the end, could not afford.Morton A. Pierce, a former vice chairman of the firm, underscored what was at stake for the top partners in his resignation letter last Friday. Mr. Pierce, one of the highest-paid partners, who had a contract paying him $8 million a year, informed Dewey that he was owed $61 million, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.At the same time, at least one group of retired partners from the legacy LeBoeuf firm has started to fight for their pensions. David P. Bicks, a partner at LeBoeuf for nearly 40 years who remains of counsel, meaning he is available for consultation, is acting as one of their representatives. He said the majority of their pensions were unfunded — meaning they were paid from revenue — and not backed by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. He said about 75 current and former partners were receiving payouts, and collected about $6 million in total last year.“I have been fielding calls from these people and it is just tragic,” Mr. Bicks said. “These are people who built a great institution and who had nothing remotely to do with the events that have brought the firm to its knees. Their questions to me are always, ‘How could this have happened?’ ”There are 1,788 participants in three Dewey & LeBoeuf pensions that are insured by the pension agency. Those pensions are 59 percent funded with unfunded liabilities of more than $8o million. On Thursday, the pension agency said that it would take over the plans to try to collect as much money as possible to fill that gap, and that many pensioners would be covered by its insurance, up to certain limits.As for the current partners at the firm, which was structured as a limited liability partnership, they are generally not individually responsible for the firm’s obligations. But in the event of a bankruptcy (or perhaps even outside of a bankruptcy), they could face certain claims. They are also last in line to be repaid anything owed them, behind banks and creditors.That means partners are unlikely to recover any money they were required to keep with the firm. (In recent years, partners had to keep 36 percent of their target compensation in the account, according to Mr. Bicks, although they sometimes borrowed the money to meet the requirement.) Normally, partners would take their funds with them when they left.It is also likely that partners may only be able to take losses on their tax returns in small increments, said Noel P. Brock, a tax lawyer, assistant professor at West Virginia University and the former partnership tax practice leader at Grant Thornton. He said the partners might also be required to pay taxes on canceled debts of the firms, since that is generally treated as income.And if the firm were found to be insolvent, say, at some point last year, the bankruptcy trustee or the firm’s creditors could make a claim that the partners were paid too much and try to recover the excess. Or creditors could try to collect profit made on cases that partners began at Dewey but took with them to a new employer — known as unfinished business, according to Allan B. Diamond, who served as the Chapter 11 trustee in the bankruptcy at Howrey L.L.P.There is not much the partners can do to shield themselves now. “In my experience, most of the time partners will end up settling with either a bankruptcy trustee or a creditor’s committee,” said Tracy L. Klestadt, a bankruptcy lawyer who represented former law partners at Thelen L.L.P. and Heller Ehrman L.L.P. in the bankruptcies of those firms.Annette W. Jarvis, a lawyer who is one of the co-heads of the finance and restructuring department at Dorsey & Whitney, represents about 45 of the 75 LeBoeuf retirees who stand to lose most of their pensions. She said a bankruptcy filing would at least lift the “cloak of secrecy.”“It’s a real problem that we can’t get any information from the firm to let us know if things are being done appropriately,” she said.Emily Bond, 79, has also had trouble getting answers. She retired in 1989 from legacy LeBoeuf, where she was the office administrator for nearly 30 years. Her annual pension is $63,000 but she said she might lose about two-thirds of that.“The partners are, I think, guilty at least of selfishness for not paying the required funding,” said Mrs. Bond, of Winter Park, Fla. “I hope they feel ashamed.”'"
"'12-05-12,'0','The money was used, the defense team argued, to hide the relationship and the resulting child from an increasingly angry and suspicious Elizabeth Edwards, who died of cancer in 2010.Mr. Lowell asserted that a “fatal defect” in the prosecution’s case was that there was no evidence that Mr. Edwards took any action with specific intent to violate the law or that donors gave the money as anything other than a gift.“What ounce of proof is there that this was a campaign contribution?” he said.The three-week-old trial has been filled with hours of testimony about the personal drama around Mr. Edwards, his wife, his mistress at the time, Rielle Hunter, and the cadre of aides and supporters who watched the affair unfold.Much of the government’s physical case is built on cellphone records but few actual recordings, a handful of e-mails, hotel and private jet receipts and secret checks written from an enthusiastic, elderly banking heiress to help Mr. Edwards with a “personal problem.”The prosecution’s case relies heavily on testimony from staff members and aides, the chief among them Andrew Young. Mr. Young falsely claimed paternity for Frances Quinn Hunter, the child conceived in 2007 in a long-running affair between Mr. Edwards and Ms. Hunter.Mr. Edwards met Ms. Hunter at a bar in New York and went on to hire her to work as a videographer for the campaign, sneaking her in and out of his hotel room and taking her on the campaign plane. When reporters began circling the story, Mr. Young, his family and a pregnant Ms. Hunter went on the run.The government contends that Mr. Edwards ordered Mr. Young to get money from Rachel Mellon, the heiress, and then turned to his campaign finance chairman, a wealthy Texas lawyer, Fred Baron, to hide the affair. Mr. Baron, who died in 2008, provided private jets and hundreds of thousands of dollars to take care of Mr. Edwards’s entourage.Much of Mr. Baron’s support came after Mr. Edwards suspended his campaign in January 2008 after a poor showing in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.Mr. Edwards, Mr. Lowell told the court, was a seasoned politician and trial lawyer who knew what constituted illegal contributions and was careful to make sure money that flowed into his campaign and organizations that supported his causes went into the proper accounts.“He didn’t just drop out of the sky into a world of campaign finance he knew nothing about,” Mr. Lowell said.After two and a half hours of arguments from Mr. Lowell and rebuttal from the lead prosecutor, David V. Harbach II, Judge Eagles took less than 10 minutes to issue her ruling: “We will let the jury decide.”Mr. Edwards, who faces up to 30 years if he is convicted, will begin his defense on Monday.'"
"'12-05-12,'0','And yet there’s mounting evidence that a state’s support for same-sex marriage yields important benefits for business, especially with the younger, highly educated, affluent population avidly courted by most employers. Brian Ellner, who led the successful Human Rights Campaign for marriage equality in New York, said, “We heard over and over from the C.E.O.’s of major corporations that they don’t want any impediments to recruiting the best people, period, whether they’re people who want to live in a tolerant city or state or gay people who want to live where they feel their families will be protected and safe.”He described business support in New York as enormously important. “They’re the job creators and the engines of the economy and so important to the health and well-being of the state. And they were on our side.”In Washington State, where same-sex marriages are scheduled to begin June 7 unless opponents gather enough signatures to force a referendum, major employers have been sounding similar themes. Starbucks said in January as the state Legislature was considering allowing same-sex marriage that it “strives to create a company culture that puts our partners first, and our company has a lengthy history of leading and supporting policies that promote equality and inclusion.” Microsoft, the first Fortune 500 company to provide same-sex domestic partnership benefits in 1993, said, “Washington’s employers are at a disadvantage if we cannot offer a similar, inclusive environment to our talented employees, our top recruits and their families” as states that permit same-sex marriage. “Employers in the technology sector,” it went on, “face an unprecedented national and global competition for top talent.”In response, the antigay-marriage National Organization for Marriage called in March for a nationwide boycott of Starbucks that so far seems to have had scant effect. Starbucks revenue grew 15 percent in the most recent quarter, to a record $3.2 billion.“It would be great if they were taking a stand because it’s the right thing to do,” said Mr. Gates, the demographer, who lives with his husband in Seattle. “But they understand that marriage equality is a mechanism for them to attract and retain talent. It’s not just about gay people, because the truth is, there aren’t enough gay people to make a huge impact. But it signals a kind of openness to people who are different. It sends a signal to people, straight or gay, that this is a place where they can potentially thrive. That’s especially critical for companies that rely on people who have to be creative, entrepreneurial and innovative.”There is data to suggest that members of the so-called creative class, a phrase coined by Richard Florida in his 2003 book “The Rise of the Creative Class,” with an updated version due out next month, are disproportionately influenced by a state’s attitude on issues like same-sex marriage. This group, which Mr. Florida estimates at more than 35 million people, tends to be mobile, affluent and well educated. “These people have choices,” Mr. Ellner noted, “and if you’re gay and you can be married in New York or Boston, would you opt for that over North Carolina? Of course you would.”Mr. Florida, now a professor at the University of Toronto, and Mr. Gates collaborated on a 2002 study for the Brookings Institution, called “Technology and Tolerance: The Importance of Diversity to High-Technology Growth.” The two concluded that “perhaps our most striking finding is that a leading indicator of a metropolitan area’s high-technology success is a large gay population.” They continued, “Frequently cited as a harbinger of redevelopment and gentrification in distressed urban neighborhoods, the presence of gays in a metro area signals a diverse and progressive environment.” They noted that the five metro areas with the highest concentration of gay residents — San Francisco, Washington, Austin, Atlanta and San Diego — are among the nation’s top 15 high-tech areas.“Why the correlation? It’s not that gays and lesbians equal economic growth or are more entrepreneurial,” Professor Florida told me this week, “but because places that are open-minded and diverse attract people who are original thinkers, and these communities percolate with entrepreneurial and creative ideas.”Typical of such areas is Raleigh-Durham, site of North Carolina’s vaunted Research Triangle, and located in one of the few counties that voted against the ban on same-sex marriage. “The Triangle is tolerant and has a long legacy as a home to colleges and universities where gays and lesbians are welcome,” Professor Florida said. “I wouldn’t doubt that they’re up in arms. North Carolina has just put itself further beyond the eight ball.”Jim Rogers, the chief executive of Duke Energy, with its headquarters in Charlotte, was one of the few executives in the state to speak out against the amendment, though he stressed he was giving his personal views and not speaking for Duke Energy. “I’m old-fashioned,” he told an audience at the Carmel Country Club in April. “I believe we’re all the children of God, and we shouldn’t have special rules for some and not for others. I will go a step further. If this amendment passes, we’re going to look back 20 years from now or 10 years from now, and we’re going to think about that amendment the same way we think about the Jim Crow laws that were passed in this state many, many years ago.” He added: “We’re competing with people around the world. We’ve got to be inclusive and open.”Stuart Campbell, the executive director of Equality North Carolina, a gay lobbying group that campaigned against the amendment, said the North Carolina vote sent the wrong message. “If I was offered a job in a state that was actively hostile to gays and lesbians, I’d have second thoughts about taking the job.” He said 80 North Carolina businesses opposed the amendment to ban same-sex marriage, and many business leaders spoke privately in opposition to it. But only one sizable company — the privately owned Replacements Inc., which sells silver, china and glassware and has a gay founder and chief executive — publicly opposed the amendment. “Given that this is a Southern state in the Bible Belt, there is still a concern among business leaders about not getting out in front of social issues.” Mr. Campbell said. “It’s not Washington or New York.”'"
"'12-05-12,'0','The disclosure that JPMorgan Chase lost more than $2 billion in trading activities put a damper on the shares of some of the biggest banks on Friday, but there was little more than a ripple through the broader market on Wall Street.“Clearly it affected these financials, but it seems pretty concentrated,” Scott L. Wren, a senior equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors, said of the JPMorgan development. “We have come a long way. There is still a good bid in this market.”The revelation on Thursday of the bank’s losses put financial markets on edge at the end of a week that had otherwise been dominated by what the elections in Greece and France would mean for the euro zone debt crisis. Some analysts tried to gauge whether the trading setback for JPMorgan meant there could be similar underlying problems at other banks, but the uncertainty seemed to be contained to the financial sector throughout the trading session.“I don’t think there is anything too systemic,” said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, referring to the mostly calm market reaction to the JPMorgan trading loss. Reports emerged last month that a JPMorgan trading unit in London was taking large hedge positions that were distorting the market.“That is an internal company-specific issue,” Mr. Hembre said about JPMorgan’s situation. “It is not an aggregate market issue.”'"

"'12-05-13,'0','But some critics say that Mr. Fu’s high-profile role as an advocate for religious freedom is a double-edged sword. It has raised awareness of human rights abuses. But his close association with Republicans and evangelical Christians, the critics say, risks stoking China’s fears that foreign forces are plotting to subvert the ruling Communist Party.“Bob’s heart is in the right place, but sometimes in his zeal to bring attention to his cause he gets sucked up into the partisan maelstrom of Washington,” said one American human rights advocate who works closely with ChinaAid and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to offend Mr. Fu.A soft-spoken former English teacher who fled China in 1997, Mr. Fu, whose Chinese name is Xiqiu Fu, has hit pay dirt here in the Permian Basin, a parched expanse of West Texas flatland that produces more than 15 percent of the nation’s oil and gas. Since a group of pastors invited him and his family to move here eight years ago, Mr. Fu has been embraced by Midland’s prosperous evangelical citizenry.In addition to bankrolling Mr. Fu’s $1.4-million-a-year operation, local residents serve on ChinaAid’s board, provide money for the families of jailed believers and finance a network of 30 defense lawyers who are willing to step into the lion’s den of China’s legal system to defend the persecuted.“Bob has really educated us about the terrible things that are going on in China,” said Doug Robison, a third-generation oilman who is chairman of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association. “The message he conveys is pretty compelling.”Mr. Fu, a frequent speaker at the city’s megachurches, rarely has to make the hard sell. During last month’s annual ChinaAid gala at the Midland Country Club, Mr. Fu said he was hoping to pull in $200,000. He left with nearly twice that amount.“A few times a year, strangers walk into my office and write out $100,000 checks,” Mr. Fu said last week as he toggled between calls from a Christian radio station in Pittsburgh, a Japanese newspaper and Mr. Smith, the congressman.ChinaAid’s growing profile on Capitol Hill and its prodigious mentions in the news media have drawn slings and arrows from some Chinese rights advocates who disparage Mr. Fu’s singular devotion to persecuted Christians. (Although it was his legal fight against forced abortions and sterilizations that got him into the trouble with the government, Mr. Chen, the lawyer, is not Christian.)Others have criticized Mr. Fu as overly partisan, pointing to statements he made that accused the Obama administration of “abandoning” Mr. Chen and mishandling the episode in which the dissident — who had fled house arrest — left the safety of the American Embassy in Beijing only to reverse course and ask to leave China to visit the United States.Mr. Fu says his close relationship with Republicans is partly a matter of pragmatism. Democrats, he said, are not always interested in his cause. “I’ve never tried to side with one party,” he said. “To do so would be a disaster for our movement.”Indeed, many mainstream human rights organizations praise Mr. Fu’s mettle and say he does an admirable job juggling the demands of his evangelical backers with the broader causes of democracy and legal reform in China. “There is no single make or model for human rights activism,” said Sophie Richardson, the China director for Human Rights Watch. “As the environment in China has worsened, it’s all hands on deck.”Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who arranged for Mr. Chen to receive a fellowship to attend N.Y.U.’s law school, said Mr. Fu was the rare example of a Chinese exile who has managed to stay relevant outside China. “Bob shows that if you come out young and flexible and with enough drive, you can make a difference,” Mr. Cohen said.It is in part Mr. Fu’s personal story that makes him such a compelling advocate. The son of farmers from China’s northeast, he led classmates at Liaocheng University to join the 1989 pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square.It was after the army violently quashed the demonstrations and Mr. Fu was hauled in for interrogation that he had his crisis of faith. The tipping point, he said, was betrayal by the university president, his mentor, and the classmates who implicated him to save themselves.One night Mr. Fu devoured a book, smuggled in by a foreign Christian teacher, about the redemption of an opium addict who went on to establish a drug-treatment center. “I realized only the supernatural power of the Holy Spirit could help me,” he said.Redeemed by writing countless self-criticisms, Mr. Fu escaped serious punishment and eventually moved to Beijing, along with Cai Bochun, a fellow student he later married. They started a small house church — an unofficial congregation outside state control — even as Mr. Fu landed a job teaching English at the Communist Party’s central school.The incongruity of working by day for an officially atheist government and preaching the Gospel by night was not lost on him. “I was God’s double agent,” he likes to say with a shy smile.In 1995, the police discovered the clandestine congregation and Mr. Fu and his wife were taken into custody. Their two-month detention was marked by long interrogations and 10- to 15-hour days during which, Mr. Fu said, he was forced to sit with his arms and legs held upright. If he faltered, he said, other prisoners would beat him. “I got quite good at not moving,” he said.Soon after their release, the couple began planning their escape. Ms. Cai was two months pregnant but lacked a childbearing permit from family planning authorities, which Mr. Fu feared could lead to a forced abortion. “We saw it happen to some of our friends,” he said.A former student working for the public security bureau warned Mr. Fu of his impending arrest. To evade their minders, Mr. Fu jumped from a bathroom window and Ms. Cai slipped out in disguise. They made their way to the countryside, where a Christian policeman took them in. Later, another believer, the owner of a state-run travel agency, arranged for the passports and paperwork that allowed them to escape to Hong Kong.In the summer of 1997, after an eight-month wait, the couple received political asylum from the United States. The Fus and their newborn son settled in Philadelphia, and Mr. Fu attended Westminster Theological Seminary. ChinaAid was born in his garage.These days, the group has five employees and an army of volunteers. In China, Mr. Fu’s devoted network of friends and sympathizers has spread. Over the years, it has secretly ferried a dozen people out of the country, including Mr. Fu’s 70-year-old father, who had been brutalized by the police in retaliation for his son’s activities. Mr. Fu’s most recent rescue was Li Jun, a Chongqing property developer who says he was tortured by officials seeking to appropriate his business.The group’s tenacity and organizational prowess have alarmed the Communist Party, and officials appear to be especially vexed by Mr. Fu.“I’m happy to meet with them,” Mr. Fu said, referring to feelers he has received from high-level security officials. “I’ll meet them almost anywhere,” he added. “Just not in China.”'"
"'12-05-13,'0','“Lou Pollak wrote briefs, made arguments, gave advice hundreds and hundreds of times on issues of the highest level of constitutional sophistication,” Jack Greenberg, who succeeded Justice Marshall as director of the defense fund, wrote in his 1994 book, “Crusaders in the Courts.”It was Mr. Pollak who argued, in the Supreme Court’s 1965 case Abernathy v. Alabama, that the convictions of Freedom Riders for their campaign to desegregate buses and bus stations in the South could not stand. Citing a prior case upholding the right of the Interstate Commerce Commission to mandate integrated public travel facilities, the Supreme Court, without writing a new opinion, reversed the convictions.Mr. Greenberg wrote that Mr. Pollak had “masterfully argued the case, in conversational tones and with humor.”A year earlier, with William T. Coleman, who later served as transportation secretary in the Ford administration, Mr. Pollak argued for the plaintiffs in McLaughlin v. Florida, a case in which the Supreme Court unanimously struck down a Florida law banning cohabitation between people of different races. “The time has come to remove this stigma from the fabric of American law,” Mr. Pollak said at the time.“That important victory,” said Debo Adegbile, who now leads the defense fund, “paved the way for the precedent-setting Loving v. Virginia victory in 1967, which declared that all anti-miscegenation laws are unconstitutional.”Civil rights was a family calling for Judge Pollak. His father was a defense lawyer for the Scottsboro Boys, the nine black youths who had been falsely accused of rape in Alabama in 1931.Born in Manhattan on Dec. 7, 1922, Louis Heilprin Pollak was one of three children of Walter and Marion Pollak. He graduated from Harvard and, after serving in the Army, received his law degree from Yale, where he was the editor of the Law Review. He was a clerk for Justice Wiley B. Rutledge of the Supreme Court in 1948 and 1949, then joined a prominent law firm in New York. It was there that he started working for the legal defense fund.Mr. Pollak joined the Yale Law School faculty in 1955 and a decade later was named dean, a post he held until 1970.Appointed to the law faculty at the University of Pennsylvania in 1974, Mr. Pollak was named dean in 1975. Three years later, President Carter appointed him to the federal court in Philadelphia.In the hundreds of trials that he presided over in his 36 years on the bench (he had been a senior judge in semiretirement since 1992), Judge Pollak was known for advocating defendants’ rights — sometimes stoking controversy in the process.In January 2002 in a murder case, he ruled that fingerprint experts could point out the similarities between prints from the crime scene to those of a defendant, but could not “present ‘evaluation’ testimony as to their ‘opinion’ that a particular latent print is in fact the print of a particular person.”His initial decision delighted defense lawyers and alarmed law enforcement officials. Two months later, after three days of testimony at a special hearing, Judge Pollak reversed himself. Still, he expressed deep concern that “there have been at least a few instances in which fingerprint examiners, here and abroad, have made identifications that turned out to be erroneous.”Besides his wife, Judge Pollak is survived by five daughters, Sally, Susan, Nancy, Libby and Debby; and seven grandchildren.For Judge Pollak, his signature accomplishment was participating in Brown v. Board of Education.“The decision in the Brown case, even though it was a decision about schools,” he said in an interview on NPR in 2004, “became a precedent for, in the next half-dozen years, a series of Supreme Court decisions where they didn’t even have to write opinions, where they knocked out segregation in buses, in parks, in swimming pools and the whole array of public institutions that had been blanketed with Jim Crow for half a century.”'"
"'12-05-13,'0','When she told him she loved him, he replied, “Thank you.”is still a cool customer. He has a rare gift: Even when he does the right thing, by the time he does it and in the way he does it, he drains away excitement and robs himself of the admiration he would otherwise be due.Why doesn’t he just do the exhilarating thing immediately? Why does he always have to be dragged kicking and screaming to principle? Not everything is a calculation.His embrace of gay marriage was not a profile in courage. It was good, better than continued “evolving,” but not particularly brave. He has been in office three and a half years and he is running for re-election, trying to bring back the thrill with a lot of constituencies and donors who felt let down by his temporizing. Who knows how long he might have kept evolving, while his advisers gamed it out, if , and hadn’t forced his hand by speaking out in such an unabashed way in support of .Obama told ABC’s Robin Roberts that Biden “got out a little over his skis.”The controlling Obama team did not like the fact that the uncontrollable Biden’s forthright statement to about being “comfortable” with gay marriage left the president looking like an equivocator, once more lagging in the leadership department.So Obama aides began anonymously trashing the vice president, not a pretty spectacle given how loyal Biden is to the president.They told Politico that Biden’s getting the jump on Obama was particularly annoying given that Biden had backed the Defense of Marriage Act as a senator in the 1990s while Obama “has actually taken steps to repeal the Clinton-era law that defined marriage as something that could only take place between a man and a woman.”“And it chafed Obama’s team,” Politico said, “that Biden had, at times, privately argued for the president to hold off on his support of marriage equality to avoid a backlash among Catholic voters in battleground states such as and .”Biden felt compelled to apologize to the president for inadvertently nudging him to do the right thing., the senior adviser, Jim Messina, the campaign manager, and others in the petty Obama sewing circle might want to remember that the opponent is , not Joe Biden.The vice president was his usual sentimental self on “Meet the Press” last Sunday, praising the influence of “Will & Grace.” He recounted the story of meeting the two children of a gay couple at a political powwow three weeks ago in , and saying about the two dads, “I wish every American could see the look of love those kids had in their eyes for you guys, and they wouldn’t have any doubt about what this is about.”The men told me that Biden had bonded with the kids, bringing them stuffed dogs and showing them pictures of his family on his phone.President Spock, on the other hand, spoke at the fund-raiser and called gay marriage “a logical extension of what America is supposed to be.”In the end, Obama had to rip off the Band-Aid and take a stand, because if his campaign depends on painting Romney as a bundle of ambiguous beliefs, the first black president can’t be ambiguous himself on a civil rights issue. Not to mention that big bucks from gay backers will be needed to replace the lost bucks from alienated Wall Street donors.The gay community, forgiving all prevarication, was electrified. As the “Will & Grace” co-creator Max Mutchnick put it on the morning show, there are now little boys who can dream of both being a president and marrying a president.As Obama is reminded of what it feels like to generate excitement, what it feels like to lift the spirits of a demoralized country by using the bully pulpit, maybe he can start occasionally blurting out something he feels strongly about.'"
"'12-05-13,'0','In any case, officials say, the air defense systems are only one piece of a broad program to keep the Olympic Park, with its proximity to residential areas, safe from attacks via land, water or air. Recent exercises to test the Olympics defense program included placing dummy missiles on the roof of Fred Wigg Tower and on another building, the Lexington Building water tower, in the borough of Tower Hamlets. The missiles — bolstered by larger ones on the ground — would be used only as a final line of defense, the Ministry of Defense said.During the Olympics, which open July 27, the Royal Navy’s largest ship, H.M.S. Ocean, will be docked in London at Greenwich, and about 13,500 members of the military are being called on to reinforce the police and security forces. London’s airspace will be patrolled by jets and helicopters, with other crafts on standby equipped with early-warning systems and carrying snipers.The rooftop plan has received the most attention, with some experts questioning the wisdom of using a missile-defense system in such a densely populated area.“Is the government seriously suggesting the answer to a potential airborne threat is to detonate it over the city?” a former Royal Artillery officer asked in a letter to The Guardian.“In destroying an incoming target over a populated area, such as London, any debris will land on this area, including the remains of the target itself, any remaining explosives and fuel (remember Lockerbie after Flight 103 came down?), not to mention the effects if the cargo is chemical or biological in nature,” the former officer wrote.Peter Felstead, the editor of IHS Jane’s Defense Weekly, said the military’s openness about its weapons plans was designed to send a message to potential attackers.“This is a deliberately visible stance designed to make the terrorists pretty much think to themselves, ‘Well, O.K., I’m not going to try and fly a bomb in the center of London in a light aircraft,’ ” Mr. Felstead said.“But a lot of the real security is actually going on under the radar in terms of all kinds of counterterrorism and intelligence operations,” he added. “The really crucial stuff is the stuff we don’t know about, and hopefully the terrorists won’t know about it either.”Brian Whelan, who lives in the upscale private apartment complex that houses the Lexington Building, said that none of this made him feel any better. The water tower roof was recently struck by lightning, residents said, adding to their feelings that it is not an ideal spot for missiles.“I can see an absolute need to defend the Olympics, but I don’t see the need for it to be presented in this way, as militarized games showcasing the latest technology,” said Mr. Whelan, who, with other residents, has hired a lawyer to examine whether the military can legally commandeer private rooftops in peacetime (it can, it says).“The military equipment should take a back seat to the Games,” Mr. Whelan added. “And if this stuff is there, it shouldn’t be in your face and plonked on top of people’s heads.”The plan spurred a healthy debate on The Guardian’s letters page, where not everyone treated it with military seriousness.“It’s blatantly unfair that high-rise flats in London’s East End should be given the protection of surface-to-air missiles, while we in the Finsbury Park area remain glaringly undefended,” wrote a man named Bruce Kent, describing himself as chairman of the “Finsbury Park Defense Collective.”The military says that the idea is to keep the weapons out of the Olympic Park, so people inside can enjoy the Games. But residents of Fred Wigg Tower say they wish they had been consulted, particularly as it is unlikely that anyone in the building has bought tickets to the Olympics.“What if the missiles don’t work, and we just get bombed?” asked Toni Francis-Clark, 11. Another resident, Ann Warbrick, said she was not altogether sure what a missile was (“Is it like a rocket?”) but did not want one on her house.Ms. Bozkurt, 42, said she was resigned to the government’s plan, saying it was of a piece with what had been going on lately, starting with a fire in December that forced residents to vacate the building for more than a month.More recently, Ms. Bozkurt said, the supermarket where she works informed her that she would be required to report for duty at 4 a.m., five hours earlier than usual, during the Olympics on account of possible traffic congestion. Meanwhile, the authorities are advising people not to drive at all, no matter what time it is.“We’ve had enough going on in the street — road works for the Olympics, traffic for the Olympics,” Ms. Bozkurt said. “And now missiles for the Olympics.”'"
"'12-05-13,'0','Today, it is just as likely to be invoked by powerful states to wage war in distant corners of the globe, much to the chagrin of authoritarian leaders in wealthy rising powers like Russia and China, who see such “humanitarian interventions” as a violation of states’ sovereignty — not to mention a threat to their manner of rule.The West’s continuing reckoning with China is not likely to play out according to familiar protocols. China has always had a much more distant relationship with international human rights norms than the Communist states of yesteryear. In the cold war, an era when America didn’t ratify any human rights treaties, the Soviet Union did. The fact that their governments had done so gave dissidents’ appeals to international human rights tremendous power at home.It was Communist Czechoslovakia’s ratification of the main international human rights covenants in 1976 that brought them into legal force — and helped inspire the creation of the dissident manifesto, Charter 77, the next year. Prompted by the arrest of members of the rock band Plastic People of the Universe, Vaclav Havel and his fellow signatories criticized the government for failing to abide by the human rights treaties it had signed. Communist China, excluded from the United Nations at the time the first human rights treaties were drafted, still hasn’t ratified the covenant for political and civil rights.Another reason China’s Charter 08 — formed by Chinese dissidents on the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration — hasn’t had an impact comparable to that of its famous Czech predecessor is primarily because today’s geopolitical balance of power is very different from the one that favored cold war dissidents.Although America was weathering its own economic storm as the human rights era dawned in the 1970s, it was not faced with the prospect of a rising Soviet Union at the time, especially not one whose productivity had supported their extensive borrowing.Today, China is rising, and because it controls so much Western debt, it is unlikely to be as easy to target for its internal conduct. Some claim that international human rights norms undid the Soviet empire, while others say that it declined and fell because of political mismanagement and economic collapse — things that seem much more prevalent in the West than in China now.This geopolitical shift gives today’s dissidents and their foreign allies much less leverage than their predecessors had.BUT the main difference between then and now is that the whole idea of human rights has lost some of its romantic appeal and moral purity. Today, the issue of human rights is no longer just about limiting power in the global arena but also about how to deploy it.For many, defending human rights implies the activist prevention of atrocity, after Bosnia and Rwanda stoked our consciences. Following America’s protective bombing of Kosovo in 1999, George W. Bush in 2003 inveighed against Saddam Hussein’s torture chambers before going to war (though a few new torture chambers were set up once Americans got there).Barack Obama, along with other concerned politicians, appealed to human rights to justify what became regime change in Libya, going far beyond the cause of saving civilians from carnage.That China and post-Soviet Russia have erected obstacles to a rerun of that human rights war in Syria is easy to chalk up to retrograde interests. But the fact is that they know that the idea of human rights today is about getting things done and not just keeping evil at bay.It is true that human rights allow their most hopeful partisans to claim that the movement means something beyond the chastening of extremist governments. In Europe, the idea of human rights has penetrated deeply into the way the Continent governs itself, becoming a source of appeal to all comers, not just a weapon against totalitarianism.But it is in this broader realm that human rights have proved most politically divisive and disappointing. For some dreamers, human rights mean ensuring citizen welfare in the form of economic justice, both within and among states. Yet the idea of international human rights has become prominent in an era when many governments are turning away from the welfare state in the name of the free market.For those who long for a state and a world that not only protect liberties but also promote well-being, the human rights movement hasn’t made enough of a difference. Human rights have succeeded in combating totalitarianism and preventing atrocities but have proved less able to promote the good life for people suffering less spectacular wrongs.That human rights have come down to earth since the days of the glamorous dissidents doesn’t make them useless. But it does mean that the utopia they call to mind is now inseparable from the realities of the world as it exists — from states to international bodies to transnational movements. For that reason, Chinese dissidents and their Western allies will need to be even more creative than their predecessors were in using human rights norms to achieve a reformed government.Most of all, when they appeal to international human rights, they will have to face the fact that these once pure ideals are now much harder to separate from the impure world of daily policy making, international power and unfulfilled hopes.'"
"'12-05-13,'0','But Roe Wilson, Harris County assistant district attorney, contended that the judges had disregarded Dr. Denkowski’s findings.The judge’s findings in Mr. Butler’s case repeatedly refer to Dr. Denkowski’s findings, but Ms. Wilson said the references were “historical.”“There was no consideration given and no mention given,” Ms. Wilson said.The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 2002 that states could not execute people who were mentally retarded. The court allowed states to decide on guidelines for determining whether a person was mentally retarded. Texas courts have adopted a three-part definition that requires the convicted inmate to have below-average intellectual function, to lack adaptive behavior skills and to have had these problems since an early age.Dr. Denkowski conducted tests to determine whether defendants who might face the death penalty aligned with those definitions. But other psychologists and defense lawyers complained that he artificially inflated intelligence scores to make defendants eligible for the death penalty. (Dr. Denkowski’s lawyer has said that he vigorously denies having violated any psychology board rules and that he used his best clinical judgment in making forensic evaluations.)Last year, the Texas Board of Examiners of Psychologists agreed to a settlement with Dr. Denkowski in which it reprimanded him, but he did not admit guilt. He agreed not to conduct intellectual disability evaluations in future criminal cases and to pay a fine of $5,500. In return, the board dismissed the complaints.Since that reprimand, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has asked trial courts to review at least six cases that included Dr. Denkowski’s work to determine what effect it had had on the case.Defense lawyers argue that Dr. Denkowski’s conclusions should be completely excluded from those reviews.“You can talk all day long about how you don’t want junk science used in these cases, but when you’re confronted with it, you have to take active steps to make sure it hasn’t contaminated the case,” said Kathryn Kase, executive director of the Texas Defender Service, which represents death row inmates.The Butler and Matamoros cases are the first to be returned to the Court of Appeals.Mr. Butler, who was also sentenced to life in prison for a separate conviction of aggravated sexual assault with a weapon, was sentenced to death in 1988 for the shooting death of Velma Clemons, a clerk at a dry-cleaning business.Dr. Denkowski evaluated Mr. Butler, and he testified in the case in 2006. School records showed Mr. Butler had been classified as “educable but mentally retarded,” but Dr. Denkowski said nothing in the records indicated that he required special education. He noted that Mr. Butler could tell time and could recite his Social Security number, “highly atypical skills for a mentally retarded person.” He concluded that Butler’s I.Q. was borderline normal.Similarly, Judge Susan Brown concluded that Mr. Butler’s poor academic performance reflected underachievement and poor choices, not lack of intellectual function. She also wrote that he had enough intellectual ability to plan, commit and then lie about the murder for which he was convicted.Dick Burr, a defense lawyer, said the judge had ignored findings by experts hired by Mr. Butler’s lawyers, including Dr. Denis Keyes, a special education professor at the College of Charleston, and Dr. Jack Fletcher, a psychology professor at the University of Houston. Both found that Mr. Butler had a low I.Q. and was mentally retarded. Dr. Fletcher — one of the psychologists who complained to the board about Dr. Denkowski’s work — said that Dr. Denkowski’s conclusion that Mr. Butler was mentally fit for execution “was based on outmoded, no-longer-accepted information.”“Our evidence demonstrated very persuasively that Steven Butler has mental retardation,” Mr. Burr said.Mr. Matamoros, whose criminal history included auto theft and burglary with intent to sexually assault, was convicted of the 1990 murder of 70-year-old Eddie Goebel, who was found in his bed with 25 stab wounds.Dr. Denkowski concluded in 2006 that Mr. Matamoros was not mentally retarded. His low I.Q. scores and a psychologist’s finding in 1977 that at 14 Mr. Matamoros had a mild intellectual disability, Dr. Denkowski concluded, were a result of bilingualism and his rearing in a deprived environment.Judge Marc Brown agreed, quoting from a federal court ruling in the case that in turn relied on Dr. Denkowski’s findings. Like Dr. Denkowski, the judge concluded that Mr. Matamoros’s ability to care for himself as an inmate and to plan and commit crimes also contradicted his claims of mental retardation.Judge Brown’s findings discounted the evaluations of psychologists hired by Mr. Matamoros’s lawyers who found that he was mentally retarded.Dr. Thomas Oakland, a psychologist and retired professor at the University of Florida, reviewed Dr. Denkowski’s findings along with Judge Marc Brown’s ruling. Both, he said, showed a “reckless disregard” for established forensic psychology.“Based upon my review of Dr. Denkowski’s affidavit and testimony, it is my opinion that Mr. Matamoros’s intelligence was and is significantly subaverage,” he wrote in an affidavit.Ms. Wilson, the assistant district attorney in Harris County, disputed the inmates’ lawyers’ argument that the judges’ findings were largely copied from Dr. Denkowski’s work.“I don’t think that is an accurate characterization, but that is something the Court of Criminal Appeals will determine,” she said.Lawyers for Mr. Butler and Mr. Matamoros want the Court of Criminal Appeals to insist that the death row inmates’ claims be re-evaluated without any reliance on Dr. Denkowski’s work.Mr. Schneider said the decision by the Court of Appeals in the two cases would also send a signal to other judges who are reviewing cases in which Dr. Denkowski had made evaluations. He said he hoped the court would continue to reject forensic methods that had been proven unscientific.“Their role has to be that of the supergatekeeper of forensic science,” Mr. Schneider said. “They have to say we will not allow a proceeding tainted by junk science to go forward.”'"
"'12-05-13,'0','Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John Watson and Sir Henry Baskerville are discussing a mysterious letter while they swelter in a sauna and — wait, no, that can’t be right; there is no such sweaty encounter in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’sAh, but this happens to be “The Hound of the Baskervilles” as unleashed by the British authors Steven Canny and John Nicholson, who have adapted Doyle’s celebrated 1902 novel to the stage expressly for laughs. Fans of Sherlockiana, depending on their sense of humor, will either love this little spoof or hate it.The comedy, in its Garden State premiere at the New Jersey Repertory Company in Long Branch, toys with a vintage mystery even as it mocks low-rent theater troupes. Technical glitches and seemingly spontaneous remarks thrown at the audience punctuate the show, performed by three actors portraying more than a dozen characters.In certain respects, like its tiny, multitasking cast and ironical airs, this comic thriller resembles the stage version of that hit Broadway in 2008 for a two-year run and is now onstage at George Street Playhouse in . The director of “The Hound of the Baskervilles” is Mark Shanahan, who not only was an understudy in “The 39 Steps” on Broadway, but also staged the George Street revival.The significant difference between the two comedies is that “The Hound of the Baskervilles” is rendered as a deliberately tatty affair with patchy costumes, minimal scraps of scenery and actors who broadly attack their characterizations.So, meanwhile, back at the sauna, a pathetic wisp of steam wafts from a bucket while Holmes and Dr. Watson — towels modestly wrapped around their Victorian street attire — talk with Sir Henry about his family’s “pet story” regarding a hellish dog haunting the ancestral estate. Then, in a flash, the little bench they share becomes a hansom cab in which Holmes and Dr. Watson pursue a suspicious stranger — with Sir Henry galloping beside them, brandishing their towels and toting that bucket.'"

"'12-05-13,'0','Having started a family at a young age, Breedlove had limited time and money to go racing. But he discovered that belly tanks — the streamlined under-wing gasoline tanks from World War II fighter planes — made cheap, light bodies for his type of competition.Breedlove bought a surplus tank and built a car powered by a supercharged Oldsmobile V-8. In the summer of 1958, at age 21, he towed it to the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, where he hit 236 m.p.h. before a clutch failed.An ideal location for top-speed runs, Bonneville is a mystical place, a miles-long natural racecourse covered with a layer of white salt deposited when an ancient sea dried up.“Bonneville is the last vestige of the wild American West, where all the horses are under the hood,” said Louise Ann Noeth, author of “Bonneville Salt Flats” (Motorbooks, 1999). “Land-speed racing represents the best of American ingenuity and honesty in sport.”While influenced by motor sports giants like Mickey Thompson, a tough, successful drag racer whose racecars were always competitive, Breedlove and his fellow competitors were also swept up in the postwar patriotism fed by Sputnik, the race to the moon and the charisma of John F. Kennedy.Conceding that he was spurred on by the “ask what you can do for your country” line from President Kennedy’s 1961 inaugural speech, Breedlove said: “I knew I couldn’t go to the moon or cure cancer, but I did know how to go real fast, and the most patriotic thing I could think of was to take the unlimited land-speed record away from the British.”Denis Manning, a fellow land-speed racer and builder of several record-holding motorcycles, added some perspective.“Most people can’t understand why we do this,” he said. “The land-speed record quest is a unique, exclusive thing. Some assume it’s for ego, and maybe it is the first time, but the tug is a far more deep-seated thing.“Breedlove soaked up everything he could about the science of aerodynamics, and he also began to think that wheel-driven racers might have their limits. He envisioned a jet engine, which could be easily packaged inside a low-drag, airplanelike body. And military-surplus jet engines could be had cheaply.So began a two-year project — finding space (twice) where he could build the car, convincing engineer friends that they should help and making sponsor proposals. Breedlove ran out of money at least twice, and partly because of his single-minded focus, his wife and children left him.The setbacks only increased his determination. When F.I.A., the international sanctioning body that certifies most Bonneville speed records, told him that 60 percent of his car’s power must go through the wheels, Breedlove went to the F.I.M., a sanctioning group for motorcycle racing.“When I told them about my jet-powered car, they were happy to sanction it, he said. “My three-wheeled airplane-type design fit into one of their existing motorcycle sidecar categories.”“Speed-record rules are really very simple,” he added. “It’s the average of two runs by a human pilot in opposite directions within one hour.”The Spirit of America finally arrived at Bonneville in 1962, but the car was beset by teething problems. Breedlove went back to work, modifying the car and cajoling his major sponsor, Shell Oil, into supporting him for another year.When the team arrived at Bonneville in 1963, the car featured a new rear fin that made it look even more like a wingless fighter plane. Breedlove and his engineers, having sorted out the car’s other issues, were confident they could break the record. On the morning of Aug. 5, Breedlove made a run of 388 m.p.h. With a return run of 428, the official average was 407, a world record.Breedlove was a new American folk hero. The Beach Boys wrote a song about him, “Spirit of America,” for their “Little Deuce Coupe” album. Jet-powered cars emerged from the workshops of talented land-speed racers all over the country.The 1964 Bonneville season shaped up as an unprecedented shootout among Breedlove and two homespun drag racers, Walt Arfons and his younger brother, Art. Each fielded a rather basic yet formidable jet car. On Oct. 2, Walt Arfons’s Wingfoot, driven by Tom Green, broke Breedlove’s record. Three days later, Art broke Walt’s record, driving his Green Monster to 434 m.p.h.When Breedlove arrived, he quickly worked up to a one-way run of 513 m.p.h. On the return run his braking parachutes ripped away, and he couldn’t stop in time with the wheel brakes. The Spirit of America ran off the course, jumped an embankment and finally came to a stop in a brine lake. Breedlove was lucky to escape without drowning.Although his car was wrecked, the return run of nearly 540 gave a record-setting average of 526.Breedlove had beaten Art Arfons by a sizable margin, but the season wasn’t over. Powered by an F-104 engine with about 18,000 pounds of thrust, Art Arfons’s Green Monster had nearly double the power of the other jet cars. Despite problems with tires blowing out, the Green Monster managed a two-way average of 536 m.p.h., breaking Breedlove’s record to cap the 1964 season.With the Spirit of America wrecked, Breedlove began work on a new four-wheel racecar. For months, Breedlove and his friends worked nearly around the clock to finish the Spirit of America Sonic I. Among its many refinements, the new car was fitted with parachutes similar to those on the Gemini spacecraft.Although Sonic I was fast and steered well, it had a tendency to become airborne over 500 m.p.h. On one test run, Breedlove saw the horizon line fall below the windshield — the front wheels were in the air, so he had no steering — but he released the braking chutes in time to prevent a crash. After a number of modifications, he set a new two-way record of 555 m.p.h.Breedlove knew that either of the Arfons brothers could beat this record, so he continued to test and work his way toward a seemingly impossible 600 m.p.h. On Nov. 15, 1965, he made a run at 593. Feeling the car was approaching its limit, Breedlove decided to go just fast enough on the return to break 600. A run of 608 gave him an average of 600.601, a record that would hold for five years.To compete in the annual battle and retain the record, an entirely new car that would stay on the ground at ever-higher speeds was needed. However, sponsors were becoming reluctant to get involved with such an increasingly dangerous sport. Goodyear, the main sponsor of Sonic I, felt Breedlove’s 600-m.p.h. record already gave them everything needed to promote tire durability and safety.It did not help that the pressures of pleasing sponsors put Breedlove in tough situations. Feeling he had to make hard-to-keep promises to employees, the press and sponsors, Breedlove often fell short, tarnishing his golden boy image.Breedlove was not able to field a land-speed car for another 30 years. By then, well-organized British teams that combined government, military and civilian expertise had pushed the record to 763 m.p.h, with a British pilot, Andy Green, breaking the sound barrier in the process.The price of chasing the land-speed record was now a multimillion-dollar challenge, and Breedlove was in his 60s. In 2006, he retired from land-speed record racing, selling Sonic Arrow to the millionaire Steve Fossett, who was killed in a plane crash before he had a chance to compete with it.Breedlove ought to be satisfied with being the first person to set the 400-, 500- and 600-m.p.h. land-speed records. Perhaps he is, but he cannot stop thinking about going for it, just one more time.'"
"'12-05-13,'0','While pet-chip technology has been around for nearly two decades, the industry has recently taken a commercial turn, spawning new ventures, including membership programs and social networking. What was once a simple process — inject a tiny transponder the size of a grain of rice between a pet’s shoulder blades and pay a one-time registration fee — has become a big business, with annual charges for benefits ranging from online distribution of customized lost-pet notices to discounted flights for missing pets found hundreds of miles away.Gary MacPhee, the general manager of HomeAgain, which is a subsidiary of Merck & Company, said, “We wanted pet owners to belong to our organization and we thought we could add value with our services.”HomeAgain’s Web site features cautionary tales from pet owners (like the self-recriminating video, “We Didn’t Even Know Gucci Was Gone,” about a missing miniature schnauzer) and alarming statistics: one out of three dogs and cats will be lost during its lifetime.According to the American Humane Association, last year more than seven million dogs and cats went missing; only about 17 percent of lost dogs and 2 percent of lost cats ever find their way back from shelters to their original owners. More than 10 million pets are euthanized every year because their owners can’t be found. HomeAgain’s Web site has a ticker counting pet recoveries tracked to chip technology; as of late April, it clocked 1,016,843 such reunions.But not all pet owners are sold on chips. Mary Ellen Feeley of Riverside, Conn., agreed to have a chip inserted in her Labrador retriever, Maggie. When she recently added a golden retriever, Dusty, to her household, she opted out. “I thought the chip was more of a scare tactic when we got Maggie,” she said. “I have never heard of any of my friends relying on the chip to find their dog. The collar tag, as antiquated as it might be, seems like a reliable methodology.”Indeed, most recoveries are still done by collar tag, said Tom Sharp, an American Kennel Club official. “It’s more likely that your dog will wind up on your neighbor’s property than in the local animal shelter,” he said. “But a chip is still the only way to permanently identify your dog as belonging to you.”Since 1995, the kennel club has offered its own nonprofit chip service, Companion Animal Recovery. Until 2005, the service had a partnership with HomeAgain, which produced the chips; when that contract expired, the two organizations parted ways. “They wanted to increase their revenue through annual fees and add-ons, so we split up,” Mr. Sharp said.Today the kennel-club service charges a one-time fee of $19.95, which enrolls a pet in its database for life (HomeAgain charges $39 for enrollment). Kennel club customers can also pay a one-time fee of $15 for lifetime membership in its lost-pet recovery program, which includes a 24-hour hot line. HomeAgain charges $17.99 a year for its package of benefits; its newest feature is an iPhone and Android app that lets users upload photos of lost pets and delivers alerts with a bark or meow.Some pet owners find the alerts distressing, and confess to not opening them or to unsubscribing from them. Others shrug them off. “I would rather get three e-mails a day about lost pets in my neighborhood than 20 e-mails from stores I rarely shop at,” said Mr. Sharp of the kennel club.Mr. MacPhee acknowledges that not every HomeAgain customer appreciates such services; after the free first year, about half decline to renew the membership (the registration information remains active in the company’s database). But he anticipates increasing the PetRescuer network to three million people by 2013 — partly by enrolling people who do not actually own pets. (They can submit their e-mail and ZIP code, and request to be notified about lost pets within a 5-, 10- or 25-mile radius of their home.) “Early triage is the No. 1 thing that gets pets found,” he said. “The distribution of information is really what helps find your animal.”Yet some pet experts think the chips provide a false sense of security. Claudia Devita, a Fairfield County, Conn., breeder, urges clients to understand the system’s limitations. “There is no quick cure to finding a lost dog, even with a chip,” she said. “Your dog has to be lucky enough to be returned to a place that has a scanner to check the number on the chip and then a way of contacting you. The only foolproof way to keep your pet safe is with making sure the dog is either walked on a leash or kept inside a yard with a fence.”Indeed, unreliable or incompatible scanner technology remains a nagging issue for chip providers. A chip is essentially a tiny transponder that uses radio frequency waves to transmit data, including registration and vendor contact information.Each chip can be activated by a hand-held scanner, but competing companies use different frequencies to send signals. Several chip vendors now produce universal scanners, and give them to animal shelters at low cost or free, but there is no guarantee that a particular chip will be recognized.“The government has not mandated that all pet organizations acquire universal scanners,” said Mr. Sharp of the American Kennel Club. “So it’s still possible that a pet’s chip won’t be read properly if he turns up at a shelter.”As for me, I can’t bring myself to delete or ignore the lost-pet alerts that pop up regularly on my smartphone. The latest one: “Farrah is missing,” described a 4-year-old female cat, weighing 12 pounds, with a black-and-white tuxedo coat. Her mug shot was adorable, and the online map showed a little green marker with a tiny paw print near my neighborhood. I’m rooting for her safe return.'"
"'12-05-13,'0','Of course, because “The Weight of the Nation” is a production of HBO, which carries no commercials, the network had no need to worry about advertiser blowback. The films were financed by HBO: a series of public health initiatives surrounding the films were supported by the health insurer Kaiser Permanente and the Michael and Susan Dell Foundation, which concentrates on health and education.Mr. Hoffman said he doubted he would have been able to scrutinize food and beverage marketing practices if he had been making the films for another broadcaster. “A commercial network would be biting the hand that feeds it,” he said.The president of HBO documentary films, Sheila Nevins, added this: “We don’t have time to duck any bullets.” She said she didn’t know if other networks would have pursued the topic of food marketing, and she added slyly, “I just know that sometimes food looks awfully good on television.”HBO embarks on a health series like “The Weight of the Nation” every few years. It previously produced multipart series about addiction and Alzheimer’s disease. This time around, four films have their premieres: “Consequences” and “Choices” on Monday night and “Children in Crisis” and “Challenges” on Tuesday night.The four films are intentionally somewhat repetitive, recognizing that many viewers won’t watch all four. At their roots the films all assert that obesity is an American epidemic that deserves urgent attention from policy makers, educators and ordinary eaters. Solving the problem, Mr. Hoffman said, “is going to require a massive renovation of the way we live our lives.”He said his intention is not to “villainize” the food industry but to “sound a very loud alarm” about the products that Americans are eating.The films try to reorient conversations about obesity away solely from personal responsibility and toward a combination of environmental circumstances to explain why 70 percent of Americans are, according to federal statistics, either overweight or obese. While personal responsibility is an important piece, “you cannot say that all these people have lost all their willpower,” Mr. Hoffman said. “There’s clearly something more powerful going on.” Factors cited by the films include federal farm subsidies, marketing strategies, changes in the work force, the content of high-caloric foods and the genetic makeup of individuals.To rope in the latest research on obesity the filmmakers worked with the nonprofit Institute of Medicine and two federal agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health. What particularly fascinated Mr. Hoffman during his research, he said, was the notion of a biological mismatch between a human species whose genes evolved in a world of scarcity but that now exist in a world of abundance. “We’re hard-wired to respond to the colors of red and yellow — ripeness,” he said. “Why do you think McDonald’s and most fast-food companies use red and yellow?”In an interview Phil Marineau, a former president of Pepsi-Cola North America and Quaker Oats, put it this way: “Our DNA has programmed us to want more, and our economic and cultural systems have delivered more.”Mr. Marineau was the member of an Institute of Medicine committee about how to accelerate progress in obesity prevention whose meetings were filmed for “The Weight of the Nation.” The meetings in 2010 and 2011 give the films a narrative arc, as do the personal stories of people trying to lose weight with the help of medical experts. Still, the films can feel academic at times, as if intended as much for classrooms as for living rooms. In fact they are. They will be distributed via DVD to thousands of community organizations and streamed on hbo.com so nonsubscribers can see them. And a companion series specially made for children will be shown in the fall.Margo Wootan, a director at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, said she was thankful HBO had targeted obesity prevention through the series and had included marketing in the conversations.“It is challenging to get educational messages out to parents about the impact and the importance of marketing, because almost everyone who usually shares information with parents — especially broadcast media — has a conflict of interest, because they’re all running junk food ads aimed at kids,” said Ms. Wootan, who is quoted throughout the HBO series.An increasing body of research has shown that advertising content affects eating behavior, and, as a couple of experts ruefully point out in the films, viewers would probably be hard-pressed to remember the last time they saw an ad for fruits or vegetables.The food and beverage industries have self-regulated their marketing to youth, but they spend $2 billion a year on ads and other forms of outreach to children and teenagers, according to the Federal Trade Commission. “The food companies are participating in self-regulation a lot more than the media companies,” Ms. Wootan said.Ms. Nevins said she sensed the films had already affected the consciousness of her staff at HBO. Some people there have lost “a considerable amount of weight,” she said, and others seem more aware of the foods and beverages they’re consuming. “They may not make the right choices,” she said, “but they know when they’re making the wrong ones.”'"
"'12-05-13,'0','HOW SAMUEL L. JACKSON BECAME HIS OWN GENRESamuel L. Jackson will always be Samuel L. Jackson, no matter the role, just as Bogart was always Bogart. There’s something about him that’s mysterious, intelligent and barely restrained. He puts the pepper in the pot.MOMMY HAD TO GO AWAY FOR A WHILEAs an obstetrician for high-risk pregnancies who has cared for women with substance-abuse problems, I found the story of Amanda Kimbrough all too familiar. On a practical level, criminalizing any aspect of women’s behavior during pregnancy has the exact opposite effect of what is intended: it alienates the very women who are most likely to benefit from prenatal care. Instead of protecting fetuses, this practice demonizes their mothers and sends them into hiding. Frequently this results in increased, rather than decreased, drug use. Which leads me to wonder if the purpose of these laws is really to protect fetuses.Willful endangerment of a child — even one who hasn’t been born yet — is something that should be taken seriously. It’s easy to be sympathetic and sentimental, or even to frame this as a gender issue. But as a physician who has seen the worst that pregnant women can do, I prefer to err on the side of protecting the children. And that’s especially true when it comes to dealing with current and former addicts. If you commit errors in judgment that endanger others, you pay the price, even if it means collateral damage with regard to the children. If left free, the danger these offenders pose to their children and others far outstrips any relative merits they might have been able to argue for.If Paul Krugman sees a difference between Ben Bernanke’s academic writing and his current posture, maybe that’s because Bernanke is no longer an academic, free to lob rhetorical missiles toward policy makers, which happens to be precisely what Krugman is doing. On the other hand, Krugman is right to feel frustrated at the pace of economic recovery and question whether there isn’t a way for policy makers to do more.Unfortunately for the country, with just six months before the presidential election, political concerns are now paramount among our nation’s leaders, which reduces the likelihood of aggressive Fed action. In a way, the Krugman-vs.-Bernanke debate symbolizes one of the great narratives of President Obama’s first term: What happens when bold ideas run smack into the responsibility — and political considerations — of actually governing and maintaining public support to continue doing so?This is really an issue of models. In your model of monetary policy, how many more jobs does the economy produce at 3 percent inflation rather than 2 percent inflation? What about 4 percent inflation? In Bernanke’s model, the answer is “not many.” Or more precisely, it’s “not enough to be worth it.” But it would be nice to see this argument conducted in more precise terms. What does Bernanke actually think the Federal Reserve could do if it tried to juice the recovery? What do his critics think the Federal Reserve could do if it tried to juice the recovery? In other words, do Paul Krugman and Ben Bernanke disagree on the number of jobs the Fed could create, or do they disagree on whether creating those jobs would be worth the cost in higher inflation expectations?Thank you, Eliza Griswold, for showing your readers a side of these women that is too often overlooked. They are almost always portrayed as little more than helpless victims. I am humbled by the courage of my Afghan sisters and enraged by the perversions that confine them to such miserable lives.

"'12-05-13,'0','About 35 of the apartments are occupied, Mr. Ginsburg said; more tenants are expected to move in soon. He said the company was looking for a restaurant to move into the 4,200-square-foot retail space. Though retail growth has been slower than residential growth in the neighborhood, Mr. Ginsburg said, a spate of new buildings should expand the customer base. Within a block of 220 Water, in an area that city government rezoned for residential use in 2009, are the recently converted 45-unit Kirkman Lofts, at 37 Bridge Street, and a 12-unit condo building at 192 Water Street.Across the street is 205 Water Street, the 65-unit new condominium building that is Toll Brothers’ first development foray into Brooklyn. In recent days, workers could be seen using a crane to put finishing touches on the cantilevered patio of the penthouse atop the concrete-and-steel-fronted building.David Von Spreckelsen, the president of the company’s Toll Brothers City Living division, said the building was about 70 percent sold, with the first tenants scheduled to move in this month.Finally, condominiums are opening at 133 Water Street, a 52-unit building designed by the Dumbo-based architect Robert Scarano. It converted to rentals shortly after opening in 2006.“It was at the time of sort of a glut of new development in the area, and the developer decided to put them on the market as luxury rentals,” said Deborah Brener Zolan, an agent at Brown Harris Stevens, who lives in the building, and who is marketing the units for sale there. In the interim, in 2009, the building’s owner, an entity called Water Street Realty Group, filed for bankruptcy protection, and tenants who were worried about building maintenance and staffing started a blog as an outlet for their concerns.Despite all this, Ms. Zolan said, the building has remained nearly full, and converting it back to condominiums was always the plan. So far eight apartments have sold, to Ms. Zolan and other current tenants, as well as to friends of the company; both groups were given the first chance to buy them. As of late April an additional five were on the market — ranging in price from $700,000, for an 802-square-foot one-bedroom apartment, to $1.399 million for a 1,783-square-foot three-bedroom — and Ms. Zolan said more would be made available as current leases expired.Mr. Walentas said Dumbo had come a long way since his earliest visits, more than 30 years ago, when he first saw the 30 Washington Street building, owned at the time by Helmsley-Spear.“That was a vacant building and had a for-sale sign on it,” he recalled. “I said to the broker: ‘Well, somebody should buy the whole neighborhood. One building, it’s tough to make a difference.’ He said, ‘We own the whole neighborhood — we’ll sell it to you.’ ”They did, in a deal worth $12 million for two million square feet. Since then, Mr. Walentas said, “It’s been quite a trip.”'"

"'12-05-14,'0','Green garlic has a window of about a month at farmers markets’ in Los Angeles, where I live, and I cannot resist buying it every time I go. At the beginning of the season the bulbs look more like leeks or spring onions than garlic, as they have not yet set cloves. To prepare them I just cut away the stalks as I would a spring onion, cut them in half and remove any tough stalk that might be running down the middle, remove the papery outer layers and chop like a scallion or leek.By now the green garlic I’m buying – actually, the bulbs are pink, but the stalks are green – has set cloves. The long green stalk must be cut away and the papery shells and the middle stalk removed. The cloves are juicy and mild, and I am using them in everything from stir-fries to omelets. Some farmers sell garlic scapes, the curly, green flowering end of the garlic plant. I have yet to find them at my market, but you can find recipes at several Web sites, including this one. They can be used in the same way you might use the green parts of scallions — in salads, omelets and pasta dishes, for example. Next year, when I’m ready to write my now-annual green garlic column, I’ll look hard for scapes so I can include some recipes.I love combining ricotta and eggs in a frittata. The resulting frittata has a fluffy texture. This can be eaten cold or hot, and it’s easy to pack for lunch.1. Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium heat in a heavy 10-inch nonstick skillet and add the bell pepper. Cook, stirring often, until it is tender, 5 to 8 minutes.

"'12-05-14,'0','The pressure is increasing on the to reform its program under which New Yorkers, nearly all innocent of any crime, were stopped by the police close to 700,000 times last year.The department said recently that it was instructing precinct commanders to review the legality of all stop-and-frisk reports, according to a report by WNYC. But such reviews — which should have been done all along — will be meaningless unless independent investigators actually interview officers to determine the proportion of stops based on reasonable suspicion, as required by law, and the percentage based on improper racial profiling, in which blacks and Hispanics are singled out.The statistics are getting worse by the year. Last week, the released a report — based on the department’s data — showing the number of street stops had grown to 685,724 in 2011 from about 97,000 in 2002, the year Mayor took office. On Friday, the Police Department released data showing that the stops have occurred at an even higher pace for the first three months of this year.The city has repeatedly argued that the program helps to keep guns off the street. But the N.Y.C.L.U.’s analysis found that the proportion of gun to stops has fallen sharply — only 780 guns were confiscated last year, not much more than the 604 guns seized in 2003, when officers made 160,851 stops. Young black and Hispanic men continued to be stopped in disproportionate numbers. They are only 4.7 percent of the city’s population, yet these males, between the ages of 14 and 24, accounted for 41.6 percent of stops last year. More than half of all stops were conducted because the individual displayed “furtive movements” — which is so vague as to be meaningless.The data also show that the police are significantly more likely to use force when they stop blacks and Hispanics than when they stop whites. This means minority targets are more likely to be slammed against walls or spread-eagled while officers go through their belongings. Even when victims are unhurt, they are likely to develop a deep and abiding distrust of law enforcement.For all this, only about 6 percent of stops lead to arrests. But the stops can also end with officers writing summonses for minor infractions like disorderly conduct. The police issue more than 500,000 summonses a year, most not arising from street stops but as part of the “quality of life” campaign the department embarked on in the 1990s.'"
"'12-05-14,'0','BURBANK, Calif. (AP) — Law enforcement officers in Southern California searched in rugged mountain terrain for a second day on Sunday for a missing F.B.I. agent who was said to be despondent and possibly suicidal.About 100 F.B.I. agents, 40 Sheriff’s Department rescuers and a dozen local police officers participated in the search for the missing agent, Stephen Ivens.Special Agent Steve Gomez of the F.B.I. said dogs had tracked Agent Ivens’s scent toward the Verdugo Mountains, east of Burbank, but searchers have fanned out across Los Angeles County.Agent Ivens, 35, who works in the F.B.I.’s Los Angeles bureau, was last seen by family members on Thursday evening, the authorities said.

"'12-05-14,'0','But the most expert of these advocates understand (at least when the microphones are off) that America operates in the real world: that our influence over the internal abuses of other countries is limited; that it’s easier to condemn a relatively inconsequential regime than one that provides us with oil or military bases; that humiliating leaders of countries like China may strengthen the hand of hard-liners; that sometimes quiet diplomacy is more effective than a public rebuke. They get all of that, but idealists believe a consistent, patient mix of pressures and incentives, public and private, can nudge an authoritarian regime in a civilized direction. “At the end of the day, no one likes to be an outcast,” said Nicholas Bequelin, who covers China for Human Rights Watch.The realists, whose reigning philosopher is that master of realpolitik , counter that wrapping ourselves in human rights may play well for domestic audiences, but it impedes progress on vital issues, especially in the case of countries like China that put a premium on respect.“The Chinese are very focused on issues of face,” said Kenneth Lieberthal, a China expert who worked in the Clinton administration and now is based at the . “It’s very hard to be effective if you are very public.”The realists are not necessarily indifferent. They argue that we can more effectively influence autocracies by exposing them to our values, and by setting a good example at home. Fair enough. But realists, who put a premium on nuance in dealing with countries like China, can be remarkably unnuanced on this subject. In a wicked takedown of Kissinger’s 2011 book, “On China,” Andrew Nathan, a China expert at Columbia, pointed out that in arguing against the elevation of human rights Kissinger combines “three fallacies: that the universality of international human rights is a matter of opinion rather than international law, that human rights equals American principles of governance, and that promoting human rights means holding hostage progress in all other areas.”’s record on human rights is — like that of most of his predecessors — mixed. intervened to stop genocide in , but he had to be dragged there. made “the freedom agenda” a signature of his administration, but America’s moral authority was seriously compromised by the excesses of the war on terror. Obama has shown little interest in beaming his personal spotlight on prominent dissidents — the , to cite one conspicuous snub. He was slow to hail the 2009 Green Revolution in Iran. And the silence on the crackdown in , which provides us both oil and a naval base, is excruciating. (“The U.S. is to Bahrain as is to ,” one activist said, overstating an uncomfortable truth.) On the other hand, Obama has stopped American agencies from using torture; he has promoted Internet freedom; he sent special ops to pursue , the crazed butcher of central ; he was cautious on the Arab Spring, but ultimately helped ease Mubarak toward the exit in and backed the opposition in . Hillary Clinton’s speech embracing gay rights as a civilized international norm should be required listening — in .The first thing the U.S. did right in Chen’s case was to offer sanctuary. Given Chen’s prominence and bravery, this was an obvious call, but the Americans did not merely let him in, they smuggled him into the embassy past Chinese security, and promptly assembled a knowledgeable team to face the Chinese. It was a brazen show of what we stand for. When Chen declared his determination to stay in China, the State Department negotiated a truly extraordinary deal with the Chinese, including an understanding that he would be allowed to live his life more freely. (Whether the Chinese would have kept their side of the deal is an excellent question; we don’t know, because Chen changed his mind about staying.) The U.S. provided Chen with cellphones to keep in touch with supporters, and even to call in to a Congressional hearing — and in the face of American resolve, the Chinese let it all happen.A couple of factors favored Chen. The Chinese Foreign Ministry, which seems to have won an internal debate with security services over his fate, had some potent arguments in favor of playing good cop. For one thing, local authorities who flouted Chinese law could be blamed for Chen’s persecution. For another, sending Chen to America means good riddance to a defiant voice. (Although in the age of social media, it’s no longer clear that exile means irrelevance. Chen’s adventure has been a phenomenon on China’s version of , including wonderful pictures of ordinary Chinese paying silent tribute to the blind lawyer by posting photos of themselves in dark glasses.)Kissinger’s disciples argue that we need to keep these individual dissident cases off the table, lest they lead to deadlock on weightier issues. But China also has an interest in those weightier issues. This time, they were willing to bend in order to prevent an embarrassing drama from getting in the way.Professor Nathan says when the U.S. soft-pedals human rights, it reinforces the view of many Chinese that the is in decline, inviting miscalculation of our seriousness. The Chen case, on the contrary, illustrates that — sometimes — if we stand firm we can have our diplomacy and our self-respect. “It is good Kissinger realism,” Nathan told me, “to show yourself to be strong in support of your own values.”'"

"'12-05-14,'0','After Ferdinand De Wilton Ward Jr. became notorious as a Gilded Age financial schemer of rare weaselly ingenuity, his picture appeared in a manual of phrenology. The shape of his “low-top head, very broad from side to side,” was said to explain why Ward had shown the “Secretiveness, Cunning, Acquisitiveness, Destructiveness” to bilk investors, shame and bankrupt a former president and try to kidnap his own son.Within the large Ward clan Ferdinand remains “the family sociopath,” although each of his parents was a candidate for that distinction. It took a great-grandson of Ferdinand’s, the prizewinning historian Geoffrey C. Ward, to write the scandal-filled but eminently fair book that airs this dirty laundry.Geoffrey Ward has reason for backhanded pride when it comes to his great-grandfather’s malfeasance. Ferdinand was not just any crook; he created a Ponzi scheme before Charles Ponzi was even born. He can legitimately be called the Bernard Madoff of his time, and he had the public infamy and prison sentence to prove it. Ferd, as he was known, was incarcerated at both the Ludlow Street Jail and the Tombs in New York, but it was not until he reached Sing Sing that his gifts as a con man really reached their peak. Thanks to well-placed bribes he got a nicer-than-average cell and the privilege of wearing a straw hat, not a striped one.Before the arrival of this book, “A Disposition to Be Rich,” which takes its title from Ferd’s mother’s excuse for his problems, not much was written directly about Ward’s chicanery. There are several reasons. His illicit financial dealings were best known as a sad footnote to the Ulysses S. Grant story, since Grant became Ward’s woefully ill-informed partner in the firm of Grant & Ward. (Specialty: securities rehypothecating, or “pledging the same paper over and over again to borrow money, paying the interest on one loan out of the principal for the next, hoping that things would somehow balance out one day.”And the Panic of 1884, which was prompted in part by the collapse of banks exploited by Grant & Ward, had other causes, among them the depletion of European gold reserves. The eloquent bursts of fury at Grant & Ward from Mark Twain, Grant’s friend and protector, are better remembered than the misdeeds that provoked them. Twain spoke of cursing Ward “with all the profanity known to the one language I am acquainted with,” as well as “odds and ends of profanity drawn from the other two languages of which I have a limited knowledge.”Finally there was little firsthand evidence of the Ward story. A trunk full of Ferd’s Sing Sing papers has been in Geoffrey Ward’s possession since 1965, but it took him years to examine the letters and family memorabilia inside. Mr. Ward has been understandably slow to tackle this subject. He has also been busy writing “The Civil War” with Ken and Ric Burns and winning the National Book Critics Circle Award for “A First-Class Temperament,” his biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt. He has written many other books, some with Ken Burns, on subjects ranging from baseball to tigers.'"
"'12-05-14,'0','Mr. Dimon, who will face shareholders at the company’s annual meeting Tuesday, has been on a public campaign of contrition in recent days. Mr. Dimon, the famously confident, even cocky, executive, repeated his apologies in a broadcast Sunday of ’s “Meet the Press.”“We made a terrible, egregious mistake and there’s almost no excuse for it,” Mr. Dimon said, adding that the bank was “sloppy” and “stupid.” He also acknowledged that the timing of the loss was a gift for advocates of more stringent regulation.Ms. Drew had tearfully offered to resign multiple times since the scale of the loss became apparent in late April, but Mr. Dimon had held off until now on accepting it, said people familiar with the situation.A skilled trader who once said she relished a crisis, Ms. Drew — and the disastrous trade — had become a liability for the firm, whose announcement of the trading loss caused JPMorgan’s shares to plunge 9.3 percent on Friday. It was unclear what type of severance package Ms. Drew will receive.“It’s not surprising that officials there are taking the fall, but this is one of the fastest movements I have seen,” said Michael Mayo, an analyst with Credit Agricole Securities in New York. “Mr. Dimon gets an A for moving to stem the wrath of regulators, but an F for not finding the problem in the first place.”With the furor intensifying, former JPMorgan executives said, Ms. Drew was clearly feeling pressure to step down, especially with regulators and members of Congress pointing to the loss as an example of why tighter oversight of the nation’s biggest financial institutions is needed.“The bank has taken bigger losses in investment banking and elsewhere, but because of the timing, she is being piled upon as this huge failure,” said a former senior executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the delicate nature of the situation.Executives said that within the last several months, Ms. Drew told traders at the bank’s chief investment office to execute trades meant to shield the bank from the turmoil in . Ms. Drew thought those bets could protect the bank from losses and even earn a tidy profit, these employees said.But when market tides abruptly shifted in April and early May, Ms. Drew’s instructions to traders to trim what had become a gigantic bet came too late to avoid racking up losses that could eventually exceed the current $2 billion estimate. Within the bank, there is also ample frustration that instead of reducing the losses, Ms. Drew’s traders may have worsened them.Besides Ms. Drew, Achilles Macris, a top JPMorgan official in London, is expected to depart, as is a senior London trader, Javier Martin-Artajo. Under Mr. Dimon’s leadership, the chief investment office has grown substantially in recent years, which until recently was little noticed by analysts and investors.Some former colleagues said Ms. Drew pushed hard for the bank to take calculated risks. She was never a “schmoozer” and kept a very low profile, bank executives said, at both JPMorgan and Chemical Bank, one of JPMorgan’s predecessor companies, which she joined in 1982. But Ms. Drew was not shy with her opinions. She routinely told senior executives in the firm’s trading businesses if she did not agree with their positions, one of the former colleagues said.Also under scrutiny is another of Ms. Drew’s subordinates, Bruno Iksil, the trader in London who gained notoriety last month for his role in the losses. He was nicknamed the London whale, because the positions he took were so large that they distorted credit prices. Other departures in London are likely.Former senior-level executives at JPMorgan said the loss was the first real misstep that Ms. Drew had experienced, having successfully navigated the financial crisis. They added that the recent trades were not meant to drum up bigger profits for the bank, but to offset risk.“This is killing her,” one of the former JPMorgan executives said, adding that “in banking, there are very large knives.”In February, Ms. Drew traveled to Washington with other JPMorgan executives, including Barry Zubrow, who oversees regulatory affairs, to explain why strategies like the one that later soured could offset risk within the bank. It was Ms. Drew’s first such trip to Washington, and she was called upon as an expert to discuss how to manage the gap between assets and liabilities for big banks, specifically how to handle the capital risks posed by having more in deposits than in .“She’s a person of the highest integrity,” said Walter Shipley, the former chief executive of Chase Manhattan and before that, Chemical Bank. “She was conservative on the risk side, she’s not a speculator.” Mr. Shipley retired from Chase in 2000, just before its merger with J.P. Morgan, but has kept in touch with Ms. Drew.Mr. Shipley had lunch with her two months ago, he said, adding that Ms. Drew, her husband, and two children live in Short Hills, N.J., not far from his home in Summit.Despite Ms. Drew’s low profile beyond JPMorgan Chase — many top Wall Street figures said Sunday that they had never heard of her until the news of the trading loss — she was a passionate advocate for women within the firm. In the largely male word of the banking elite, trading is an especially -laden niche, but Ms. Drew encouraged women to go into trading, arguing that working predictable market hours was actually a benefit in terms of balancing career and family.“I’m very upset for her,” said William Harrison, who was chief executive of JPMorgan Chase before Mr. Dimon’s tenure. “She looked out for the company first. I’ve always been a great fan.”'"

"'12-05-15,'0','Several analysts believe that GM’s decision will cause other marketers to take at least a second look at their own Facebook strategy. Melissa Parrish, an analyst at Forrester, wrote in an e-mail that the move would force Facebook to listen more closely to marketers.“My colleagues and I have spoken with several other advertisers who were already thinking of putting their dollars elsewhere,” Ms. Parrish said. “Now that G.M. has done so in such a large and public way, many of the fence-sitters will know that they’re not alone in their disappointment about their results.” According to Forrester, Facebook made just under $4 in revenue per user in 2011.General Motors, which spends about $3 billion on advertising annually worldwide, has advertised on Facebook since 2008. In January, G.M. consolidated its media planning and buying operations, giving Carat, part of the Aegis Media unit of the Aegis Group, the job. The automaker will continue to have a presence on Facebook with free content like the existing brand pages. Mr. Henderson said Facebook “continues to be a very effective tool for engaging with our customers.”A person briefed on the discussions between the companies said that G.M. spent a total of about $40 million on Facebook annually, most of that on managing its own presence and developing applications. This person, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations, said that Facebook had advised the company to spend less money on developing applications and more money on advertising and promotion. “They didn’t use paid media to get the message out,” the person said.Debra Aho Williamson, a principal analyst at the research company eMarketer said that “if G.M. is spending $40 million year and $30 million of that is going toward managing its page, that’s a lot of money.”“The advertising on Facebook helps brands extend their message,” said Ms. Williamson. “The challenge for G.M. is, can they do that without actively marketing and paying Facebook for advertising?”When Facebook held its first advertising conference in February, the reaction from marketers was mixed. Rumors that Facebook would announce its own ad network, allowing advertisers to buy inventory on the site in real time, did not materialize. Instead, advertisers were given more places to put their ads, including on the log-out page and in a user’s news feed.Ben Winkler, the chief digital officer at OMD, an agency in the Omnicom Media Group, said that while Facebook was a great mechanism for communicating and sharing content, it did not provide advertisers with the amount of data and analytics that they want from the site. “It will cause a ripple effect,” Mr. Winkler said about G.M.’s pullback. “It will make advertisers consider what they are spending.”One company that disagreed with G.M.’s decision was its Detroit rival, Ford. In a statement, the company said, “We’ve found Facebook ads to be very effective when strategically combined with engagement, great content and innovative ways of storytelling, rather than treating them as a straight media buy.”'"

"'12-05-15,'0','Judge Eagles said it was her role — not a witness’s — to explain the law to the jurors and let them decide if Mr. Edwards had violated it.“It doesn’t seem to me that the jury needs help,” she said. “It just doesn’t seem that complicated to me.”At issue is whether Mr. Edwards arranged with an aide to get money from Rachel Mellon, a banking heiress, and later solicited the help of a wealthy Texas lawyer, Fred Baron, to support his mistress, Rielle Hunter, and then the daughter she gave birth to in 2008.Although the decision keeping Mr. Thomas from the jury hurt Mr. Edwards’s attempt to rebut the main prosecution charge, testimony on Monday from another witness could prove helpful. It came from Lora Haggard, the chief financial officer of the Edwards campaign, who offered evidence that the Federal Election Commission, which regulates campaign spending, knew of the money and decided it did not need to be included in the voluminous forms tracing spending.Last month, the election commission approved Mr. Edwards’s campaign reports after completing an audit that had been prompted by his decision to accept public money for his campaign.Ms. Haggard said she had learned about the $925,000 in payments to cover up the affair once Mr. Edwards was indicted last June. Even then, with commission officers auditing the books, she did not include it in any amended filings, she told the court.“They were not used to urge the public to vote for John Edwards to become president,” she said.When the Federal Election Commission, which was well aware of the money and the indictment, approved her reports last month, she took it to mean her assessment was correct.The testimony presents an unusual situation. One government agency says the money was not a contribution, and another — the Department of Justice — says it was.“Whatever the F.E.C. determined is not relevant to the criminal charges,” argued a prosecutor, Jeffrey Tsai.Much of the money in question paid for the personal needs of Ms. Hunter, whom Mr. Edwards had met in a bar in New York and later put on the payroll to provide video for a small series of “Webisodes” designed to show a more personal side of the candidate.She had a front-row seat during much of the campaign, traveling on his plane and accompanying him on the road. What the public did not know but what aides came to suspect was that she was his lover and that the two had a daughter.To throw off the press and his family, a close Edwards aide, Andrew Young, claimed paternity and then spent a year hiding with his family and Ms. Hunter. The money used to support that effort is at the heart of the trial.The jury has spent 14 days hearing prosecutors pull details of the affair from witnesses, in a case relatively light on election law. The defense will most likely finish presenting its evidence this week.By Wednesday, defense lawyers will decide whether Mr. Edwards will testify. They said his daughter Cate, a lawyer who has spent nearly every day in court, could testify as soon as Tuesday.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — Almost all creatures, great and small, are welcome in the city of St. Francis, patron saint of animals, whose spirit imbues this place with a love and regard for our nonhuman friends. Take just one example gleaned from census and city data: Dogs outnumber children here, making already assertive dog owners an even more formidable political force.But the emergence in recent years of coyotes in the city’s parks, and sometimes in its expensive backyards and picturesque streets, has raised doubts about whether that founding legacy can survive. Will the two animal worlds — the domesticated and the wild — be able to coexist? Might they even, as many in this liberal city hope, ultimately complement each other?Taking no chances, city officials recently cordoned off trails and barricaded a restroom in an area of Golden Gate Park where reports of coyotes following dog owners and approaching unleashed dogs have been rising. The coyotes are believed to be protecting their den and newborns during the pup-rearing season, which lasts from April through August.“Coyote alert” signboards and posters, as well as those warning dog owners to keep their pets on leash, have been put up in Golden Gate Park and other pockets where coyotes have been sighted.Reports of coyotes killing dogs have come in, though none have been substantiated this season.“Some of it, we don’t know how real it is and how much of it is people raising the hysteria level,” said Rebecca Katz, director of the city’s Animal Care and Control.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','In February, federal prosecutors said they were trying to put together evidence to charge Mr. Rosemond in connection with the 2009 Bronx murder of Lowell Flecher, an associate of 50 Cent. As of Monday, Mr. Rosemond, 47, had not been charged in any killings, court officials said.In a 13-count indictment handed up last year, the prosecution said that since 2007, Mr. Rosemond’s operation made over $10 million shipping drugs coast to coast, often in musical instrument cases.On Monday afternoon, Carlos Giraldo, a special agent with the federal Drug Enforcement Administration, testified that he used UPS shipping labels in August 2009 to track down several kilograms of cocaine believed to be connected to Mr. Rosemond’s organization. Some of the packages, he said, were wrapped in plastic bags covered in “dressing.” Court documents identified the substance as mustard, used to camouflage the contraband from drug-sniffing dogs.As a prosecutor, Soumya Dayananda, showed the jury the cocaine that Mr. Giraldo seized — some of it in plastic bags the size of five-pound packages of rice — Mr. Rosemond rocked in his chair with his hands clasped together touching his lips.He wore a dark purple suit with multicolored pinstripes and occasionally waved and smiled to friends and family who filled the courthouse benches. One man who appeared to be a supporter wore a jacket with an image of the drug kingpin Tony Montana from the movie “Scarface” on the back.Mr. Rosemond’s arrest on the drug charges in 2011 came days after Dexter Isaac, who is serving a life sentence for murder in New York, claimed that Mr. Rosemond paid him to assault Mr. Shakur in a Times Square studio in 1994. Though Mr. Shakur survived that attack, in which he was shot, the feud escalated to the murders of both Mr. Shakur in Las Vegas in 1996 and Mr. Wallace in Los Angeles in early 1997.Mr. Shargel said in court on Monday that Mr. Isaac’s accusation, as well as a retracted article from The Los Angeles Times that also implicated Mr. Rosemond in Mr. Shakur’s shooting, set the stage for people to make other false accusations about him, particularly with regard to drugs, money laundering and witness tampering.Mr. Shargel told the court that Mr. Rosemond even lied about himself when he confessed to crimes during interviews with the police. He did so, Mr. Shargel said, because he believed that the police were using him only to gain information about hip-hop celebrities.“James Rosemond went in and made false confessions and false accusations,” Mr. Shargel said. “If they liked it, it was the truth. If they didn’t like it, it wasn’t the truth.”The trial is expected to take weeks. At one point on Monday, Judge John Gleeson turned to the jury and said: “Like you, I don’t really know what’s coming.”'"
"'12-05-15,'0','In Tehran, Mr. Taraghi was promoting a narrative that might pave the way for public, and political, acceptance of a compromise over a program that has broad public support, even among competing political factions. Enrichment is seen as a matter of national sovereignty and pride.Mr. Taraghi ticked off Iran’s successes. First, he said, Western countries did not want Iran to have a nuclear power plant, but its Bushehr reactor was now connected to the national grid. Second, the West had opposed Iran having heavy-water facilities, he said, but it now has one in Arak.Third, the West had said no to any enrichment.“But here we are, enriching as much as we need for our nuclear energy program,” Mr. Taraghi said with a smile, referring to the thousands of cascades of centrifuges spinning for years in the half-underground facility in Natanz. Since January, dozens more centrifuges have been online in the Fordo mountain bunker complex, near Qum, built to withstand a heavy attack.Mr. Taraghi and other officials say their policy has forced the United States to accept enrichment, though five resolutions by the United Nations Security Council have called for it to suspend it. Obama administration officials dispute that view.But some Iranian and Western officials have hinted that the White House may now be willing to accept some level of enrichment activity, in return for highly intrusive inspections and other guarantees. Tehran, too, may be willing to compromise, ending its enrichment up to 20 percent, a level at which it is easier to enrich it to weapons grade.Even before a preliminary meeting in Istanbul last month, the head of Iran’s nuclear agency, Fereydoon Abbasi, announced that Iran was willing to stop enriching uranium up to 20 percent. Iran has said it was enriching uranium in order to power up a 43-year-old American-designed medical reactor to produce medical isotopes used to treat cancer.Mr. Taraghi also said that in the Istanbul talks, Iran had managed to convince the West of the importance of a religious edict, or fatwa, by Ayatollah Khamenei, against the possession of nuclear weapons. He said that doing so helped sell its position that it is not pursuing nuclear weapons. “The West is secular, they do not believe that religious decisions are more important for us than political ones. This took some convincing from our side,” he said. American officials describe it differently, saying that they brought up the fatwa in an effort to offer the Iranians a face-saving way to reach a compromise.Iran’s negotiators left the Istanbul meeting believing they had scored a major victory. “We have managed to get our rights,” said Mr. Taraghi in his office in downtown Tehran. “All that remains is a debate over the percentage of enrichment.”But it is not clear from either Washington or Tehran where optimism ends and posturing for negotiations begins. American officials say no compromise on nuclear enrichment was offered in the Istanbul talks, which potentially sets the Iranian side up for major disappointment.Instead, last week the United States called upon Iran to take “urgent, practical steps,” without specifying what, before the meeting in Baghdad, on May 23.Empowered by the opinion that escalating sanctions mixed with military threats have intimidated the Iranians, Western officials have leaked several central demands they might make at the Baghdad talks.One is for Iran to allow United Nations inspectors back into the Parchin military complex, to investigate accusations by Western intelligence agencies that Iran has been working on triggers for a nuclear weapon. There are also demands for Iran to close the Fordo complex, which is under I.A.E.A. supervision. And, if any deal is to take place, Western powers want the Islamic Republic to sign a voluntary agreement under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, allowing wider inspections.United States officials have said they could imagine an enrichment program on Iranian soil — but only years from now and only under a series of conditions, including: full answers to all I.A.E.A. questions about possible work on weapons technology; allowing the I.A.E.A. to conduct inspections without warning at declared and suspected sites; and suspension of enrichment until these commitments are fulfilled.“This illustrates that the nuclear case is just another pretext for trying to keep us down,” said Aziz Shah Mohammadi, an expert formerly connected with Iran’s National Security Council, which, together with Ayatollah Khamenei, maps out Iran’s nuclear policy. “Therefore, we view each round of negotiations as a separate phase, not as leading to an all-out solution,” he said.Independence from the West is a pillar of the Islamic Republic’s ideology, which makes it very hard for Iran’s leaders to compromise on issues such as closing nuclear sites or foreign inspections beyond the current agreements under the nonproliferation treaty, analysts here said.Rather, expect the country to start a new nuclear project, if talks fail, one analyst said. “Wait for our leaders to announce, for example, a new mountain bunker so Fordo will be forgotten,” he said, asking to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to discuss this topic. “In case of failure we will try to hold out again until better opportunities for reaching our goals arise.”Mr. Taraghi did not want to consider the possibility of the talks failing, though he said Iran would have demands of its own in Baghdad, including an end to sanctions against its Central Bank.“We view the nuclear episode as a heavy retreat for the Western powers,” he said. “But acceptance of our nuclear program takes time, we understand that.”'"
"'12-05-15,'0','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) — Pakistan’s foreign minister suggested Monday that the country should reopen its Afghan border to NATO troop supplies, saying the government had made its point by closing the route for nearly six months in retaliation for American airstrikes that killed 24 Pakistani soldiers.Reopening the border risks a domestic outcry in Pakistan given Washington’s refusal to apologize for the attack, which it says was an accident. But it could help ensure that Pakistan has a role in the future of Afghanistan as NATO prepares to retool its strategy there during a conference that starts Sunday in Chicago.Pakistan’s presence would benefit the American-led coalition as well, because the country is seen as crucial to striking a peace deal with the Taliban and their allies in Afghanistan that would allow foreign troops to withdraw without the nation descending into further chaos.The supply line running through Pakistan to Afghanistan will be critical to that withdrawal as NATO pulls out more than a decade’s worth of equipment. It has been critical for shipping in supplies as well, although the United States has reduced its reliance on Pakistan in recent years by using a more costly route through Central Asia.The foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, said the government made the right decision to close the border to NATO to send a message to Washington that the attack on its troops in November was unacceptable.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','It was to forestall just such a default showdown that the framers of the monetary union did not even design a process by which one of the countries using the euro could withdraw from the union. And it was not because they were pie-in-the-sky thinkers who never believed that the monetary pact would be challenged.In fact, the euro’s architects were veterans of the clumsy collapse of the euro’s predecessor, the European Exchange Rate mechanism. They realized that the pain of trying to survive a deep economic downturn without the elixir of a unilateral currency devaluation might tempt a country to flee — and so they effectively barred the exits.But the framers surely never expected a member to encounter debt problems of the magnitude of Greece’s. Nor could they have known how much they would have to ask from Europe’s taxpayers to keep Greece in the euro: close to 100 billion euros so far, or about $130 billion.Now, investors are betting that if Mr. Tsipras does come to power in some way, he will force Greece’s so-called troika of international lenders — Europe, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund — to cut off funds by refusing to carry out their recipe of wage and pension cuts.“If you don’t have money, you don’t make the rules,” said a troika official who was not authorized to speak publicly. “And Greece does not have any money.”If Greece does not get its next 30 billion euro installment of bailout money by August, default could come in a matter of months, if not sooner, once it begins to miss its bond payments.What would happen next would be quick, and possibly brutal, said Mr. Nordvig of Nomura.According to Mr. Nordvig, the European Central Bank’s support of the Greek banking system, amounting to more than 100 billion euros, has so far been the most important factor in keeping Greece in the euro since its debt crisis began more than two years ago.Greece has already lost more than 20 percent of its deposits via capital flight. And without the money provided by the European bank, its banks would have long ago gone bust.If Greece were to default, Mr. Nordvig contends, Greek banks would probably be cut off from access to European Central Bank funds, and the euros in Greek banks would become effectively devalued compared with their counterparts in other European banks.Greece would then be forced to impose capital controls and approve laws to start printing a new drachma — not because it wanted to, but because it had to, he said. “It just happens automatically,” Mr. Nordvig said. “A euro sitting in a Greek bank would not be the same as a euro in another European bank. I think we are now moving very close to this being a central case.”In other words, a euro sitting in a Greek bank would not be perceived to have the same value as one in a German bank — because investors would fear that Greece might suddenly freeze euro accounts and force the holders to take newly printed drachmas, which might have only 50 percent of the value of a euro.Until now, there have been only small signs that money is fleeing the other troubled countries of the southern euro zone: Portugal, Spain and Italy. But the worry is that after a Greek default, and amid worries over bank problems in Spain, depositors in those countries could send their euros to safe German banks in gradually larger numbers.Many government officials in Greece now believe that a Greek default would lead to an eventual exit from the euro, and that belief is a main reason they are leaning heavily toward paying a small group of investors who refused to participate in the 100 billion euro debt restructuring most other creditors agreed to in March.Better to pay off the vulture funds, they say, with teeth clenched, than risk a default under Athens’s current political turmoil.“If you are not going to pay, you do not do so in a state of chaos,” said Gikas Hardouvelis, an economic adviser to the departing prime minister, Lucas Papademos, who has been vocal in warning that Greece faces a euro exit — or ejection — if it rejects the troika’s terms.But as Mr. Tsipras’s economic adviser sees it, whether Greece defaults or not is not the central issue. “We have to convince Europeans that the problem is not Greece but the financial architecture of the euro zone,” Mr. Tsakalotos said. “We need a central bank that prints money, euro bonds, and a system that transfers money from rich countries to poor countries.”A tall order indeed — especially for a country teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','Many political analysts say that unless Greece forms a government at the 11th hour this week, the most likely outcome after a probable new round of elections in June is another round of contentious negotiations over the terms of staying in the euro zone because neither side has a strong incentive to speed up a withdrawal. They predict, in other words, that Europe will continue to stumble through the crisis for some months to come.“Nobody can really calculate what the costs are of Greece exiting the euro, and nobody wants to test it,” said Thomas Risse, professor of international politics at the Free University in Berlin, who called recent demands for a Greek exit “carrot and stick” maneuvering. “They’re going to continue to muddle through for the time being unless something catastrophic happens.”There is still likely to be plenty of hyperbole on both sides. Staking out a hard line is part of the grander way that Europe comes to a consensus, a psychopolitical drama in which the Germans tend to play the part of the uncompromising guardians of rectitude, hoping to head off new demands from other bailout countries, like Ireland and Portugal, and even giants like Spain and France that would look for any excuse to back away from politically difficult economic reforms and spending cuts.Greek politicians, meanwhile, increasingly resemble kamikaze pilots, ready to take the European banking system down with them if their demands are not met. They do so to respond to the anger and frustration of the Greek public; only 40 percent of the Greek electorate backed the parties supporting the existing European loans-for-austerity agreement, making it nearly impossible for the next Greek government to continue the program as it stands. Yet opinion surveys also show that a majority of Greeks not only do not want to see the euro destroyed, but also want to keep using it as their own currency.But there is always a wild-card element with so many moving parts. Experts warn that brinkmanship in such an unstable political and financial environment carries the possibility of miscalculation, which could result in a Greek exit. “I think it’s a very serious risk, and the reason I say that is that there’s no room for maneuvering,” said Stefanos Manos, a former finance minister in Greece. “We have to meet various deadlines, and we won’t meet them,” Mr. Manos said.An exit would be no simple matter. There is no legal path for a country to depart the euro area, so many experts say Greece would have to leave the European Union entirely. Even economists who think Greece should leave the euro zone agree the transition would be colossally difficult, with problems like a possible refugee crisis and years of lawsuits for Greek companies.As big as the price tag may be to keep Greece afloat, cutting it loose would be much more expensive. Greece owes a tremendous amount of money to European institutions, including money lent by the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. The European Central Bank and other central banks in the euro zone hold significant amounts of Greek debt. Estimates of the total vary, but easily exceed $500 billion. If Greece left the euro zone, it would probably be unable to honor those obligations. The European Central Bank’s losses alone could wipe out its capital reserves, requiring the remaining euro zone countries to make up the shortfall.All sides have so much to lose that more negotiations are likely to follow no matter what political parties form the next Greek government. For all the tough talk in Berlin, the Germans have not even approved the permanent rescue fund, the European Stability Mechanism, which they would probably want in place before Greece left the euro zone.Many analysts say Ms. Merkel could accept some relief on Greece’s repayment terms for its European loans in exchange for ratification of the fiscal pact to rein in deficits in the long run. Over the past week, German policy makers have also signaled a willingness to accept somewhat higher inflation and higher wages at home and to promote more growth across the region.“The Greek crisis did not arise from too much saving,” Ms. Merkel said at a news conference on Monday. Yet the chancellor, the proponent of austerity, then struck an almost Keynesian note, saying, “But it is also clear that the more I grow, the better I can pay back debts, and therefore there has to be sustainable growth.”Over the weekend, the president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, Jean-Claude Juncker, appealed for patience and more time for Greece to make the painful spending cuts agreed to under the bailout deals.Dimitris Kyriakou, an economic adviser to the Greek government, said: “There is much room for negotiation. Room also grows as the fear of collapse emerges, since countries insisting on austerity have gained more from the euro and have more to lose from its collapse.”While Greece implodes, Germany is enjoying the lowest levels of unemployment since reunification after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and borrowing costs that have dropped below the rate of inflation as investors seek safe haven from the turmoil. German politicians may be indignant over what they see as unfair Greek demands, but they have little incentive to hasten a collapse.Although the political uncertainty remains high, government advisers said that Greece would not fall into disarray even if it undertook new elections in a month. In the interim, negotiations between Greece and its “troika” of foreign lenders — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund — would be conducted by a caretaker administration, most likely with a Supreme Court justice at its helm.Mr. Stournaras, the Greek economist, said that even if the Coalition of the Radical Left, or Syriza, came to power, it would not act immediately on the threat to reject the loan agreement, but first try to find a sustainable middle ground.Janis A. Emmanouilidis, a senior policy analyst at the European Policy Center in Brussels, said: “It’s something like a poker game. The question for everyone is whether they go all in. Once you decide to go all in and expose your cards, you can’t take your money out again.”'"

"'12-05-15,'0','Their differences are real, but they can be exaggerated. The fiscal pact itself has little teeth, and Mr. Hollande has already promised to obey its debt limits and even balance France’s budget by 2017, so the call for more growth versus austerity is largely political. “It is a false debate,” said Olli Rehn, the European commissioner for economic and financial affairs. “We need to stay on course for fiscal adjustment and also promote growth.”There is “a new political landscape,” Mr. Rehn said. “But policy making is not just about symbolism but substance, and there is no alternative to moving ahead with fiscal consolidation.”Everyone favors growth, but Germany will not allow old-fashioned pump-priming oiled by new deficit spending. Ms. Merkel wants sustainable growth. What Germany fears most, said Finland’s European affairs minister, Alexander Stubb, “is the French model of the euro zone — a transfer union,” in which rich countries regularly send money to poorer ones.But both sides are expected to agree to increase the resources of the European Investment Bank by as much as $12.8 billion, to reallocate unused European Union structural funds for economic growth, to support a financial transaction tax and even, some suggest, to support collective bonds to finance carefully chosen public works projects.But Mr. Hollande does not share the Anglo-German notion that sustainable growth comes mostly from structural changes like liberalizing the labor market and reducing taxes on companies to promote productivity and competitiveness. He wants at least a temporary agreement to let the European Central Bank loosen its inflationary strings beyond what the charter demands, 2 percent or lower — though inflation was already 2.6 percent in April in the euro zone, according to Eurostat. He wants the bank to emphasize growth as well as low inflation, and to be able to lend directly to governments, a charter change that Germany also rejects.Still, Ms. Merkel — with her conservative party hammered in two successive state elections, her Dutch ally facing new elections and the opposition Social Democrats praising the election of Mr. Hollande — needs to jump a bit on the growth bandwagon, however defined. As the newspaper Le Monde said on Monday, her party’s showing in the large state of North Rhine-Westphalia, with about 22 percent of German voters, “is at the same time bad news for the chancellor and good news for François Hollande.”Ms. Merkel does not want Germany to be isolated in Europe, nor does she want to ignore the new wind in left-wing sails. She knows she needs France to help guide the euro zone and the European Union. And she is likely to recognize that Greece and the Netherlands, as much as Mr. Hollande, have thrown a democratic challenge to the usual back-room European Union dealing.Still, Ms. Merkel said on Monday that she saw “no conflict between solid budgetary policy and growth,” and that the state election would have no impact on European policy.To respond to the democratic revolt and deepening recession in Greece, Mr. Hollande is likely to urge Ms. Merkel to cut Greece, Spain and Portugal a little more slack; this could include lower interest rates and more time to pay off debt, or an extension of when they must reduce their deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product, currently 2013. He may even push for a restructuring of the rest of Greek debt. But it will be a hard sell, and Mr. Hollande also has to be careful, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform in London.“If Hollande tried to gang up with, say, Italy and Spain, to force Germany into a complete U-turn, he would fail,” Mr. Grant said. “Furthermore, France has much less clout in the E.U. than Germany. The financial crisis and the euro crisis have highlighted the vulnerabilities of the French economy.”Mr. Hollande is scheduled to fly to the German capital late Tuesday afternoon after taking office and naming a prime minister. He and Ms. Merkel will meet for an hour and hold a brief news conference, followed by dinner together, German officials said. Mr. Hollande will return to France after dinner.Nils Diederich, a professor of political science at Berlin’s Free University and a former legislator, said that Ms. Merkel “has to take an interest in coming to an understanding with the Frenchman. You will notice very quickly that Ms. Merkel, step by step, moves in a different direction from the neoliberalism she has been following.”But how real the moves will be is another question. Ms. Merkel remains personally popular, and she has no more state elections until January and probably more than a year before she calls parliamentary elections, which currently look likely to produce another “grand coalition” with the Social Democrats. And German voters remain allergic to easy money and inflation. Growth may be the mantra, but no more German money to bail out other countries is the bottom line.Ms. Merkel “is one of the few politicians with a strong sense for what is necessary to keep the public in a good mood,” Mr. Diederich said. “As in the kitchen, Ms. Merkel will search for the right knife for the job.”'"
"'12-05-15,'0','The case could also affect J. J. Hickson of the Portland Trail Blazers and Chauncey Billups of the Los Angeles Clippers.At issue is whether a player retains his Bird rights when he changes teams through a waiver claim, as Lin, Novak, Hickson and Billups did this season.The union contends that a player claimed on waivers should retain all contractual benefits, as he does when he is traded. The league disagrees, citing a specific clause in the labor agreement that indicates Bird rights are lost when a player is waived, even if another team claims him.“We are confident that our interpretation of the agreement is correct,” said Mike Bass, an N.B.A. spokesman.Although the Bird rules — named for the former Celtics star Larry Bird — have been in place for years, this specific dispute had not arisen. For one, N.B.A. players are rarely claimed off waivers. And most waived players are not valuable enough for a team to invoke their Bird rights to keep them.That changed in rather dramatic fashion this season when Lin and Novak — who were both playing on minimum contracts — had breakout seasons for the Knicks after being claimed on waivers in December. Both could receive lucrative multiyear offers this summer.If Lin and Novak are determined to have so-called early-Bird rights, the Knicks could pay each one a starting salary up to the league average, about $5.3 million.Without those rights, the Knicks could offer only small raises, unless they used a cap exception, the midlevel ($5 million) or the biannual ($1.9 million).The Knicks would almost certainly need the entire midlevel exception to sign Lin, which would leave them unable to compete for Novak and Smith.Lawyers for the league consider the matter cut and dried based on definitions contained in the collective bargaining agreement. But experts across the league believed otherwise when the issue first came up. Three general managers asked in February all said they believed that Lin had retained his early-Bird rights.The league then clarified its view, and the union began pondering whether to challenge it.“I think we feel very strongly about the case,” said Novak’s agent, Mark Bartelstein, adding, “I don’t think the players association would go through the exercise if they didn’t feel strongly about the merits.”A player earns Bird rights by playing for the same team in consecutive years: two years for early-Bird rights and three for full Bird rights. An early-Bird player is eligible for the average player salary, without respect to the cap. A player with full Bird rights can sign for up to the maximum salary.Novak and Lin were in position to earn their early-Bird rights before they were waived last December, Novak by San Antonio and Lin by Golden State. (Lin was subsequently claimed, and waived again, by Houston, before joining the Knicks.)Hickson and Billups had full Bird rights before being waived (Hickson by Sacramento and Billups by the Knicks).In general, a player retains his Bird rights in a trade, because his contract transfers with him. The union contends that the same principle should apply when a player is claimed off waivers, because the contract is still in effect and — similar to a trade — the player did not choose his new team.In the union’s view, Bird rights should expire only when a player clears waivers, because he is a free agent at that point who can choose a new team and sign a new contract.The union contends that the entire rationale for allowing Bird rights to transfer was to protect players who changed teams against their will, a principle that could apply to both trades and waiver claims. (The section of the uniform player contract that deals with waiver claims, in fact, cross references the rules governing trades.)So union officials believe the spirit of the rule favors them. But if the arbitrator goes by the letter of the law, the union will probably lose the case and the Knicks will probably lose some key players.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','As its name implies, the Look & Listen Festival, now in its 11th season, is built to give audiences something to see, as well as plenty to hear. Concerts are held in galleries, and the audience is encouraged to examine the works on display, which in any case provide a striking frame for the performances.This year’s festival, which opened on Saturday evening, was at the Pratt Manhattan Gallery, amid a colorful, varied exhibition of works by 45 graduate students in fine arts at the Pratt Institute.As its contribution to the John Cage centenary, the festival commissioned a new work from Derek Bermel, whose bow to Cage’s spirit relied on indeterminacy: the score for his “Orbit Design,” inspired by Newton’s ideas about celestial mechanics, includes instructions and structural models but no pitches. It was offered in a different guise — as a percussion sextet, a flute trio or a string quartet — each night of the festival.So Percussion, augmented by the percussionist Doug Perkins and the drummer (mostly) Bobby Previte, opened Saturday’s installment with a version that had a slightly comic edge, perhaps because of the way seemingly random harmonica tones contrasted with the slow, interlocking drum patterns, the atmospheric sound of a bowed vibraphone and the occasional low rumbling that made up the rest of the texture.Most of the program was devoted to brief solo percussion pieces, performed by members of the So quartet, Mr. Perkins and Mr. Previte. Adam Sliwinski gave a shapely, thoughtfully nuanced account of David Lang’s “String of Pearls” (2007), a work in which dynamics and phrasing are left to the performer. And Josh Quillen’s deft steel drum playing in two movements (“Lullaby” and “Ligeti-Lix”) from Paul Lansky’s “Pandemonium” (2010) afforded an entirely new sense of what can be accomplished with that instrument.Several works blended percussion and electronics. In Cenk Ergun’s “Comfort Dream Queen Memory” (2011), a recording of what sounded like a fierce, muzzled dog gave way to murkier, more purely electronic, timbres, which Jason Treuting supplemented by playing a piece of plexiglass with a bow.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','In 2005, an anonymous phone call to a television program about the disappearance added a piece to the puzzle: “To find the solution to the case go and see who’s buried in the crypt of the basilica of Sant’Apollinare,” an unidentified man said, referring to the tomb of the local mob boss, Enrico De Pedis, known as Renatino, who was gunned down in Rome in 1990.The caller also implied that Emanuela had been kidnapped as a favor to Cardinal Ugo Poletti, who in 1983 was the vicar general of Rome.Cardinal Poletti died in 1997, and Archbishop Marcinkus in 2006.Questions remain about why Mr. De Pedis, a member of the Magliana crime gang, was buried in a church owned by the Holy See. His tomb is in a small locked room in a crypt under the church. Lorenzo Radogna, the lawyer for Mr. De Pedis’s wife, said Monday that the corpse would be taken to the family plot in Rome’s main cemetery or cremated.To lay rumors to rest that the Vatican had obstructed investigations into Emanuela’s disappearance, last month the Holy See agreed to the opening of Mr. De Pedis’s tomb.Pietro Orlandi, the brother of the missing girl, said Monday that the decision reflected a new collaboration between the Vatican and Italian prosecutors investigating the case.“It’s very positive,” Mr. Orlandi said. “Especially because this hadn’t been the case in the past.” The Vatican’s “silence for 29 years remains inexplicable for me,” he said. “I never expected her to be buried there, but it was important to clear up a doubt.” He said he was convinced that the truth behind his sister’s disappearance “is known to many people.”Mr. Orlandi also said he planned to lead a march to the Vatican later this month, in the hope that the pope would “publicly acknowledge” his sister.There are those who have claimed to have proof that Emanuela was still alive, and there have been reports of sightings of the now-adult Emanuela, in places like Turkey and England.One book published last month goes as far as to suggest that she is living in Rome. “The reopening of the tomb is to throw people off track,” said Roberta Hidalgo, the book’s author.Police officials on Monday confirmed that the tomb contained the body of Mr. De Pedis, identified using his fingerprints. They said tests would be carried out on the other bones found in the ancient crypt.“The hope of the family is that the remains won’t be found,” said Massimo Krogh, a lawyer for the Orlandi family. “Obviously, as long as they don’t find anything, they can hope she is still alive.”'"
"'12-05-15,'0','Broadway has experienced a steep rise in ticket prices in recent years and has been staging more musicals, revivals and other productions viewed as safer bets to lure larger audiences.But André Bishop, Lincoln Center Theater’s artistic director, said the new stage was not meant to be an antidote to mainstream theater, some of which Lincoln Center itself produces on its Tony-eligible Beaumont stage.“The thinking was, what can we do to make Lincoln Center Theater better?, not, what can we do to make American theater better?” Mr. Bishop said.“I see this as a legacy — all these young writers, directors, designers are now part of our world,” he continued. “It means I as an artistic director don’t have to do artistic direction by shopping. It’s fun to see people grow under your own roof — on top of your roof.”The company’s $42 million new theater, called the Claire Tow, was indeed built above the Beaumont. A boxy structure, it includes rehearsal space, offices and a terrace overlooking the North Plaza.LCT3 was created even before there was a stage for it; the company has rented space at the Duke on 42nd Street since 2008, and has its own artistic director, Paige Evans. Already Lincoln Center is seeing results. Amy Herzog’s play “4000 Miles” started at the Duke and moved last month to the Newhouse, where its run has been extended through June 17.But don’t call the new stage a black-box theater. “I didn’t want there to be the sense that this Lincoln Center theater was experimental,” Mr. Bishop said. “I wanted it to be another theater on a level with the others.”He added, “Many of our writers are beginning their careers, and they’re not known yet, and you want to break them in gently, yet with full production values.”While the theater is small, its ambitions will be considerably larger, with an annual budget of about $2 million and three to four productions a year; Lincoln Center Theater’s overall annual budget is $38 million.While the theater’s programming will be progressive, its aesthetic is rather traditional, with cushy red theater seats and a conventional layout. The notion of a thrust stage — like the Beaumont’s — or movable seats was rejected in favor of a standard proscenium.“We decided, let’s just have a normal space where everyone is looking in the same direction,” Mr. Bishop said.“I actually wanted limitations on the space,” he added, “so that a lot of time and effort would not be spent on, ‘What should we make the theater look like for this play?’ ”In designing the theater, Hugh Hardy, the building’s architect, used simple materials: stained oak for the lobby floors, walnut for the theater’s sloping walls. “This should not be a pretentious place,” Mr. Hardy said. “It should be made with very straightforward stuff.”At the same time, Lincoln Center “couldn’t pretend this was some East Village bar theater,” Mr. Bishop said. “That would be coy.”Lincoln Center originally considered downtown as a location for the new theater, but playwrights wanted the prestige that comes with being on the Lincoln Center campus. “These artists want to be part of the life that’s going on there already,” Mr. Bishop said. “They don’t want to be the offshoot, the stepchild.”In other ways Lincoln Center wants the theater to be un-Lincoln-Center-like, with less expensive drinks and snacks (prices still to be determined), a bar that stays open well after a performance and an informal atmosphere.For Mr. Bishop the new theater represents the fulfillment of a need he anticipated when he first came on board in 1992: to have a small theater like the one upstairs at Playwrights Horizons, where he developed productions like “Driving Miss Daisy” and “Falsettos.”Over the last few years that kind of space came to seem increasingly necessary as Lincoln Center Theater’s regular cadre of writers diminished. “We don’t have the family of artists we used to have,” Mr. Bishop said. “We need another family.”Although the project dovetailed with Lincoln Center’s larger redevelopment effort, intended to make the campus more inviting, the new theater was a tough sell. Preservationists objected to altering the Beaumont, designed by Eero Saarinen, and the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, designed by Gordon Bunshaft, which abuts it. To accommodate an elevator to the new theater, Lincoln Center had to remove some of the library’s stacks.Yet the theater managed to move ahead and raise the money. (There is about $2 million still needed.) The auditorium is named for Claire Tow, whose husband, Leonard, a board member, donated $7.5 million. The first production opens on June 4: “Slowgirl,” by Greg Pierce, directed by Anne Kauffman.“My hope,” Mr. Bishop said, “is that in 10 years or so people won’t even remember that there were only two theaters here.”'"
"'12-05-15,'0','If approved, the drug would be recommended for H.I.V.-negative people at high risk of becoming infected, like gay men who have multiple partners and do not use consistently, prostitutes and people in relationships with someone who is H.I.V.-positive.Already, though, there are reports that the drug is being prescribed to men who may not fit these criteria. Little is known about how consistently they are taking it. And that raises a big worry: viral resistance.Although Truvada alone can prevent an H.I.V. infection, it cannot control one that has already taken hold. If an H.I.V.-positive patient were to take Truvada alone, or if a user were to become infected while taking it, the H.I.V. strains they carry could become drug-resistant. The infection would be hard to treat, and it could spread to other people.To prevent drug resistance, people who want to use Truvada for prevention first would have to make sure they were H.I.V.-negative and then be retested regularly, every few months, because it is possible, though unlikely, to become infected while taking the drug. But experts testifying before the panel on Thursday acknowledged that there is no way to ensure that people taking the drug receive frequent H.I.V. tests.Then there is the question of adherence. Skipping doses or using Truvada on occasion, as if it were a party drug, would invite both infection and the emergence of drug-resistant strains. But research shows that people are not good at sticking to the required daily regimen. In one major study, only 10 percent of the participants took Truvada as directed.Side effects may be one reason: The drug can cause in the first weeks it is taken. Patients must also be monitored for kidney problems and bone thinning, rare but potentially serious complications.Perhaps the most serious concern is that some who take the drug will assume they no longer need condoms. But condoms are still necessary, because Truvada is not 100 percent effective. If people take the drug inconsistently and also skip condoms, they may wind up at even greater risk than they were before Truvada came along.At the committee meeting on Thursday, one young man said he and his friends would not abandon condoms, because they still had concerns about , and other sexually transmitted infections.But people slip up once in a while, he added, and for those lapses, Truvada might be a safety net.The F.D.A. has yet to decide whether to approve Truvada for prevention, but the agency usually follows its experts’ advice. On Thursday, one of the panel members who voted for approval also said it would be important to watch what happens once Truvada gains greater use, especially in terms of drug resistance, and to make changes if something goes wrong. It was a troubling possibility.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','In I.V.F. there was no significant difference between fresh and frozen embryos. Over all, compared with ICSI, in vitro fertilization was 32 percent less likely to result in a birth defect.This finding is particularly important, according to Michael J. Davies, the lead author. “ICSI is now being used almost as the first treatment option when people move to an invasive therapy,” he said. “This is a rapidly evolving technology, and there have been few long-term follow-ups of ICSI because it hasn’t been around long enough.” Dr. Davies is a researcher in the Robinson Institute at the University of Adelaide.Using the fertility drug Clomid (clomiphene citrate) at home without any other drugs increased the risk for birth defects, but the number of women in the study who used this technique was too small to draw firm conclusions about its risk.Women who had any fertility treatment were more likely to have a stillbirth, to have a low-birthweight baby, and to deliver before 32 weeks of gestation. Unsurprisingly, parental factors played a large role. For example, babies conceived without treatment by women who had previously had fertility treatments had a 25 percent greater risk for birth defects.Dr. Pasquale Patrizio, director of the Yale University Fertility Center, who was not involved in the study, said this was a significant finding. “The most important message that I take from this is that it confirms pretty strongly the fact that infertility itself increases the risk for birth defects. If you’re infertile, you’re already at higher risk even if you don’t take any treatment.”Although the finding of increased risk is not new, Dr. Davies said, this study provides the best data yet. “We have all births, all terminations, all treatments in a defined population, and ascertainment for birth defects through a child’s fifth birthday,” he said. “This is a unique study.”Dr. Davies said that despite the evidence of increased risk in some techniques, there is good news in the study for infertile couples.“We can now state that a cycle of a single fresh embryo transfer with I.V.F. and, if necessary, followed by the transfer of a frozen embryo will result in no significant additional risk above that of a spontaneous conception,” he said.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','In a statement, Mr. Schulze said, “I understand and accept the findings of the audit committee.”He will remain on the board through June 2013, when his current term expires, the company said.It is a major change for Mr. Schulze’s role at Best Buy. He started the company as a small music retailer in 1966 and expanded it into the nationwide electronics chain it is today. He was chief executive of the company for almost 40 years, resigning in 2002 and becoming chairman.Recently, Best Buy has struggled with how to make its fleet of giant stores relevant as online competition has increased, and Mr. Schulze has advised it. But the company lost $1.23 billion for its 2012 fiscal year, which ended March 3, at which point it outlined “major” changes. Mr. Dunn’s sudden resignation days later added to Best Buy’s troubles. The company’s fumbling of his departure, first casting it as a standard resignation then, hours later, revealing that Mr. Dunn had left midway through a personal conduct investigation, did not help matters.Analysts said Mr. Schulze’s departure would make big changes easier. It “will remove a heavily influential voice from the board of directors,” Colin McGranahan, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a note to clients, which “could lead to a cleaner break with history and could result in more strategic flexibility going forward.”Mike Mikan, a board member, is the interim chief executive, and the company has started a search for a new chief. The audit committee’s report contained many details about Mr. Dunn’s behavior that raised red flags within Best Buy.“The female employee spoke openly and frequently in the workplace about her friendship with the C.E.O. and the favors he provided to her,” the report said, and Mr. Dunn gave her tickets to at least seven concerts and sports events.Although Mr. Dunn violated company policy by asking a vendor to give the employee a free concert ticket in Las Vegas, there was “no misuse of company resources” the report said.“A significant amount of communication by text and cellphone for which there was no identifiable business purpose” occurred, the report said. During nine days of overseas travel in 2011, “the C.E.O. contacted the female employee by cellphone at least 224 times, including 33 phone calls, 149 text messages and 42 picture or video messages,” the report said.The report said that Mr. Dunn and the female employee had said their relationship “was a close friendship that was not romantic or otherwise improper.” But it said that, “Even accepting those statements as true, the relationship nevertheless reflected extremely poor judgment by the C.E.O.”The report cited the effects of the relationship, including disruption in the workplace, damaged employee morale and perceived favoritism that undermined the employee’s supervisor’s attempts to manage her.“Further, the C.E.O.’s relationship with this employee led some employees to question senior management’s commitment to company policy and the ethical principles the company champions,” the report said. “During interviews, some employees said that they felt that the rules appeared to apply to every employee except the C.E.O.,” it said.Best Buy said in a statement that the audit committee would review and enhance Best Buy’s relevant corporate policies and procedures, and that the board was supporting a shareholder proposal that directors should stand for re-election each year.“Each of us — with no exceptions — will be subject to approval by the shareholders on an annual basis,” Hatim Tyabji, the chairman-elect, said in the statement. Best Buy also disclosed the severance terms for Mr. Dunn on Monday. He will get compensation worth about $6.6 million, made up of his $1.1 million bonus for the 2012 fiscal year, a severance payment of $2.85 million and $2.5 million in stock. Mr. Schulze will be get the honorary title chairman emeritus when he officially leaves the chairmanship in June. Mr. Tyabji, a board member, will replace Mr. Schulze as chairman effective June 21, the company’s annual meeting.'"
"'12-05-15,'0','The political stalemate in Greece rattled financial markets worldwide on Monday, sending stocks lower in the United States.The euro sank to a three-month low against the dollar, and borrowing costs for Spain and Italy jumped as bond traders anticipated that financial troubles could spread beyond Greece. Investors dumped risky assets for the safety of the Treasury market, pushing yields to their lowest levels this year.The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 125.25 points, or 1 percent, to close at 12,695.35. The Dow has lost more than half its gains for the year in the last two weeks as worries have resurfaced about Europe and the strength of the American economy.In Athens, talks to form a government dragged into a second week. The uncertainty has raised concerns that Greece could miss a debt payment and drop out of the euro currency. The worry is that if Greece leaves the currency union, bond traders might demand steeper borrowing rates from other troubled countries and push them deeper into debt.The turmoil could easily spread to the United States through the banking system. “The large banks are globally connected,” said Guy LeBas, chief fixed income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott.” The concrete fear is that if Greece exits the euro, that would hurt European banks. They’ll pull back lending to U.S. banks and then they’d be in worse shape.”'"

"'12-05-16,'0','An announcement about a paper coming out in the mentions, in passing, that the silk moth is the only domesticated insect, but a little research raises somequestions: What about ? Or pet tarantulas?And how do you define domestication? Simple questions can be hard to answer. There are a lot of ingredients to domestication, including breeding animals or plants to be better at giving us milk, silk, wheat — or perhaps companionship.Then there is the question of who domesticates whom. Some wolves may have actually been the initiators of domestication, not because they thought out the future of disappearing wilderness and the growth of the pet product industry, but simply because hanging around humans meant more food would be available with less effort.Mutual gain is another aspect of domestication. We make hives for bees; they make honey for us, and help with pollination. But for some animals it’s unclear. We keep alligators in pens and then kill them for their hides, but I don’t think of them as domesticated. What about pet tarantulas? People have been known to keep tigers in their apartments, but that doesn’t mean the big cats are domestic animals.There may even be disagreement in areas that seemed to be beyond question. Years ago, when I told Vicki Hearne, the writer and dog trainer, that my family had just acquired a Pomeranian, she said, “You do know that they are not fully domesticated?”All thoughts and nominations for domestic animals are welcome.

Colfajas, which manufactures fajas and exports them from Colombia, raised its production by 47 percent last year and exported 60,000 items, thousands more than in past years, said Jean Pierre Velez, who helps run the family-owned company.Y & K, a small clothing and lingerie shop on Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens, regularly sells out the roughly 4,000 fajas it ships in each year.The fajas comes in a variety of shapes and sizes, from full-body jumpsuits to tight belly bands, for women as well as men. The effects depend on the fabric heft of the fajas; they come in Lycra, cotton, nylon and latex. The less forgiving the material, the more flattering the effect. Prices typically run from $20 to over $70, depending on the fabric and how much of the body it covers.“There is a Spanish saying, you want to look ‘like a Coke bottle,’ ” said Lilliana Rios, 33, who reflects on the faja on her blog . “A lot of Spanish songs talk about women with shapes like a guitar, so that’s the curved look that Latina women want.”Getting the look requires some grit. Tugging on a faja can become a desperate bout of woman versus fabric. Flesh must be coaxed inside, battened down by hooks and, finally, sealed with a zipper that can force the air out of your lungs.“The first day you can’t stand it,” Ms. Murillo said. “But then it loosens it up.”Hidden under clothes the results may be sexy, but fajas are not. Most are the color of an Ace bandage and resemble body casts. Some are configured to squeeze certain areas and leave others to jiggle.Juan Lopez and his partner, Monica Arias, import the PonteBella brand of fajas from Colombia to Valley Stream, N.Y., on . Though they started out selling to medical and plastic surgeons, orders from the fashion market overtook medical sales about five years ago, Mr. Lopez said.More recently, calls have been pouring in from unexpected places: retailers in Great Neck and Garden City, also on Long Island, where the Latino populations are small.“In the beginning, it was almost only for Latinos and black women,” Ms. Arias said. “Now the white people are asking for fajas.”Recognizing the changing market, Ms. Arias said, the company began selling softer versions to appeal to a wider audience: some women’s ideal body might not involve the roller-coaster curves favored in Latin America. Girdles, once de rigueur, mostly disappeared during the 1960s, said Valerie Steele, the author of “The Corset: A Cultural History” and the director and chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology.“Clothing was showing more of the body, so it wasn’t good enough to just push the fat around,” she said. “The other reason was the thought that you shouldn’t have to rely on it, you were supposed to be healthy and in good shape already.”The feminist movement, Ms. Steele added, rejected the girdle as a symbol of repression, even as it fell out of fashion.The newfound popularity of fajas comes at a time when skyrocketing rates crash into a body ideal that seems skinnier than ever. “There’s this radical disjunction between an ideal, which is slender and muscular, and a reality that more and more people are dramatically overweight,” Ms. Steele said.At Aishti, his store in Jackson Heights, Queens, Moussa Balaghi has begun carrying girdles in size “extra small,” because, to his shock, so many teenagers and even younger girls were coming in to request them. “Only chubby fat girls used to use this; now, everybody is,” he said, shaking his head. “If she has the smallest little thing at her waist, she wants to use this.”Ms. Rios, the blogger, said new fabrics had replaced the rubberized material of the old corsets, which were often reinforced with stiff struts called boning. And implicit celebrity endorsements helped popularize the new version for a new generation.“Fajas to me were something my mother would wear,” Ms. Rios said. “Now Spanx came along and you see wearing it, wearing it. Now it’s at a comfort level that women at any size and any age are wearing them.”At Caralinda Mis Fajas, clients ease their way into tighter and tighter fajas. A seamstress will resize the faja once or twice as a customer’s weight shifts downward. And it often does: a faja can hold the stomach so tight, Ms. Cipriani said, the wearer loses her appetite.'"
"'12-05-16,'0','Dimon doesn’t buy the argument that bosses of big, complex companies can never make mistakes. A smart quarterback still needs great defensive ends, as he puts it, or the guy who runs can’t ensure all the meat is fresh.has been rocked by a “shareholder spring,” a revolution of ordinarily placid investors vetoing bloated deals and bonuses. Three top executives of British firms were sacked in revolts of shareholders, who also rose up against giving new executives millions in “golden hellos.”As a pay advisory body crisply put it, “It is unclear how a golden hello benefits shareholders.”It is redolent of the classic movie with Judy Holliday as a scrappy small stockholder, challenging the board of directors about fat salaries and dubious policies.With C.E.O. pay going stratospheric as workers’ pay grew stagnant, anger was bound to erupt.Yet there wasn’t much ire at the annual shareholders meeting in on Tuesday. It was over quickly and painlessly, despite — or maybe because of — Dimon’s admission on “Meet the Press” that his team was “sloppy” and “stupid” and used “bad judgment” in incurring the loss, which has led to the rolling of three heads at the bank, an investigation, and a Congressional ramp-up for more chiding hearings.Talking even faster than usual, the tarnished silver-haired banker told shareholders that he couldn’t justify the “self-inflicted” debacle. While the trade was “poorly vetted and poorly executed,” he said it wouldn’t make a dent in the “fortress balance sheet.”A few shareholders asked pointed but polite questions, but most supported Dimon. “We think you are doing a fabulous job,” one Tampa shareholder told the C.E.O. Outside, a paltry 20 protesters gathered.The Rev. Seamus Finn, representing shareholders from the Catholic organization Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate, did gently press the boss: “We’re wondering, Mr. Dimon, given what we’ve learned, do you still believe a company can self-regulate when trading on their own accounts?” He added: “Furthermore, should our company really be spending shareholder funds on, some $7 million last year alone, on lobbying efforts to thwart the Dodd-Frank legislation and the work of regulators to write the rules stemming from that legislation?”The priest concluded that the shareholders, “weary of mistakes” and pledges to reform, wonder if Dimon is listening.But the group endorsed Dimon’s pay package of $23 million and let him keep his dual titles of chairman and C.E.O.Dimon says he’s a “barely Democrat,” but he’s known as the favorite banker of the president, who called Dimon “one of the smartest bankers we got” on “The View” on Tuesday. ’s financial disclosure report released on Tuesday showed a checking account at JPMorgan worth $500,000 to $1 million, and in 2010 the president defended Dimon’s $17 million bonus, on top of compensation in 2010 and 2011 of $23 million.’s chief audit officer is urging Dimon to “claw back” salary and bonuses paid to the top executives who dragged the bank into the excessive risk. That would be a first for Wall Street. Dimon says he is “likely” to do it, but is loath to “act like a judge and jury” with Ina Drew, the head of the investment office who resigned on Monday, given that she lost $2 billion on that deal while she was making $9 billion on others.He knows he has to claw his way back to high regard.“I never put myself on a pedestal,” he said. “You lose credibility, you have to earn it back. You have to earn respect every day. It’s never how great we are. It’s always the good, the bad and the ugly.”'"
"'12-05-16,'0','Mr. Lu practices several ancient Chinese art forms, and says he hails from a noted Shanghai teaching lineage. On weekends, he teaches calligraphy, painting and cutting at the New York Chinese Cultural Center. He said that in Shanghai, his birth city, he was renowned for stone sculpture and stamp seal carving. He credits the facial portraits to his formative training in a three-dimensional form.Paper-cutting dates to the Han dynasty but it is traditionally associated with designs like animals and flowers. But Mr. Lu has adapted the technique for facial portraits. “You’re not going to see anybody doing the faces,” said Alex Gombach, one of Mr. Lu’s oldest students. “That’s really his own thing.”“When you see those subway faces in their totality, it’s a New York portrait,” Mr. Gombach continued. “You’ve got a young black woman, an Orthodox Jew, a white guy. It’s a New York story.”On a recent Thursday night, Mr. Lu, Chinese-language newspapers scattered at his feet, trimmed the visage of a rider while Jason Kraut, 39, filmed it on his smartphone. An L train blasted off into the tunnel, threatening to dislodge his works, but Mr. Lu swiveled the folded paper through his scissors, paying no attention to the ruckus.Mr. Kraut, who often passes Mr. Lu on the L platform on his commute to Park Slope, Brooklyn, analyzed the cutting as if he were in a museum. “This makes me think of Chet Baker blowing those changes,” he said, referring to the jazz trumpeter. “I have no idea what’s going on. Same with this.” He decided: “I need to have one.”Mr. Lu is pleased if a rider wants a portrait — he accepted $20 for a small, live portrait — but he is also content just cutting an interesting face.“Not about money,” he said. “About face.”Another session drew a crowd of backpack-wearing riders, complete with shushes and quiet faces of awe. Mr. Lu recognized one of the audience members, Kristen Mucci, and gave her a hug.“How’s your husband?” he asked her before returning to his work. Two years ago, Ms. Mucci hired Mr. Lu for her birthday.“He was a big hit,” she said. “We had it at a bar in Williamsburg. Something different. Half the payoff is watching him create such frail, delicate things. It looks like he’s just touching a piece of paper, but they all come out different. It’s not canned.”Mr. Lu is not as dainty as his creations. He has cropped black hair, and a scent of cigarettes follows him. His English is rudimentary, but effective enough to plant disarming compliments to charm riders into modeling for him.He resumed his routine the following night, turning from his Sing Tao Daily upon noticing a possibly trim-worthy face. “I love your face,” he said as he started trimming the likeness of the bearded man’s face. The rider abandoned Mr. Lu when his train arrived. Mr. Lu completed the portrait accurately without visual aid. He taped it to his wall and returned to his newspaper.Later, Raymond Colletti, intrigued by the three-dimensional portraits popping up from the subway wall, approached.Mr. Lu turned from his newspaper. “How you, my friend?” he said. “How old? Very nice young man.”Mr. Colletti had little say in the matter. Mr. Lu started cutting as a rackety train dashed past.'"

"'12-05-16,'0','Alex Getelman was still in his 20s when he turned his nascent company into what he called “New York City’s fastest-growing general contracting and construction management firm.” He had a list of blue-chip clients, a plush office on 57th Street and a luxurious home on Long Island’s North Shore.But in order to help pay for his castlelike stone house on 3.3 acres in Old Brookville, prosecutors charged, Mr. Getelman systematically inflated the cost of work for one of the largest hedge funds in the world, Citadel Investment Group. Between 2008 and 2011, Mr. Getelman stole $1.2 million from Citadel as his company, Aragon, built offices for the hedge fund in the skyscraper at 601 Lexington Avenue, the former Citicorp Center, according to the complaint filed on Tuesday by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. The contractor also failed to declare the extra income and pay $286,000 in taxes, the complaint said.On Tuesday, Mr. Getelman, now 39, pleaded not guilty to one count of grand larceny and one count of filing a false tax return in Criminal Court in Lower Manhattan.Citadel, which declined to comment, has been the comeback kid of the hedge-fund world. After the company stumbled badly in 2008, its founder, Kenneth C. Griffin, earned a 20 percent return for his investors last year and a $700 million paycheck.The charges against Mr. Getelman are the latest case in a long-running investigation into the interior construction industry by the district attorney’s rackets bureau and the special investigations unit of the State Police.'"
"'12-05-16,'0','Several analysts believe that GM’s decision will cause other marketers to take at least a second look at their own Facebook strategy. Melissa Parrish, an analyst at Forrester, wrote in an e-mail that the move would force Facebook to listen more closely to marketers.“My colleagues and I have spoken with several other advertisers who were already thinking of putting their dollars elsewhere,” Ms. Parrish said. “Now that G.M. has done so in such a large and public way, many of the fence-sitters will know that they’re not alone in their disappointment about their results.” According to Forrester, Facebook made just under $4 in revenue per user in 2011.General Motors, which spends about $3 billion on advertising annually worldwide, has advertised on Facebook since 2008. In January, G.M. consolidated its media planning and buying operations, giving Carat, part of the Aegis Media unit of the Aegis Group, the job. The automaker will continue to have a presence on Facebook with free content like the existing brand pages. Mr. Henderson said Facebook “continues to be a very effective tool for engaging with our customers.”A person briefed on the discussions between the companies said that G.M. spent a total of about $40 million on Facebook annually, most of that on managing its own presence and developing applications. This person, who asked not to be identified discussing private negotiations, said that Facebook had advised the company to spend less money on developing applications and more money on advertising and promotion. “They didn’t use paid media to get the message out,” the person said.Debra Aho Williamson, a principal analyst at the research company eMarketer said that “if G.M. is spending $40 million year and $30 million of that is going toward managing its page, that’s a lot of money.”“The advertising on Facebook helps brands extend their message,” said Ms. Williamson. “The challenge for G.M. is, can they do that without actively marketing and paying Facebook for advertising?”When Facebook held its first advertising conference in February, the reaction from marketers was mixed. Rumors that Facebook would announce its own ad network, allowing advertisers to buy inventory on the site in real time, did not materialize. Instead, advertisers were given more places to put their ads, including on the log-out page and in a user’s news feed.Ben Winkler, the chief digital officer at OMD, an agency in the Omnicom Media Group, said that while Facebook was a great mechanism for communicating and sharing content, it did not provide advertisers with the amount of data and analytics that they want from the site. “It will cause a ripple effect,” Mr. Winkler said about G.M.’s pullback. “It will make advertisers consider what they are spending.”One company that disagreed with G.M.’s decision was its Detroit rival, Ford. In a statement, the company said, “We’ve found Facebook ads to be very effective when strategically combined with engagement, great content and innovative ways of storytelling, rather than treating them as a straight media buy.”'"
"'12-05-16,'0','The New York Police Department has agreed to inform all officers of, and train new recruits in, the rules under which they may order livery passengers out of cabs, detain and search them.The agreement was part of a settlement this week with the New York Civil Liberties Union, which claimed in a lawsuit filed last year that the police were engaged in a “practice of detaining, questioning, frisking and searching” livery passengers without suspicion of wrongdoing.The cabs were being stopped under the Taxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program, or TRIP, in which drivers display a window decal that says the police may pull them over at any time to check on their safety. While the lawsuit did not challenge the program itself, it claimed that the police were using it as a license to remove livery passengers for questioning and searches.It also contended that because livery cabs operated predominantly in nonwhite neighborhoods, it was often members of minority groups who bore “the brunt of this unlawful practice.”The lawsuit was filed on behalf of two men — Terrence Battle, who is black and was then a radio executive living in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn; and Munir Pujara, a lawyer of South Asian descent living in Harlem — who said they had been removed from cabs without justification.'"
"'12-05-16,'0','That has left little evidence. “The only absolutely certain way to know who was there is to dig,” said Ms. O’Neal, 65, a retired art conservator who has led the family’s opposition to the development. “And that’s something we obviously think should be avoided.”Walmart says it will redraw construction plans in any way necessary. “We really want to do the right thing,” said Bill Wertz, a company spokesman. “As we’ve gotten into it, we’ve discovered there’s a certain degree of uncertainty about what the boundaries of the real cemetery are.”The City Council voted Tuesday night to rezone the land from a residential property to a commercial one. If approved by state historical, environmental and transportation officials, Walmart would be allowed to build the store.Many residents in this city of 39,000 have resisted any kind of development on the tract, 160 forested acres beside a sleepy, middle-class neighborhood. “No Walmart” signs were placed along the property, and a group called Citizens Against Urban Sprawl gathered hundreds of signatures on a petition and made a short historical video that calls the cemetery “a place of sacred beauty so far untouched by city life.”What historical clues exist are perplexing. By all accounts, the cemetery was an acre, and a deed from 1903 says it was an exact square, with General Coffee’s grave in the center. But aerial photographs taken by the Tennessee Valley Authority at midcentury suggest it may have been a rectangle. If so, one end of the cemetery would be under Walmart’s proposed road. A separate, slightly better-preserved slave cemetery on another part of the property contains an unknown number of bodies.In a report to the Alabama Historical Commission this month, a team of private archaeologists using ground-penetrating radar concluded that the rectangular shape was “unlikely to have been used as a cemetery.” But a geographer and a historian from the University of North Alabama found depressions in the soil that suggest burials may have occurred where Walmart plans to build.City Council members said the Walmart project would be an economic benefit for the city. “Strictly from a business perspective, it’s going to create numerous jobs,” Councilman William Jordan said.No living descendants of General Coffee’s slaves have been identified. But many African-Americans in Florence trace their ancestry to slaves who worked in the nearby soybean and cotton fields.One, Shirley Rowell Carter, 58, retired from a job at a dry cleaners, said it seemed distasteful to build a store so close to the graveyard, even if no human remains were disturbed. “If they just start digging, that’s devastating no matter what color the people were,” she said. “It’s just inhumane.”Any human remains except for tooth enamel would have decayed long ago, said Greg Gaston, the University of North Alabama geography professor who surveyed the site. But that does not take away the historical value of the property or the need to handle the development with sensitivity, he said.“We’re not trying to say Walmart should not be here,” he said. “We’re just trying to make this decision based on the facts — who was buried where.”'"
"'12-05-16,'0','For the fifth time in three years, the Museum for African Art has been forced to delay opening its new home at 110th Street and Fifth Avenue, in East Harlem, as it continues to work to raise the money to finish the project.Elsie McCabe Thompson, the museum’s president, said the institution needed to raise about $10 million to finish construction on the site, which occupies the bottom floors of a 19-story luxury condominium designed by Robert A. M. Stern.Ms. Thompson declined to say just when the museum, which had been slated to open later this year, would be ready. It closed the gallery in its temporary quarters in Long Island City, Queens, nearly seven years ago to focus on the new development.“With some soul-searching, we decided not to open a portion of the building,” she said, or do a cheaper design that would drain “out the very life of the building.” Ms. Thompson, who has worked for 15 years to convert her dream into bricks and mortar — or, in this case, concrete and aluminum — added, “Africa deserves the best that we could give it.”As of last year, the museum said, it had raised a total of $86.3 million for the project, which includes an education center, a library, a cafe and a gift shop. A June 2011 financial statement showed that it had received more than $20 million from the city and state in the previous 12 months; the federal government has chipped in with tax credits. The more than 70,000-square-foot space cost nearly $44 million, according to the financial statement.“Elsie dreams big,” said Margarita Aguilar, executive director of El Museo del Barrio, several blocks south on Fifth Avenue. Ms. Aguilar has developed and hosted educational programs with the African art museum and said the museum’s opening should increase traffic to neighboring arts institutions, turning the area into a “cultural hub.”'"
"'12-05-16,'0','Does anyone at American Ballet Theater conceive of ballet as an art free of the manipulation of women by men, and of the clichéd pyrotechnics of repeated turns and jumps? It was hard to think so at its depressing opening gala on Monday.True, there were a few exhilarating sections. Diana Vishneva and Marcelo Gomes were convincingly rapturous in the balcony scene from Kenneth MacMillan’s “Romeo and Juliet.” Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev, even though they have left the Bolshoi Ballet, exemplified the best Bolshoi tradition of inflating a cartload of clichés (the “Flames of Paris” pas de deux, attributed to Vasily Vainonen) with outstandingly larger-than-life exuberance. Alina Cojocaru and Angel Corella, lovable dancers both, were mega-lovable in the Act I pas de deux from MacMillan’s “Manon.”Still, there were many moments when I thought I was in the Inferno, and that ballet had gone there ahead of me. Even though the performance started late, some latecomers in the darkened Metropolitan Opera House stood and argued about where they should be sitting, so that whole rows behind them could seldom see the first piece at all. One man, who had announced “Throw ’em out!” during the music when he was told people were in his family’s seats, was still wandering slowly and confusedly up and down the aisle during the second piece while people hissed at him, “This is a ballet!”Caroline Kennedy made the annual Caroline Kennedy Speech. This time she said that her mother would have been thrilled to see the children of the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School dance later in the evening. This is not the kindest thing I have heard about Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: the routine they danced, “Polonaise d’Enfants,” by Raymond Lukens, made the students look efficiently trite.The solo violinist was seldom in tune throughout the evening, but he reserved his flattest and scratchiest playing for the pas de deux from Act II of “Swan Lake,” during which Irina Dvorovenko and Maxim Beloserkovsky delivered their steely version of soulfulness and pathos. The most famous American dancer present, David Hallberg, was confined to a partnering section of “La Bayadère.” I liked the slow, solitary exit he made doing a backbend, looking farther and farther up: It suggested that his ballerina (Polina Semionova) was hovering high above the Met stage and that he was hoping she might not notice his escape into the wings.There were three bikini-tutus, three bedroom pas de deux and three sets of fouetté turns. The bikini-tutu is my least favorite form of dance apparel; the three odalisques (harem slaves, remarkably unlike those famously painted by Ingres or Matisse) from Ballet Theater’s version of “Le Corsaire” had sleeves. Here they are assigned to Act I, which would have been news to Marius Petipa — the main choreographer to whom all versions of “Le Corsaire” are now attributed — since in the original version (and the current Mariinsky and Bolshoi productions) they occur in later acts.'"

"'12-05-16,'0','Signals that a deal was in the works began when President Asif Ali Zardari’s spokesman, Farhatullah Babar, said on Tuesday that NATO had invited Mr. Zardari to the summit meeting and that he would consider attending “in the light of the Parliament’s guidelines and government’s advice.” But one senior government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Zardari had already decided to accept. “Mr. Zardari is keen to attend the Chicago summit and will travel to the United States,” the official said.American and NATO officials have considered it critical that Pakistan be represented at the conference, which is centered on Afghanistan’s future after the end of the NATO military mission there in 2014. Pakistan holds many of the cards when Afghanistan’s stability is involved, not least because many of the Taliban’s senior insurgent leaders are based on Pakistani soil.“This meeting will underline the strong commitment of the international community to the people of Afghanistan and to its future,” Oana Lungescu, a spokeswoman for NATO headquarters in Brussels, said in a statement. “Pakistan has an important role to play in that future.”Senior Obama administration officials said that there had been enough progress on talks, which have lasted weeks, to reopen the supply routes, and that the deal was close enough to extend the invitation to attend the summit meeting.“We do want to see these land routes opened,” the State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said in Washington. “We are continuing to work on it. But we thought it was important to have them at the summit in this partnership role.”It is not yet clear whether President Obama would hold a separate meeting with Mr. Zardari, if the Pakistan leader attends, American officials said. Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani met on the sidelines of a nuclear summit meeting in Seoul, South Korea, in March.Many Pakistani officials said the NATO invitation was a critical step in helping secure a supply line deal. The public display of indecision over whether to attend was widely seen as playing to a domestic audience in which anti-American sentiment runs high.Earlier on Monday, Hina Rabbani Khar, the Pakistani foreign minister, told reporters in Islamabad that six months after the Salala border episode, time had come to move on and that NATO supplies could not be stopped indefinitely.“I think we need a closure on that and move on,” Ms. Khar said at a news briefing.“We want to continue to be a facilitator, enabler and not a blocker,” Ms. Khar said. “Reopening will happen when it will happen. The issue is not just that of relations with the U.S. but with other 42 countries that have stakes in Afghanistan,” she said.Senior American officials said the two sides had not yet resolved two other thorny issues: more than $1 billion in payments Pakistan says the United States owes for deploying some 150,000 troops along the border with Afghanistan; and an apology for the airstrike last November.'"
"'12-05-16,'0','ALBANY — The state ethics commission has begun a preliminary inquiry of the State Senate’s second highest-ranking member, Thomas W. Libous, people with knowledge of the matter said Tuesday.The inquiry is the first known review of a case involving a legislator by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics, which was created last year to combine ethics enforcement of both the executive and legislative branches. Before that, legislators exclusively policed their own ethics violations and rarely imposed any disciplinary action. The inquiry was reported by The Times Union of Albany.The inquiry into Senator Libous, a Republican from Binghamton, was prompted after the commission received a complaint from that city’s mayor, Matthew T. Ryan, a Democrat who is a political rival of Mr. Libous, claiming the senator had misused his office in seeking a job for his son. The commission cannot proceed with a formal investigation or issue subpoenas, however, until it is approved by a vote of the full commission.Mr. Libous received what is known as a 15-day letter, the typical first step in a preliminary inquiry that informs the subject of the complaint and gives that person 15 days to provide a response. The inquiry stems from a claim, made by a witness testifying in a Yonkers corruption case, that Mr. Libous got his son a job at a law firm in exchange for promising the firm state business.Mr. Ryan made the complaint after learning of the testimony in the case, which led to the conviction of a former Yonkers councilwoman and a former Yonkers Republican Party leader.'"
"'12-05-16,'0','BRUSSELS — With a $2 billion loss by JPMorgan Chase in London serving as a reminder that risky trading has not gone away, European Union finance ministers broke an impasse Tuesday and agreed on a plan to force banks to hold more capital as a buffer against the unexpected.The unanimous move came after a compromise that allowed Britain — which held up passage of the package last week during a 16-hour marathon meeting — to impose tougher standards than the international minimum.The British government, which was forced to partially nationalize the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group during the financial crisis, called the deal “an important step towards a safer and stronger banking system in Europe, and one that will help protect the taxpayer from picking up the bill when things go wrong in the way they have had to do over the past few years.”The agreement was required for Europe to implement new global rules on banking standards known as Basel III, which were endorsed by the Group of 20 largest economies in 2010 and are meant to force banks to sock away more cash for bad times.The draft approved by ministers means negotiations can begin on a final text with the European Parliament, where a committee passed its own version late Monday. The Parliament’s version includes an additional measure that would forbid banks from awarding bonuses that are higher than an employee’s annual base salary — a response to continued public anger over outsized pay in the financial sector.'"

"'12-05-16,'0','“In the current context, zero growth in the euro zone in the first quarter is relatively good news,” Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said in a statement. “It suggests that the economy is not falling off a cliff under the burden of fiscal austerity.”In the fourth quarter of 2011, gross domestic product in the euro zone had declined 0.3 percent. A second consecutive quarter of decline would have met the general definition of a recession.Germany’s economy expanded 0.5 percent in the first quarter, more than analysts expected. But France did not grow at all, Spain’s economy slipped 0.3 percent, and Italy experienced a 0.8 percent decline in output.The divergence in the numbers, which officials adjusted for seasonal effects, showed that there remains a wide gulf between Northern and Southern Europe.“Even if the euro zone as a whole narrowly escaped technical recession in the first quarter, there is no sign of a strong, sustained economic bounceback on the horizon,” Martin van Vliet, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients. The data, he said, “offers scant consolation for the peripheral economies, where the recession is deepening and whose economic fortunes look bleak at best and downright depressing at worst.”The growth numbers arrived hours before François Hollande, newly sworn in as French president, traveled to Berlin, where he was to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel. She was likely to see the data as vindication of her position that growth must be the product of sound government finances and economic restructuring, not the stimulus advocated by Mr. Hollande.The Greek economy has shrunk by more than a quarter since 2008, and continued to plunge at the beginning of the year without adjusting for seasonal effects, although at a slower velocity. While Greece’s official statisticians do not make such adjustments, statistics agencies in most countries adjust quarterly data to reflect the fact that economic activity typically picks up at the end of a year and slows at the beginning of the next.Another euro zone trouble spot, Portugal, also performed less dismally than expected. Its economy shrank 0.1 percent in the first quarter from the previous quarter, compared with a 1 percent decline that analysts had forecast.Portugal, which is seen as having done more than Greece to improve economic performance, may have benefited from stronger exports. But Mr. Fois of Barclays said a recovery probably remains distant.“Expecting sustained growth in the short term would be a bit optimistic,” he said. “You still have a lot of fiscal austerity to come through.”Germany has benefited from the European Central Bank’s low lending rate of 1 percent, a benchmark that is set with the euro zone as a whole in mind but is probably too low for German conditions.While credit is tight in much of Europe, it is still available in Germany at inexpensive rates that have pushed up real estate prices in urban areas. German wages are also likely to rise as companies have trouble finding skilled workers, fueling inflation which is already above the official target of about 2 percent.Higher wages and inflation in Germany are likely to trouble some policy makers and segments of the German public, but may be good news for other countries in Europe. They would have an easier time competing with Germany for investment, while higher wages might increase German demand for their products.“Robust German demand is essential to help offset falling domestic activity in the peripheral countries,” Ms. Diron said.Germany depends on trade with other euro zone members, and in coming months there is a risk its economy may suffer from problems in countries like Italy and Spain.“The highly competitive German economy has not entered a recession,” Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank, wrote in a note. “Still, it is unlikely to expand at the same pace in the next few months.”'"
"'12-05-16,'0','The charges on Tuesday relate to cover-up activities suspected to have occurred in a two-week period last summer, involving six people, and issues that will be easier for prosecutors to put to a jury, the experts said. By contrast, the allegations of phone hacking involve as victims at least 800 politicians, celebrities, crime victims and others, and a lengthy roll call of editors, reporters and investigators at the two tabloids who may have been involved. Complex issues of “who said what to whom and when” are likely to come up in any phone-hacking trials, as well as a likely argument from the defense that legal red lines were crossed in pursuit of issues that were in the public interest.The heightened scrutiny of the tabloid practices began last summer when it was disclosed that hacking at The News of the World included the cellphone of a 13-year-old London schoolgirl, Milly Dowler, whose messages had been intercepted after she was abducted and before her body was discovered. That prompted Rupert and James Murdoch to fly to London and close the 168-year-old tabloid. Ms. Brooks, a former editor of the paper, quickly resigned as chief executive of News International, the Murdoch newspaper subsidiary in Britain. She was arrested the first time shortly afterward.The two Murdochs then went before Parliament to testify about the affair, denying any cover-up by News International or , the New York-based media conglomerate controlled by the Murdoch family. But by then the scandal, revealing the widespread contacts and influence that the Murdochs and their aides had at the heart of government, had developed a strong political taint, and Rupert Murdoch bowed to the mounting scrutiny by withdrawing a $12 billion takeover bid for , the country’s most lucrative satellite broadcasting network.It was in the midst of those events — between July 6 and July 19, 2011 — prosecutors said on Tuesday, that Ms. Brooks, her husband and the four others, including her private assistant at News International, her chauffeur and a bodyguard, were engaged in concealing documents, computers, electronic devices and archive material from Scotland Yard investigators.The decision to prosecute Ms. Brooks and her husband was seen as a major blow to Rupert Murdoch, who put Ms. Brooks on the fast track to one of the most powerful positions in News Corporation’s worldwide empire, and who stood by her as the scandal spread. It was a blow, too, to Mr. Cameron. By his own account, he has maintained a cozy social relationship with Ms. Brooks and her husband, — a prominent racehorse trainer who, like Mr. Cameron, was educated at — both when he was in the opposition and, since 2010, as prime minister.The charges drew a combative response from the Brookses even before prosecutors announced the details. In a statement, they left little doubt that their defense would rest on claims that they are high-profile scapegoats and that a trial is an attempt to deflect some of the pressure that the scandal has placed on politicians and the police.“We deplore this weak and unjust decision,” they said of the charges, which they dismissed in a meeting with reporters later as nothing more than a “witch hunt” and an “expensive sideshow.”Before a bank of cameras under rainy skies in London, Ms. Brooks and her husband decried the prosecution, denied wrongdoing and questioned whether the decision to charge them had been motivated by public pressure.Mr. Brooks said that he felt he and the others arrested with his wife were being used “to ratchet up the pressure” on Ms. Brooks. She could not, he said, expect a fair trial. Ms. Brooks said she was “baffled by the decision to charge me today,” questioned whether it was “made on a proper, impartial assessment of the evidence” and said she was angry that those around her — her husband and former colleagues — had been “dragged into this.”The prosecution service said it had received a file of evidence from the police on March 27 concerning Ms. Brooks, her husband and five other suspects. The prosecutors’ statement identified the other suspects as Cheryl Carter, Ms. Brooks’ personal assistant; Mark Hanna, the head of security at News International; a chauffeur, Paul Edwards; and two security consultants, Daryl Jorsling and a second suspect who was not named. The unidentified suspect was not charged.Alison Levitt, a top lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, said all the suspects conspired to “conceal material” from police officers and to “remove seven boxes of material from the archive of News International.” Ms. Brooks, Mr. Brooks, Mr. Hanna, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Jorsling also conspired “to conceal documents, computers and other electronic equipment” that bore on the continuing police investigations into phone hacking and corruption of public officials by The News of the World and , Ms. Levitt said.While the maximum legal penalty for the offense is life in prison, legal experts said Ms. Brooks and the others accused could receive jail terms of several months, or as much as four or five years, if convicted. Fleeting glimpses of what may emerge at the trials of Ms. Brooks and the others have emerged in newspaper coverage of the scandal.According to two former staff members at The News of the World who did not want to be identified because they were discussing a topic that was the subject of a police investigation, Ms. Carter, the former personal assistant, was fiercely loyal to Ms. Brooks.An individual who was present on the day that Ms. Brooks cleared out her office after her resignation was announced on July 15, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Ms. Brooks and Ms. Carter were seen carrying items to a parked car. Friends of Ms. Carter’s have said that she was subsequently required to surrender her passport to the police and cancel plans to emigrate to . A lawyer for Ms. Carter said that she vigorously denied the charges.It is unclear what Mr. Brooks, who has strong ties to Mr. Cameron’s Conservative Party, is suspected of having done. But The Guardian reported in July that he was involved in a peculiar episode featuring a laptop left in a bag in a garbage can in a parking garage near the London apartment he shares with his wife.According to the newspaper, the bag, which also held some papers, was unearthed by security guards, who called the police. Mr. Brooks then tried to reclaim the items but could not prove they were his. A spokesman for Mr. Brooks told The Guardian that he had “left the bag with a friend who was returning it, but dropped it in the wrong part of the garage.”'"

"'12-05-17,'0','Even when his club took a 2-1 lead in the second period on goals by Marc Staal and Chris Kreider, Tortorella did not look satisfied. It has been a hallmark of Tortorella, who led Tampa Bay to the Stanley Cup in 2004 and is a finalist this season for the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year, never to be satisfied.Then Ryan Carter scored late in the second period to tie the score for the Devils, and Tortorella’s angst seemed more justified than ever.Marian Gaborik, the Rangers’ best goal scorer, failed to clear the puck out of the defensive zone, leading to a shot by Bryce Salvador that was tipped in by Carter. Gaborik also had a chance to block Salvador’s shot, but he did not attack it with the zeal many of his teammates have shown during the playoffs.Although the Rangers needed a goal, especially after David Clarkson gave the Devils a 3-2 lead they never relinquished early in the third, Tortorella benched Gaborik until 8:58 remained in the game.Asked if he could share his reasons for sitting Gaborik, Tortorella said, “No.”Gaborik said, “On the second goal, I didn’t get the puck out.” Referring to Tortorella, Gaborik added, “You’ll have to ask him.”The Rangers’ offense executed on a pair of the kind of workmanlike goals they need to score to excel in the playoffs. Staal’s goal, a bank shot from the point off the backboards that was fumbled by Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, came with Derek Stepan standing inches outside the crease. Kreider’s goal was a tip of an Anton Stralman shot from the point. The goals were so “greasy,” in the hockey parlance, that the official scorer initially credited them to the wrong Rangers.But at the other end of the ice, the Rangers often seemed a step slower than the Devils. The same was true in Game 1 on Monday, especially when the Devils dominated the second period, but Henrik Lundqvist kept the Devils scoreless and the Rangers found their legs in the third period for a 3-0 win.The Rangers, who never quite found their game from the beginning, did not win any period of Game 2.“Tonight is one of those rare nights and we just didn’t have it,” Hagelin said. “No matter what we tried, we never got going and we lost too many battles. Everyone in here is angry.”In the only extensive answer of his postgame meeting with reporters, Tortorella said, “You need to improve as a hockey team every game.”“They wanted it more,” Lundqvist said in a painful admission for any player.The Rangers will use the two days without games before Game 3 in Newark on Saturday afternoon to rest on Thursday, practice on Friday and watch a lot of video.As they did for most of Game 2, the Rangers will also hear plenty from Tortorella.“There are things we can fix,” Staal said. “And we’re going to.”'"
"'12-05-17,'0','Criminal trials for central players in the scandal could air new information. Among those who could face charges is Andy Coulson, the former editor of The News of the World who later became Mr. Cameron’s director of communications.If it is proved that those in Mr. Murdoch’s employ conspired to pay public officials to further business interests, experts say he could be at risk of sanctions in the United States under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Even a small fine would threaten to take the scandal across the Atlantic, and increase political pressure on Mr. Murdoch’s lucrative American interests.A far-reaching British public inquiry, led by a senior judge, Lord Justice Brian Leveson, is running in parallel to the criminal investigations. It has elicited explosive testimony from Mr. Murdoch, his son James and their former senior executives and will continue into July with appearances by leading past and present politicians, said John Toker, a spokesman for the inquiry.On the witness stand in the next two weeks will be Culture Minister Jeremy Hunt, who is accused of seeking to aid Mr. Murdoch’s bid to take over a British satellite broadcaster, BSkyB, instead of adjudicating it impartially.It is unclear whether Mr. Cameron and his chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, will also give evidence on their relationships with the Murdoch family and company executives. Both officials have faced embarrassing allegations that dinners and parties with the Murdochs, including a gathering that Mr. Cameron attended on Mr. Murdoch’s yacht, reveal an inappropriate coziness that may have influenced the BSkyB deal.The inquiry’s report will be released in October, Mr. Toker said, and the second part of the inquiry, focusing on the hacking scandal, will begin after criminal proceedings have ended.Meanwhile, more than 100 civil lawsuits alleging illegal voice mail interceptions have been filed, according to court records. Many suits have been settled at an undisclosed cost, which could reach hundreds of millions of dollars in damages and legal fees. The police have said that there are likely more than 800 victims.The judge overseeing the cases, Geoffrey Vos, set a trial date of Feb. 18, 2013, for any cases that are not settled out of court.News International has also come under some pressure to waive legal privilege and allow the release of an internal dossier on hacking, compiled by the law firm BCL Burton Copeland in 2006, that might reveal whether senior executives knew of widespread illegality even as they said that hacking was limited to “one rogue reporter,” Clive Goodman, who was jailed in 2007. A News International spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter, and the law firm did not respond to messages.“We’re now thinking in terms of years, not weeks or months,” said a News International official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy. But the company may not be alone. Other allegations of phone hacking outside of Mr. Murdoch’s empire — including accusations that it took place at a large corporation — are likely to emerge, one person familiar with the investigations said.'"
"'12-05-17,'0','Judge Shira Scheindlin of Federal District Court spoke up for the constitutional rights of blacks and Hispanics on Wednesday by granting class-action status to a lawsuit that accuses the New York Police Department of using race as the basis for stopping and frisking hundreds of thousands of citizens a year.The decision opens the door to potential claims by an enormous number of people who may have been illegally stopped, and any remedy would be applied citywide. In a fierce defense of the Fourth Amendment, which guarantees freedom from unreasonable search and seizure, Judge Scheindlin was profoundly critical of the police program. The city’s arguments, she wrote, “do not withstand the overwhelming evidence that there, in fact, exists a centralized stop-and-frisk program that has led to thousands of unlawful stops.” She allowed the class-action status because “the vast majority of New Yorkers who are unlawfully stopped will never bring suit to vindicate their rights.”Instead of fighting the suit, brought by the Center for Constitutional Rights, the city should be trying to settle this case and working immediately to reform a policy that violates rights and undermines trust in the police.The stop-and-frisk program dates to the 1990s, when the police department adopted a “zero tolerance” approach to policing and began bearing down on minor crime as a way of preventing more serious crimes. Despite the city’s claims, there is no proof that this approach, by itself, reduced crime in New York because crime has fallen in many cities that do not follow New York’s lead.Over time, the program has grown to alarming proportions. There were fewer than 100,000 stops in 2002, but the police department carried out nearly 700,000 in 2011 and appears to be on track to exceed that number this year. About 85 percent of those stops involved blacks and Hispanics, who make up only about half the city’s population. Judge Scheindlin said the evidence showed that the unlawful stops resulted from “the department’s policy of establishing performance standards and demanding increased levels of stops and frisks.”She noted that police officers had conducted tens of thousands of clearly unlawful stops in every precinct of the city, and that in nearly 36 percent of stops in 2009, officers had failed to list an acceptable “suspected crime.” The police are required to have a reasonable suspicion to make a stop. Only 5.37 percent of all stops between 2004 and 2009, the period of data considered by the court, resulted in arrests, an indication that a vast majority of people stopped did nothing wrong. Judge Scheindlin rebuked the city for a “deeply troubling apathy toward New Yorkers’ most fundamental constitutional rights.” The message of this devastating ruling is clear: The city must reform its abusive stop-and-frisk policy.'"
"'12-05-17,'0','But the murky circumstances surrounding the firefights underscore the potential successes and risks in the United States’ escalating efforts to help small Central American governments battle well-armed and financed transnational narcotics smugglers by adapting counterinsurgency techniques honed in the Afghanistan and Iraq wars. The challenge has been to help bolster local security forces without raising a nationalist backlash fueled by memories of interventions by the United States during the cold war.The American efforts include the use of D.E.A. commando squads — called FAST, or Foreign-deployed Advisory Support Team — to train and work along side specially vetted local forces in the Western Hemisphere. This year, the military built three “forward operating bases” in isolated areas of Honduras to prestage helicopter-borne units so they could more quickly respond.Dawn Dearden, a D.E.A. spokeswoman, confirmed that American agents had been present alongside Honduran counterparts at both episodes. She said the D.E.A. worked “hand in hand with our Honduran counterparts” but were “involved in a supportive role only” during the two operations.She declined to comment further, citing the delicacy of the matter. But other officials said that government forces in the two operations seized more than a ton of cocaine that had just been flown in on small planes from Venezuela and was probably bound for the United States. They also said door gunners for the helicopters were Honduran.The episode last Friday began when an American intelligence task force detected a plane from Venezuela headed for a remote airstrip in Honduras. The military sent a Navy P-3 surveillance plane — developed for anti-submarine warfare in the cold war — high over the site, where it detected about 30 people unloading cargo from the plane into a vehicle, according to officials briefed on the matter.The smugglers, they said, then drove to a nearby river and loaded the materials into a canoe. It is a standard technique for smugglers to ferry their contraband in canoes, which glide under triple-canopy rain forest to the coast, where the cargo is put into fast boats or submersibles for the trip north to the United States.Meanwhile, helicopters were scrambling from one of several “forward operating bases” that the United States military has recently built, this one at Puerto Castilla on the coast. The helicopters carried a Honduran strike force along with members of a FAST unit.The helicopters, officials said, landed and seized the boat along with its cargo, about 2,000 pounds of cocaine. American and Honduran officials have said a second boat arrived and opened fire on the government agents, and a brief but intense shootout ensued in which government forces on the ground killed two drug traffickers.But Mr. Baquedano told El Tiempo that the helicopter was pursuing the drug traffickers when they mistook another boat, filled with villagers and traveling with a light on, for the traffickers, whose boat was unlighted. He said gunners on the helicopter fired on the villagers’ boat, while the smugglers abandoned their boat and escaped. Mr. Baquedan said the four slain villagers were innocent bystanders.Just as in operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan and Yemen, it is often difficult to distinguish insurgents from villagers when combating drugs in Central America. One official said it is a common practice for smugglers to pay thousands of dollars to a poor village if its people will help bring a shipment through the jungle to the coast.The FAST teams were created in 2005 to help Afghan forces go after drug traffickers in the war zone who were helping to finance the Taliban. Most of them were military veterans and received Special Operations-style training from the military. The D.E.A. had a similar program during the 1980s and early 1990s in which agents worked alongside Latin American police and military officials to go after jungle labs and smuggling planes. That program was ended early in the Clinton administration after complaints that it was not having enough of an impact to justify its risks.Because they are considered law enforcement agents, not soldiers, their presence on another country’s soil may raise fewer sensitivities about sovereignty. The American military personnel deployed in Honduras, for example, are barred from responding with force even if Honduran or D.E.A. agents are in danger. But if their Honduran counterparts come under fire, FAST teams may shoot back. For similar reasons, the helicopters are part of a State Department counternarcotics program — and not military.A FAST team was involved in a firefight in Honduras in March 2011 in which a Honduran officer was wounded and two drug traffickers were killed. In that case, the presence of the team was fortuitous — it had been on a training exercise with Honduran counterparts nearby when a smuggling plane was detected coming into a remote airstrip. On the May 6 mission, an American intelligence task force identified a plane leaving Venezuela and heading toward Honduras. A surveillance plane spotted the single-engine airplane as it landed in the wilderness of Miskito Indian country of eastern Honduras, and watched as about 100 people unloaded bales of cargo into several vehicles, officials said.The landing strip was less than 30 miles from one of the new outposts, called Forward Operating Base Mocoron. A joint Honduran-D.E.A. squad arrived on a State Department helicopter as two vehicles were leaving the landing zone. Drug smugglers on the ground, officials said, opened fire on the helicopter, and the government forces returned fire. In that episode, officials said, the drug smugglers fled into the rain forest, and there were no casualties.'"

"'12-05-17,'0','In recent days Ms. Merkel has signaled a growing openness to additional growth measures as long as they do not interfere with the fiscal compact to cut deficits in the euro zone in the long run. “On the one hand we have the pillar of sound fiscal policy, and the second pillar will then be the growth component,” Ms. Merkel said in the CNBC interview.That support could come in the form of money from existing funds that would be redirected for use by crisis countries, said Fabian Zuleeg, the chief economist with the European Policy Center. That approach had been championed by Mr. Hollande.But it will take more than technical adjustments to calm the growing political opposition to austerity in Greece, Spain and other hard-hit countries in the euro zone’s periphery, Mr. Zuleeg added. “We need to put together a package that looks convincing. It can’t just be rhetoric; it has to have some real elements to it,” he said. “The real element that certainly has to be in there is money.”Ms. Merkel’s comments punctuated a day in which all sides — from European policy makers in to political operatives in , where a caretaker government was named on Wednesday — began gearing up for a second Greek election, scheduled for June 17. The political establishment in Greece and elsewhere is seeking to describe the vote as a referendum on membership in the euro, which a large majority of Greeks say they support, even as they also demand a renegotiation of the terms of their bailout agreement.Speaking at an event in on Wednesday, , the president of the , made a plea for having Greece remain in the euro zone. “I want to state that our strong preference is that Greece will continue to stay in the euro area,” Mr. Draghi said.German officials have been boasting recently about the ability of the euro zone to handle a Greek exit. Though aimed at reining in Greece’s left-wing parties and their goal of renegotiating the bailout deal, the talk also unsettled markets and had the potential of turning into a self-fulfilling prophecy. The perils of brinkmanship in an unstable environment were on full display on Wednesday as the news emerged that Greeks had pulled nearly $900 million in savings from banks in the days after the May 6 elections, prompting fears of an uncontrollable bank run.The tough talk about Greece’s departure from the euro has resulted in growing qualms among the Greek public that their money could be converted to a new, significantly weaker currency — such as a reintroduced drachma — shrinking the value of hard-earned nest eggs. The more likely this possibility appears, the more Greeks have an incentive to put their money in bank accounts abroad.With the continuing instability, the rest of Europe would remain “in limbo” waiting for Greek elections, said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg Bank in , “which for financial markets means one thing: volatility.”He added, “We are exactly in the situation where the rumors or the expectations could trigger a downward spiral.”Mr. Schmieding said that Ms. Merkel and Mr. Hollande were prepared to make concessions, but had to focus the rest of their energy on preparing to control contagion and cushion the brunt of the impact in the event of a Greek departure.The high stakes of the second trip to the polls for Greek voters were apparent on Wednesday. “The Greek people should know what they are voting about,” said , Germany’s foreign minister, in a statement on Wednesday. “It is not about party politics, but about Greece’s future in Europe and the euro. We hope and at the same time also expect that everyone in a decision-making role in Greece is aware of their responsibilities.”Ms. Merkel has proved time and again how adept she is at shifting with changing circumstances. “There is a realignment under way, and one thing we know about Ms. Merkel is she is able to manage this sort of transition with very high tactical skills,” said Véron, a visiting fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.Voters in Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, dealt Ms. Merkel’s party a devastating electoral loss on Sunday, which was viewed in part as a repudiation of her emphasis on austerity to the detriment of growth.But Ms. Merkel’s ultimate goal, Mr. Véron said, is to maintain European unity. “Her primary objective is avoiding a situation where there would be a divide between France and Germany that would be impossible to manage for both nations and would make the whole euro crisis even less manageable than it was before,” he said.Jörg Krämer, the chief economist at Commerzbank, said he believed that the European Union was actually more flexible than German politicians had claimed, and could give Greece more time to meet the promised goals to reduce its budget deficits.“The political class in Europe still has solidarity with Greek politicians, with the exception of the radical left,” Mr. Krämer said.Europe needs to show its support for Greece, Ms. Merkel said in a second televised interview, on CNN, “as regards growth, as regards employment, as regards development, because what the people in Greece are experiencing now is a very, very tough period.”'"

"'12-05-17,'0','Experts outside the study gave it differing reviews.Dr. John G. Bartlett, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and a former president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, said, “I’m inclined to agree with Dr. Ray.”He said he was convinced by the study because it included data on a huge number of patients and because the findings were biologically plausible, given that related drugs had also been found capable of disrupting heart rhythm. For patients at high risk, he would prescribe a different drug, he said, adding that there are plenty of alternatives.Dr. Bartlett also said that the study provided another reason to curb overuse of antibiotics, which are too often prescribed for colds and other viral infections that they cannot treat. The overuse has contributed to the emergence of dangerous, drug-resistant strains of bacteria.“We use azithromycin for an awful lot of things, and we abuse it terribly,” Dr. Bartlett said. “It’s very convenient. Patients love it. ‘Give me the Z-Pak.’ For most of where we use it, probably the best option is not to give an antibiotic, quite frankly.”Dr. Lori Mosca, director of preventive cardiology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center, advised caution in interpreting the study, because of its methodology and because azithromycin’s benefits may outweigh the small risks suggested by the study.Dr. Mosca noted that the study was observational, meaning that the researchers looked back at medical records, rather than setting up an experiment in which patients were assigned at random to one treatment or another and then monitored. Even the most careful observational study can be misleading, she said: results that appear related to treatment may really be due to basic, undetected differences between groups of patients. She said a more rigorous study should be done to verify these new findings.In the meantime, she said: “It would be crazy to think we can’t use azithromycin. It’s bad to undertreat infections.”Dr. Roy M. Gulick, the chief of infectious diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell, also said that more research was needed. But, he said, “in someone with significant cardiovascular risks or documented disease, the results of this study would be one factor that would help you choose among the antibiotics.”Dr. Ray and his team analyzed the medical records of about 540,000 Medicaid patients ages 30 to 74 in Tennessee from 1992 to 2006. The researchers looked at cardiovascular deaths while people were taking various antibiotics and during comparable periods in which they were taking none: about 350,000 prescriptions for azithromycin, 1.4 million matched periods with no treatment, 1.4 million prescriptions for amoxicillin, 265,000 for ciprofloxacin and 194,000 for levofloxacin. By comparing people taking other antibiotics, the researchers hoped to control for the possibility that the infections they were being treated for were the cause of sudden death.Over all, there were few sudden deaths during these specified periods, fewer than 100 combined among those taking azithromycin, amoxicillin or no antibiotic. But when the researchers calculated the rates of sudden death per million courses of treatment (or untreated control periods), azithromycin stood out, with 64.6 deaths per million courses, as opposed to 21.8 for amoxicillin and 24 when there was no treatment. The death rates with azithromycin and levofloxacin were about the same (earlier studies have linked levofloxacin to abnormal heart rhythms), and were higher than the rate with ciprofloxacin.The people who had the greatest baseline risk for heart disease had the highest risk from taking azithromycin.“Any antibiotic is going to have risks and benefits,” Dr. Ray said. “We think this is an important piece of information about risks.”'"
"'12-05-17,'0','¶ The police took only one photo at the scene of any of Mr. Zimmerman’s injuries — a full-face picture of him that showed a bloodied nose — before paramedics tended to him. It was shot on a department cellphone camera and was not downloaded for a few days, an oversight by the officer who took it.¶ The vehicle that Mr. Zimmerman was driving when he first spotted Mr. Martin was mistakenly not secured by officers as part of the crime scene. The vehicle was an important link in the fatal encounter because it was where Mr. Zimmerman called the police to report a suspicious teenager in a hooded sweatshirt roaming through the Retreat. Mr. Zimmerman also said he was walking back to the vehicle when he was confronted by Mr. Martin, who was unarmed, before shooting him.¶ The police were not able to cover the crime scene to shield evidence from the rain, and any blood from cuts that Mr. Zimmerman suffered when he said Mr. Martin pounded his head into a sidewalk may have been washed away.¶ The police did not test Mr. Zimmerman for alcohol or drug use that night, and one witness said the lead investigator quickly jumped to a conclusion that it was Mr. Zimmerman, and not Mr. Martin, who cried for help during the struggle.Some Sanford officers were skeptical from the beginning about certain details of Mr. Zimmerman’s account. For instance, he told the police that Mr. Martin had punched him over and over again, but they questioned whether his injuries were consistent with the number of blows he claimed he received. They also suspected that some of the threatening and dramatic language that Mr. Zimmerman said Mr. Martin uttered during the struggle — like “You are going to die tonight” — sounded contrived.The Sanford police — who contended that their 16-day investigation, done in consultation with the original prosecutor in the case, was detailed and impartial — also encountered other obstacles. One involved the investigators’ inability to get the password for Mr. Martin’s cellphone from his family, who apparently did not know it. That was significant because Mr. Martin had been talking to a girl on the phone moments before he was killed, but the young woman did not contact the police after Mr. Martin’s death was made public.From what is known of the investigation and the available evidence, what exactly happened in the dimly lighted residential development that Sunday night may remain out of reach. Given Mr. Zimmerman’s assertion that he was acting in self-defense, and lacking enough evidence to the contrary, the original prosecutor in the case, Norm Wolfinger, whose jurisdiction includes Sanford, filed no charges against him.That decision resulted in an increasingly strident public outcry. After Gov. of contacted Mr. Wolfinger and had a conversation with him in late March, the prosecutor recused himself, citing, among other things, an unspecified conflict of interest.The governor selected another state attorney to handle the case, Angela B. Corey of the area. On April 11, after nearly three weeks of investigation, Ms. Corey charged Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder. An accompanying affidavit said that Mr. Zimmerman had “profiled” Mr. Martin, who was black, and had assumed he was a criminal. Mr. Zimmerman is Hispanic.Ms. Corey declined to be interviewed, as did Mr. Wolfinger. Governor Scott also declined several requests for an interview about how and why he selected Ms. Corey for the case.In announcing the charge, Ms. Corey praised the Sanford Police Department’s work, indicating that it had conducted a “thorough and intensive” inquiry and was a “tremendous help” to her office.What appears unchanged since the beginning, however, is that investigators say they do not know who started the fight. Florida’s controversial Stand Your Ground law, which has come to shadow a number of homicide cases since it was adopted in 2005, justifies the use of deadly force in certain threatening situations but does not require a person to retreat. The law became the framework within which the police and prosecutors had to work after Mr. Zimmerman claimed that Mr. Martin confronted and pounced on him.Mr. Zimmerman had called the police from his vehicle to report what he believed was a suspicious person in the Retreat, something he had done numerous times in the past. He later told investigators that he got out of his vehicle and followed Mr. Martin but lost sight of him. As Mr. Zimmerman was returning to his vehicle, he told them, Mr. Martin emerged and then attacked him. Mr. Zimmerman told investigators that at one point, Mr. Martin had his hand over his mouth. And before he shot the youth, he explained to the police, Mr. Martin had reached for Mr. Zimmerman’s gun.“There is a perception that we were trying to protect George Zimmerman,” the Sanford police chief, Bill Lee Jr., who temporarily stepped aside in March to quell the furor and later offered to resign, said in a recent interview. “We think that what he did was terrible. We wish that he had just stayed in his vehicle.”“There was no bias in the investigation. We did not lean one way or another. We were looking for the truth,” he said.Chief Lee declined to discuss specifics about the case, but he added, “I have been frustrated by the negative attention the police and the city have received that does not accurately reflect who we are and what we have done in this investigation.”At 7:09 p.m., Mr. Zimmerman, who was driving to a , made his call to a police dispatcher.Within eight minutes, Mr. Martin was dead from a gunshot wound to the chest, his body crumpled on a stretch of grass behind a row of town houses. When the first officer arrived at 7:17, Mr. Zimmerman was waiting not far from the body. He raised his hands in surrender before relinquishing his 9-millimeter pistol from the holster in his waistband.He was handcuffed and taken into “investigative detention” at Sanford police headquarters, where he was read his Miranda rights and answered questions without a lawyer present. Investigators described him as unhesitatingly cooperative. At some point, Mr. Zimmerman provided the police with a permit allowing him to carry a concealed weapon. His clothes were taken into evidence after his wife came to the station with a new set.A law enforcement official said officers did not seize Mr. Zimmerman’s vehicle because they thought that he had been on foot. They did not realize that he had been driving until after his wife had moved the vehicle, the official said.The official said he believed that the police, in the hours after the shooting, sought to determine whether Mr. Zimmerman was wanted for any crimes. But he said they did not have a complete background check in hand until midmorning the next day — after Mr. Zimmerman had been released. The records showed a domestic violence dispute with a woman who identified herself as his ex-fiancée and a run-in with a state alcohol agent, neither of which resulted in a conviction.As for the officer at the scene who took the single full-face photo of Mr. Zimmerman — he suffered a and other injuries during the struggle — he called an investigator “in a panic” over his failure to download it sooner, according to a person familiar with the case. Other photos of Mr. Zimmerman’s injuries were later shot at police headquarters, although he had been cleaned up by paramedics by then.Another investigator briefed on the case said officers should have been more thorough as they knocked on doors in the neighborhood: they might have learned Mr. Martin’s identity early and that he was staying at the town house of his father’s girlfriend and was not trespassing. At the time of the shooting, the girlfriend’s 14-year-old son was waiting for Mr. Martin to return from a 7-Eleven store, where he had bought a bag of Skittles candies and a can of iced tea. Mr. Martin was not identified until Monday morning, about 13 hours after he was killed, when the police learned that his father, Tracy Martin, had reported him as missing.One witness said a police investigator twice declined her offer to show him the close and unobstructed vantage point from a partly opened bedroom window where she had watched and heard the struggle between Mr. Martin and Mr. Zimmerman. The witness, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition she remain anonymous because the investigation is active, said the detective taped part of her account.She also recalled telling him that night that she was haunted by the cries for help she believed came from Mr. Martin during the struggle. But she said the investigator seemed to have already formed an opinion about what had happened. He told her, she said, that it was Mr. Zimmerman — not Mr. Martin — who was the one screaming, an assertion that remains in dispute.More than a month later, she and her lawyer, Derek Brett of , met with two investigators from Ms. Corey’s office. Mr. Brett said his client was subject to only 15 minutes or so of “substantive questioning.”“This surprised me because when something is not done properly, in this instance by the police, you sit down and do more than just fill in the blanks,” he said.On the night of the shooting, the police were assisted by the Seminole County sheriff’s office, which sent a representative to the scene with a live fingerprint scanner to see if a match showed up for Mr. Martin. It did not.Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the Martins, said that Mr. Martin was carrying a T-Mobile Comet phone and that the police contacted his father a day or two after the shooting to get the password, but he did not know it.A law enforcement official said that the phone had died not long after the police retrieved it, and that it took days for the authorities to get a charger and an expert to try to get into the device. If the police had been able to get access to it, they could have interviewed Mr. Martin’s friend about what he had told her in those final moments of his life and what else she had heard. The police eventually subpoenaed Mr. Martin’s cellphone records, but did not receive them in a timely fashion.The official said that while the police never tested Mr. Zimmerman for alcohol or drugs, such decisions are left to the discretion of investigators based on whether they have reason to suspect the person is under the influence. (The medical examiner in the case did a routine toxicology screening of Mr. Martin; the results have not been made public.)Sgt. David Morgenstern, spokesman for the Sanford police, said he could not say much about the case because the investigation was continuing. But he said of the officer who took one photo of Mr. Zimmerman at the scene: “I don’t think that is wrong because subsequent photos can be taken within hours. They might not be as graphic but they still will depict the injuries somebody might have.”Over all, Chief Lee, whose resignation was not accepted by the City Commission last month, said in an interview that his department’s work was as fair and thorough as possible.“I am confident about the investigation, and I was satisfied with the amount of evidence and testimony we got in the time we had the case,” he said.“We were basing our decisions, which were made in concert with the state attorney’s office, on the findings of the investigation at the time,” he added, “and we were abiding by the Florida law that covers self-defense.”The Sanford Police Department assigns homicide cases to its five investigators who handle major crimes. Their wide-ranging responsibilities cover everything from sex crimes to carjackings. On the evening that Mr. Martin was fatally shot, the head of the major crimes unit was on vacation. The rotation supervisor on call was a sergeant who works narcotics cases. In all, more than a dozen officers and department superiors were on the scene of Mr. Martin’s killing — which the police said was Sanford’s first homicide of 2012 — including Chief Lee, who joined the department last May.In the two weeks after the shooting, the police were in regular contact with the office of Mr. Wolfinger, sharing their findings and suspicions with him.The police conducted a lie-detection procedure, known as voice stress analysis, on Mr. Zimmerman that he passed, and they had him re-enact the encounter with Mr. Martin back at the Retreat the day after the shooting. But the operating belief was that the police did not have enough evidence to establish probable cause for a manslaughter charge and an arrest, according to officials with knowledge of the case.At one department meeting a few days after Mr. Martin’s death, a representative from Mr. Wolfinger’s office was told about the inconsistencies the police saw in Mr. Zimmerman’s account. The prosecutor told them he understood that the police were trying to build a case against Mr. Zimmerman, though they did not have adequate evidence, according to a law enforcement official. It was decided that more work was needed on the case.As the national uproar intensified, the Sanford city manager, Norton N. Bonaparte Jr., and Mayor Jeff Triplett were growing eager to have the police send the case to Mr. Wolfinger to get it moving through the justice system. The police did so just over two weeks after Mr. Martin’s death. They included a recommendation that Mr. Zimmerman be charged with manslaughter, a position that one law enforcement official described as “weak,” and that the prosecutor did not act on.Ms. Corey’s decision to charge Mr. Zimmerman with second-degree murder fueled even more criticism of the police. Mr. Zimmerman has since entered a written plea of not guilty.'"
"'12-05-17,'0','“We have a lot of European countries that are in economic crisis, that are facing elections and whose citizens are fatigued with the war after 11 years. So for us coming up with substantial money for the Afghan National Security Forces, it is not so clear a priority for us,” said one European diplomat here. Like others interviewed for this article, the diplomat spoke about the aid discussions on the condition of anonymity.Everyone believes that at the end of the day — in fact by the end of the conference — the aid pledges will be there to fill out a goal of $4.1 billion a year, over the next 10 years, to help Afghanistan maintain its security forces. The Americans plan to provide roughly two-thirds of that.Still, for many European countries, the money is being given reluctantly, most of all because they would prefer to spend on health clinics and schools rather than armies. And even as they are agreeing to commit the money for security help at the Chicago conference, they worry that doing so will make their parliaments reluctant to give more at a Tokyo conference in July that will focus on future Afghanistan reconstruction projects. And in more candid moments, some wish aloud that the money could stay available for countries with more chance for success than Afghanistan.“What dominates the agenda of Karzai and the United States is security — the military strategy, the night raids, detention and the rest,” another European diplomat said. “So no matter how much we are going to push the Afghans to address issues of governance and corruption, it’s not going to happen. But these are things we care about and the capitals care about.”Though the Americans and British insist that they do not want to end up slighting development spending, their clear priority in Chicago is to ensure there is enough money for the security forces to avoid a repeat of what happened in 1991 when the Soviet Union withdrew financial support for the military under Najibullah, the Communist ruler they had left in Kabul after they withdrew in 1989. When the money stopped, his government collapsed in a matter of months.“Everybody has economic problems but this is serious business,” said a senior American official. “Security forces cannot be under-resourced without grave danger to the state.”Yet for all that the Americans wanted a broad Western coalition, they did themselves no favors in the prelude to Chicago by sending around a list in January with the amount they expected every country to give. Canada was assessed for $125 million; Finland for $20 million; France, $200 million; Sweden, $40 million — among others. Only Greece, whose government has rescheduled much of its debt, was given an exemption.The list made other countries feel they were trapped in a carpet bazaar in which the store owner sets the price above what he knows he will get. (The list was even called “Target Asks.”)“It was a bit blunt as an approach, and we thought, ‘Right, why weren’t we involved in the exercise to come up with the numbers?’ ” one European diplomat said.Another country’s diplomat looked at the list and wondered why his country was asked to pay more than another country of similar size. “We were told, ‘You punch above your weight,’ and we said, ‘Yes, but we don’t want to pay more than our share.’ ”So far the result is that countries are offering about 60 percent of the amount the Americans asked them for. Britain has already announced it will spend $110 million — barely more than half the $200 million it was asked for. France was asked for $200 million, but with the election last week of a staunchly antiwar Socialist president, François Hollande, no one is expecting they will give that much. Several diplomats said they doubted that Mr. Hollande would come to the Chicago meeting empty-handed.A senior United States official said that the Americans recognized the European reluctance, but that as a practical matter what was most important was that the United States remain out front in helping Afghanistan — in part because of a sense of responsibility that the past 11 years of war cannot be allowed to come to nothing, but also because it encourages other countries to contribute.“What it really takes is us,” said the official, referring to the United States.The strategic partnership agreement signed on May 1 by President Obama and Mr. Karzai in Kabul committed the United States to support Afghanistan for the next 10 years in economic development, rule of law and security, among other things.The European reluctance to spend on security is not born of a lack of interest in Afghanistan. Many European countries have had development and humanitarian efforts here going back more than 25 years. But after years of development programs that have fallen far short of the West’s hopes, they are wary of the prospect of pumping more money into defending an Afghan state that many Europeans have dwindling faith in.They are put off by a troubling record of corruption and human rights abuses, and daunted by the prospect of a collapse into civil war after NATO pulls out. They say the Americans base their projections on best-case plans.“The major goal now is to avoid a cross-country conflict that moves into a regional conflict,” a European diplomat said. He added, “We have low expectations for 2014.”Another European diplomat, who has spent years in the country, described how Afghanistan has fallen out of his country’s consciousness.“Our media is not even mentioning Afghanistan now,” the diplomat said. “We are Europeans at the end of the day; we have to care about North Africa — it is closer; we can explain why it matters. We have to care about Belarus, it is nearly a neighbor. But Afghanistan is very far away.”'"
"'12-05-17,'0','The court heard the prosecutor’s dry and methodical recitation of how, in ethnically mixed Bosnia, Serbian politicians and military leaders carefully planned a campaign of ethnic cleansing, attacking and terrorizing non-Serbian civilians to clear out whole regions and turn them into lands only for Serbs. Tens of thousands of civilians were killed or fled their homes. The campaign to divide Sarajevo, which the prosecutor said was “once a model of ethnic diversity,” left more than 10,000 people dead. He played the sounds of what he called radio intercepts in which Mr. Mladic was heard personally directing fire against civilian targets in Sarajevo’s Old Town.At the height of the Bosnian operation, forces under Mr. Mladic’s command controlled nearly three-quarters of the territory.In the crowded public gallery, a group of Bosnian survivors murmured insults as Mr. Mladic turned to scan the crowd, with one woman shouting “Vulture!” as Mr. Mladic gave a thumbs-up sign when he spotted an acquaintance. Another woman raised her hands, crossed over as if in handcuffs, to remind him that he was now a prisoner. He responded by running his hand across his throat, a gesture that led the chief judge to call him to order and tell him to stop “inappropriate interactions.”During a break, Kada Hotic, who had traveled from Srebrenica, had lost her breath in anger. “He ordered the killing of my husband, my son, my two brothers and my brother-in-law,” she said. “Now that I look him in the face, I am so disturbed, I want revenge.”In another courtroom not far away, Charles Taylor, the former president of Liberia who was found guilty last month of war crimes and crimes against humanity for aiding rebels in Sierra Leone, said during a sentencing hearing that he sympathized with victims of the civil war in Sierra Leone. While he did not express remorse or acknowledge wrongdoing, he asked the judges to decide his sentence in a spirit of “reconciliation, not retribution,” The Associated Press reported. He is to be sentenced on May 30.Mr. Mladic, who was arrested in a Serbian village in May 2011, faces charges of war crimes, crimes against humanity and two counts of genocide — one for the ethnic cleansing campaign and a second for a massacre during the war’s climax, when Mr. Mladic’s forces overran a small contingent of United Nations peacekeepers in Srebrenica. About 8,000 unarmed men and boys were killed over several days in July 1995 in what were portrayed as acts of vengeance for Serbian deaths at the hands of Muslims.“By the time Mladic and his troops murdered thousands in Srebrenica,” Mr. Groome said, “they were well rehearsed in the craft of murder.”Bodies from the Srebrenica massacre are still being found in mass graves. Ewa Tabeau, a demographer called to testify at the tribunal, said this month that 8,005 had been killed there, of whom 6,241 have been identified by DNA analysis. “The prosecution will present evidence that will show beyond a reasonable doubt the hand of Mr. Mladic in each of these crimes,” Mr. Groome said.The prosecutor described how Bosnian Serbs had used strategies of ethnic cleansing to redraw the demographic outline of areas they targeted to ensure “the separation of the Serbian people from the other two national communities” — Bosnian Muslims and Croats. “Ethnic cleansing was the purpose of military action” rather than a consequence of war, he said.Mr. Mladic has refused to enter a formal plea, but has said that he is not guilty of wrongdoing because his mission was “to defend Serbs.” The court entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf on Wednesday. He is the last of the major figures in the Balkan wars to face trial at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia here.Mr. Mladic has been in poor health, the result of two strokes, although his health has been improving, his lawyer, Branko Lukic, said. “The prosecution has a strong case, but we will fight it,” Mr. Lukic said after the session.At the start of the session, Mr. Mladic greeted a man in the gallery; he nodded and smiled, and the man responded in kind.Was he connected to Mr. Mladic, a reporter asked the man, who identified himself as Satko Mujagic from Bosnia.“Yes, I am connected to Mladic,” Mr. Mujagic replied, his voice rising in anger. “His army attacked my town, Kozarac, burned down my house, killed my grandmother, my cousins, my best friend, my schoolteachers. I spent 200 days in Omarska prison camp and was beaten until I could no longer walk. So I am connected to him.”Why, then, did he smile and greet Mr. Mladic?“Because I am so very happy that now he is there, in the dock,” Mr. Mujagic said.Much of the evidence against Mr. Mladic has been amassed and tested in other trials, where defendants were accused of crimes that overlapped with the accusations against him. Four of his aides and senior officers are serving life sentences, and other subordinates have been given a range of prison sentences.Prosecutors will also rely on satellite images and extensive film that put Mr. Mladic on the scene at the time of military action.Another extraordinary source for prosecutors lies in material found hidden inside a wall of Mr. Mladic’s home in Belgrade. It includes recordings of Mr. Mladic speaking during meetings and by telephone, and his wartime diaries, or military logs, reporting on meetings and decisions, totaling almost 4,000 pages.'"

Because of Mississippi’s history of racial discrimination, the state is required to get federal approval for any change in election laws or procedures. The Justice Department in recent months has rejected voter identification laws from Texas and South Carolina. The state N.A.A.C.P. is asking the department to reject the law, saying it could disproportionately create hardships for poor, elderly or minority voters who might be less likely to have a photo identification. No black officials attended the bill signing ceremony. Mr. Bryant was surrounded by several fellow Republicans and some Tea Party members. Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said he did not expect the new law to be in place for the Nov. 6 elections.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Citi Field, home of the Mets, is sold out for Sunday evening — but not for a baseball game. More than 40,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews plan to pack the stadium to hear about what the event’s organizers call the dangers of the Internet and how to use it in a religiously responsible way.Tickets for the gathering have been so sought after that organizers announced on Wednesday that they had also rented the nearby 20,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium, home to the United States Open, for an overflow crowd.Speakers at the rally in Queens will not seek to ban the Internet, but rather to raise awareness about how, unmonitored, it poses a grave risk to the community, said Eytan Kobre, a spokesman for the organizers. The risk, he said, comes not only from pornography, but also from social media and the addictive pull of the Internet, which can limit human interaction, reading and study.“These are the same concerns that people across society — in academia, in psychology, parents, spouses — have about the Internet,” he said. “But here is a community that is actually standing up and coming together and putting our money where our mouth is, to express a unified communal resolve to address the issues.”At both stadiums, only men are invited, because of the ultra-Orthodox practice of strict gender separation. The meeting will be broadcast live to audiences of women in schools and event halls in Borough Park and Flatbush in Brooklyn and in other ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, according to Hamodia, a newspaper serving the Orthodox.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','The initiative, first agreed upon by the Group of 8 leaders at their meeting in L’Aquila, Italy, in 2009, was a pledge to put $22 billion into food and agriculture projects. Although much of the money had previously been earmarked for agriculture projects, about $6 billion was new.Almost all of the $22 billion has now been “budgeted and appropriated,” and 58 percent of it has been disbursed, Mr. Shah said. “I am confident that continuing into this year and the next, the U.S. and other countries will absolutely meet their commitments,” he said.He conceded, however, that not all of the money is being spent as promised, which has drawn complaints from many nongovernmental organizations and African countries.“The grand promise of L’Aquila was, if you build a plan for agriculture, the donors will help them find the resources for it,” said Gregory Adams, director of aid effectiveness at Oxfam America, an international relief and development organization.“Now there are 30 plans of varying degrees of quality with shovel-ready projects donors could invest in today, but instead donors have put their money in other things.”Some donor countries have insisted that their money be spent on traditional food handouts rather than the building blocks of an agricultural development program, Mr. Adams said.Several companies that were contacted said the administration had asked them not to speak about their commitments until Friday.Mr. Shah, however, offered a few examples. Tanseed, a Tanzanian seed company, will commit to spend $11 million over time to buy certified seed and sell it in little packets to meet the needs of small farmers.Derek Yach, senior vice president for global health and agriculture policy at PepsiCo, a member of the alliance, said it grew from work the World Economic Forum had been doing on food security with the African Union.“What’s exciting about it is that the companies participating really extend across the value chain,” Mr. Yach said, including seeds, plants, processing and financing.Mr. Shah said that the administration does not plan for the private sector to take over.“The president will commit to encouraging ourselves and our G-8 partners to seek to maintain the high level of commitment to agriculture and food security even as we go forward beyond the formal L’Aquila period” of three years, he said.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','The Turner Family Picnic is famous in hard-core blues circles and over the years has attracted the likes of Bill Wyman, Robert Plantand Martin Scorsese, but it hasn’t been spoiled by the attention of outsiders. The family still prepares pulled-goat sandwiches for the crowd, though now the meat is U.S.D.A.-approved, not the product of a backyard slaughter. And moonshine is still passed around in pint jars, though no longer sold on site. Cicadas chirp. Neighbors from the surroundingcounties — an overwhelmingly rural and sparsely populated area where in some places 29 percent live below the poverty line — greet each other and gossip.The event has the feel of a rural block party, one where black and white, town and country, poor and less-so mix freely. The Turner family dog, a one-eyed snaggletooth pit bull named Gucci, begs for goat bones. It’s a relaxed atmosphere, but, to insiders, not without tension: Thomas, the headliner at the picnic for most of her life, and perhaps the only living link to the ur-music of America, may move away to become a schoolteacher. Rumor has it she may want to move on musically, too. I ask Tamke what he thinks of the possibility. “It would be a tragedy,” he says.There’s no lineup or set list at Otha’s farm, just a rousing hill country blues session with musicians, famous and unknown, hopping up on stage to sit in, then hopping down to fetch a cold one. That is, until Thomas, who’s been slinging goat and selling beers from a lean-to at the side of the yard, announces, “I’m going to round up the boys to play some drums.” When enough kin have assembled to fill out the drum corps — kettle, snare and bass — she draws the fife to her lips. The instrument is nothing more than a piece of cane hollowed out by a red hot poker from the fire. It’s got five holes and plays not much more than two notes, but Thomas’s high, sweet obbligato bends and stretches them until the fife sings a melody. “Little Sally Walker/Sittin’ in a saucer/Ride, Sally, ride!” She begins to sway before the drums. “Shake it to the East/Shake it to the West/Shake it to the one you love the best.” A crowd gathers around, because Thomas and her cousins are not playing on the makeshift stage on the back of a flatbed truck but marching in front of it. Before the procession gets going, Thomas stops everything and lashes out at her band: “Y’all, get it together!” She’s not feeling it.It’s electrifying to see Thomas crack the whip. She’s barely five feet tall, leading a band of formidable-looking men. Bill, her brother, on the snare, has a what looks to be a homemade tattoo across the front of his neck that says “Mr. Ssippi.” Thomas’s cousin Andre, on the kettle drum, is well over six feet tall and built like an athlete. He spits out his cigarette, grinding it into the dirt with his heel. They start up again, this time with a different rhythm. Whoops erupt from the crowd, which is pressing close. “I come to see ya!” hollers one celebrant, “I want to hear ya!”The drums beat slowly, but this time the sound is fermenting into something stronger. Thomas is walking backward, rocking her body back and forth, blowing into the fife and waving it like a conductor’s baton. She’s a snake charmer, and the drummers are under her spell. With a phrase on the fife, Thomas calls the tune — one of Otha Turner’s old standards, mashed up with hip-hop-inflected improvisations. The players keep time not with their feet but rather with their bodies, and the rhythm syncopates and changes with the dance.The slow burn turns hot. Andre is beating his drum so hard it jumps high into the air with every hit. Mr. Ssippi is bathed in sweat. Much of the audience joins in and is transported, too.The rhythm of the drums, already impossibly loud and complex, jumps yet another notch. There is a crashing wave of crescendos followed by more whoops from the crowd.Andre is not only beating his own kettle drum but also a big bass drum strapped to Robert, his cousin. “When I say ‘beat it,’ ” he shouts, “beat it, good!” Thomas is bent over so far backward that she’s playing the fife with one hand, the other placed on the ground. What I’m hearing sounds almost like an exorcism, and just as the music can’t get any higher, it comes to a screeching halt. The crowd erupts in orgiastic cheer.The spell takes a while to wear off. In the giddy afterglow, a stranger locks eyes with me and gives me a high-five. And then, slowly, the stage fills up again, and the regularly scheduled blues resumes. It goes like this until late: free-form jam sessions on stage, punctuated every hour or two with fife and drum on the ground. The later it is, the more incantatory the fife and drum gets.It’s after the penultimate performance of the night that Tamke suddenly reappears and takes me into the headlock. I manage to talk him out of hurting me by promising him that I’ll tell the world that Mississippi is no longer the violent, racist place it once was, then leave him passed out in a pickup truck. The party has moved to the rural road in front of Otha’s farm. It’s only a two-lane blacktop, but tonight it’s a full-on cruising scene. A Dodge Charger repeatedly peels out on 28-inch rims, women gyrating out every window.Later, I decide to follow the Charger, to a ball field behind a nearby juke joint. There, a young all-black crowd is gathering around a sound system set up at home plate. Two towers of speakers are pumping out a filthy but infectious brand of hip-hop that drives the crowd into a frenzy. It’s as raw and uncensored a dance party as I’ve seen. As I hang out on the fringes, it occurs to me that this after-party may actually be closer to what Lomax witnessed than the integrated picnic I had just come from. I introduced myself to the man behind the mixer, D.J. Mark Da Spot. He’s as surprised as Tamke was to meet a reporter from The Times, but very welcoming. We talk, he spins, and I try out my new theory on him: fife and drum is a world away from the club music he’s playing, but they’re closely linked. “It’s the same beat,” he agrees.Thomas didn’t go to Mark Da Spot’s after-party, but she does like contemporary hip-hop, she told me the following afternoon. Her first album, “What Do I Do?,” released in 2010, is half fife and drum, half smooth R&B. David Katznelson, the former Warner A&R man whose boutique label, Birdman Records, published Otha Turner’s two albums a decade ago, doesn’t think much of Thomas’s attempt to modernize fife and drum. “It’s kind of lost its soul,” he had told me a month earlier, over coffee in San Francisco. But Thomas dismisses the criticisms of blues purists.“I’m not worried about the blues industry,” she says. “My next album will be strictly hip-hop.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Animism, the propensity to attribute consciousness to inanimate objects, once was supposed to be a defining trait of so-called primitive people. But modern ones project supernatural properties onto things like cars, communication devices and artworks; we are all in the grip of magical thinking, at least sometimes. “Animism,” an unapologetically didactic show at e-flux, is a good prompt for a discussion of the implications.Organized by Anselm Franke, a curator in Brussels and Berlin, it consists of films and videos by a multigenerational roster that includes Chris Marker, Marcel Broodthaers and Ana Mendieta. A central work is “Assemblages” (2010), a 62-minute documentary by Angela Melitopoulos and Maurizio Lazzarato about the psychologist and philosopher Félix Guattari, who argued that taking animism seriously would solve many social problems.Other works exemplify animation. Walt Disney’s “Skeleton Dance” is a comically macabre short cartoon from 1929. A film by Daria Martin studies two naked dancers interacting with robotic devices in a laboratory. One by Joachim Koester shows a man performing curious movements from a system of exercises that the probably fictional shaman Don Juan taught Carlos Castaneda.“Capitalism: Slavery” (2006), a short piece by the filmmaker Ken Jacobs, is a flickering, grainy, slow-motion pan of what looks like an old diorama of slaves picking cotton. Mr. Jacobs made it by digitally alternating exposures of both sides of an antique stereoscopic photograph. Strangely three-dimensional and eerily still, it casts an unsettling spell.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','At a rate of more than 3 million barrels a day, Iran is still the second-largest producer of crude oil in OPEC after Saudi Arabia. But its production levels have been in gradual decline for years, hampered by sanctions that have starved the industry of spare parts and new investment. Its more immediate problem now is a lack of buyers, after new sanctions on financial institutions and pressures by the Obama administration on reliable customers like India, China and the Southeast Asian nations.“We are not selling as much as before, and the use of outdated equipment is taking its toll,” said Reza Zandi, an oil specialist writing for Shargh, a newspaper that is critical of the government. “Clearly this is not serving Iran’s interest.”Iran’s oil minister, Rostam Ghasemi, on Tuesday denied both reports by OPEC and the International Energy Agency. “The reports are not true at all, and our oil is selling very well,” the semiofficial Fars news agency quoted him as saying.Iran has long stored some oil in tankers on the Persian Gulf to wait out market gluts and secure the highest possible price. But this time is different, industry insiders say.“Now we have less and less buyers,” said one middleman involved in reselling crude, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to endanger his business. “We see even India buying less oil. We have to find new markets.”Iran’s oil revenues traditionally make up the majority of its government budgets. In the last five years, riding a wave of high oil prices, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s government has earned nearly $500 billion in oil income, more than in the past three decades combined. High oil prices have helped Iran weather past sanctions, Mr. Zandi said, “but now the reliance on oil revenue is making us vulnerable.”Iran also faces a boycott of its oil by the European Union, which is scheduled to start on July 1. This will be accompanied by a ban on insurance for Iranian oil shipments, a measure that has already had an impact by deterring insurers from issuing policies that might extend beyond July 1.“We are even seeing less and less Chinese and Indian companies calling our port,” said one an oil cargo inspector, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid potential repercussions. He said his company’s final European customer arrived at the port for oil in the beginning of April. “We are waiting to see what will happen when those new sanctions kick in.”Already, financial sanctions devised by the United States Treasury Department are making it increasingly difficult for customers of Iranian oil to pay for the crude, with reportedly both China and India offering unfavorable barter deals calculated in local currencies.Eventually, if the storage capacity is exhausted, Iran will be forced to shut down some of its production, a potentially disastrous step that it is trying to avoid, analysts say.“Closing off valves sounds easy,” Mr. Zandi said, but the consequences can be extremely damaging. “Technically it wrecks the oil wells, and we will never be able to bring their output back to previous levels.”While Iran is notoriously immune to outside pressures, the oil sanctions represent a new and far more threatening weapon than it has faced before, analysts say.“Our economy is like a car with four flat tires,” said Mohammad Reza Sabzalipour, the president of the Tehran World Trade Center. “We can’t bypass these sanctions forever. We need understanding and détente with the West.”On the other hand, others say, the oil sanctions can be a double-edged sword.“The less oil there is available, the higher the prices will be, it’s that simple,” Mr. Zandi said. “All of us are consciously destroying our future.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','One of the surveys was conducted by Jacob A. Tennessen and Joshua M. Akey of the University of Washington in Seattle and colleagues, the other by a team led by Matthew R. Nelson and Vincent Mooser of GlaxoSmithKline.Both groups attribute the abundance of rare variants to the explosion of human populations after the invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. Because the population expansion is so recent, in evolutionary terms, natural selection has not had time to eliminate the harmful mutations.The Seattle team calculates that in every individual, 313 genes out of the 25,000 in the human genome carry rare mutations that alter the function of the protein specified by the gene. The GlaxoSmithKline team, which looked just at a category of genes likely to make good drug targets, calculates that a rare variant occurs in one out of every 17 DNA units, of which the human genome has some three billion.These findings may help explain why it has proved so hard to isolate the genetic roots of disease. Until now, researchers have looked only at common mutations as possible contributors to the risk of common diseases.This approach was in one sense dictated by technology; for many years, common mutations were the only ones that could be worked with. But a theory developed to justify the approach — the “common disease, common variant” hypothesis — held that some mutations exerted their bad effects late in life, after people had had their children, and had become common because natural selection was powerless to act against them.But the theory was wrong. Common variants have turned out to explain only a fraction of the genetic risk of common disease. The opposite hypothesis, the “common disease, rare variant” idea, “has become increasingly credible,” the GlaxoSmithKline team writes.Jonathan Pritchard, a geneticist at the University of Chicago who drew attention to the possible role of rare variants in 2001, said it seemed a likely bet that rare variants were contributing to an important fraction of disease. In addition, many common variants may contribute risks that are too small to have shown up in current surveys, he said. But in either case, detecting the roots of common disease will prove much more difficult than envisaged under the “common variant, common disease” scenario. Mutations with small effect must be studied in large numbers of patients to be detectable. Even if the effects of some rare variants can be measured, assessing the significance of the millions that stud each individual’s genome will be challenging.Though the cost of decoding an individual’s genome is fast approaching a mere $1,000, the difficulty of interpreting its mutations now seems much greater than before, raising doubts as to how soon genome sequencing will become a routine medical test. But Dr. Pritchard said personal genomics may soon be valuable in specific situations, like pediatric cases, cancer and the genetics of response to drugs.Another complication underlined by the two new surveys is that many rare mutations, because they are so recent, are specific to particular populations, with Africans and Europeans having sets that do not overlap much. This means that medical knowledge about rare mutations may have to be developed independently for each population.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Even so, the government expects the rules to cost billions of dollars to achieve fully — perhaps as much as $7 billion, which is less than 1 percent of the system’s overall cost, over the next 15 years, depending on how they are carried out.Advocates said the rules would end up saving money — for example, by avoiding the medical costs of injuries suffered by rape victims.Jamie Fellner, an expert on the subject with Human Rights Watch, said the costs would not be very high for any single facility, except perhaps those where very little has been done to address the problem.“If states don’t want to pay the costs, then they have to reduce their prison populations,” she said. “If you are going to put them in prison, you have to keep them safe.”The standards focus on prevention, supervision and changing the prison culture, not on setting numerical standards for results.“In popular culture,” said a summary of the rules issued on Thursday, “prison rape is often the subject of jokes; in public discourse, it has been at times dismissed by some as an inevitable — or even deserved — consequence of criminality. But sexual abuse is never a laughing matter, nor is it punishment for a crime. Rather, it is a crime, and it is no more tolerable when its victims have committed crimes of their own.”Among many provisions, the rules set targets for the staffing of juvenile facilities, but in recognition of the expense, this requirement does not take effect for five years, unless otherwise required by existing rules or judicial orders.The Justice Department said it would help states with grants to support demonstration projects and would support a national center on prison rape that would work on prevention strategies, detection and reporting, and other practices to keep inmates safe.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Chinese officials have been indignant at American criticism of their solar power industry, pointing out that the United States has urged China for years to embrace renewable energy as a way to reduce air pollution, combat climate change and limit the need for oil imports from politically volatile countries in the Mideast.Government support for solar energy is an important feature of China’s current Five-Year Plan, which runs through 2015, although Premier Wen Jiabao publicly cautioned in March that he was becoming concerned about overcapacity in the sector.Li Junfeng, an energy policy maker and regulator in the Chinese government who is also the president of the government-controlled Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, responded angrily to the American decision.“This is really a surprise,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s really dangerous.” Mr. Li said that Chinese companies would “certainly” retaliate by filing a trade case at China’s commerce ministry accusing big American chemical companies of dumping polysilicon, the main ingredient in solar panels, on the Chinese market.The American decision was made by civil servants in a quasi-judicial process that is heavily insulated by law from political interference and does not represent a deliberate attempt by the Obama administration to confront China on trade policy. But that distinction has been largely lost in China, where the solar panel issue has been one of many causes embraced online by the country’s vociferous ultranationalists, who put heavy pressure on Chinese officials to respond forcefully to perceived snubs to China.Further complicating matters is a similar case against China and Vietnam over the manufacture of steel towers for wind turbines, charging that steep government subsidies were giving foreign companies an unfair advantage over American manufacturers. A preliminary ruling is due on May 30 in that case.The solar tariffs, which are retroactive to 90 days before the decision is officially published in the next several days, are in addition to antisubsidy tariffs of 2.9 to 4.73 percent that the department imposed in March.SolarWorld Industries America, which led the coalition of manufacturers that filed the solar dumping case, welcomed the department’s ruling. The decision “is a very positive step in the process. It’s also in line with what we expected,” said Ben Santarris, a company spokesman. “We consider this a bellwether case. It underscores the importance of manufacturing to the U.S. economy.”Alan Price, a partner who heads the international trade practice at Wiley Rein, the law firm representing the United States companies in both the solar and wind cases, said that China posed a particular threat to America’s developing green energy sector.“China’s method is straightforward: it sets forth industry-specific Five-Year Plans and then uses all forms of national and local subsidies and other governmental support to quickly transfer jobs, supply chains, intellectual property and wealth, to the permanent detriment of U.S. and global manufacturers,” he said. “China’s ability to ramp up and overwhelm an industry is unique and particularly devastating with new and emerging technologies, where global competitors may be less established and can be knocked out more easily and quickly.”Several large Chinese manufacturers expressed disappointment with the decision and said they would try to convince the Commerce Department that it was unjustified.“Limiting trade in solar products will cause panel prices to increase, defeating America’s goal of driving down costs,” said Shawn Qu, chief executive of Canadian Solar, which makes panels in several Chinese plants and does brisk business in the United States. “Our first priority should be to support the health of the industry as a whole through the financing and installation of solar, which is the key driver to expanding jobs in the U.S. solar market.”According to a report from the Solar Foundation, an advocacy group, the solar industry employed about 100,000 workers last year, up almost 7 percent from the year before. More than half of the jobs were in installation, with about a quarter in manufacturing.Isabelle Christensen, the marketing director of JinkoSolar, another Chinese manufacturer, said that her company had already established a factory in Canada and could probably shift production there if necessary.“We can begin ramping up our manufacturing facility in Canada fairly quickly,” she said, matching what the company produces in China for the American market in a matter of months.But while Chinese solar panel manufacturers may threaten to set up production elsewhere, they may face another obstacle: their bankers. State-owned banks have already lent heavily to the Chinese manufacturers under pressure from the government, producing a capacity glut in China that has prompted factories to slash prices as they fight to maintain market share.A senior Chinese banker, who insisted on anonymity to avoid political repercussions, said that Chinese banks were not eager to lend heavily for another round of solar panel factory investments on the large scale needed to supply the American market.In the United States, solar panel trade cases have divided the industry in much the same way that automotive trade disputes in the 1980s split the American auto industry, when Detroit automakers seeking import restrictions were opposed by American car dealers who were making large profits from selling and servicing cars imported from Japan.Opponents of the tariffs say that the United States benefits from cheap Chinese production. They point out that Chinese companies often turn to American companies to buy the factory equipment and polysilicon they need to make solar panels, and installers hire local American workers to set up and service rooftop systems.Like the antisubsidy tariffs, the antidumping decision on Thursday is preliminary. But if solar panel importers win a final review of both tariff decisions by the Commerce Department later this year, the preliminary tariffs could be reduced or even entirely refunded, although they also might be increased.The Commerce Department calculated the 31 percent tariff by estimating Chinese manufacturers’ costs and then determining how far below cost the solar panels were being sold in the United States. But the department’s methods for calculating costs are controversial for countries that it designates as nonmarket economies, where the government plays such a large role in allocating land, credit and other resources that the true costs of any given product may not be apparent.In Thursday’s decision, the Commerce Department sided with SolarWorld in using solar manufacturing costs in Thailand as a proxy for costs in China. The Chinese industry had wanted to use India as a proxy instead.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Critics of the Police Department, however, said that if the intent of the changes was to resolve issues raised by a lawsuit against the department, which Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court elevated to class-action status on Wednesday, they fell short. Mr. Kelly’s letter included no substantive policy change, said Eugene J. O’Donnell, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.“It is being depicted as ‘a misunderstanding by the troops in the field, or nefarious conduct by the troops in the field,’ and not as, ‘We at One Police Plaza are searching our conscience and trying to find ways to make policy changes,’ ” Professor O’Donnell said. “It skirts all of the issues that were raised by the judge.”Last year, according to the Police Department, there were 685,724 street stops, not all of which led to frisks. Critics argue that the stops are often not justified, and that young black and Hispanic men are singled out. The police respond that the stops are made only after officers develop reasonable suspicion of criminality, and that the tactic has been responsible for reducing gun violence in high-crime neighborhoods.Mr. Kelly acknowledged that the refinements he is carrying out could blunt the spiraling rise in the number of stops.“It may translate into fewer stops,” he said at a news conference later on Thursday. “We think some of the stops are being recorded, and the forms used, unnecessarily. That’s part of it.”In his letter, Mr. Kelly pointed out that he had directed the department’s top training official, Deputy Commissioner James O’Keefe, to review the curriculum for street stops. He said one result of the review was the creation of a new course, currently being taught, that “provides personnel with an additional layer of clarity in determining when and how to conduct a lawful stop.”In addition, officers are encouraged to give to those they stop cards describing the legal authority for the stop, in an effort to reduce tensions that are common in such episodes, Mr. Kelly said. He said the first officers to get the training were 1,500 rookies assigned to the department’s Operation Impact program — an innovation he devised to team newly minted officers with supervisors in crime-plagued areas.Also, Mr. Kelly cited efforts at community outreach that he said the department was expanding to make inroads with young people who have come to the attention of the police, often because of their truancy or exposure to domestic violence.He said that filming for a fifth and final training video regarding street stops, to foster better understanding of the encounters on the street, began this week.Ms. Quinn, who disclosed the letter from Mr. Kelly, said that the steps were significant but that more must be done.“With these actions today,” she said in a statement, “Commissioner Kelly and the N.Y.P.D. are taking an important step forward, however more must be done to significantly reduce the number of stops and to bridge the divide between the N.Y.P.D. and the communities they serve.”But Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said Mr. Kelly’s efforts not only fell far short of resolving the concerns raised in the lawsuit, filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, but also failed to provide the kind of fundamental changes in the culture of policing that critics are increasingly calling for.“We need a clear recognition that the system is broken,” Ms. Lieberman said, “and that what is needed is systemic overhaul of policing in communities of color, particularly of stop-and-frisk.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — New claims for jobless benefits were unchanged last week, while factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region contracted in May, two reports said Thursday.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits held at 370,000 for the week ended Saturday, the Labor Department said. That was a little higher than analysts forecast in a Reuters poll.“We are really not showing much momentum in the labor market at this time,” said Sean Incremona, an economist at 4Cast in New York.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index declined to minus 5.8 from positive 8.5 in April, falling well short of economists’ expectations for an acceleration of activity.Any reading below zero indicates contraction in the region’s manufacturing. The survey covers factories in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.The claims data comes on the heels of three consecutive months of slowing employment gains. Companies added 115,000 new jobs to their payrolls in April, the fewest in six months.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Korean groups have been further motivated by a letter-writing campaign in Japan in opposition to a proposal by Peter Koo, a New York councilman and Chinese immigrant, to rename a street in Flushing, , in honor of comfort women.Mr. Park said that in the past week or so, his organization had received calls from at least five Korean community organizers around the country — in , , and — expressing interest in building their own memorials. These would be in addition to at least four memorials in the works in and Georgia, he added.The monument in Palisades Park is the only one in the dedicated to comfort women, borough officials said.“Starting from Flushing, N.Y., we will continue the construction in the areas of major Korean-American communities,” said Paul Park, executive director of the Korean-American Association of Greater New York, one of the oldest Korean community organizations in the region. “We Korean-Americans observe the issue on the level of a global violation of human rights.”Tensions between Japan and South Korea over the legacy of comfort women were reignited in December when a bronze statue in honor of victims was installed across the street from the Japanese Embassy in , the South Korean capital. Japanese officials have asked the Korean authorities to remove that statue.Japanese leaders have said that their formal apologies, expressions of remorse and admissions of responsibility regarding the treatment of comfort women are sufficient, including an offer to set up a $1 billion fund for victims. But many Koreans contend that those actions are inadequate. Surviving victims have rejected the fund because it would be financed by private money. The victims are seeking government reparations.Mayor James Rotundo of Palisades Park said the lobbying began obliquely late last month. Officials at the Japanese consulate in New York sent e-mails requesting a meeting with borough administrators.“I called the secretary and said, ‘What is this about?’ ” the mayor recalled in an interview, “and she said, ‘It’s about Japanese-U.S. relations,’ and I said: ‘Oh. Well, O.K.’ ”The first meeting, on May 1, began pleasantly enough, he said. The delegation was led by the consul general, Shigeyuki Hiroki, who talked about his career, including his work in — “niceties,” Mr. Rotundo said.Then the conversation took a sudden turn, Mr. Rotundo said. The consul general pulled out two documents and read them aloud.One was a copy of a 1993 statement from Yohei Kono, then the chief cabinet secretary, in which the Japanese government acknowledged the involvement of military authorities in the coercion and suffering of comfort women.The other was a 2001 letter to surviving comfort women from , then the prime minister, apologizing for their treatment.Mr. Hiroki then said the Japanese authorities “wanted our memorial removed,” Mr. Rotundo recalled.The consul general also said the Japanese government was willing to plant cherry trees in the borough, donate books to the public library “and do some things to show that we’re united in this world and not divided,” Mr. Rotundo said. But the offer was contingent on the memorial’s removal. “I couldn’t believe my ears,” said Jason Kim, deputy mayor of Palisades Park and a Korean-American, who was at the meeting. “My blood shot up like crazy.”Borough officials rejected the request, and the delegation left.The second delegation arrived on May 6 and was led by four members of the Japanese Parliament. Their approach was less diplomatic, Mr. Rotundo said. The politicians, members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, tried, in asking that the monument be removed, to convince the Palisades Park authorities that comfort women had never been forcibly conscripted as sex slaves.“They said the comfort women were a lie, that they were set up by an outside agency, that they were women who were paid to come and take care of the troops,” the mayor related. “I said, ‘We’re not going to take it down, but thanks for coming.’ ”The Japanese consulate in New York has been reluctant to discuss its lobbying.In interviews this week, Fumio Iwai, the deputy consul general, would not say whether the consul general had requested that the monument be removed. But he denied that the consul general had offered to help the borough in return for the monument’s removal. Mr. Hiroki “did not offer any such condition,” he said.Mr. Iwai said the issue of comfort women, if not Palisades Park specifically, was the subject of continuing discussions “at a very high level” between the governments of South Korea and Japan.he said, pausing as if to choose his words carefully, “things are quite complicated.”'"

"'12-05-18,'0','In fact, both rights activists and legal experts say, the system for dealing with dissidents and other troublemakers is geared toward allowing local leaders to ignore the law, with Beijing’s sometimes silent assent.The central government may even reward local leaders for doing so. The reason is that their Communist Party careers depend on meeting a series of performance goals — from high economic growth to low levels of public unrest — whose importance far outweigh any gold stars awarded for following the law.That system gives leaders an incentive to silence troublemakers by any means in order to win high marks for maintaining public stability, one of the most importance performance metrics. It can uncork gushers of money for added security measures to keep control of a high-profile activist like Mr. Chen.And it can pay off for the local leaders who do the job well. The man Mr. Chen has blamed most for his detention and imprisonment is Li Qun, who was mayor of Linyi from 2003 to 2007. Just a few years before that, Mr. Li was studying public administration at the University of New Haven and an intern to the New Haven mayor, John DeStefano Jr.Mr. Li has since been promoted to party secretary of Shandong’s biggest port, Qingdao, and he sits on the province’s Communist Party standing committee, its highest ruling body.Only when local measures blow up into national or global embarrassments, as they have in Mr. Chen’s case, is the central government obliged to step in and order face-saving measures like investigations. In countless other instances, the experts say, Beijing quietly tolerates local officials’ lawlessness, and they do so for a simple reason: with rare exceptions, the system is exceedingly efficient at stifling unrest.Jerome Cohen, a law professor at New York University and an adviser to Mr. Chen, said he was told by a prominent Chinese criminal lawyer that cases like Mr. Chen’s were not unusual. “They’re only unusual because you know about them,” Mr. Cohen said. “I can tell you that there are thousands of cases like this.”To those who study the system, its success makes it unlikely that party leaders will use the embarrassment of the Chen episode to push for changes that could themselves prove destabilizing.“It would have implications not just in one city or one county, but for the entire country,” Fu Hualing, a law professor at Hong Kong University, said in an interview. “This is how they govern the population. If you punish the local government, if you dismiss the officials, then you have to tell all the other local officials that there’s a different way of doing things now. And that would be a very fundamental change.”A serious inquiry also would send a signal that when enough publicity and pressure is brought to bear, the Communist Party can be forced to change.“The main problem with Beijing is that very often, they condone injustices even though they know that the local authorities are in the wrong,” said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong. “But many of the problems that come up in these cases are not isolated — they’re endemic. And Beijing fears that backing down on one case would open the floodgates.”Mr. Chen’s case, one of the few to get prolonged public scrutiny, offers some insights into the incentives that make repression the tool of choice to deal with dissidents and troublemakers.A self-taught lawyer who is blind, Mr. Chen crusaded for social justice in his native Shandong Province, and in the process imperiled party officials’ record not only on keeping order, but also on another important measure: enforcing the one-child population-control policy.In August 2005, after he began a deftly publicized campaign to help citizens sue the local government over forced late-term abortions and sterilizations, the reaction was swift: a mob surrounded Mr. Chen’s village home, trapping the family inside for weeks. Foreshadowing the events of this spring, Mr. Chen and a nephew eventually escaped to Beijing, only to be seized there and returned home by police officers sent from Shandong.Neither action by the local authorities was legal. “They used the justification of the one-child policy and stability maintenance,” said Pu Zhiqiang, a prominent human rights lawyer.After the detention generated international headlines, Mr. Cohen said, the public security minister sent emissaries to Shandong to discuss the case. Later, in 2006, Mr. Chen was convicted and imprisoned on what experts said were trumped-up charges, and his detention gained a legal basis.But when he was released from prison in September 2010, Mr. Chen again found himself and his family sealed inside their village home, this time surrounded by a cordon of fences and security equipment and a contingent of guards around the clock.For the layers of government overseeing Dongshigu, Mr. Chen’s destitute, remote village, detention has become a lucrative industry. Mr. Chen has claimed that his captors told him it cost about $9.5 million annually to keep him under house arrest.The target of that smothering security is now in a Beijing hospital, preparing to move with his wife and daughter to the United States to study law. But the costly crackdown continues unabated.Outside Dongshigu, police vans dot the highway, their lights flashing, and carloads of plainclothes guards roam side roads, their license plates sometimes covered in camouflage cloth.On Sunday, when journalists sought to visit Mr. Chen’s home in Dongshigu, about 33 miles from Linyi, they were quickly and roughly escorted away by security guards in plain clothes. Later, in Yinan, the county seat, one man attacked a photographer who was recording a reporter’s attempt to question him.“Get out of China,” the man yelled at a Chinese news assistant. “You’re not Chinese. You’re a traitor.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Whatever approach you take is going to cost you something, even if you avoid the stock market altogether. So how you deal with investment risk will ultimately depend on what you’re willing to give up. Here are some different approaches:ELIMINATE MOST RISK Trying to squeeze out risk is still going to require some sacrifices. The idea is that you save enough money to meet your goal — say, covering your basic expenses in retirement — without investing in risky assets. The big caveat is that you’ll need to save aggressively, perhaps much more so than if you turned to the stock market for some assistance (assuming it provides a decent return during your time frame).But some academics like Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University, say they believe it can be done by taking a “safety first” approach, where you start by figuring out what your bare essentials will cost in retirement. Then, you save aggressively to cover those expenses, and put the money into virtually risk-free investments, like Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or I-Bonds. (I-Bonds never decline in value, are issued by Treasury and pay a fixed interest rate, currently 0 percent, as well as a variable rate that keeps pace with inflation.)The idea is to create a safety net once you stop working. So if you bought $10,000 of I-Bonds each year over a 40-year career — the maximum you can buy each year, though Professor Bodie expects the amount will be adjusted for inflation — you would leave the work force with $400,000. Today, a 65-year-old man could take that money and buy an annuity that would provide roughly $15,000 in inflation-adjusted income annually (with spousal survivor benefits). This could be used with Social Security income — for a retiree at full retirement age today, a maximum of about $30,000 annually — to cover the basics.“That’s not too bad,” added Professor Bodie, co-author of “Risk Less and Prosper” (Wiley 2011).He also suggested creating something that approximated a personal pension through a so-called TIPS ladder. Here, you would figure out your basic spending needs each year, and buy TIPS with varying terms so that the bonds mature over time, as you need the money. (Given the tax treatment of TIPS, he recommended doing this in a tax-deferred or tax-sheltered account. It also takes significant planning since TIPS are sold in five-year maturities.)Mr. Bodie said he did not have a problem investing money in riskier assets for discretionary spending. He also said that younger people could handle somewhat more risk since they had the luxury of time to make adjustments.Still, this approach isn’t foolproof either. You may be sacrificing more than you need to if the markets do well. You can also lose the ability to save aggressively if you are laid off, for example, or have an expensive medical issue. And then there are all of life’s other costs — college tuition, saving for a down payment on a home, health insurance.“The trouble is, of course, that almost no one can accumulate that much money — in rough terms, about 25 years of living expenses after Social Security and pensions — just by investing in safe assets,” said William J. Bernstein, author of “The Investor’s Manifesto” (Wiley 2009) and other investing books. “You have to take some risk to get there, and because you’re taking that risk, you may not get there. But taking that risk is still your best shot.”There are several different ways to figure out how much that kind of low-risk approach may cost you. But let’s say you decided that saving $1 million was enough (that is, $1 million in inflation-adjusted dollars, meaning it keeps pace with inflation over time). You may be able to get there after 30 years by saving $750 a month, or $9,000 annually, and investing that money in a portfolio evenly split between stock and bonds, which earned 4.7 percent after inflation. But to avoid the stock market altogether, you would have to increase your monthly savings to $1,250 a month, or $15,000 a year, and receive a 2.5 percent return after inflation in a diversified bond-only portfolio, according to calculations by Kent Smetters, a risk management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and founder of Veritat Advisors, which takes an approach similar to the one advocated by Professor Bodie.REDUCE RISK, LIVE WITH SOME Investing in a diversified portfolio — split among different types of stocks and bonds, while gradually reducing your exposure to risky stocks — is the classic way to reduce your risk. But it doesn’t eliminate risk. “In a crunch, or even in a normal sharply down market, like we’ve had the past few weeks, there are only risky and riskless assets,” Mr. Bernstein said. “So in the short term, diversification among different stock asset classes is usually of no help. They all get taken out and get shot. But over a decade or longer, diversification among stock asset classes is nearly magic.”And when you add a healthy helping of bonds, you further reduce that risk. The trick is finding a level of risk you’re comfortable with so that you don’t bail out at the worst possible time. This approach also requires you to consider what a worst case might feel like, and what sort of changes you need to make to adjust.You can also reduce your risk through hedging techniques. One relatively straightforward strategy is buying “put” option contracts, which give you the right to sell a fixed number of shares (say, of an exchange-traded fund that tracks a stock index) at a certain price within a certain period of time. This essentially puts a floor on your losses. If the shares don’t drop, you lose only the cost of the option.So while this allows you to hedge your risk, it can weigh on your total return because you are paying for the insurance the puts provide. The downside, of course, are the costs and the hassles of such a strategy. “You can approximate any hedging strategy you might want far more cheaply simply by selling some risky assets,” Mr. Bernstein said. “There is no risk fairy who will write you a cheap option that will take stock risk off your hands.”TRANSFER OR SHARE RISK This approach to risk management typically involves buying insurance. If you’re about to retire, you could buy a single-premium immediate annuity, where you pay an insurance company a pile of cash and, in return, the company pays you a stream of income for the rest of your life. The downside is that you just surrendered a pile of cash, which means you will not be able to use that money in an emergency. And if you die prematurely, your heirs won’t receive it either. There’s the risk, too, that the insurance company could run into financial trouble.Annuities can also feel expensive. They may pay out approximately 4 or 5 percent of your investment, according to Professor Bodie, depending on the options you choose. An investment of $500,000 will buy slightly less than $2,400 in monthly income for a 65-year old man and his 62-year-old wife, according to a rough estimate from ImmediateAnnuities.com. But inflation-adjusted payments will cost more.“Any insurance is going to cost you,” said Professor Bodie, who says he believes annuities may make sense for some retirees. “There is no free lunch.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','In addition to setting interest rates based on the economy’s condition, the Fed also is one of the main regulators of financial businesses.Both of the new governors are experienced in financial regulation, Mr. Powell as a senior Treasury Department official under President George H. W. Bush, and Mr. Stein as an adviser to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.Some Fed watchers have expressed concern that the institution has been operating below full capacity for so long. Mr. Obama had been slow to fill all of the vacancies, and Republicans had blocked some of his nominees.In 2010, Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, put a hold on the nomination of Peter A. Diamond, a Nobel laureate in economics, causing Mr. Diamond to withdraw last June. On Thursday, some senators expressed hope that the vote would lead to broader comity. For too long, said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Republican of Tennessee, being in the Senate had felt like “being invited to join the Grand Ole Opry and not being allowed to sing.”Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said, “We hope it can set the tone for agreements well into the future, this year and in 2013 as well,”A White House statement expressed gratitude that “both parties have come together” for the votes on Mr. Stein and Mr. Powell. “Today’s broad bipartisan vote in the Senate reflects their deep knowledge of economic and monetary policy, as well as their distinguished backgrounds and unique experience,” it said.Opening the debate on the Senate floor, Mr. Vitter made clear that he opposed the candidates, and that he opposed the Fed’s monetary policy of low interest rates. “This Federal Reserve has set essentially a zero interest rate policy, an extremely easy policy for an extended period of time,” he said, calling it a “very dangerous policy.”On the regulatory front, Mr. Vitter said, approving the two new members would make it easier for the board to enact rules carrying out the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law and pushing “those regulations to the left, if you will.”The two nominees were confirmed by a voice vote of the Senate Banking Committee on March 29, and neither is controversial in his own right. But Senate Republicans have blocked many of Mr. Obama’s nominees, out of a broader opposition to his policies.Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, said he would vote to confirm the nominees, saying they were qualified even though he believed they were not as “hawkish” on inflation as he would like.Mr. Corker expressed hope that, if Mitt Romney won the presidential election, Democrats would not stand in the way when he nominated the next Fed chairman and vice chairman.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Critics of the Police Department, however, said that if the intent of the changes was to resolve issues raised by a lawsuit against the department, which Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of Federal District Court elevated to class-action status on Wednesday, they fell short. Mr. Kelly’s letter included no substantive policy change, said Eugene J. O’Donnell, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.“It is being depicted as ‘a misunderstanding by the troops in the field, or nefarious conduct by the troops in the field,’ and not as, ‘We at One Police Plaza are searching our conscience and trying to find ways to make policy changes,’ ” Professor O’Donnell said. “It skirts all of the issues that were raised by the judge.”Last year, according to the Police Department, there were 685,724 street stops, not all of which led to frisks. Critics argue that the stops are often not justified, and that young black and Hispanic men are singled out. The police respond that the stops are made only after officers develop reasonable suspicion of criminality, and that the tactic has been responsible for reducing gun violence in high-crime neighborhoods.Mr. Kelly acknowledged that the refinements he is carrying out could blunt the spiraling rise in the number of stops.“It may translate into fewer stops,” he said at a news conference later on Thursday. “We think some of the stops are being recorded, and the forms used, unnecessarily. That’s part of it.”In his letter, Mr. Kelly pointed out that he had directed the department’s top training official, Deputy Commissioner James O’Keefe, to review the curriculum for street stops. He said one result of the review was the creation of a new course, currently being taught, that “provides personnel with an additional layer of clarity in determining when and how to conduct a lawful stop.”In addition, officers are encouraged to give to those they stop cards describing the legal authority for the stop, in an effort to reduce tensions that are common in such episodes, Mr. Kelly said. He said the first officers to get the training were 1,500 rookies assigned to the department’s Operation Impact program — an innovation he devised to team newly minted officers with supervisors in crime-plagued areas.Also, Mr. Kelly cited efforts at community outreach that he said the department was expanding to make inroads with young people who have come to the attention of the police, often because of their truancy or exposure to domestic violence.He said that filming for a fifth and final training video regarding street stops, to foster better understanding of the encounters on the street, began this week.Ms. Quinn, who disclosed the letter from Mr. Kelly, said that the steps were significant but that more must be done.“With these actions today,” she said in a statement, “Commissioner Kelly and the N.Y.P.D. are taking an important step forward, however more must be done to significantly reduce the number of stops and to bridge the divide between the N.Y.P.D. and the communities they serve.”But Donna Lieberman, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said Mr. Kelly’s efforts not only fell far short of resolving the concerns raised in the lawsuit, filed by the Center for Constitutional Rights, but also failed to provide the kind of fundamental changes in the culture of policing that critics are increasingly calling for.“We need a clear recognition that the system is broken,” Ms. Lieberman said, “and that what is needed is systemic overhaul of policing in communities of color, particularly of stop-and-frisk.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','One of the surveys was conducted by Jacob A. Tennessen and Joshua M. Akey of the University of Washington in Seattle and colleagues, the other by a team led by Matthew R. Nelson and Vincent Mooser of GlaxoSmithKline.Both groups attribute the abundance of rare variants to the explosion of human populations after the invention of agriculture some 10,000 years ago. Because the population expansion is so recent, in evolutionary terms, natural selection has not had time to eliminate the harmful mutations.The Seattle team calculates that in every individual, 313 genes out of the 25,000 in the human genome carry rare mutations that alter the function of the protein specified by the gene. The GlaxoSmithKline team, which looked just at a category of genes likely to make good drug targets, calculates that a rare variant occurs in one out of every 17 DNA units, of which the human genome has some three billion.These findings may help explain why it has proved so hard to isolate the genetic roots of disease. Until now, researchers have looked only at common mutations as possible contributors to the risk of common diseases.This approach was in one sense dictated by technology; for many years, common mutations were the only ones that could be worked with. But a theory developed to justify the approach — the “common disease, common variant” hypothesis — held that some mutations exerted their bad effects late in life, after people had had their children, and had become common because natural selection was powerless to act against them.But the theory was wrong. Common variants have turned out to explain only a fraction of the genetic risk of common disease. The opposite hypothesis, the “common disease, rare variant” idea, “has become increasingly credible,” the GlaxoSmithKline team writes.Jonathan Pritchard, a geneticist at the University of Chicago who drew attention to the possible role of rare variants in 2001, said it seemed a likely bet that rare variants were contributing to an important fraction of disease. In addition, many common variants may contribute risks that are too small to have shown up in current surveys, he said. But in either case, detecting the roots of common disease will prove much more difficult than envisaged under the “common variant, common disease” scenario. Mutations with small effect must be studied in large numbers of patients to be detectable. Even if the effects of some rare variants can be measured, assessing the significance of the millions that stud each individual’s genome will be challenging.Though the cost of decoding an individual’s genome is fast approaching a mere $1,000, the difficulty of interpreting its mutations now seems much greater than before, raising doubts as to how soon genome sequencing will become a routine medical test. But Dr. Pritchard said personal genomics may soon be valuable in specific situations, like pediatric cases, cancer and the genetics of response to drugs.Another complication underlined by the two new surveys is that many rare mutations, because they are so recent, are specific to particular populations, with Africans and Europeans having sets that do not overlap much. This means that medical knowledge about rare mutations may have to be developed independently for each population.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','He went on to add that: “At some moment, such actions, which undermine sovereignty, can end with a full-fledged regional war, or even, and I don’t want to scare anybody, the use of nuclear weapons.”The Russian Micex index, a gauge of large blue chips traded on the domestic market, fell sharply. By the market closing, the index had lost 3.5 percent and ended the day at its lowest level in seven months. Some large Russian companies tumbled even further. Sberbank, the country’s largest lender, dropped 7 percent.Those losses were partly recouped in a midday surge on Friday — before stocks dipped yet again.The index typically closely tracks the price of oil, a major export commodity. And global oil prices were also down, providing another explanation for the drop. Other international markets were also down.When Mr. Medvedev spoke “traders were looking for any excuse to sell,” Vladimir Osakovsky, the chief economist for the former Soviet states at Merrill Lynch Bank of America in Moscow, said in a telephone interview.The prospect of nuclear Armageddon, per se, did not frighten investors. At issue was the comment’s significance for a looming macroeconomic transition in Russia known as the “twin deficits.”Though Russia’s economy appears in rude health today from high oil prices, rising consumer spending and government outlays will push both the budget and balance of payments into deficit within two years, economists say.After that, the Kremlin will rely on lending from abroad, a dynamic last seen in the late Soviet period and in the 1990s.Attracting foreign investment hinges on the Kremlin assuaging worries about the eruption of a new East-West conflict and instituting reforms at home.Yet Vladimir V. Putin, now president, may well choose a hawkish foreign policy stance to deflect attention from the middle-class protest movement simmering in the capital, analysts of Russian politics say. In one signal, Mr. Putin canceled a visit to Washington, where he was to attend a Group of 8 industrialized nations meeting this weekend.Mr. Medvedev, who will attend in Mr. Putin’s place, favors reform, and during his term as president welcomed the détente between Russia and the United States under the administration of President Obama.The nuclear talk brought back memories of a more tense relationship.“This kind of stuff is really not market-friendly,” Mr. Osakovsky said.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Miller grew up in a thoroughly Jewish milieu, recalling in his autobiography, “Timebends,” how he sat on his great-grandfather’s lap in synagogue and later had a bar mitzvah ceremony. His adult belief system, though, took the form of left-wing politics, and critiques of capitalism and the McCarthy era’s Red Scare ultimately informed many of his finest plays — “All My Sons,” “A View From the Bridge,” “The Crucible.”“Salesman” had indisputably Jewish origins. Miller based Willy Loman on his uncle Manny Newman, a salesman brought low by the Depression. He tried out earlier versions of the character in stories he wrote in his teens and 20s about salesmen with apparently Jewish surnames — Schoenzeit and Schleifer.So the intriguing question remains why Willy, as finally written, offers so little evidence of heritage. Miller, in a 1969 interview, insisted that the character’s “religious or cultural background ... seems to me irrelevant.” The contemporary playwright Tony Kushner, who is editing Miller’s collected plays for the Library of America, suggested that for Jewish writers in the mid-20th century, “there wasn’t a sense of shame about being Jewish, but of reaching for something universal, and there was some sense that the immigrant experience and the ethnic specificity would limit it.”Miller did write overtly Jewish characters, starting in his 1945 novel about anti-Semitism, “Focus,” and continuing through two plays about the Holocaust, “Incident at Vichy” (1964) and “Broken Glass” (1994). So the decision to leave Willy’s identity indistinct represented a thought-through choice, not a chronic ambivalence about Jewish content.Mr. Novick, for his part, called “Salesman” the sequel to “Fiddler on the Roof” — the tragic culmination of the immigrant’s American dream. Harold Bloom, a scholar of both biblical and modern literature, posited that the play’s heartbreaking, embittered reunion of Willy and his alienated son Biff is an inversion of the Bible’s reuniting of Jacob and Joseph, which he called “the paradigm of Jewish family love.”The playwright David Mamet, himself the grandson of a traveling salesman, said that the play’s tension “between hope, confusion, aspiration and circumstance” was itself “the voice of the second-generation American-Jewish writers.” Some critics have singled out Linda Loman’s famous speech about Willy — “Attention, attention must finally be paid to such a person” — as having a distinctively Yiddish cadence.Over time, Miller came around to acknowledging some Jewish specificity to the Lomans. In an essay published for the play’s 50th anniversary, in 1999, he described them as “Jews light-years away from religion or a community that might have fostered Jewish identity.” Thus sundered, they are left “on the sidewalk side of the glass looking in at the clean well-lighted place.” In the very absence of their Jewish identity, one might say, is its very presence.The current production — widely lauded and nominated for seven Tony Awards — has been most notable for its fidelity to Miller’s original intent. It uses the set design and musical score from the original production, and it indelibly portrays Willy’s drift between present and past, between reality and memory and fantasy. Miller’s original title for the play, after all, was “The Inside of His Head.”The producer Scott Rudin was interested enough, though, in the matter of the Loman family’s roots to assemble a research folder of critical and biographical essays grappling with the Jew-Everyman debate. “It’s so much a play about someone who wants to belong to the largest thing he can belong to — a fantasy of America,” Mr. Rudin said in a recent interview. “And he’s become deracinated from his background in the process.”Mike Nichols, the director of the current revival, came to the United States as a Jewish refugee child from Nazi Germany. What he has seen in Willy is not the intensity of the immigrant generation of Jews, with its fervor for education, but the worship of materialism by the second generation, those disparaged in Yiddish as being “alrightniks.”“Willy has no forebears,” Mr. Nichols said in an interview this month. “He’s not from any country. He has no holidays of any religion. So you have to assume Miller’s making a point. We who are struggling to sell enough have to drop everything — religion, nationality, family. There is nothing except, as Willy puts it, being known and being well-liked.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','For someone who really has a passion for managing a process, though, investing in franchises can be so lucrative that that extra spark may not matter.David Barr, an accountant by training, said that in 1998, after managing the sale of Great American Cookies as chief executive, he had enough money to think about what he wanted to do next. He decided to invest some of it in two Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises and begin a second career as a director on corporate boards.“I wanted a brand that was a powerful brand, not a start-up, because long term I was looking for something in which I didn’t have to be at the counter every day or over the fryer,” Mr. Barr said. “It’s a true investment because I’ve never taken a dime out and those two have now acquired 23 franchises.”To keep his investments in Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and, later, Taco Bell restaurants separate from his day job, he instituted a firm rule: Every restaurant had to be at least 45 minutes but no more than three hours from his home in Marietta, Ga.“I’m not 100 percent passive,” he said, noting that he had an operating partner. “Anyone who thinks that buying a franchise is like buying G.E. stock is crazy. But it’s not 40 hours a week.”The biggest drain for passive investors in franchises may be managing the people who are making their investment profitable day to day.“A lot of people do not pay attention to the people part of the business,” said Aslam Khan, who started as a dishwasher at a Church’s Chicken in 1987 and now owns 165 of the restaurants and employs 6,000 people. “Chicken doesn’t move by itself.”He said he attributed his success to making sure that the people who worked for him were well taken care of.Stephen J. Caldiera, chief executive of the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said having someone to pay attention to the day-to-day operation was crucial. “The people who just want to invest are smart to hire proven operators,” he said. “You’re only as good as the people running the business.”One of the misleading numbers for people interested in investing in a franchise is the relatively low franchise fee. Mr. Caldiera said fees started as low as $5,000. Burger King’s franchise fee is $50,000 — but it requires people to have a net worth of $1.5 million and liquid assets of $500,000.These financial requirements are the biggest barrier for investors. McDonald’s has a similar $500,000 liquid asset requirement, but the company estimates that equipment and preopening costs range from $959,450 to $2,110,700. The franchise fee is a mere $45,000.“Over the past several years, the biggest growth in our system has been from second-generation owners,” Danya Proud, a spokeswoman, said. “There has been a smaller percentage from outside the system.”That said, a franchisee’s child would not be granted a franchise on that basis alone. “They’re taking over a $2.6 million business,” she said. “We’re not going to take some 23-year-old who has maxed out her credit cards.”Even for newer franchises, the setup costs are steep. Seattle’s Best Coffee, which is owned by Starbucks, said the cost to set up a new franchise ranged from $181,835 to $445,035, excluding real estate costs. It doesn’t take a math whiz to figure out that you are going to have to sell a lot of coffee to recoup that initial investment.Mr. Khan said he had become an investor in franchises his managers wanted to start, as much to make a return on his money as to help minority business owners like himself get started. “They got me here, and I can get them here,” he said. He said he would invest up to 49 percent of the cost of the franchise.For investors who want to turn one franchise into many, the type of franchise they start with matters. Mr. Barr said he chose Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants because he knew it would be easier to get financing for a top-tier franchise, given the track record and customer base.Mr. Barr also advised people who wanted a hands-off role to buy existing franchises instead of building one from scratch. “If you buy a KFC today that’s operating, the next day you’re making money,” he said. “You’re not training staff and opening with no revenue.”But again, franchises fail, like anything else. Mr. Cohen has had to close Great American Cookie stores, even though he is the longest-serving franchisee in the system. He has also lost his entire investment in a franchise that sold Philly cheesesteaks.And perhaps worse for the passive investor, an investment in a franchise can require more attention than an investor planned on giving it. That happened to Carlyle MacHarg, who made his money in real estate.Mr. MacHarg, 68, said he had purposely steered clear of investing in any type of restaurant, after seeing too many friends regret doing it. But when he was approached by the son of a family friend who was part of a group trying to turn around Pat & Oscar’s, a small family restaurant chain based in San Diego, he changed his mind.Mr. MacHarg said the price he paid in June 2010 produced an annual return of 40 percent. He then hired the friend’s son to manage the restaurants, and was happy for a year or so. But last September, the company that owned the brand went bankrupt, and Mr. MacHarg found himself leading a group of five other franchisees to get control of the Pat & Oscar’s name.They were outbid. Worse, the new owner tried to raise the franchise fees. Mr. MacHarg said the group balked and began looking to rebrand their restaurants under the name O’s American Kitchen.“I’ve been spending most days, 10 to 12 hours a day, on this,” he said. “Everything else I have to deal with is on the back burner. This thing has been all-consuming. “Despite all of this, he said the restaurants accounted for only 10 percent of his investments. But having gone from passive investor to active manager, he has caught the bug that drives the most passionate franchisees. “This could really take off,” he said. “And if the brand takes off, it really goes.”Then he caught himself. “Or it could be fine for our nine restaurants.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','“It’s primarily due to the low natural gas prices, and how that affects the political environment,” said Bart Ford, a vice president of Tenaska, the developer. “We’re not changing the nature of the facility, just deferring the synthetic natural gas portion.”Still, Tenaska is continuing to seek permits to inject carbon dioxide underground at the site, Mr. Ford said. “This allows us to say, we’ll wait until the price impact is lower because the price of natural gas is up,” he said.Making synthetic natural gas from coal makes economic sense only if the ordinary natural gas that it displaces is more expensive.The advent of hydraulic fracturing, a drilling method that has opened vast new supplies of natural gas, has helped to keep gas prices low. The industry’s expectation is that the price will rise somewhat from its current depressed level — near $2 per million B.T.U., compared with as much as $14 before the recession — but that it will not recover fully for many years.Edwardsport, a “capture-ready” Duke Energy coal plant, is scheduled to begin commercial operation this year. The plant, in Edwardsport, Ind., will cook coal into a fuel gas and could be retrofitted to capture carbon dioxide released in that conversion. But Duke, the builder, has no plan to capture the carbon dioxide and no place to sequester it for now. It is exempted from the new rule because construction began five years ago.The plant cost nearly $3 billion to build, about $1 billion over budget, and carbon capture would cost $380 million, not counting storage.Only two other major carbon capture projects are on the drawing boards in the United States. Neither is affected directly by low natural gas prices. But the ebbing interest in coal-fired construction may signal that even if the technology works well, there may be few commercial projects where it could be deployed.One is FutureGen 2.0, a $1.6 billion plan to burn coal in oxygen, generating exhaust gas that is pure carbon dioxide, and pumping it into geologic formations thousands of feet below the earth’s surface.The Recovery Act of 2009 is covering $1 billion of the cost of the project, which is in Meredosia, Ill. But the project, originally expected to be running by 2015, has run into a variety of bureaucratic problems and is now scheduled to be in service in 2017, barring further delays. An earlier version, FutureGen, was rejected by the Energy Department in 2008 to save money.The other venture is the Southern Company’s Kemper County project in Mississippi, which will turn coal into a cleaner gas and use it to power a turbine. The captured carbon dioxide is expected to be sold and travel through a pipeline to Texas, where it will be pumped under ground to force oil out of old oil fields, a process known as enhanced oil recovery.At the moment the market prospects look favorable, given that the price oil drillers will pay for the carbon dioxide depends partly on the price of oil, which is relatively high. But construction is just beginning, so the long-term picture is unclear. The plant is expected to start operating in 2014.Some in the power industry are debating whether the Obama administration’s carbon regulation will be blocked by Congress or a new administration. Still, the absence of a rule would not change the economic equation discouraging investment in capture technology for coal plants.Kelly Ziegler, a spokeswoman for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state consortium on the East Coast that seeks to limit carbon dioxide output, said that no regulation was necessary to stop new coal plants. “Natural gas has already done that for you,” she said.Hearings on the rule are to begin on May 24, and the E.P.A. is taking public comments until June 25. The agency may issue a final rule this year.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Citi Field, home of the Mets, is sold out for Sunday evening — but not for a baseball game. More than 40,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews plan to pack the stadium to hear about what the event’s organizers call the dangers of the Internet and how to use it in a religiously responsible way.Tickets for the gathering have been so sought after that organizers announced on Wednesday that they had also rented the nearby 20,000-seat Arthur Ashe Stadium, home to the United States Open, for an overflow crowd.Speakers at the rally in Queens will not seek to ban the Internet, but rather to raise awareness about how, unmonitored, it poses a grave risk to the community, said Eytan Kobre, a spokesman for the organizers. The risk, he said, comes not only from pornography, but also from social media and the addictive pull of the Internet, which can limit human interaction, reading and study.“These are the same concerns that people across society — in academia, in psychology, parents, spouses — have about the Internet,” he said. “But here is a community that is actually standing up and coming together and putting our money where our mouth is, to express a unified communal resolve to address the issues.”At both stadiums, only men are invited, because of the ultra-Orthodox practice of strict gender separation. The meeting will be broadcast live to audiences of women in schools and event halls in Borough Park and Flatbush in Brooklyn and in other ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods, according to Hamodia, a newspaper serving the Orthodox.'"

"'12-05-18,'0','The other two judges were harder to read. Chief Judge William Byrd Traxler Jr. said relatively little throughout the hearing, and the third jurist, Albert Diaz, asked skeptical questions of both sides.The former C.I.A. officer, Jeffrey Sterling, is accused of leaking government secrets to Mr. Risen for his 2006 book, “State of War.” It recounted an effort by the C.I.A. a dozen years ago to sabotage Iranian nuclear research — an operation that the book portrays as having been dangerously botched. Mr. Risen is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter for The New York Times.The Justice Department has tried to force Mr. Risen to testify, first during a grand jury proceeding and then again after Mr. Sterling was charged with leaking government secrets. But Mr. Risen has refused to identify his confidential sources, citing the First Amendment.Last year, the trial judge overseeing the case, Leonie M. Brinkema of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., ruled that Mr. Risen was protected by a qualified “reporter’s privilege” that allowed her to balance whether it was necessary to force him to disclose his sources. Judge Brinkema contended that Mr. Risen’s testimony was not crucial because prosecutors could use other evidence against Mr. Sterling.But the government has appealed that ruling, arguing that no reporter’s privilege exists in criminal trials. Mr. Parker on Friday invoked a 1972 Supreme Court case holding that there is no reporter’s privilege against being forced to testify before a grand jury. He said the case was “clear” that the same rule should apply in a trial.But Judge Diaz pronounced the precedent “clear as mud.” Among other problems, the fifth vote in the majority for that case came from a justice who wrote his own concurring opinion that appeared to give a broader reading of press freedoms than the other four.A lawyer for Mr. Risen, Joel Kurtzberg, told the panel that no federal appeals court has adopted an understanding of First Amendment press protections as limited as the prosecutors’ view, urging them “not to accept the government’s invitation to be the first.”A diverse coalition of more than two dozen media organizations, including The Times and Fox News, has filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that a qualified reporter’s privilege — allowing judges to protect reporters from testifying under some circumstances — is crucial for the “dissemination of news and information to the public.”There is a possibility that the appeals court will invoke a technicality to sidestep the need to directly address the novel First Amendment questions raised by the case — at least for now. Mr. Kurtzberg argued that the appeals court lacks jurisdiction to review Judge Brinkema’s order at this stage because the judge has said she will revisit the question of Mr. Risen’s testimony midway through the trial.Both Judge Diaz and Judge Traxler asked questions about the jurisdictional matter. But Mr. Parker voiced doubt that Judge Brinkema will change her mind and argued that the appeals court should rule on the issue now. Prosecutors need to know whether they can invoke Mr. Risen’s testimony in opening statements, he said, and it would be too late for prosecutors to appeal again once a jury is seated.A lawyer for Mr. Sterling told the court that his client took no position in the dispute between Mr. Risen and prosecutors.The names of the three appeals court judges assigned to the case were not disclosed until Friday, as is the Fourth Circuit’s practice. All three were selected by Democrats: President Obama appointed Judge Diaz and President Bill Clinton appointed Judges Traxler and Gregory, although Judge Gregory received a recess appointment and was reappointed by President George W. Bush.Mr. Sterling is one of six current and former government employees to be charged with leaking government secrets under the Obama administration — more such cases than were brought under all previous presidents combined.Only the first half of the hearing was open to the public. Prosecutors are also appealing two other decisions by Judge Brinkema, including one barring them from using two witnesses because prosecutors missed a deadline for giving the defense team information that could be used to call their testimony into question. The discussion of the other portions of the case were closed to the public because they were expected to involve classified information.Prosecutors have said that Judge Brinkema’s rulings, if they stand, “effectively terminated the prosecution” of Mr. Sterling.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','My natural instinct is to react angrily and dismiss the hypercapitalistic arguments of Edward Conard. But as I thought about it a little bit more, I decided he should be applauded. In a country where the 1 percent seem all too content to hide behind vague and self-serving arguments, Conard openly shares opinions that he has formed after considerable thought. I may not be interested in seeing these ideas carried out to reality, but this clarity helps me better understand fiscal conservatives and their logic. If I were a politician in this battle, I would feel better equipped to bridge an ever-widening partisan gap.The story’s author, Adam Davidson, did not go far enough to explore the ramifications of Conard’s argument, which is essentially that people’s lives are better just because they can buy a Big Mac, and it doesn’t much matter if they can afford to raise a child, get her educated or get her a doctor when she is sick. There is little concern from this guy for the heartbreak of struggling to raise a child when you have to work two jobs to support her and you can’t afford to get her into activities that will keep her out of trouble. I certainly don’t see a problem with developing cheap burgers or a better way to make a soda can,but to say that that is the way to make a better life and a better country shows just how stunted the 1 percent really is. Conard’s argument is a justification for heartlessness.The United States’ rise in productivity is not translating into higher wages for the average worker, as it always has in the past. During the past decade, productivity increases have been especially steep, while the median income has declined slightly. Rising productivity is great, but why isn’t it shared? Conard says it’s because the workforce includes a lot of rifraff who have “below-average productivity” — young people, the “marginally employed,” “near-retirees,” women who will later drop out to raise children. But even if you accept Conard’s claim that these workers are less productive than average, which I’m inclined to doubt, the United States’ workforce has always included these categories of worker. And previously, when productivity went up, median income went up, too.Conard is essentially correct, but blunders in trying to make his case on the basis of benefits to the masses. Don’t apologize. Be proud of your wealth! Why is it anyone’s business how much someone makes? What right does anyone have to hate the rich, which the article’s author implies is the norm? If you don’t dream, fine. But don’t snarl like a vicious predator when someone else does.The contempt some of the ultrawealthy have for people whose goal in life isn’t to be ultrawealthy is jarring sometimes.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','“We’re on storm watch for the summer of 2012,” said Jack Malvey, the chief global market strategist at BNY Mellon.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 4.3 percent for the week and 0.7 percent on Friday to close at 1,295.22. That takes the index back to where it was in mid-January. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.6 percent, or 73.11 points, to 12,369.38.The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury bond ended the week at 1.72, hovering around the lowest level in decades.Around the world, Switzerland, Australia and Mexico joined the list of countries where stocks have erased all of their gains since the beginning of the year.This is the third year in a row that markets have headed south in the spring. In the last two years the markets eventually recovered, but only after months in the red. The S.& P. 500 had risen nearly 12 percent earlier this year, but now stands up just 3 percent.Facebook’s initial public offering was supposed to help lift some of the gloom that settled over the stock markets. In the hours before its debut, technology stocks saw gains.But as the I.P.O. stalled and ended the regular-trading day essentially flat at $38.23, it brought other hot technology stocks down with it. The Nasdaq composite index ended the day down 1.2 percent and fell 5.3 percent this week, to 2,778.79. The frantic trading in Facebook shares did push up the volume of trading on the nation’s exchanges. But one-day spikes are not expected to erase the trend of shrinking trading volumes as investors seek refuge in less risky assets like bonds.Sectors of the economy that rely on global exports, like energy and materials, have been heading down for weeks. But recently sectors that are focused more on the United States economy, like consumer staples and utilities, have also suffered.The biggest sign of the potential problems for the economy came on Thursday when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its monthly business outlook survey for the Middle Atlantic region unexpectedly turned negative in May. That confirmed fears raised by recent government data suggesting that companies had slowed their hiring.“We’ve seen some softer data,” said Michelle Girard, the senior United States economist at RBS. “It has led to some disappointment for those who had hoped we were on to something more.”Financial stocks fell more sharply than any other sector in the S.& P. 500 this week after JPMorgan disclosed late last Friday that it suffered billions dollars in unexpected trading losses on a corporate trading desk. The bank ended the week down 9.4 percent. Finance industry professionals worry that the incident could lead banks to cut back on some types of riskier lending, which could in turn dampen the economy.Looking forward, market strategists and traders have also been increasingly focused on the possibility that United States politicians could, as they did last year, fall into paralyzing debate over tax increases and the federal debt.The economic picture has by no means totally soured. This week brought the latest batch of data suggesting that the housing industry, including residential real estate prices, might have finally begun a slow improvement.More important, any further weakening of the economic picture could provoke the Federal Reserve to embark on another round of asset purchases like the ones that helped bolster the economy when it slowed the last two years. The notes from the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting, released on Wednesday, indicated that a growing number of the central bank’s board members were open to such measures.“It’s hard for portfolio managers to get too negative because in the back of their head they know the Fed could come in at any time and change the game,” said Rick Bensignor, the chief market strategist at Merlin Securities.The picture could change drastically if the European situation entered full crisis mode, and fears of this have escalated further than they did last year. The euro currency reached its lowest level in two years this week and was trading at $1.27 on Friday.Greece is the leading problem, but if Greece leaves the euro currency there is widespread concern that Spain, with a much larger economy, would follow it. The cost of insuring Spanish debt rose to its highest level this week. Investors are watching the international summit meetings in Washington and Chicago this weekend, where European leaders could discuss measures to contain the problems.“We are at a crossroads here,” said Mr. Malvey. “Fateful decisions are going to be made by politicians over the next two to four months.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','“I’m afraid he’s out there and he doesn’t know how to come back,” she said later that day, crying. “He said he needs to go out and walk. He said he’s fat.”Officers found him later that afternoon, in a supermarket about a block from his home. He told them that he had argued with his wife and had spent the night walking around to cool down. His wife said that there had been no argument and that he did not remember where he had gone. “I was so happy to see him,” she said.The professor known to coffee shops slipped away one afternoon in January. It was the third time. The other two times, he had come back right away, so his wife waited a couple of hours before she called the police. She asked that their names be withheld — “There’s a stigma with these situations,” she said.This time, someone found him in a subway, looking out of place, without a coat — and yet, intelligent, distinguished — and took him to the police. Now, his wife makes him carry an electronic tracking device. “Every time we go out he asks me, ‘What’s this for?’ ” she said.If there is a silver lining to the silver alert, it is this: they generally end well. They differ from other missing-persons cases in that the missing are not hiding from anyone, and are not being held. They drift toward parks, or to the subway. They are usually found in less than 24 hours, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, commanding officer of the New York Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit. There have been more than 50 silver alerts since the program began in New York in 2011, but most cases are closed before reaching Lieutenant Zimmerman’s office.Mr. Goffman had not returned to the doctor’s waiting room when his wife, Nancy Larkin, 67, returned to it and feared the worst. He had difficulty following a conversation. “If you spoke to him, it might take you a moment to realize most things that he said didn’t make sense,” she said. She ran to a nearby police precinct, and became irritated when an officer instructed her to go to their former home in Greenwich Village and call 911 from there. Lieutenant Zimmerman said this was standard procedure, as missing people are more likely to be found near their homes.The police arrived — three officers, their sergeant and a detective. “I felt kind of guilty, because I could hear coming over the radio, ‘Robbery on East Sixth Street,’ or things like that, more draconian than this,” Ms. Larkin said. She and a friend searched entrances to Central Park, benches near the Museum of Natural History, and Starbucks.Early Thursday, a little more than 12 hours since Mr. Goffman had walked off, an officer found him sitting in the 72nd Street subway station. Some kind stranger must have swiped him into the subway. We’ll never know; he has no idea. Officers took him to an emergency room, where detectives were waiting when Ms. Larkin arrived. “The female officer was crying,” Ms. Larkin said. The officer said, “Your husband’s such a nice man.”Ms. Larkin found him, and he looked at her and said, “I’ve been looking for you.”'"

"'12-05-18,'0','Animism, the propensity to attribute consciousness to inanimate objects, once was supposed to be a defining trait of so-called primitive people. But modern ones project supernatural properties onto things like cars, communication devices and artworks; we are all in the grip of magical thinking, at least sometimes. “Animism,” an unapologetically didactic show at e-flux, is a good prompt for a discussion of the implications.Organized by Anselm Franke, a curator in Brussels and Berlin, it consists of films and videos by a multigenerational roster that includes Chris Marker, Marcel Broodthaers and Ana Mendieta. A central work is “Assemblages” (2010), a 62-minute documentary by Angela Melitopoulos and Maurizio Lazzarato about the psychologist and philosopher Félix Guattari, who argued that taking animism seriously would solve many social problems.Other works exemplify animation. Walt Disney’s “Skeleton Dance” is a comically macabre short cartoon from 1929. A film by Daria Martin studies two naked dancers interacting with robotic devices in a laboratory. One by Joachim Koester shows a man performing curious movements from a system of exercises that the probably fictional shaman Don Juan taught Carlos Castaneda.“Capitalism: Slavery” (2006), a short piece by the filmmaker Ken Jacobs, is a flickering, grainy, slow-motion pan of what looks like an old diorama of slaves picking cotton. Mr. Jacobs made it by digitally alternating exposures of both sides of an antique stereoscopic photograph. Strangely three-dimensional and eerily still, it casts an unsettling spell.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','At a rate of more than 3 million barrels a day, Iran is still the second-largest producer of crude oil in OPEC after Saudi Arabia. But its production levels have been in gradual decline for years, hampered by sanctions that have starved the industry of spare parts and new investment. Its more immediate problem now is a lack of buyers, after new sanctions on financial institutions and pressures by the Obama administration on reliable customers like India, China and the Southeast Asian nations.“We are not selling as much as before, and the use of outdated equipment is taking its toll,” said Reza Zandi, an oil specialist writing for Shargh, a newspaper that is critical of the government. “Clearly this is not serving Iran’s interest.”Iran’s oil minister, Rostam Ghasemi, on Tuesday denied both reports by OPEC and the International Energy Agency. “The reports are not true at all, and our oil is selling very well,” the semiofficial Fars news agency quoted him as saying.Iran has long stored some oil in tankers on the Persian Gulf to wait out market gluts and secure the highest possible price. But this time is different, industry insiders say.“Now we have less and less buyers,” said one middleman involved in reselling crude, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to endanger his business. “We see even India buying less oil. We have to find new markets.”Iran’s oil revenues traditionally make up the majority of its government budgets. In the last five years, riding a wave of high oil prices, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s government has earned nearly $500 billion in oil income, more than in the past three decades combined. High oil prices have helped Iran weather past sanctions, Mr. Zandi said, “but now the reliance on oil revenue is making us vulnerable.”Iran also faces a boycott of its oil by the European Union, which is scheduled to start on July 1. This will be accompanied by a ban on insurance for Iranian oil shipments, a measure that has already had an impact by deterring insurers from issuing policies that might extend beyond July 1.“We are even seeing less and less Chinese and Indian companies calling our port,” said one an oil cargo inspector, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid potential repercussions. He said his company’s final European customer arrived at the port for oil in the beginning of April. “We are waiting to see what will happen when those new sanctions kick in.”Already, financial sanctions devised by the United States Treasury Department are making it increasingly difficult for customers of Iranian oil to pay for the crude, with reportedly both China and India offering unfavorable barter deals calculated in local currencies.Eventually, if the storage capacity is exhausted, Iran will be forced to shut down some of its production, a potentially disastrous step that it is trying to avoid, analysts say.“Closing off valves sounds easy,” Mr. Zandi said, but the consequences can be extremely damaging. “Technically it wrecks the oil wells, and we will never be able to bring their output back to previous levels.”While Iran is notoriously immune to outside pressures, the oil sanctions represent a new and far more threatening weapon than it has faced before, analysts say.“Our economy is like a car with four flat tires,” said Mohammad Reza Sabzalipour, the president of the Tehran World Trade Center. “We can’t bypass these sanctions forever. We need understanding and détente with the West.”On the other hand, others say, the oil sanctions can be a double-edged sword.“The less oil there is available, the higher the prices will be, it’s that simple,” Mr. Zandi said. “All of us are consciously destroying our future.”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','By the time the crowd had been led through a brief, guided meditation, and a group from Buenos Aires, the So What Project!, took the stage, people did seem ready to explode. They jumped up and down to the beat of what the band called its “rock mantras.”The two men of the So What Project!, Rodo Bustos and Nico Pucci, came up with the idea of the yoga rave five years ago because they wanted to offer their party-happy friends an alternative to the smoke, drugs and alcohol of the club scene. They held house parties at first, then moved to larger sites.“We realized that so many people want a different place, want a different orientation to have fun,” said Mr. Bustos, who is an Art of Living instructor, in a phone interview.At the Pacha event, which is part of a seven-city tour of the United States, Tom Silverman, the founder and chief executive of Tommy Boy Records, marveled that such euphoria was being produced without drugs.“They’re acting the same as they would if they’d taken a bunch of pills,” he said of the crowd.“I could see this being 10,000 to 20,000 people in Madison Square Garden,” he said. “There is no alternative like this where you can go and not drink, and still be in bed by midnight.”Actually, out in the bohemian refuge of Bushwick, Brooklyn, a group of 20-somethings recently offered a similar alternative — though on a smaller, mellower scale — to their friends in the D.I.Y. music scene.In a former welding shop that they fixed up by hand, they have opened what they call the Body Actualized Center.One of the founders, Brian Sweeny, 28, an artist and event producer, described it as “a hipster improvement center,” a place to do yoga, listen to live music, talk about New Age spirituality and generally cultivate a “healthy hedonism.”At the opening party, on a temperate evening in late March, men in ironic T-shirts and women in vintage dresses and ankle boots stood around a fire pit in the backyard, while musicians played inside. The atmosphere was wholesome, but not dogmatically so; the dinner was raw and vegetarian, but some people were drinking beer, and there was a scent of something other than fire smoke in the air.Another founder, a 26-year-old yoga instructor and artist who said her name was Angelina Dreem — “I’m going to roll with that for a while,” she said — suggested that the goal was partly to redefine post-college socializing.“We want to coexist socially with people, and in a city,” she said, but also “to be healthy and to eat well and to not have to drink all night.”“I mean, I was an alcoholic for a while,” she said. “So for me it’s like being social and being active and being creative, but being healthy and having a safe space.”On weekdays, the center offers at least four classes a day. On Sundays at 5 p.m., it hosts a Cosmic Yoga Party, featuring live music and raw food.More conventional yoga studios are also incorporating music and parties into their programs. Jivamukti Yoga School, near Union Square, hosts live shows by Bhakti Band and other groups frequently. Laughing Lotus Yoga Center, in Chelsea, holds a class every Friday from 10 p.m. to midnight that is set to either live music or a D.J. It has also started holding a monthly dance party.Still, it would be hard to capture as much of the spirit of a New Age revival as the Body Actualized Center did at its opening party. The actual yoga portion came late, around 11 p.m., by which time the main room was too crowded for anyone to do more than a very cramped downward dog. The instructor, Amy Jenkins, 24, dressed in flowing white pants and a white tank top, with glitter on her cheeks, instructed the participants, who stood in mountain pose, to run their hands over their bodies.“We never touch ourselves in public; we never breathe,” she said, wiggling as she moved her hands over her torso. Then she instructed everyone to rise up into tree pose and lift their arms above their heads.As people raised their arms in the tight space, she told the group, “If you touch someone ... touch them again!”'"
"'12-05-18,'0','The initiative, first agreed upon by the Group of 8 leaders at their meeting in L’Aquila, Italy, in 2009, was a pledge to put $22 billion into food and agriculture projects. Although much of the money had previously been earmarked for agriculture projects, about $6 billion was new.Almost all of the $22 billion has now been “budgeted and appropriated,” and 58 percent of it has been disbursed, Mr. Shah said. “I am confident that continuing into this year and the next, the U.S. and other countries will absolutely meet their commitments,” he said.He conceded, however, that not all of the money is being spent as promised, which has drawn complaints from many nongovernmental organizations and African countries.“The grand promise of L’Aquila was, if you build a plan for agriculture, the donors will help them find the resources for it,” said Gregory Adams, director of aid effectiveness at Oxfam America, an international relief and development organization.“Now there are 30 plans of varying degrees of quality with shovel-ready projects donors could invest in today, but instead donors have put their money in other things.”Some donor countries have insisted that their money be spent on traditional food handouts rather than the building blocks of an agricultural development program, Mr. Adams said.Several companies that were contacted said the administration had asked them not to speak about their commitments until Friday.Mr. Shah, however, offered a few examples. Tanseed, a Tanzanian seed company, will commit to spend $11 million over time to buy certified seed and sell it in little packets to meet the needs of small farmers.Derek Yach, senior vice president for global health and agriculture policy at PepsiCo, a member of the alliance, said it grew from work the World Economic Forum had been doing on food security with the African Union.“What’s exciting about it is that the companies participating really extend across the value chain,” Mr. Yach said, including seeds, plants, processing and financing.Mr. Shah said that the administration does not plan for the private sector to take over.“The president will commit to encouraging ourselves and our G-8 partners to seek to maintain the high level of commitment to agriculture and food security even as we go forward beyond the formal L’Aquila period” of three years, he said.'"
"'12-05-18,'0','Chinese officials have been indignant at American criticism of their solar power industry, pointing out that the United States has urged China for years to embrace renewable energy as a way to reduce air pollution, combat climate change and limit the need for oil imports from politically volatile countries in the Mideast.Government support for solar energy is an important feature of China’s current Five-Year Plan, which runs through 2015, although Premier Wen Jiabao publicly cautioned in March that he was becoming concerned about overcapacity in the sector.Li Junfeng, an energy policy maker and regulator in the Chinese government who is also the president of the government-controlled Chinese Renewable Energy Industries Association, responded angrily to the American decision.“This is really a surprise,” he said in a telephone interview. “It’s really dangerous.” Mr. Li said that Chinese companies would “certainly” retaliate by filing a trade case at China’s commerce ministry accusing big American chemical companies of dumping polysilicon, the main ingredient in solar panels, on the Chinese market.The American decision was made by civil servants in a quasi-judicial process that is heavily insulated by law from political interference and does not represent a deliberate attempt by the Obama administration to confront China on trade policy. But that distinction has been largely lost in China, where the solar panel issue has been one of many causes embraced online by the country’s vociferous ultranationalists, who put heavy pressure on Chinese officials to respond forcefully to perceived snubs to China.Further complicating matters is a similar case against China and Vietnam over the manufacture of steel towers for wind turbines, charging that steep government subsidies were giving foreign companies an unfair advantage over American manufacturers. A preliminary ruling is due on May 30 in that case.The solar tariffs, which are retroactive to 90 days before the decision is officially published in the next several days, are in addition to antisubsidy tariffs of 2.9 to 4.73 percent that the department imposed in March.SolarWorld Industries America, which led the coalition of manufacturers that filed the solar dumping case, welcomed the department’s ruling. The decision “is a very positive step in the process. It’s also in line with what we expected,” said Ben Santarris, a company spokesman. “We consider this a bellwether case. It underscores the importance of manufacturing to the U.S. economy.”Alan Price, a partner who heads the international trade practice at Wiley Rein, the law firm representing the United States companies in both the solar and wind cases, said that China posed a particular threat to America’s developing green energy sector.“China’s method is straightforward: it sets forth industry-specific Five-Year Plans and then uses all forms of national and local subsidies and other governmental support to quickly transfer jobs, supply chains, intellectual property and wealth, to the permanent detriment of U.S. and global manufacturers,” he said. “China’s ability to ramp up and overwhelm an industry is unique and particularly devastating with new and emerging technologies, where global competitors may be less established and can be knocked out more easily and quickly.”Several large Chinese manufacturers expressed disappointment with the decision and said they would try to convince the Commerce Department that it was unjustified.“Limiting trade in solar products will cause panel prices to increase, defeating America’s goal of driving down costs,” said Shawn Qu, chief executive of Canadian Solar, which makes panels in several Chinese plants and does brisk business in the United States. “Our first priority should be to support the health of the industry as a whole through the financing and installation of solar, which is the key driver to expanding jobs in the U.S. solar market.”According to a report from the Solar Foundation, an advocacy group, the solar industry employed about 100,000 workers last year, up almost 7 percent from the year before. More than half of the jobs were in installation, with about a quarter in manufacturing.Isabelle Christensen, the marketing director of JinkoSolar, another Chinese manufacturer, said that her company had already established a factory in Canada and could probably shift production there if necessary.“We can begin ramping up our manufacturing facility in Canada fairly quickly,” she said, matching what the company produces in China for the American market in a matter of months.But while Chinese solar panel manufacturers may threaten to set up production elsewhere, they may face another obstacle: their bankers. State-owned banks have already lent heavily to the Chinese manufacturers under pressure from the government, producing a capacity glut in China that has prompted factories to slash prices as they fight to maintain market share.A senior Chinese banker, who insisted on anonymity to avoid political repercussions, said that Chinese banks were not eager to lend heavily for another round of solar panel factory investments on the large scale needed to supply the American market.In the United States, solar panel trade cases have divided the industry in much the same way that automotive trade disputes in the 1980s split the American auto industry, when Detroit automakers seeking import restrictions were opposed by American car dealers who were making large profits from selling and servicing cars imported from Japan.Opponents of the tariffs say that the United States benefits from cheap Chinese production. They point out that Chinese companies often turn to American companies to buy the factory equipment and polysilicon they need to make solar panels, and installers hire local American workers to set up and service rooftop systems.Like the antisubsidy tariffs, the antidumping decision on Thursday is preliminary. But if solar panel importers win a final review of both tariff decisions by the Commerce Department later this year, the preliminary tariffs could be reduced or even entirely refunded, although they also might be increased.The Commerce Department calculated the 31 percent tariff by estimating Chinese manufacturers’ costs and then determining how far below cost the solar panels were being sold in the United States. But the department’s methods for calculating costs are controversial for countries that it designates as nonmarket economies, where the government plays such a large role in allocating land, credit and other resources that the true costs of any given product may not be apparent.In Thursday’s decision, the Commerce Department sided with SolarWorld in using solar manufacturing costs in Thailand as a proxy for costs in China. The Chinese industry had wanted to use India as a proxy instead.'"

"'12-05-19,'0','HARTFORD (AP) — Connecticut Republicans have again endorsed the former wrestling executive Linda E. McMahon as their candidate for the United States Senate.Ms. McMahon, a multimillionaire from Greenwich, garnered 730 of the 1,208 delegates who voted at the party’s convention on Friday. But her lead rival for the party’s backing, former Representative Christopher Shays, won 389 votes, more than the 15 percent needed to secure a spot on the Aug. 14 primary ballot. They are competing for the seat being vacated by Senator Joseph I.

"'12-05-19,'0','In the ’50s and ’60s she gave the color orange — her favorite, she said — one of its early moments in the high-style spotlight.“If European-accented country furniture and glass and steel tables have become national decorative clichés,” Marylin Bender wrote in The New York Times in 1974, “it is because Barbara D’Arcy pioneered and pushed them in her lavish model room settings in the ’60s.”Ms. D’Arcy, who became a merchandising executive in 1975, traveled in Europe and Asia as part of a Bloomingdale’s team of design scouts. She was among the first Americans to visit the People’s Republic of China on business after its relations with the United States were normalized in 1972. When she found a piece of furniture or an object she liked — she and others sometimes bribed museum guards to let them carry historic pieces of furniture into a courtyard for better light in sketching, photographing and measuring them — she arranged for it to be reproduced, usually by Italian manufacturers. “She and I visited furniture factories in Italy, where she would have to teach them to make a piece of furniture that looked old instead of new, how to stress it,” Marvin Traub, the former chief executive of Bloomingdale’s, said in an interview on Thursday. “It was a new idea to them, but they caught on.”Mr. Traub, who coined the concept of “retail as theater,” said Ms. D’Arcy was modest about her work early on. “But over time she came to recognize her influence,” he added. “She had enormous impact on the entire American home furnishings industry.”Barbara D’Arcy was born on April 3, 1928, in Manhattan, the youngest of three children of Ida Marie and James J. D’Arcy. Her mother was an art teacher, her father a manager for a Manhattan moving and storage company whose clients included many of the city’s wealthiest families.“He moved people back and forth among their various homes,” said Mr. White, Ms. D’Arcy’s husband. “In the process he became quite a discerning judge of furniture. Barbara learned a lot from him.”She joined Bloomingdale’s as a junior decorator in the fabric department in 1952, shortly after graduating from the College of New Rochelle, a Roman Catholic college for women, where she studied art and made sets for a student puppet theater. (She remained with the company until her retirement in 1995.)In 1958 she was named coordinating designer of the store’s model rooms, which The Times characterized at the time as “dream rooms that the consumer knows she cannot afford to duplicate in toto but that contain practical ideas she can modify with an eye on the budget.”The model rooms acquired a must-see cachet among New York designers and decorators and a loyal following of shoppers drawn to their dreamlike decorative perfection, some of it whimsical. Two of her best-known and most imaginative designs were the all-cardboard room she created with help from the architect Frank Gehry, and the Cave Room, a Flintstonesque room made from a frame of chicken wire and wood, sprayed with urethane foam and painted white. The furniture was built into the foam.In the late ’70s Ms. D’Arcy directed the redesign of Bloomingdale’s entire first floor, a three-year project that Paul Goldberger, the architecture critic for The Times, described as “perhaps the most daring piece of large-scale store design in a decade.”The palatial expanse of black marble and brass-lacquered surfaces, which she conceived and saw to completion in 1979, and which remain in place, have become a landmark in the retail world, said Mark Bradin, who teaches interior decorating at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. “That design has become Bloomingdale’s signature,” he said. “If she had done nothing else, she would be remembered just for that.”'"

"'12-05-19,'0','“I’m afraid he’s out there and he doesn’t know how to come back,” she said later that day, crying. “He said he needs to go out and walk. He said he’s fat.”Officers found him later that afternoon, in a supermarket about a block from his home. He told them that he had argued with his wife and had spent the night walking around to cool down. His wife said that there had been no argument and that he did not remember where he had gone. “I was so happy to see him,” she said.The professor known to coffee shops slipped away one afternoon in January. It was the third time. The other two times, he had come back right away, so his wife waited a couple of hours before she called the police. She asked that their names be withheld — “There’s a stigma with these situations,” she said.This time, someone found him in a subway, looking out of place, without a coat — and yet, intelligent, distinguished — and took him to the police. Now, his wife makes him carry an electronic tracking device. “Every time we go out he asks me, ‘What’s this for?’ ” she said.If there is a silver lining to the silver alert, it is this: they generally end well. They differ from other missing-persons cases in that the missing are not hiding from anyone, and are not being held. They drift toward parks, or to the subway. They are usually found in less than 24 hours, said Lt. Christopher Zimmerman, commanding officer of the New York Police Department’s Missing Persons Unit. There have been more than 50 silver alerts since the program began in New York in 2011, but most cases are closed before reaching Lieutenant Zimmerman’s office.Mr. Goffman had not returned to the doctor’s waiting room when his wife, Nancy Larkin, 67, returned to it and feared the worst. He had difficulty following a conversation. “If you spoke to him, it might take you a moment to realize most things that he said didn’t make sense,” she said. She ran to a nearby police precinct, and became irritated when an officer instructed her to go to their former home in Greenwich Village and call 911 from there. Lieutenant Zimmerman said this was standard procedure, as missing people are more likely to be found near their homes.The police arrived — three officers, their sergeant and a detective. “I felt kind of guilty, because I could hear coming over the radio, ‘Robbery on East Sixth Street,’ or things like that, more draconian than this,” Ms. Larkin said. She and a friend searched entrances to Central Park, benches near the Museum of Natural History, and Starbucks.Early Thursday, a little more than 12 hours since Mr. Goffman had walked off, an officer found him sitting in the 72nd Street subway station. Some kind stranger must have swiped him into the subway. We’ll never know; he has no idea. Officers took him to an emergency room, where detectives were waiting when Ms. Larkin arrived. “The female officer was crying,” Ms. Larkin said. The officer said, “Your husband’s such a nice man.”Ms. Larkin found him, and he looked at her and said, “I’ve been looking for you.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','The other two judges were harder to read. Chief Judge William Byrd Traxler Jr. said relatively little throughout the hearing, and the third jurist, Albert Diaz, asked skeptical questions of both sides.The former C.I.A. officer, Jeffrey Sterling, is accused of leaking government secrets to Mr. Risen for his 2006 book, “State of War.” It recounted an effort by the C.I.A. a dozen years ago to sabotage Iranian nuclear research — an operation that the book portrays as having been dangerously botched. Mr. Risen is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter for The New York Times.The Justice Department has tried to force Mr. Risen to testify, first during a grand jury proceeding and then again after Mr. Sterling was charged with leaking government secrets. But Mr. Risen has refused to identify his confidential sources, citing the First Amendment.Last year, the trial judge overseeing the case, Leonie M. Brinkema of the United States District Court in Alexandria, Va., ruled that Mr. Risen was protected by a qualified “reporter’s privilege” that allowed her to balance whether it was necessary to force him to disclose his sources. Judge Brinkema contended that Mr. Risen’s testimony was not crucial because prosecutors could use other evidence against Mr. Sterling.But the government has appealed that ruling, arguing that no reporter’s privilege exists in criminal trials. Mr. Parker on Friday invoked a 1972 Supreme Court case holding that there is no reporter’s privilege against being forced to testify before a grand jury. He said the case was “clear” that the same rule should apply in a trial.But Judge Diaz pronounced the precedent “clear as mud.” Among other problems, the fifth vote in the majority for that case came from a justice who wrote his own concurring opinion that appeared to give a broader reading of press freedoms than the other four.A lawyer for Mr. Risen, Joel Kurtzberg, told the panel that no federal appeals court has adopted an understanding of First Amendment press protections as limited as the prosecutors’ view, urging them “not to accept the government’s invitation to be the first.”A diverse coalition of more than two dozen media organizations, including The Times and Fox News, has filed a friend-of-the-court brief arguing that a qualified reporter’s privilege — allowing judges to protect reporters from testifying under some circumstances — is crucial for the “dissemination of news and information to the public.”There is a possibility that the appeals court will invoke a technicality to sidestep the need to directly address the novel First Amendment questions raised by the case — at least for now. Mr. Kurtzberg argued that the appeals court lacks jurisdiction to review Judge Brinkema’s order at this stage because the judge has said she will revisit the question of Mr. Risen’s testimony midway through the trial.Both Judge Diaz and Judge Traxler asked questions about the jurisdictional matter. But Mr. Parker voiced doubt that Judge Brinkema will change her mind and argued that the appeals court should rule on the issue now. Prosecutors need to know whether they can invoke Mr. Risen’s testimony in opening statements, he said, and it would be too late for prosecutors to appeal again once a jury is seated.A lawyer for Mr. Sterling told the court that his client took no position in the dispute between Mr. Risen and prosecutors.The names of the three appeals court judges assigned to the case were not disclosed until Friday, as is the Fourth Circuit’s practice. All three were selected by Democrats: President Obama appointed Judge Diaz and President Bill Clinton appointed Judges Traxler and Gregory, although Judge Gregory received a recess appointment and was reappointed by President George W. Bush.Mr. Sterling is one of six current and former government employees to be charged with leaking government secrets under the Obama administration — more such cases than were brought under all previous presidents combined.Only the first half of the hearing was open to the public. Prosecutors are also appealing two other decisions by Judge Brinkema, including one barring them from using two witnesses because prosecutors missed a deadline for giving the defense team information that could be used to call their testimony into question. The discussion of the other portions of the case were closed to the public because they were expected to involve classified information.Prosecutors have said that Judge Brinkema’s rulings, if they stand, “effectively terminated the prosecution” of Mr. Sterling.'"
"'12-05-19,'0','“It’s primarily due to the low natural gas prices, and how that affects the political environment,” said Bart Ford, a vice president of Tenaska, the developer. “We’re not changing the nature of the facility, just deferring the synthetic natural gas portion.”Still, Tenaska is continuing to seek permits to inject carbon dioxide underground at the site, Mr. Ford said. “This allows us to say, we’ll wait until the price impact is lower because the price of natural gas is up,” he said.Making synthetic natural gas from coal makes economic sense only if the ordinary natural gas that it displaces is more expensive.The advent of hydraulic fracturing, a drilling method that has opened vast new supplies of natural gas, has helped to keep gas prices low. The industry’s expectation is that the price will rise somewhat from its current depressed level — near $2 per million B.T.U., compared with as much as $14 before the recession — but that it will not recover fully for many years.Edwardsport, a “capture-ready” Duke Energy coal plant, is scheduled to begin commercial operation this year. The plant, in Edwardsport, Ind., will cook coal into a fuel gas and could be retrofitted to capture carbon dioxide released in that conversion. But Duke, the builder, has no plan to capture the carbon dioxide and no place to sequester it for now. It is exempted from the new rule because construction began five years ago.The plant cost nearly $3 billion to build, about $1 billion over budget, and carbon capture would cost $380 million, not counting storage.Only two other major carbon capture projects are on the drawing boards in the United States. Neither is affected directly by low natural gas prices. But the ebbing interest in coal-fired construction may signal that even if the technology works well, there may be few commercial projects where it could be deployed.One is FutureGen 2.0, a $1.6 billion plan to burn coal in oxygen, generating exhaust gas that is pure carbon dioxide, and pumping it into geologic formations thousands of feet below the earth’s surface.The Recovery Act of 2009 is covering $1 billion of the cost of the project, which is in Meredosia, Ill. But the project, originally expected to be running by 2015, has run into a variety of bureaucratic problems and is now scheduled to be in service in 2017, barring further delays. An earlier version, FutureGen, was rejected by the Energy Department in 2008 to save money.The other venture is the Southern Company’s Kemper County project in Mississippi, which will turn coal into a cleaner gas and use it to power a turbine. The captured carbon dioxide is expected to be sold and travel through a pipeline to Texas, where it will be pumped under ground to force oil out of old oil fields, a process known as enhanced oil recovery.At the moment the market prospects look favorable, given that the price oil drillers will pay for the carbon dioxide depends partly on the price of oil, which is relatively high. But construction is just beginning, so the long-term picture is unclear. The plant is expected to start operating in 2014.Some in the power industry are debating whether the Obama administration’s carbon regulation will be blocked by Congress or a new administration. Still, the absence of a rule would not change the economic equation discouraging investment in capture technology for coal plants.Kelly Ziegler, a spokeswoman for the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a nine-state consortium on the East Coast that seeks to limit carbon dioxide output, said that no regulation was necessary to stop new coal plants. “Natural gas has already done that for you,” she said.Hearings on the rule are to begin on May 24, and the E.P.A. is taking public comments until June 25. The agency may issue a final rule this year.'"
"'12-05-19,'0','Whatever approach you take is going to cost you something, even if you avoid the stock market altogether. So how you deal with investment risk will ultimately depend on what you’re willing to give up. Here are some different approaches:ELIMINATE MOST RISK Trying to squeeze out risk is still going to require some sacrifices. The idea is that you save enough money to meet your goal — say, covering your basic expenses in retirement — without investing in risky assets. The big caveat is that you’ll need to save aggressively, perhaps much more so than if you turned to the stock market for some assistance (assuming it provides a decent return during your time frame).But some academics like Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University, say they believe it can be done by taking a “safety first” approach, where you start by figuring out what your bare essentials will cost in retirement. Then, you save aggressively to cover those expenses, and put the money into virtually risk-free investments, like Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) or I-Bonds. (I-Bonds never decline in value, are issued by Treasury and pay a fixed interest rate, currently 0 percent, as well as a variable rate that keeps pace with inflation.)The idea is to create a safety net once you stop working. So if you bought $10,000 of I-Bonds each year over a 40-year career — the maximum you can buy each year, though Professor Bodie expects the amount will be adjusted for inflation — you would leave the work force with $400,000. Today, a 65-year-old man could take that money and buy an annuity that would provide roughly $15,000 in inflation-adjusted income annually (with spousal survivor benefits). This could be used with Social Security income — for a retiree at full retirement age today, a maximum of about $30,000 annually — to cover the basics.“That’s not too bad,” added Professor Bodie, co-author of “Risk Less and Prosper” (Wiley 2011).He also suggested creating something that approximated a personal pension through a so-called TIPS ladder. Here, you would figure out your basic spending needs each year, and buy TIPS with varying terms so that the bonds mature over time, as you need the money. (Given the tax treatment of TIPS, he recommended doing this in a tax-deferred or tax-sheltered account. It also takes significant planning since TIPS are sold in five-year maturities.)Mr. Bodie said he did not have a problem investing money in riskier assets for discretionary spending. He also said that younger people could handle somewhat more risk since they had the luxury of time to make adjustments.Still, this approach isn’t foolproof either. You may be sacrificing more than you need to if the markets do well. You can also lose the ability to save aggressively if you are laid off, for example, or have an expensive medical issue. And then there are all of life’s other costs — college tuition, saving for a down payment on a home, health insurance.“The trouble is, of course, that almost no one can accumulate that much money — in rough terms, about 25 years of living expenses after Social Security and pensions — just by investing in safe assets,” said William J. Bernstein, author of “The Investor’s Manifesto” (Wiley 2009) and other investing books. “You have to take some risk to get there, and because you’re taking that risk, you may not get there. But taking that risk is still your best shot.”There are several different ways to figure out how much that kind of low-risk approach may cost you. But let’s say you decided that saving $1 million was enough (that is, $1 million in inflation-adjusted dollars, meaning it keeps pace with inflation over time). You may be able to get there after 30 years by saving $750 a month, or $9,000 annually, and investing that money in a portfolio evenly split between stock and bonds, which earned 4.7 percent after inflation. But to avoid the stock market altogether, you would have to increase your monthly savings to $1,250 a month, or $15,000 a year, and receive a 2.5 percent return after inflation in a diversified bond-only portfolio, according to calculations by Kent Smetters, a risk management professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and founder of Veritat Advisors, which takes an approach similar to the one advocated by Professor Bodie.REDUCE RISK, LIVE WITH SOME Investing in a diversified portfolio — split among different types of stocks and bonds, while gradually reducing your exposure to risky stocks — is the classic way to reduce your risk. But it doesn’t eliminate risk. “In a crunch, or even in a normal sharply down market, like we’ve had the past few weeks, there are only risky and riskless assets,” Mr. Bernstein said. “So in the short term, diversification among different stock asset classes is usually of no help. They all get taken out and get shot. But over a decade or longer, diversification among stock asset classes is nearly magic.”And when you add a healthy helping of bonds, you further reduce that risk. The trick is finding a level of risk you’re comfortable with so that you don’t bail out at the worst possible time. This approach also requires you to consider what a worst case might feel like, and what sort of changes you need to make to adjust.You can also reduce your risk through hedging techniques. One relatively straightforward strategy is buying “put” option contracts, which give you the right to sell a fixed number of shares (say, of an exchange-traded fund that tracks a stock index) at a certain price within a certain period of time. This essentially puts a floor on your losses. If the shares don’t drop, you lose only the cost of the option.So while this allows you to hedge your risk, it can weigh on your total return because you are paying for the insurance the puts provide. The downside, of course, are the costs and the hassles of such a strategy. “You can approximate any hedging strategy you might want far more cheaply simply by selling some risky assets,” Mr. Bernstein said. “There is no risk fairy who will write you a cheap option that will take stock risk off your hands.”TRANSFER OR SHARE RISK This approach to risk management typically involves buying insurance. If you’re about to retire, you could buy a single-premium immediate annuity, where you pay an insurance company a pile of cash and, in return, the company pays you a stream of income for the rest of your life. The downside is that you just surrendered a pile of cash, which means you will not be able to use that money in an emergency. And if you die prematurely, your heirs won’t receive it either. There’s the risk, too, that the insurance company could run into financial trouble.Annuities can also feel expensive. They may pay out approximately 4 or 5 percent of your investment, according to Professor Bodie, depending on the options you choose. An investment of $500,000 will buy slightly less than $2,400 in monthly income for a 65-year old man and his 62-year-old wife, according to a rough estimate from ImmediateAnnuities.com. But inflation-adjusted payments will cost more.“Any insurance is going to cost you,” said Professor Bodie, who says he believes annuities may make sense for some retirees. “There is no free lunch.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','He went on to add that: “At some moment, such actions, which undermine sovereignty, can end with a full-fledged regional war, or even, and I don’t want to scare anybody, the use of nuclear weapons.”The Russian Micex index, a gauge of large blue chips traded on the domestic market, fell sharply. By the market closing, the index had lost 3.5 percent and ended the day at its lowest level in seven months. Some large Russian companies tumbled even further. Sberbank, the country’s largest lender, dropped 7 percent.Those losses were partly recouped in a midday surge on Friday — before stocks dipped yet again.The index typically closely tracks the price of oil, a major export commodity. And global oil prices were also down, providing another explanation for the drop. Other international markets were also down.When Mr. Medvedev spoke “traders were looking for any excuse to sell,” Vladimir Osakovsky, the chief economist for the former Soviet states at Merrill Lynch Bank of America in Moscow, said in a telephone interview.The prospect of nuclear Armageddon, per se, did not frighten investors. At issue was the comment’s significance for a looming macroeconomic transition in Russia known as the “twin deficits.”Though Russia’s economy appears in rude health today from high oil prices, rising consumer spending and government outlays will push both the budget and balance of payments into deficit within two years, economists say.After that, the Kremlin will rely on lending from abroad, a dynamic last seen in the late Soviet period and in the 1990s.Attracting foreign investment hinges on the Kremlin assuaging worries about the eruption of a new East-West conflict and instituting reforms at home.Yet Vladimir V. Putin, now president, may well choose a hawkish foreign policy stance to deflect attention from the middle-class protest movement simmering in the capital, analysts of Russian politics say. In one signal, Mr. Putin canceled a visit to Washington, where he was to attend a Group of 8 industrialized nations meeting this weekend.Mr. Medvedev, who will attend in Mr. Putin’s place, favors reform, and during his term as president welcomed the détente between Russia and the United States under the administration of President Obama.The nuclear talk brought back memories of a more tense relationship.“This kind of stuff is really not market-friendly,” Mr. Osakovsky said.'"

He decided to invest some of it in two Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises and begin a second career as a director on corporate boards.“I wanted a brand that was a powerful brand, not a start-up, because long term I was looking for something in which I didn’t have to be at the counter every day or over the fryer,” Mr. Barr said. “It’s a true investment because I’ve never taken a dime out and those two have now acquired 23 franchises.”To keep his investments in Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants and, later, Taco Bell restaurants separate from his day job, he instituted a firm rule: Every restaurant had to be at least 45 minutes but no more than three hours from his home in Marietta, Ga.“I’m not 100 percent passive,” he said, noting that he had an operating partner. “Anyone who thinks that buying a franchise is like buying G.E. stock is crazy. But it’s not 40 hours a week.”The biggest drain for passive investors in franchises may be managing the people who are making their investment profitable day to day.“A lot of people do not pay attention to the people part of the business,” said Aslam Khan, who started as a dishwasher at a Church’s Chicken in 1987 and now owns 165 of the restaurants and employs 6,000 people. “Chicken doesn’t move by itself.”He said he attributed his success to making sure that the people who worked for him were well taken care of.Stephen J. Caldiera, chief executive of the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said having someone to pay attention to the day-to-day operation was crucial. “The people who just want to invest are smart to hire proven operators,” he said. “You’re only as good as the people running the business.”One of the misleading numbers for people interested in investing in a franchise is the relatively low franchise fee. Mr. Caldiera said fees started as low as $5,000. Burger King’s franchise fee is $50,000 — but it requires people to have a net worth of $1.5 million and liquid assets of $500,000.These financial requirements are the biggest barrier for investors. McDonald’s has a similar $500,000 liquid asset requirement, but the company estimates that equipment and preopening costs range from $959,450 to $2,110,700. The franchise fee is a mere $45,000.“Over the past several years, the biggest growth in our system has been from second-generation owners,” Danya Proud, a spokeswoman, said. “There has been a smaller percentage from outside the system.”That said, a franchisee’s child would not be granted a franchise on that basis alone. “They’re taking over a $2.6 million business,” she said. “We’re not going to take some 23-year-old who has maxed out her credit cards.”Even for newer franchises, the setup costs are steep. Seattle’s Best Coffee, which is owned by Starbucks, said the cost to set up a new franchise ranged from $181,835 to $445,035, excluding real estate costs. It doesn’t take a math whiz to figure out that you are going to have to sell a lot of coffee to recoup that initial investment.Mr. Khan said he had become an investor in franchises his managers wanted to start, as much to make a return on his money as to help minority business owners like himself get started. “They got me here, and I can get them here,” he said. He said he would invest up to 49 percent of the cost of the franchise.For investors who want to turn one franchise into many, the type of franchise they start with matters. Mr. Barr said he chose Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants because he knew it would be easier to get financing for a top-tier franchise, given the track record and customer base.Mr. Barr also advised people who wanted a hands-off role to buy existing franchises instead of building one from scratch. “If you buy a KFC today that’s operating, the next day you’re making money,” he said. “You’re not training staff and opening with no revenue.”But again, franchises fail, like anything else. Mr. Cohen has had to close Great American Cookie stores, even though he is the longest-serving franchisee in the system. He has also lost his entire investment in a franchise that sold Philly cheesesteaks.And perhaps worse for the passive investor, an investment in a franchise can require more attention than an investor planned on giving it. That happened to Carlyle MacHarg, who made his money in real estate.Mr. MacHarg, 68, said he had purposely steered clear of investing in any type of restaurant, after seeing too many friends regret doing it. But when he was approached by the son of a family friend who was part of a group trying to turn around Pat & Oscar’s, a small family restaurant chain based in San Diego, he changed his mind.Mr. MacHarg said the price he paid in June 2010 produced an annual return of 40 percent. He then hired the friend’s son to manage the restaurants, and was happy for a year or so. But last September, the company that owned the brand went bankrupt, and Mr. MacHarg found himself leading a group of five other franchisees to get control of the Pat & Oscar’s name.They were outbid. Worse, the new owner tried to raise the franchise fees. Mr. MacHarg said the group balked and began looking to rebrand their restaurants under the name O’s American Kitchen.“I’ve been spending most days, 10 to 12 hours a day, on this,” he said. “Everything else I have to deal with is on the back burner. This thing has been all-consuming. “Despite all of this, he said the restaurants accounted for only 10 percent of his investments. But having gone from passive investor to active manager, he has caught the bug that drives the most passionate franchisees. “This could really take off,” he said. “And if the brand takes off, it really goes.”Then he caught himself. “Or it could be fine for our nine restaurants.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','Miller grew up in a thoroughly Jewish milieu, recalling in his autobiography, “Timebends,” how he sat on his great-grandfather’s lap in synagogue and later had a bar mitzvah ceremony. His adult belief system, though, took the form of left-wing politics, and critiques of capitalism and the McCarthy era’s Red Scare ultimately informed many of his finest plays — “All My Sons,” “A View From the Bridge,” “The Crucible.”“Salesman” had indisputably Jewish origins. Miller based Willy Loman on his uncle Manny Newman, a salesman brought low by the Depression. He tried out earlier versions of the character in stories he wrote in his teens and 20s about salesmen with apparently Jewish surnames — Schoenzeit and Schleifer.So the intriguing question remains why Willy, as finally written, offers so little evidence of heritage. Miller, in a 1969 interview, insisted that the character’s “religious or cultural background ... seems to me irrelevant.” The contemporary playwright Tony Kushner, who is editing Miller’s collected plays for the Library of America, suggested that for Jewish writers in the mid-20th century, “there wasn’t a sense of shame about being Jewish, but of reaching for something universal, and there was some sense that the immigrant experience and the ethnic specificity would limit it.”Miller did write overtly Jewish characters, starting in his 1945 novel about anti-Semitism, “Focus,” and continuing through two plays about the Holocaust, “Incident at Vichy” (1964) and “Broken Glass” (1994). So the decision to leave Willy’s identity indistinct represented a thought-through choice, not a chronic ambivalence about Jewish content.Mr. Novick, for his part, called “Salesman” the sequel to “Fiddler on the Roof” — the tragic culmination of the immigrant’s American dream. Harold Bloom, a scholar of both biblical and modern literature, posited that the play’s heartbreaking, embittered reunion of Willy and his alienated son Biff is an inversion of the Bible’s reuniting of Jacob and Joseph, which he called “the paradigm of Jewish family love.”The playwright David Mamet, himself the grandson of a traveling salesman, said that the play’s tension “between hope, confusion, aspiration and circumstance” was itself “the voice of the second-generation American-Jewish writers.” Some critics have singled out Linda Loman’s famous speech about Willy — “Attention, attention must finally be paid to such a person” — as having a distinctively Yiddish cadence.Over time, Miller came around to acknowledging some Jewish specificity to the Lomans. In an essay published for the play’s 50th anniversary, in 1999, he described them as “Jews light-years away from religion or a community that might have fostered Jewish identity.” Thus sundered, they are left “on the sidewalk side of the glass looking in at the clean well-lighted place.” In the very absence of their Jewish identity, one might say, is its very presence.The current production — widely lauded and nominated for seven Tony Awards — has been most notable for its fidelity to Miller’s original intent. It uses the set design and musical score from the original production, and it indelibly portrays Willy’s drift between present and past, between reality and memory and fantasy. Miller’s original title for the play, after all, was “The Inside of His Head.”The producer Scott Rudin was interested enough, though, in the matter of the Loman family’s roots to assemble a research folder of critical and biographical essays grappling with the Jew-Everyman debate. “It’s so much a play about someone who wants to belong to the largest thing he can belong to — a fantasy of America,” Mr. Rudin said in a recent interview. “And he’s become deracinated from his background in the process.”Mike Nichols, the director of the current revival, came to the United States as a Jewish refugee child from Nazi Germany. What he has seen in Willy is not the intensity of the immigrant generation of Jews, with its fervor for education, but the worship of materialism by the second generation, those disparaged in Yiddish as being “alrightniks.”“Willy has no forebears,” Mr. Nichols said in an interview this month. “He’s not from any country. He has no holidays of any religion. So you have to assume Miller’s making a point. We who are struggling to sell enough have to drop everything — religion, nationality, family. There is nothing except, as Willy puts it, being known and being well-liked.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','Korean groups have been further motivated by a letter-writing campaign in Japan in opposition to a proposal by Peter Koo, a New York councilman and Chinese immigrant, to rename a street in Flushing, , in honor of comfort women.Mr. Park said that in the past week or so, his organization had received calls from at least five Korean community organizers around the country — in , , and — expressing interest in building their own memorials. These would be in addition to at least four memorials in the works in and Georgia, he added.The monument in Palisades Park is the only one in the dedicated to comfort women, borough officials said.“Starting from Flushing, N.Y., we will continue the construction in the areas of major Korean-American communities,” said Paul Park, executive director of the Korean-American Association of Greater New York, one of the oldest Korean community organizations in the region. “We Korean-Americans observe the issue on the level of a global violation of human rights.”Tensions between Japan and South Korea over the legacy of comfort women were reignited in December when a bronze statue in honor of victims was installed across the street from the Japanese Embassy in , the South Korean capital. Japanese officials have asked the Korean authorities to remove that statue.Japanese leaders have said that their formal apologies, expressions of remorse and admissions of responsibility regarding the treatment of comfort women are sufficient, including an offer to set up a $1 billion fund for victims. But many Koreans contend that those actions are inadequate. Surviving victims have rejected the fund because it would be financed by private money. The victims are seeking government reparations.Mayor James Rotundo of Palisades Park said the lobbying began obliquely late last month. Officials at the Japanese consulate in New York sent e-mails requesting a meeting with borough administrators.“I called the secretary and said, ‘What is this about?’ ” the mayor recalled in an interview, “and she said, ‘It’s about Japanese-U.S. relations,’ and I said: ‘Oh. Well, O.K.’ ”The first meeting, on May 1, began pleasantly enough, he said. The delegation was led by the consul general, Shigeyuki Hiroki, who talked about his career, including his work in — “niceties,” Mr. Rotundo said.Then the conversation took a sudden turn, Mr. Rotundo said. The consul general pulled out two documents and read them aloud.One was a copy of a 1993 statement from Yohei Kono, then the chief cabinet secretary, in which the Japanese government acknowledged the involvement of military authorities in the coercion and suffering of comfort women.The other was a 2001 letter to surviving comfort women from , then the prime minister, apologizing for their treatment.Mr. Hiroki then said the Japanese authorities “wanted our memorial removed,” Mr. Rotundo recalled.The consul general also said the Japanese government was willing to plant cherry trees in the borough, donate books to the public library “and do some things to show that we’re united in this world and not divided,” Mr. Rotundo said. But the offer was contingent on the memorial’s removal. “I couldn’t believe my ears,” said Jason Kim, deputy mayor of Palisades Park and a Korean-American, who was at the meeting. “My blood shot up like crazy.”Borough officials rejected the request, and the delegation left.The second delegation arrived on May 6 and was led by four members of the Japanese Parliament. Their approach was less diplomatic, Mr. Rotundo said. The politicians, members of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party, tried, in asking that the monument be removed, to convince the Palisades Park authorities that comfort women had never been forcibly conscripted as sex slaves.“They said the comfort women were a lie, that they were set up by an outside agency, that they were women who were paid to come and take care of the troops,” the mayor related. “I said, ‘We’re not going to take it down, but thanks for coming.’ ”The Japanese consulate in New York has been reluctant to discuss its lobbying.In interviews this week, Fumio Iwai, the deputy consul general, would not say whether the consul general had requested that the monument be removed. But he denied that the consul general had offered to help the borough in return for the monument’s removal. Mr. Hiroki “did not offer any such condition,” he said.Mr. Iwai said the issue of comfort women, if not Palisades Park specifically, was the subject of continuing discussions “at a very high level” between the governments of South Korea and Japan.he said, pausing as if to choose his words carefully, “things are quite complicated.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','“We’re on storm watch for the summer of 2012,” said Jack Malvey, the chief global market strategist at BNY Mellon.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 4.3 percent for the week and 0.7 percent on Friday to close at 1,295.22. That takes the index back to where it was in mid-January. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.6 percent, or 73.11 points, to 12,369.38.The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury bond ended the week at 1.72, hovering around the lowest level in decades.Around the world, Switzerland, Australia and Mexico joined the list of countries where stocks have erased all of their gains since the beginning of the year.This is the third year in a row that markets have headed south in the spring. In the last two years the markets eventually recovered, but only after months in the red. The S.& P. 500 had risen nearly 12 percent earlier this year, but now stands up just 3 percent.Facebook’s initial public offering was supposed to help lift some of the gloom that settled over the stock markets. In the hours before its debut, technology stocks saw gains.But as the I.P.O. stalled and ended the regular-trading day essentially flat at $38.23, it brought other hot technology stocks down with it. The Nasdaq composite index ended the day down 1.2 percent and fell 5.3 percent this week, to 2,778.79. The frantic trading in Facebook shares did push up the volume of trading on the nation’s exchanges. But one-day spikes are not expected to erase the trend of shrinking trading volumes as investors seek refuge in less risky assets like bonds.Sectors of the economy that rely on global exports, like energy and materials, have been heading down for weeks. But recently sectors that are focused more on the United States economy, like consumer staples and utilities, have also suffered.The biggest sign of the potential problems for the economy came on Thursday when the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia reported that its monthly business outlook survey for the Middle Atlantic region unexpectedly turned negative in May. That confirmed fears raised by recent government data suggesting that companies had slowed their hiring.“We’ve seen some softer data,” said Michelle Girard, the senior United States economist at RBS. “It has led to some disappointment for those who had hoped we were on to something more.”Financial stocks fell more sharply than any other sector in the S.& P. 500 this week after JPMorgan disclosed late last Friday that it suffered billions dollars in unexpected trading losses on a corporate trading desk. The bank ended the week down 9.4 percent. Finance industry professionals worry that the incident could lead banks to cut back on some types of riskier lending, which could in turn dampen the economy.Looking forward, market strategists and traders have also been increasingly focused on the possibility that United States politicians could, as they did last year, fall into paralyzing debate over tax increases and the federal debt.The economic picture has by no means totally soured. This week brought the latest batch of data suggesting that the housing industry, including residential real estate prices, might have finally begun a slow improvement.More important, any further weakening of the economic picture could provoke the Federal Reserve to embark on another round of asset purchases like the ones that helped bolster the economy when it slowed the last two years. The notes from the Federal Reserve’s most recent meeting, released on Wednesday, indicated that a growing number of the central bank’s board members were open to such measures.“It’s hard for portfolio managers to get too negative because in the back of their head they know the Fed could come in at any time and change the game,” said Rick Bensignor, the chief market strategist at Merlin Securities.The picture could change drastically if the European situation entered full crisis mode, and fears of this have escalated further than they did last year. The euro currency reached its lowest level in two years this week and was trading at $1.27 on Friday.Greece is the leading problem, but if Greece leaves the euro currency there is widespread concern that Spain, with a much larger economy, would follow it. The cost of insuring Spanish debt rose to its highest level this week. Investors are watching the international summit meetings in Washington and Chicago this weekend, where European leaders could discuss measures to contain the problems.“We are at a crossroads here,” said Mr. Malvey. “Fateful decisions are going to be made by politicians over the next two to four months.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','“In Moscow, it was very difficult, very painful for the players, the club, for the fans,” Drogba said of the 2008 defeat. “Today, we managed to change it, and again it was an amazing game, a crazy game.”The defeat was especially bitter for Bayern. It not only had to watch as Chelsea celebrated on its home field, but it also controlled play throughout, taking 35 shots to Chelsea’s 9.For more than 80 minutes the championship game followed a predictable script. Bayern had the ball. Bayern got close to the Chelsea goal. A swarm of blue-clad defenders smothered the attack.After 82 scoreless minutes, the game seemed destined for penalty kicks, and it was. But the path to get there was unexpectedly thrilling.In the 83rd minute, Bayern finally made the most of one of its chances when Thomas Müller bounced a header off the grass and over Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech.“Thomas!” screamed the announcer. “Müller!” the crowd answered — once, twice and a third time.There were seven minutes to go and the dream of a European title at its home stadium seemed closer and closer as time wound down. Bayern dominated Chelsea on corner kicks throughout, taking 20 to Chelsea’s 1. But Drogba made sure the only corner was one that counted.With two minutes to go in regulation, Drogba silenced the celebrating crowd, driving home a header on Juan Mata’s corner kick. Bayern goalie Manuel Neuer could only deflect the ball into the net.Bayern had another chance to win five minutes into extra time when Drogba fouled Bayern’s French star, Franck Ribéry, in the penalty area, a mistake that could have cost Chelsea the game and negated his earlier heroics. But Arjen Robben took the penalty and kicked the ball low, and Cech stopped it at the line.The most dominant team in the history of German professional soccer, with a reputation here similar to that of the Yankees, Bayern ended the season without a title, failing to win the Bundesliga title, the German Cup and now the Champions League.This was without question the bitterest taste of all.Each club had an allotment of 17,500 tickets, but Bayern fans clad in red and white outnumbered the Chelsea blues. In many ways, the pressure was all on Bayern. Its fans and management expected a victory on home turf. Chelsea could blame injuries and its four suspended players, including John Terry, the captain, to Bayern’s three if it came up short again.Time and again, Bayern had chances in regulation and in extra time. As late as the 107th minute, Ivica Olic, the Croat substituted for Ribéry, took a soft cross from Philipp Lahm and sent the ball rolling just past the far post.The shootout came in front of the screaming Bayern fans, a sea of red and white. Lahm, the Bayern captain, converted the first penalty. Then Neuer blocked Chelsea’s first try by Mata. Once again, it seemed as if Bayern would win, exactly as it dispatched Real Madrid in the semifinals.Mario Gómez, the second-leading scorer in the Champions League this season, was barely a presence in the match, but he made his penalty kick. David Luiz countered for Chelsea, and it was 2-1.Neuer took the next shot and sent it past Cech to give Bayern a 3-1 advantage.Lampard stepped up and drilled the next Chelsea penalty high into the net, setting up the dramatic conclusion. First, Olic was denied as Cech guessed right and batted the ball away. Chelsea’s Ashley Cole made his penalty, and it was now 3-3.Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has been at Bayern since he was on the youth squad, stepped up to take his turn. He must have known that Drogba was waiting behind him. He hesitated and took a stutter-step before sending a soft kick off the goal post. He walked away with his shirt pulled over his head, and Drogba did the rest.As Drogba’s shot went in, several Chelsea fans managed to rush the field before a line of green-uniformed German police could fan out across their end. Schweinsteiger gripped his head in disbelief as stadium employees began preparing for the trophy ceremony and Chelsea’s name was inscribed into the cup.'"

"'12-05-19,'0','It’s enough to make you want to break out the Champagne.But the rosy scenario, delightful though it may be, is incomplete. And the first clue is that the return estimated by the Treasury Department is based on “the direct fiscal cost.” The indirect costs of the rescue efforts, including subsidies provided to the recipients by taxpayers, loom large. But they are unmeasured in this analysis.This point was made in Washington this month by a group of respected economists, who also contend that a large portion of the payments that the Treasury said will accrue to taxpayers should not be included.Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College and an authority on analyzing subsidies, was one of those economists. In an interview last week, he called the Treasury’s analysis deficient.First, Mr. Kane objected to the Treasury’s inclusion of $179 billion in interest income that it expects the Federal Reserve to generate on investments through 2015. These include Treasury securities and other assets bought by the Fed under various rescue programs.Including such income is improper, Mr. Kane said, because — from the taxpayers’ point of view — the Fed’s balance sheet and income statements should be consolidated with those of the Treasury. When the Fed receives income on its government securities, for example, that money comes from the Treasury. Characterizing that as a gain for the taxpayer is a reach, he said.AN even larger problem with the Treasury analysis, Mr. Kane said, is its failure to calculate the value of the subsidy that taxpayers provided to rescue recipients. “You would not pass Economics 101,” he said, “if you didn’t understand the opportunity costs involved in providing the subsidy.”The programs provided enormous amounts of money at below-market terms for extended periods, he said. Had those guarantees been priced at their true market value — what a private investor would have charged to lend during those dire days — taxpayers should have received far higher returns.Timothy G. Massad, assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, said: “We believe the fact that we took strong, forceful action resulted in us preventing significant economic costs, including the risk of a second Great Depression. But a specific counterfactual analysis is something that can be done in a variety of ways, and for the government to endorse one particular approach is not something we think is appropriate in this case.”Charles W. Calomiris, is a professor at Columbia Business School, as well as Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He worked with Mr. Kane on the critique of the Treasury’s analysis and said in an interview last week: “Pretending that when providing these subsidies all you have to do is get your money back and not get an adequate return accounting for risk — that is not a good accounting for cost.”Another problem with the Treasury’s presentation is that it does not give taxpayers a cost-benefit analysis. “We are not saying that the benefits weren’t there,” Mr. Calomiris said. “We’re not saying that it wasn’t worthwhile to create these programs. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t. But it requires a fuller analysis of what the benefits were.”When the subject of bailout benefits comes up, policy makers usually characterize them in broad and nebulous terms. The rescues avoided another Great Depression, as Mr. Massad said, or staved off Armageddon.This is insufficient, in Mr. Calomiris’s view. “It’s not good enough to say it would have been the end of the world,” he said. “If you do a cost-benefit analysis you have to take into account all relative alternatives.”Better to estimate the damage that would have been done to the economy as a whole if the rescues hadn’t taken place and then argue that the amount spent was worthwhile.“If you think you avoided a major credit contraction and you have some model of what the disruption would have been to gross domestic product,” Mr. Calomiris added, “that might tell you the benefits were far in excess of the costs.”Recognizing all the costs associated with bailouts and formulating an estimate of the benefits provided by those costs is something that taxpayers have a right to expect from their government. Being honest about the costs and benefits is the only way we can analyze the response to the crisis and correct any mistakes that were made.Focusing on whether the programs made money misses the point, Mr. Kane said. “The real issue,” he said, “is how well the government used the money and what are the lessons.”We’re still waiting for that.'"
"'12-05-19,'0','In the ’50s and ’60s she gave the color orange — her favorite, she said — one of its early moments in the high-style spotlight.“If European-accented country furniture and glass and steel tables have become national decorative clichés,” Marylin Bender wrote in The New York Times in 1974, “it is because Barbara D’Arcy pioneered and pushed them in her lavish model room settings in the ’60s.”Ms. D’Arcy, who became a merchandising executive in 1975, traveled in Europe and Asia as part of a Bloomingdale’s team of design scouts. She was among the first Americans to visit the People’s Republic of China on business after its relations with the United States were normalized in 1972. When she found a piece of furniture or an object she liked — she and others sometimes bribed museum guards to let them carry historic pieces of furniture into a courtyard for better light in sketching, photographing and measuring them — she arranged for it to be reproduced, usually by Italian manufacturers. “She and I visited furniture factories in Italy, where she would have to teach them to make a piece of furniture that looked old instead of new, how to stress it,” Marvin Traub, the former chief executive of Bloomingdale’s, said in an interview on Thursday. “It was a new idea to them, but they caught on.”Mr. Traub, who coined the concept of “retail as theater,” said Ms. D’Arcy was modest about her work early on. “But over time she came to recognize her influence,” he added. “She had enormous impact on the entire American home furnishings industry.”Barbara D’Arcy was born on April 3, 1928, in Manhattan, the youngest of three children of Ida Marie and James J. D’Arcy. Her mother was an art teacher, her father a manager for a Manhattan moving and storage company whose clients included many of the city’s wealthiest families.“He moved people back and forth among their various homes,” said Mr. White, Ms. D’Arcy’s husband. “In the process he became quite a discerning judge of furniture. Barbara learned a lot from him.”She joined Bloomingdale’s as a junior decorator in the fabric department in 1952, shortly after graduating from the College of New Rochelle, a Roman Catholic college for women, where she studied art and made sets for a student puppet theater. (She remained with the company until her retirement in 1995.)In 1958 she was named coordinating designer of the store’s model rooms, which The Times characterized at the time as “dream rooms that the consumer knows she cannot afford to duplicate in toto but that contain practical ideas she can modify with an eye on the budget.”The model rooms acquired a must-see cachet among New York designers and decorators and a loyal following of shoppers drawn to their dreamlike decorative perfection, some of it whimsical. Two of her best-known and most imaginative designs were the all-cardboard room she created with help from the architect Frank Gehry, and the Cave Room, a Flintstonesque room made from a frame of chicken wire and wood, sprayed with urethane foam and painted white. The furniture was built into the foam.In the late ’70s Ms. D’Arcy directed the redesign of Bloomingdale’s entire first floor, a three-year project that Paul Goldberger, the architecture critic for The Times, described as “perhaps the most daring piece of large-scale store design in a decade.”The palatial expanse of black marble and brass-lacquered surfaces, which she conceived and saw to completion in 1979, and which remain in place, have become a landmark in the retail world, said Mark Bradin, who teaches interior decorating at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan. “That design has become Bloomingdale’s signature,” he said. “If she had done nothing else, she would be remembered just for that.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','Racial discrimination in voting is “one of the gravest evils that Congress can seek to redress,” Judge David Tatel wrote in a crucial ruling on Friday upholding the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act.In extending the law in 2006, Congress did just that, after reviewing racial bias in the nine states and parts of several others that have deep histories of discrimination. These “covered jurisdictions” had long been required by Section 5 of the law to get permission from the Justice Department or a federal court before making any changes to their voting rules. Congress found that discriminatory practices were still persistent and pervasive in those jurisdictions, and that the preclearance requirement remained necessary.In his 2-to-1 majority opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Judge Tatel explained that Congress’s judgment, supported by a legislative record of more than 15,000 pages and 22 hearings, “deserves judicial deference” because of the weight of the evidence. The ruling upheld a forceful decision by a federal district judge that reached the same conclusion in 2011.The case, Shelby County, Ala. v. Holder, has great significance because in 2009, by a vote of 8 to 1, the Supreme Court said there were “serious constitutional questions” about whether Section 5 met a current need. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, left some legal experts with the impression that the court had come close to striking down Section 5, which, fortunately, it did not do.A dissent in the Alabama ruling argues that Section 5 is no longer constitutional because it is not “congruent and proportional” to the problem it aims to solve. But the thoroughness of Judge Tatel’s opinion dispels that idea. The majority found that voting rights discrimination is heavily concentrated in covered jurisdictions, and that overt discrimination persists in those places despite decades of Section 5 preclearance.Since 2009, there has been a wave of regressive voting measures across the country.

"'12-05-19,'0','The board of the N.A.A.C.P. voted to endorse same-sex marriage on Saturday, putting the weight of the country’s most prominent civil rights group behind a cause that has long divided some quarters of the black community.The largely symbolic move, made at the group’s meeting in Miami, puts the N.A.A.C.P. in line with President Obama, who endorsed gay marriage a little over a week ago. Given the timing, it is likely to be viewed as both a statement of principle as well as support for the president’s position in the middle of a closely contested presidential campaign.All but two of the organization’s board members, who include many religious leaders, backed a resolution supporting same-sex marriage, according to people told of the decision.Borrowing a term used by gay rights advocates, the resolution stated, “We support marriage equality consistent with equal protection under the law provided under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.”In a statement, Roslyn M. Brock, chairwoman of the 64-member board, said, “We have and will oppose efforts to codify discrimination into law.”'"
"'12-05-19,'0','More worrying, from his perspective, is that he provided the Securities and Exchange Commission with evidence pointing to frequent insider trading involving analyst research at Lehman, but the S.E.C. ultimately did not bring a case. Mr. Parmigiani spent two and a half years giving information to the S.E.C. He produced materials indicating that Lehman sales representatives were tipped off to upcoming research changes; data showing suspicious trades in dozens of stocks; organizational charts and floor plans showing that some Lehman executives who were part of the research department were located near sales and trading desks. These departments are supposed to be separated.With that ammunition, the S.E.C. opened an investigation, case HO-10864. Officials told him that his evidence was credible.Then the case died. And after Lehman’s collapse its employees have scattered across Wall Street.Since the financial crisis, the S.E.C. has spent a lot of time and money trying to plug leaks. In a case worthy of “Law & Order,” prosecutors used wiretaps to ensnare Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire Galleon hedge fund manager whose web of tipsters stretched from Wall Street to some of the mightiest corporations in the land. For his crimes, Mr. Rajaratnam, whom prosecutors called “the modern face of illegal insider trading,” was sentenced last October to 11 years in prison.Mr. Rajaratnam’s conviction, in the largest insider-trading scandal in a generation, handed a much-needed win to the beleaguered S.E.C. Only two years earlier, the commission had been lambasted for missing glaring evidence of Bernard L. Madoff’s vast Ponzi scheme.But Mr. Parmigiani and others suspect that the P.R. of the Galleon case glosses over risks that insider trading can and does occur regularly at many Wall Street firms. In their view, it has become institutionalized. The flow of information between a firm’s analysts, its traders and its clients — a lucrative heads-up on stock upgrades and downgrades, for instance — can bolster trading profits, brokerage commissions and, ultimately, Wall Street paydays. Those in the know can get rich before the rest of us know what happened.“Prosecutors say insider trading won’t be tolerated, that this is justice,” Mr. Parmigiani says of the Galleon case. “But they refuse to acknowledge that their widespread net has a very big hole in it.”What exactly happened at Lehman? Mr. Parmigiani says traders there were routinely advised of changes in analysts’ company ratings before those changes were made public. That way, Lehman could profit on subsequent market moves. Here is how he describes it: First, research officials tipped off the traders; then Lehman’s proprietary trading desk, which cast bets with the firm’s own money, positioned itself accordingly. Lehman salespeople also alerted favored hedge funds. Only later, he says, were ratings changes made public.Blowing the whistle on any big corporation, as Mr. Parmigiani tried to do in the case of Lehman, is almost always perilous. Shortly after noting the suspicious trading in Amkor, Mr. Parmigiani says, he was fired for not being a team player. He has since been unable to find work on Wall Street.John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., said it conducted a careful, thorough investigation of Mr. Parmigiani’s allegations.“Not only did we investigate the circumstances surrounding each of the research reports specifically identified by Mr. Parmigiani, we conducted a broader examination into the trading by Lehman clients in all companies in which there was a material change in the stock price following the issuance of a Lehman research report,” Mr. Nester said. “We also investigated the communications between 46 Lehman employees and 56 Lehman clients, including nearly 100,000 e-mails.”The S.E.C. also analyzed voluminous trading data and interviewed numerous Lehman employees, he said. “After all that, there simply was not any evidence in this case to support the conclusion that Lehman, its employees or its clients had committed insider trading.”Publicly, the S.E.C. is taking a strong stance against insider trading. Officials say the commission is not only going after insider traders but also taking action against firms. A recent case against Goldman Sachs suggests that the S.E.C. recognizes the potential for improprieties that can occur if traders receive special access to research analysts’ work.In the case, the S.E.C. alleged that Goldman analysts had shared trading ideas and other information with select clients. Although the S.E.C. did not charge any individuals with insider trading or tipping, Goldman’s activities “created a serious and substantial risk that analysts would share material, nonpublic information concerning their published research,” the S.E.C. said. Goldman paid $22 million to settle the matter. As is common in such cases, it neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.In an interview with Reuters in late April, Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C. director of enforcement, said: “We have charged firms for having compliance failures even where there were no underlying violations. We want to send a message that businesses have to have controls in place in order to prevent fraud.”Indeed, the S.E.C. filed roughly 60 insider-trading cases in its 2011 fiscal year alone. But aside from a few that sprang from the Rajaratnam case and a handful of other sizable cases, many involved minor players and small sums. Of the 93 people charged during that period, 37 had pocketed less than $100,000 on their inside trades, according to the S.E.C.; 19 made $50,000 or less; and one netted just $8,391.Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities laws in New York, says the S.E.C. is wasting time and money by going after small fish.“This raises questions about the allocation of resources at a time when there is a real hue and cry that the S.E.C. is not getting sufficient funds from Congress,” Mr. Lowenfels says. “When you see that such a disproportionate amount goes to this kind of insider trading, you really have to wonder if the S.E.C. is using this as a means to resuscitate their stature, post-Madoff.”The real potential targets are much, much bigger. Many people, inside and outside financial circles, have long suspected that Wall Street firms alert favored clients to analyst research before the investing public.Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who works closely with whistle-blowers, examined the material that Mr. Parmigiani brought to the S.E.C. Expressing disappointment in its handling of the allegations, Mr. Grassley said: “This case emphasizes serious questions about the S.E.C.’s culture of deference to Wall Street and big players going back a long time. The S.E.C. obtained what appears to be clear evidence of, at a minimum, disregard for regulations designed to ensure that Wall Street firms can’t leak inside information to preferred clients prior to public announcements. Yet there appears to have been no consequences.”When most people think of insider trading, they probably think of Gordon Gekko, the corrupt financier played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film “Wall Street.” In the movie, the hot tips were about corporate takeovers.Mergers and acquisitions are big, market-moving news, but so are corporate earnings announcements. These statements are ripe for insider trading, particularly when results take analysts and investors by surprise.But while insider trading commonly involves nonpublic corporate information, advance warning on research changes can also yield quick, illicit gains. The S.E.C. said as much in a rare research case it filed in 2007 involving an executive at the Swiss banking giant UBS. In that case, eight individuals and three hedge funds were charged with profiting on tips about coming analyst ratings changes — “valuable and material, nonpublic information,” the S.E.C. said. One executive went to jail, and others settled with the S.E.C.Mr. Parmigiani says his experience at Lehman made him suspect that the firm was trying to profit by trading ahead of changes in analyst recommendations.“ ‘We’re trying to monetize the research,’ is what they would tell me when they asked for advance warning of rating changes,” Mr. Parmigiani says. “They would say: ‘Just let me know. We’ve got to relay a heads-up to trading. We’ve got to protect the house.’ ”Ted Parmigiani didn’t take the usual road to Wall Street. In 1986, at the age of 17, he dropped out of high school to join the Navy. He served on the U.S.S. Midway and gained expertise in accounting and supply-chain aspects of technology.Paul Dublino, who lives near Orlando, Fla., enlisted at the same time and considers Mr. Parmigiani a friend. Mr. Dublino says his old Navy buddy impressed him with his intelligence and honesty. “No matter what he ever did, he excelled at it,” Mr. Dublino says. “I don’t think he has any type of fabrication of any sort in him. He tells it how it is.”Mr. Parmigiani resigned from active duty in 1990, went to college on the G.I. Bill and then collected a master’s degree in finance. He joined Lehman in 2002.At that time, Wall Street research was under a microscope. Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, had exposed how analysts routinely slanted research to win lucrative investment banking business. In 2003, Lehman was among 10 firms that reached a $1.4 billion settlement. They all promised to wall off research operations from other parts of their business.But Mr. Parmigiani says he was asked to break those new rules. Lehman bosses, he contends, told him to write research that would support investment banking business — a violation of the Spitzer settlement. He says he was warned not to make negative comments about companies, even when he thought they were merited, lest he antagonize corporate executives. In 2003, he says, he was chastised for downgrading a company that was a corporate finance client of Lehman’s.Most alarming, Mr. Parmigiani says, was that Lehman had created a system that gave its stock trading desks access to its analysts’ research recommendations before those recommendations were made public. The Product Management Group, as this business unit was known, scheduled analysts’ calls on the firm-wide squawk box system and was part of the research department.Mr. Parmigiani says the Product Management Group often delayed the announcements of recommendation changes for no apparent reason. He says he began to suspect that the delays were meant to allow Lehman’s traders to put on positions ahead of the news and to give the firm’s top sales representatives time to alert favored clients.On March 30, 2005, Mr. Parmigiani had been scheduled to meet with a series of hedge fund clients, including Moore Capital, to discuss his research. At the last minute, Jared Demark, a vice president in Lehman’s institutional equity sales who covered the hedge funds and had planned to accompany him, bowed out. In an e-mail to Mr. Parmigiani, Mr. Demark wrote: “Go to the Moore meeting without me, we have big ratings change looming ... ”While Mr. Parmigiani did not learn precisely what Mr. Demark meant by that e-mail, it fueled Mr. Parmigiani’s concern that Lehman was alerting hedge funds to analysts’ pending changes.Chris Boehning, a lawyer at Paul Weiss, said his client, Mr. Demark, would not comment.he S.E.C. staff “conducted a careful investigation beginning in the fall of 2008 and concluded that there was no basis to recommend an enforcement action,” Mr. Boehning said.  “We were very pleased with the thorough way the S.E.C. went about its work.”That same day of the e-mail, Mr. Parmigiani said, another salesman told him that he had received a message about an imminent industrywide downgrade and had to start alerting clients.Even though the Product Management Group was part of the research department, it was on the second floor, next to the stock trading desks and close to the firm’s top institutional sales representatives covering hedge funds.Before long, Mr. Parmigiani and his superiors butted heads. In 2004, he says, he was asked to vet a company he had properly referred to Lehman’s investment bankers for a securities offering. He recalled Stuart Linde, then director of United States equity research, prodding him to be positive in his analysis, to help ensure that the deal got done. When he questioned whether this followed the rules handed down in the Spitzer settlement, Mr. Linde took offense, he said. But he says he stood his ground.“One of the things I took out of the military is the one rule and duty you have is a duty to disobey an unlawful order,” Mr. Parmigiani says.Mr. Linde, now director of United States equity research at Barclays Capital, declined to comment. A Barclays spokesman said Mr. Linde had never received a subpoena from the S.E.C. about the matter.For Mr. Parmigiani, the final straw came on June 1, 2005, when he decided to change his rating on Amkor from “sell” to “neutral.” He had submitted his change to the Product Management Group that day, but then was told the switch wouldn’t be announced until the following day.The next morning, he sent his upgrade to the research committee, which agreed that he should discuss Amkor on the squawk box at 10 a.m. But before he could speak, Amkor stock jumped in unusually heavy trading. He accused firm officials of distributing his upgrade ahead of time.About two weeks later, Lehman fired him, with two weeks’ salary and no severance. On his permanent employee record filed with regulators, Lehman said he had been dismissed because he had “failed to meet performance expectations.” Those words effectively ended his Wall Street career, he says.He filed a wrongful-termination case in May 2006, which was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum. The check was signed by Richard S. Fuld Jr., who, as chief executive, would later preside over Lehman’s collapse.Unable to find work on Wall Street, Mr. Parmigiani took his story to the S.E.C. On a Friday in late April 2008, he left a message for Linda Chatman Thomsen, then the commission’s director of enforcement. The next Monday, an enforcement attorney called back and invited him to conduct a conference call with S.E.C. officials. A two-hour conversation ensued, during which he described his experiences at Lehman.Then, that April, S.E.C. officials asked him to come to Washington from his home in the San Francisco Bay Area. He spent a day with four enforcement lawyers. “They copied all my stuff and we sat there for six hours,” Mr. Parmigiani says. “They asked me questions, they took notes. They were shocked.”He says the S.E.C. lawyers told him they would get back to him.But then, as the financial crisis flared that summer, the S.E.C.’s interest waned. After Lehman failed, Mr. Parmigiani got a call from two of the lawyers, signaling that the S.E.C. was probably not going to pursue the matter. The S.E.C. spokesman said the lawyers would not comment.Mr. Parmigiani took his brief to Senator Grassley’s office. Officials there sent a letter to the S.E.C., inquiring about the status of the investigation. By then, however, Ms. Thomsen, the enforcement director, had left the agency for private practice. Messages left for Ms. Thomsen were not returned.Eventually, Mr. Parmigiani had another meeting with the S.E.C., in September 2010, and presented an analysis by Steven P. Feinstein, an associate professor of finance at Babson College. Relying on public information, Mr. Feinstein had analyzed the price movements of stocks in 361 downgrades by Lehman analysts between 2004 and 2008. The sample excluded any stocks that had been the subject of market-moving news — like earnings reports or other announcements — as well as shares that had been downgraded recently by other Wall Street firms.Mr. Feinstein concluded that the stocks “exhibited significantly different price behavior on the two trading days preceding a rating downgrade by Lehman Brothers than they did on other days.” The results, Mr. Feinstein said, indicated that Lehman Brothers “apparently engaged in tipping,” and that stock prices were affected and that investors suffered damages as a result.Mr. Parmigiani says the S.E.C. seemed impressed with the study. One lawyer, he says, told him that the commission “really liked the case” but that they did not have enough to go forward.But Mr. Nester of the S.E.C. said a report connecting analyst actions with stock moves does not make an insider-trading case. “Fortunately, our staff can and does interrogate witnesses, review contemporaneous documents, including e-mails, and scrutinize trading records,” he said. “That is evidence, and that is what determines whether insider trading has occurred.”Frustrated, Mr. Parmigiani called investigators for Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. These were the prosecutors bringing the Galleon cases.“I told them that Galleon was one of the spokes of the wheel but that it was not the wheel itself,” Mr. Parmigiani says, but his discussions led nowhere as well. Mr. Bharara’s office declined to comment.At his last meeting with the S.E.C., Mr. Parmigiani recalled, one of the officials said, “We never doubted your credibility.”Today, Mr. Parmigiani spends much more time with his two young children; his wife has become the family’s breadwinner. He has paid a price for trying to blow the whistle on Lehman, but says he has no regrets. Still, he says, his experience suggests that the authorities are reluctant to go after high-level executives on Wall Street.As he puts it: “Law-abiding citizens should not have to beg civil servants charged with law enforcement to do their jobs.”'"

"'12-05-20,'0','“In Moscow, it was very difficult, very painful for the players, the club, for the fans,” Drogba said of the 2008 defeat. “Today, we managed to change it, and again it was an amazing game, a crazy game.”The defeat was especially bitter for Bayern. It not only had to watch as Chelsea celebrated on its home field, but it also controlled play throughout, taking 35 shots to Chelsea’s 9.For more than 80 minutes the championship game followed a predictable script. Bayern had the ball. Bayern got close to the Chelsea goal. A swarm of blue-clad defenders smothered the attack.After 82 scoreless minutes, the game seemed destined for penalty kicks, and it was. But the path to get there was unexpectedly thrilling.In the 83rd minute, Bayern finally made the most of one of its chances when Thomas Müller bounced a header off the grass and over Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech.“Thomas!” screamed the announcer. “Müller!” the crowd answered — once, twice and a third time.There were seven minutes to go and the dream of a European title at its home stadium seemed closer and closer as time wound down. Bayern dominated Chelsea on corner kicks throughout, taking 20 to Chelsea’s 1. But Drogba made sure the only corner was one that counted.With two minutes to go in regulation, Drogba silenced the celebrating crowd, driving home a header on Juan Mata’s corner kick. Bayern goalie Manuel Neuer could only deflect the ball into the net.Bayern had another chance to win five minutes into extra time when Drogba fouled Bayern’s French star, Franck Ribéry, in the penalty area, a mistake that could have cost Chelsea the game and negated his earlier heroics. But Arjen Robben took the penalty and kicked the ball low, and Cech stopped it at the line.The most dominant team in the history of German professional soccer, with a reputation here similar to that of the Yankees, Bayern ended the season without a title, failing to win the Bundesliga title, the German Cup and now the Champions League.This was without question the bitterest taste of all.Each club had an allotment of 17,500 tickets, but Bayern fans clad in red and white outnumbered the Chelsea blues. In many ways, the pressure was all on Bayern. Its fans and management expected a victory on home turf. Chelsea could blame injuries and its four suspended players, including John Terry, the captain, to Bayern’s three if it came up short again.Time and again, Bayern had chances in regulation and in extra time. As late as the 107th minute, Ivica Olic, the Croat substituted for Ribéry, took a soft cross from Philipp Lahm and sent the ball rolling just past the far post.The shootout came in front of the screaming Bayern fans, a sea of red and white. Lahm, the Bayern captain, converted the first penalty. Then Neuer blocked Chelsea’s first try by Mata. Once again, it seemed as if Bayern would win, exactly as it dispatched Real Madrid in the semifinals.Mario Gómez, the second-leading scorer in the Champions League this season, was barely a presence in the match, but he made his penalty kick. David Luiz countered for Chelsea, and it was 2-1.Neuer took the next shot and sent it past Cech to give Bayern a 3-1 advantage.Lampard stepped up and drilled the next Chelsea penalty high into the net, setting up the dramatic conclusion. First, Olic was denied as Cech guessed right and batted the ball away. Chelsea’s Ashley Cole made his penalty, and it was now 3-3.Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has been at Bayern since he was on the youth squad, stepped up to take his turn. He must have known that Drogba was waiting behind him. He hesitated and took a stutter-step before sending a soft kick off the goal post. He walked away with his shirt pulled over his head, and Drogba did the rest.As Drogba’s shot went in, several Chelsea fans managed to rush the field before a line of green-uniformed German police could fan out across their end. Schweinsteiger gripped his head in disbelief as stadium employees began preparing for the trophy ceremony and Chelsea’s name was inscribed into the cup.'"
"'12-05-20,'0','Racial discrimination in voting is “one of the gravest evils that Congress can seek to redress,” Judge David Tatel wrote in a crucial ruling on Friday upholding the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act.In extending the law in 2006, Congress did just that, after reviewing racial bias in the nine states and parts of several others that have deep histories of discrimination. These “covered jurisdictions” had long been required by Section 5 of the law to get permission from the Justice Department or a federal court before making any changes to their voting rules. Congress found that discriminatory practices were still persistent and pervasive in those jurisdictions, and that the preclearance requirement remained necessary.In his 2-to-1 majority opinion for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Judge Tatel explained that Congress’s judgment, supported by a legislative record of more than 15,000 pages and 22 hearings, “deserves judicial deference” because of the weight of the evidence. The ruling upheld a forceful decision by a federal district judge that reached the same conclusion in 2011.The case, Shelby County, Ala. v. Holder, has great significance because in 2009, by a vote of 8 to 1, the Supreme Court said there were “serious constitutional questions” about whether Section 5 met a current need. Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, left some legal experts with the impression that the court had come close to striking down Section 5, which, fortunately, it did not do.A dissent in the Alabama ruling argues that Section 5 is no longer constitutional because it is not “congruent and proportional” to the problem it aims to solve. But the thoroughness of Judge Tatel’s opinion dispels that idea. The majority found that voting rights discrimination is heavily concentrated in covered jurisdictions, and that overt discrimination persists in those places despite decades of Section 5 preclearance.Since 2009, there has been a wave of regressive voting measures across the country. No one seriously argues that “the blight of racial discrimination in voting,” as the Supreme Court once called it, has been halted.'"
"'12-05-20,'0','DENVER (AP) — Minutes after President Obama announced that he supported same-sex marriage, the Democratic governor of Colorado choked back tears as he ordered state lawmakers to reconsider a civil unions measure that Republicans had defeated the day before.In the week that followed, the debate over equal rights for same-sex couples consumed the State Capitol. And while Republicans ultimately succeeded in killing the measure, lawmakers in both parties acknowledged that the emotional standoff over the issue could help shape the presidential campaign in this battleground state.“Go back to your communities, go back to your neighborhoods, go back to your churches and let them know that the fight continues,” Speaker Frank McNulty, a Republican, implored opponents of same-sex marriage who had gathered outside the Capitol on Tuesday.Democrats, in turn, predicted that their loyalists, as well as independents, would rally behind Mr. Obama, who plans to visit the state on Wednesday to deliver a commencement address at the Air Force Academy before attending fund-raisers in Denver.“That will have a positive impact on the chances of the president being re-elected and winning Colorado in November,” said State Representative Mark Ferrandino, a Democrat who is gay and co-sponsored the civil unions legislation.'"
"'12-05-20,'0','It’s enough to make you want to break out the Champagne.But the rosy scenario, delightful though it may be, is incomplete. And the first clue is that the return estimated by the Treasury Department is based on “the direct fiscal cost.” The indirect costs of the rescue efforts, including subsidies provided to the recipients by taxpayers, loom large. But they are unmeasured in this analysis.This point was made in Washington this month by a group of respected economists, who also contend that a large portion of the payments that the Treasury said will accrue to taxpayers should not be included.Edward J. Kane, a professor of finance at Boston College and an authority on analyzing subsidies, was one of those economists. In an interview last week, he called the Treasury’s analysis deficient.First, Mr. Kane objected to the Treasury’s inclusion of $179 billion in interest income that it expects the Federal Reserve to generate on investments through 2015. These include Treasury securities and other assets bought by the Fed under various rescue programs.Including such income is improper, Mr. Kane said, because — from the taxpayers’ point of view — the Fed’s balance sheet and income statements should be consolidated with those of the Treasury. When the Fed receives income on its government securities, for example, that money comes from the Treasury. Characterizing that as a gain for the taxpayer is a reach, he said.AN even larger problem with the Treasury analysis, Mr. Kane said, is its failure to calculate the value of the subsidy that taxpayers provided to rescue recipients. “You would not pass Economics 101,” he said, “if you didn’t understand the opportunity costs involved in providing the subsidy.”The programs provided enormous amounts of money at below-market terms for extended periods, he said. Had those guarantees been priced at their true market value — what a private investor would have charged to lend during those dire days — taxpayers should have received far higher returns.Timothy G. Massad, assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability, said: “We believe the fact that we took strong, forceful action resulted in us preventing significant economic costs, including the risk of a second Great Depression. But a specific counterfactual analysis is something that can be done in a variety of ways, and for the government to endorse one particular approach is not something we think is appropriate in this case.”Charles W. Calomiris, is a professor at Columbia Business School, as well as Columbia’s School of International and Public Affairs, and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research. He worked with Mr. Kane on the critique of the Treasury’s analysis and said in an interview last week: “Pretending that when providing these subsidies all you have to do is get your money back and not get an adequate return accounting for risk — that is not a good accounting for cost.”Another problem with the Treasury’s presentation is that it does not give taxpayers a cost-benefit analysis. “We are not saying that the benefits weren’t there,” Mr. Calomiris said. “We’re not saying that it wasn’t worthwhile to create these programs. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t. But it requires a fuller analysis of what the benefits were.”When the subject of bailout benefits comes up, policy makers usually characterize them in broad and nebulous terms. The rescues avoided another Great Depression, as Mr. Massad said, or staved off Armageddon.This is insufficient, in Mr. Calomiris’s view. “It’s not good enough to say it would have been the end of the world,” he said. “If you do a cost-benefit analysis you have to take into account all relative alternatives.”Better to estimate the damage that would have been done to the economy as a whole if the rescues hadn’t taken place and then argue that the amount spent was worthwhile.“If you think you avoided a major credit contraction and you have some model of what the disruption would have been to gross domestic product,” Mr. Calomiris added, “that might tell you the benefits were far in excess of the costs.”Recognizing all the costs associated with bailouts and formulating an estimate of the benefits provided by those costs is something that taxpayers have a right to expect from their government. Being honest about the costs and benefits is the only way we can analyze the response to the crisis and correct any mistakes that were made.Focusing on whether the programs made money misses the point, Mr. Kane said. “The real issue,” he said, “is how well the government used the money and what are the lessons.”We’re still waiting for that.'"
"'12-05-20,'0','More worrying, from his perspective, is that he provided the Securities and Exchange Commission with evidence pointing to frequent insider trading involving analyst research at Lehman, but the S.E.C. ultimately did not bring a case. Mr. Parmigiani spent two and a half years giving information to the S.E.C. He produced materials indicating that Lehman sales representatives were tipped off to upcoming research changes; data showing suspicious trades in dozens of stocks; organizational charts and floor plans showing that some Lehman executives who were part of the research department were located near sales and trading desks. These departments are supposed to be separated.With that ammunition, the S.E.C. opened an investigation, case HO-10864. Officials told him that his evidence was credible.Then the case died. And after Lehman’s collapse its employees have scattered across Wall Street.Since the financial crisis, the S.E.C. has spent a lot of time and money trying to plug leaks. In a case worthy of “Law & Order,” prosecutors used wiretaps to ensnare Raj Rajaratnam, the billionaire Galleon hedge fund manager whose web of tipsters stretched from Wall Street to some of the mightiest corporations in the land. For his crimes, Mr. Rajaratnam, whom prosecutors called “the modern face of illegal insider trading,” was sentenced last October to 11 years in prison.Mr. Rajaratnam’s conviction, in the largest insider-trading scandal in a generation, handed a much-needed win to the beleaguered S.E.C. Only two years earlier, the commission had been lambasted for missing glaring evidence of Bernard L. Madoff’s vast Ponzi scheme.But Mr. Parmigiani and others suspect that the P.R. of the Galleon case glosses over risks that insider trading can and does occur regularly at many Wall Street firms. In their view, it has become institutionalized. The flow of information between a firm’s analysts, its traders and its clients — a lucrative heads-up on stock upgrades and downgrades, for instance — can bolster trading profits, brokerage commissions and, ultimately, Wall Street paydays. Those in the know can get rich before the rest of us know what happened.“Prosecutors say insider trading won’t be tolerated, that this is justice,” Mr. Parmigiani says of the Galleon case. “But they refuse to acknowledge that their widespread net has a very big hole in it.”What exactly happened at Lehman? Mr. Parmigiani says traders there were routinely advised of changes in analysts’ company ratings before those changes were made public. That way, Lehman could profit on subsequent market moves. Here is how he describes it: First, research officials tipped off the traders; then Lehman’s proprietary trading desk, which cast bets with the firm’s own money, positioned itself accordingly. Lehman salespeople also alerted favored hedge funds. Only later, he says, were ratings changes made public.Blowing the whistle on any big corporation, as Mr. Parmigiani tried to do in the case of Lehman, is almost always perilous. Shortly after noting the suspicious trading in Amkor, Mr. Parmigiani says, he was fired for not being a team player. He has since been unable to find work on Wall Street.John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., said it conducted a careful, thorough investigation of Mr. Parmigiani’s allegations.“Not only did we investigate the circumstances surrounding each of the research reports specifically identified by Mr. Parmigiani, we conducted a broader examination into the trading by Lehman clients in all companies in which there was a material change in the stock price following the issuance of a Lehman research report,” Mr. Nester said. “We also investigated the communications between 46 Lehman employees and 56 Lehman clients, including nearly 100,000 e-mails.”The S.E.C. also analyzed voluminous trading data and interviewed numerous Lehman employees, he said. “After all that, there simply was not any evidence in this case to support the conclusion that Lehman, its employees or its clients had committed insider trading.”Publicly, the S.E.C. is taking a strong stance against insider trading. Officials say the commission is not only going after insider traders but also taking action against firms. A recent case against Goldman Sachs suggests that the S.E.C. recognizes the potential for improprieties that can occur if traders receive special access to research analysts’ work.In the case, the S.E.C. alleged that Goldman analysts had shared trading ideas and other information with select clients. Although the S.E.C. did not charge any individuals with insider trading or tipping, Goldman’s activities “created a serious and substantial risk that analysts would share material, nonpublic information concerning their published research,” the S.E.C. said. Goldman paid $22 million to settle the matter. As is common in such cases, it neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.In an interview with Reuters in late April, Robert S. Khuzami, the S.E.C. director of enforcement, said: “We have charged firms for having compliance failures even where there were no underlying violations. We want to send a message that businesses have to have controls in place in order to prevent fraud.”Indeed, the S.E.C. filed roughly 60 insider-trading cases in its 2011 fiscal year alone. But aside from a few that sprang from the Rajaratnam case and a handful of other sizable cases, many involved minor players and small sums. Of the 93 people charged during that period, 37 had pocketed less than $100,000 on their inside trades, according to the S.E.C.; 19 made $50,000 or less; and one netted just $8,391.Lewis D. Lowenfels, an expert in securities laws in New York, says the S.E.C. is wasting time and money by going after small fish.“This raises questions about the allocation of resources at a time when there is a real hue and cry that the S.E.C. is not getting sufficient funds from Congress,” Mr. Lowenfels says. “When you see that such a disproportionate amount goes to this kind of insider trading, you really have to wonder if the S.E.C. is using this as a means to resuscitate their stature, post-Madoff.”The real potential targets are much, much bigger. Many people, inside and outside financial circles, have long suspected that Wall Street firms alert favored clients to analyst research before the investing public.Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who works closely with whistle-blowers, examined the material that Mr. Parmigiani brought to the S.E.C. Expressing disappointment in its handling of the allegations, Mr. Grassley said: “This case emphasizes serious questions about the S.E.C.’s culture of deference to Wall Street and big players going back a long time. The S.E.C. obtained what appears to be clear evidence of, at a minimum, disregard for regulations designed to ensure that Wall Street firms can’t leak inside information to preferred clients prior to public announcements. Yet there appears to have been no consequences.”When most people think of insider trading, they probably think of Gordon Gekko, the corrupt financier played by Michael Douglas in the 1987 film “Wall Street.” In the movie, the hot tips were about corporate takeovers.Mergers and acquisitions are big, market-moving news, but so are corporate earnings announcements. These statements are ripe for insider trading, particularly when results take analysts and investors by surprise.But while insider trading commonly involves nonpublic corporate information, advance warning on research changes can also yield quick, illicit gains. The S.E.C. said as much in a rare research case it filed in 2007 involving an executive at the Swiss banking giant UBS. In that case, eight individuals and three hedge funds were charged with profiting on tips about coming analyst ratings changes — “valuable and material, nonpublic information,” the S.E.C. said. One executive went to jail, and others settled with the S.E.C.Mr. Parmigiani says his experience at Lehman made him suspect that the firm was trying to profit by trading ahead of changes in analyst recommendations.“ ‘We’re trying to monetize the research,’ is what they would tell me when they asked for advance warning of rating changes,” Mr. Parmigiani says. “They would say: ‘Just let me know. We’ve got to relay a heads-up to trading. We’ve got to protect the house.’ ”Ted Parmigiani didn’t take the usual road to Wall Street. In 1986, at the age of 17, he dropped out of high school to join the Navy. He served on the U.S.S. Midway and gained expertise in accounting and supply-chain aspects of technology.Paul Dublino, who lives near Orlando, Fla., enlisted at the same time and considers Mr. Parmigiani a friend. Mr. Dublino says his old Navy buddy impressed him with his intelligence and honesty. “No matter what he ever did, he excelled at it,” Mr. Dublino says. “I don’t think he has any type of fabrication of any sort in him. He tells it how it is.”Mr. Parmigiani resigned from active duty in 1990, went to college on the G.I. Bill and then collected a master’s degree in finance. He joined Lehman in 2002.At that time, Wall Street research was under a microscope. Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, had exposed how analysts routinely slanted research to win lucrative investment banking business. In 2003, Lehman was among 10 firms that reached a $1.4 billion settlement. They all promised to wall off research operations from other parts of their business.But Mr. Parmigiani says he was asked to break those new rules. Lehman bosses, he contends, told him to write research that would support investment banking business — a violation of the Spitzer settlement. He says he was warned not to make negative comments about companies, even when he thought they were merited, lest he antagonize corporate executives. In 2003, he says, he was chastised for downgrading a company that was a corporate finance client of Lehman’s.Most alarming, Mr. Parmigiani says, was that Lehman had created a system that gave its stock trading desks access to its analysts’ research recommendations before those recommendations were made public. The Product Management Group, as this business unit was known, scheduled analysts’ calls on the firm-wide squawk box system and was part of the research department.Mr. Parmigiani says the Product Management Group often delayed the announcements of recommendation changes for no apparent reason. He says he began to suspect that the delays were meant to allow Lehman’s traders to put on positions ahead of the news and to give the firm’s top sales representatives time to alert favored clients.On March 30, 2005, Mr. Parmigiani had been scheduled to meet with a series of hedge fund clients, including Moore Capital, to discuss his research. At the last minute, Jared Demark, a vice president in Lehman’s institutional equity sales who covered the hedge funds and had planned to accompany him, bowed out. In an e-mail to Mr. Parmigiani, Mr. Demark wrote: “Go to the Moore meeting without me, we have big ratings change looming ... ”While Mr. Parmigiani did not learn precisely what Mr. Demark meant by that e-mail, it fueled Mr. Parmigiani’s concern that Lehman was alerting hedge funds to analysts’ pending changes.Chris Boehning, a lawyer at Paul Weiss, said his client, Mr. Demark, would not comment.he S.E.C. staff “conducted a careful investigation beginning in the fall of 2008 and concluded that there was no basis to recommend an enforcement action,” Mr. Boehning said.  “We were very pleased with the thorough way the S.E.C. went about its work.”That same day of the e-mail, Mr. Parmigiani said, another salesman told him that he had received a message about an imminent industrywide downgrade and had to start alerting clients.Even though the Product Management Group was part of the research department, it was on the second floor, next to the stock trading desks and close to the firm’s top institutional sales representatives covering hedge funds.Before long, Mr. Parmigiani and his superiors butted heads. In 2004, he says, he was asked to vet a company he had properly referred to Lehman’s investment bankers for a securities offering. He recalled Stuart Linde, then director of United States equity research, prodding him to be positive in his analysis, to help ensure that the deal got done. When he questioned whether this followed the rules handed down in the Spitzer settlement, Mr. Linde took offense, he said. But he says he stood his ground.“One of the things I took out of the military is the one rule and duty you have is a duty to disobey an unlawful order,” Mr. Parmigiani says.Mr. Linde, now director of United States equity research at Barclays Capital, declined to comment. A Barclays spokesman said Mr. Linde had never received a subpoena from the S.E.C. about the matter.For Mr. Parmigiani, the final straw came on June 1, 2005, when he decided to change his rating on Amkor from “sell” to “neutral.” He had submitted his change to the Product Management Group that day, but then was told the switch wouldn’t be announced until the following day.The next morning, he sent his upgrade to the research committee, which agreed that he should discuss Amkor on the squawk box at 10 a.m. But before he could speak, Amkor stock jumped in unusually heavy trading. He accused firm officials of distributing his upgrade ahead of time.About two weeks later, Lehman fired him, with two weeks’ salary and no severance. On his permanent employee record filed with regulators, Lehman said he had been dismissed because he had “failed to meet performance expectations.” Those words effectively ended his Wall Street career, he says.He filed a wrongful-termination case in May 2006, which was eventually settled for an undisclosed sum. The check was signed by Richard S. Fuld Jr., who, as chief executive, would later preside over Lehman’s collapse.Unable to find work on Wall Street, Mr. Parmigiani took his story to the S.E.C. On a Friday in late April 2008, he left a message for Linda Chatman Thomsen, then the commission’s director of enforcement. The next Monday, an enforcement attorney called back and invited him to conduct a conference call with S.E.C. officials. A two-hour conversation ensued, during which he described his experiences at Lehman.Then, that April, S.E.C. officials asked him to come to Washington from his home in the San Francisco Bay Area. He spent a day with four enforcement lawyers. “They copied all my stuff and we sat there for six hours,” Mr. Parmigiani says. “They asked me questions, they took notes. They were shocked.”He says the S.E.C. lawyers told him they would get back to him.But then, as the financial crisis flared that summer, the S.E.C.’s interest waned. After Lehman failed, Mr. Parmigiani got a call from two of the lawyers, signaling that the S.E.C. was probably not going to pursue the matter. The S.E.C. spokesman said the lawyers would not comment.Mr. Parmigiani took his brief to Senator Grassley’s office. Officials there sent a letter to the S.E.C., inquiring about the status of the investigation. By then, however, Ms. Thomsen, the enforcement director, had left the agency for private practice. Messages left for Ms. Thomsen were not returned.Eventually, Mr. Parmigiani had another meeting with the S.E.C., in September 2010, and presented an analysis by Steven P. Feinstein, an associate professor of finance at Babson College. Relying on public information, Mr. Feinstein had analyzed the price movements of stocks in 361 downgrades by Lehman analysts between 2004 and 2008. The sample excluded any stocks that had been the subject of market-moving news — like earnings reports or other announcements — as well as shares that had been downgraded recently by other Wall Street firms.Mr. Feinstein concluded that the stocks “exhibited significantly different price behavior on the two trading days preceding a rating downgrade by Lehman Brothers than they did on other days.” The results, Mr. Feinstein said, indicated that Lehman Brothers “apparently engaged in tipping,” and that stock prices were affected and that investors suffered damages as a result.Mr. Parmigiani says the S.E.C. seemed impressed with the study. One lawyer, he says, told him that the commission “really liked the case” but that they did not have enough to go forward.But Mr. Nester of the S.E.C. said a report connecting analyst actions with stock moves does not make an insider-trading case. “Fortunately, our staff can and does interrogate witnesses, review contemporaneous documents, including e-mails, and scrutinize trading records,” he said. “That is evidence, and that is what determines whether insider trading has occurred.”Frustrated, Mr. Parmigiani called investigators for Preet Bharara, United States attorney for the Southern District of New York. These were the prosecutors bringing the Galleon cases.“I told them that Galleon was one of the spokes of the wheel but that it was not the wheel itself,” Mr. Parmigiani says, but his discussions led nowhere as well. Mr. Bharara’s office declined to comment.At his last meeting with the S.E.C., Mr. Parmigiani recalled, one of the officials said, “We never doubted your credibility.”Today, Mr. Parmigiani spends much more time with his two young children; his wife has become the family’s breadwinner. He has paid a price for trying to blow the whistle on Lehman, but says he has no regrets. Still, he says, his experience suggests that the authorities are reluctant to go after high-level executives on Wall Street.As he puts it: “Law-abiding citizens should not have to beg civil servants charged with law enforcement to do their jobs.”'"
"'12-05-20,'0','The trip to New York ended an improbable journey that began in late April, when despite his lack of sight, Mr. Chen scaled the walls around his house, sneaked past the guards who held him captive and was whisked to Beijing by a human rights activist. American officials agreed to provide at least temporary shelter, but the pickup almost went awry: Chinese security cars trailed their vehicle, forcing them to sweep Mr. Chen into their car from another vehicle and race through the streets of the capital to the embassy.But the drama did not end there. Mr. Chen decided more than a week later to stay in China, only to change his mind several hours later when American officials left him at a hospital and friends expressed fears for his safety. That led to renewed negotiations and eventually to Saturday’s release.Now, after years of isolation — his every move at his home recorded by surveillance cameras — and serving time in a Chinese jail, Mr. Chen found himself at the center of a media frenzy generated by his release.But the sudden ability to speak out was bittersweet, which he acknowledged in an interview on the plane. China has a pattern of allowing some especially vocal dissidents to leave the country in order to minimize the impact of their activism at home, and it is unclear if he will be able to effect change as easily from so far away, while he studies at New York University.“I don’t really feel that happy, but rather sentimental,” he said in the brief interview. “After all the suffering for years, I don’t have those tearful moments anymore, but I do feel something inside.”He looked calm, but his hands shook as he talked about leaving a country he has tried to change from within for years.“I’m very clear what kind of role I’m playing right now,” he said. “Opportunity and risk exist at the same time.”In Washington, the State Department praised the Chinese government in a statement that reflected the United States’ handling of the case from the start: understated and nonconfrontational, despite the emotions and high stakes involved for both countries. “We also express our appreciation for the manner in which we were able to resolve this matter and to support Mr. Chen’s desire to study in the U.S. and pursue his goals,” the State Department’s spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said.Her statement referred to the complex understanding — the Chinese were loath to call it a deal — in which Mr. Chen will be allowed to attend law school on a fellowship rather than seek asylum, which the authorities in Beijing would have considered an affront. School officials said they had already stocked a faculty apartment with Chinese food and new furniture for him.His departure from Beijing — after two weeks of waiting — avoided a major embarrassment for the Obama administration, which was criticized by Chinese activists and some Republicans in Congress who accused the administration of releasing Mr. Chen too quickly into Chinese custody and, they said, seeking an expedient solution to a nettlesome problem ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s visit to China in early May. Since then, activists have been mainly supportive of the United States’ efforts to help Mr. Chen.On Saturday, Mr. Chen left Beijing with his wife and two children, and like most events surrounding his case, the departure was shrouded in secrecy. Mr. Chen and his family said they did not know they were leaving the country until several hours before the flight, and it was only on their way to the airport that they learned where they were heading. The passports they had been awaiting were delivered by Chinese officials shortly before the family got on the plane.Once on board, flight attendants promptly drew a curtain around their business class seats and barred other passengers in the cabin from using the bathroom while the plane was on the runway.Speaking by cellphone before he boarded the flight, Mr. Chen told friends that he was excited to leave China but was worried about the fate of relatives left behind. Bob Fu, president of ChinaAid, a Christian advocacy group in that championed Mr. Chen’s case, said, “He’s happy to finally have a rest after seven years of suffering, but he’s also worried they will suffer some retribution.”Mr. Chen and his family were driven directly to Beijing International Airport by employees of Chaoyang Hospital, where Mr. Chen had been treated for intestinal problems and for the foot he broke during his escape. .Mr. Chen, a self-taught lawyer blinded by childhood illness, was once toasted by the state news media for his advocacy of the disabled and the disenfranchised.But in 2005, he ran into trouble with the authorities by organizing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of thousands of women in Shandong Province who had been subjected to forced abortions and sterilizations. A year later, a local court sent him to prison for more than four years on charges that were widely seen as spurious.Although technically a free man after his release in September 2010, Mr. Chen ran up against local officials who, with the backing of provincial authorities, turned his home into a makeshift prison, with hired guards and cellphone jamming equipment.In a homemade video that was smuggled last year out of the village where he lived and posted on the Internet, Mr. Chen and his wife detailed the indignities of their detention. Local officials responded with a vicious round of beatings.The cordon of security also kept out visitors, including journalists, diplomats and freelance Chinese activists, who were violently repelled when they tried to enter the village.Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher based in for , offered tempered praise on Saturday for the Chinese government’s handling of the episode but said he would reserve further judgment until the day Mr. Chen sought to return to China.Jerome A. Cohen, a New York University law professor who helped arrange Mr. Chen’s fellowship, said he thought Beijing would be eager to blunt the domestic impact of Mr. Chen’s departure. “The last thing they want,” he said, “is for this deal to symbolize a way out of China for dissidents.”'"
"'12-05-20,'0','By the time the crowd had been led through a brief, guided meditation, and a group from Buenos Aires, the So What Project!, took the stage, people did seem ready to explode. They jumped up and down to the beat of what the band called its “rock mantras.”The two men of the So What Project!, Rodo Bustos and Nico Pucci, came up with the idea of the yoga rave five years ago because they wanted to offer their party-happy friends an alternative to the smoke, drugs and alcohol of the club scene. They held house parties at first, then moved to larger sites.“We realized that so many people want a different place, want a different orientation to have fun,” said Mr. Bustos, who is an Art of Living instructor, in a phone interview.At the Pacha event, which is part of a seven-city tour of the United States, Tom Silverman, the founder and chief executive of Tommy Boy Records, marveled that such euphoria was being produced without drugs.“They’re acting the same as they would if they’d taken a bunch of pills,” he said of the crowd.“I could see this being 10,000 to 20,000 people in Madison Square Garden,” he said. “There is no alternative like this where you can go and not drink, and still be in bed by midnight.”Actually, out in the bohemian refuge of Bushwick, Brooklyn, a group of 20-somethings recently offered a similar alternative — though on a smaller, mellower scale — to their friends in the D.I.Y. music scene.In a former welding shop that they fixed up by hand, they have opened what they call the Body Actualized Center.One of the founders, Brian Sweeny, 28, an artist and event producer, described it as “a hipster improvement center,” a place to do yoga, listen to live music, talk about New Age spirituality and generally cultivate a “healthy hedonism.”At the opening party, on a temperate evening in late March, men in ironic T-shirts and women in vintage dresses and ankle boots stood around a fire pit in the backyard, while musicians played inside. The atmosphere was wholesome, but not dogmatically so; the dinner was raw and vegetarian, but some people were drinking beer, and there was a scent of something other than fire smoke in the air.Another founder, a 26-year-old yoga instructor and artist who said her name was Angelina Dreem — “I’m going to roll with that for a while,” she said — suggested that the goal was partly to redefine post-college socializing.“We want to coexist socially with people, and in a city,” she said, but also “to be healthy and to eat well and to not have to drink all night.”“I mean, I was an alcoholic for a while,” she said. “So for me it’s like being social and being active and being creative, but being healthy and having a safe space.”On weekdays, the center offers at least four classes a day. On Sundays at 5 p.m., it hosts a Cosmic Yoga Party, featuring live music and raw food.More conventional yoga studios are also incorporating music and parties into their programs. Jivamukti Yoga School, near Union Square, hosts live shows by Bhakti Band and other groups frequently. Laughing Lotus Yoga Center, in Chelsea, holds a class every Friday from 10 p.m. to midnight that is set to either live music or a D.J. It has also started holding a monthly dance party.Still, it would be hard to capture as much of the spirit of a New Age revival as the Body Actualized Center did at its opening party. The actual yoga portion came late, around 11 p.m., by which time the main room was too crowded for anyone to do more than a very cramped downward dog. The instructor, Amy Jenkins, 24, dressed in flowing white pants and a white tank top, with glitter on her cheeks, instructed the participants, who stood in mountain pose, to run their hands over their bodies.“We never touch ourselves in public; we never breathe,” she said, wiggling as she moved her hands over her torso. Then she instructed everyone to rise up into tree pose and lift their arms above their heads.As people raised their arms in the tight space, she told the group, “If you touch someone ... touch them again!”'"
"'12-05-20,'0','Over the years he has asked me to do all variety of odd things, so I didn’t think much of it when he asked me to fetch a map of the United States. He was wrapping up a teaching in Seattle and wanted to take his time and see a bit of the country before his next engagement in New York City.That he would take the time for a vacation was a surprise and a relief to those who know him. He flies almost every week of the year, accepting as many invitations as he can to meet the needs of his students around the world. So I looked for a road map.My friend Emily, who travels with the guru wherever he goes, nudged him and said, “Aren’t you going to tell her?”“Oh yeah,” he said without looking up from his iPad. “Right.”And that’s how I found out that I would be spending the next three weeks at the wheel, a holy man at my side, all of the United States in front of me.Being asked to chauffeur was, to me, a thrilling honor like being asked to drive the president or the pope. But it was also scary, like being asked to transport someone’s kidney.I would have help. Along with Emily, there would be David, a phlegmatic retired therapist and former New York City taxi driver. When I asked him why he thought he’d been selected, he said, “Rinpoche’s going on vacation and I guess he knew I’d be pretty low maintenance since I don’t talk a lot.” My mind immediately began wheeling. Why me? I remember Rinpoche telling us that when Lord Atisha traveled to Tibet, he intentionally took along the most infuriating person he knew so there’d be plenty of opportunities for practicing patience. Am I that person?One of Buddhism’s famous sayings is: “Drive all blames into one,” which is funny when you have friends named Juan. It’s meant to point to the ego as the one root of all suffering. But in the case of our little road trip, I was the Juan. As the primary planner I would be the bearer of bad news, the target of raised eyebrows, the one responsible for tedium and sad continental breakfast options.But we started out well enough. David picked out a comfortable Chevy Traverse and I charted the first part of our journey, a four-day trip from Seattle to Boulder, Colo., my hometown, where we would stay a week. On the morning of departure, Rinpoche’s devotees came to see us off, offering him white scarves and bowing with worried looks on their faces. One approached, hugging me as she whispered, “Drive safe.”A whisper can be so loud and penetrating. It was now up to me to deliver Rinpoche, the most precious human these people know, safely to Midtown Manhattan.I collected myself and got into the driver’s seat. The Traverse was a solid gas guzzler. The doors shut with soft assurance; everyone had enough room. We waved off the devotees and headed out of the city. Rinpoche sat cross-legged in a comfortable tracksuit. When he went to Tibet a few years ago, 5,000 horsemen greeted him with the very freshest butter and yak meat. Here he was under the radar: no fanfare, no processions, no greeting parties with burning juniper, no robes.That afternoon we entered Idaho. “Everywhere in Idaho is a sweet spot,” a tourist brochure claimed, and so it was. What a beautiful state. Gliding through canyons of greenery under blue skies, stopping in a small town for pie and American coffee. Rinpoche paid some children $20 to wash the already clean Traverse. The calm that had settled over us deepened.As the sun began to set, Rinpoche finally spoke. “America has nothing to worry about,” he said. “So much natural beauty.” I felt glad that I’d chosen this slightly longer route. We sailed through towns called Tensed and Troy, making our way to Orofino, Idaho, home of the Nez Percé Indian Reservation.I picked Orofino because I thought Rinpoche would appreciate the indigenous culture of our continent for its similarities with Tibet. But Orofino was devoid of any visible evidence of the 20,000-year history of the Native American people.From my room at the Best Western I downloaded images of the Nez Percé to show Rinpoche at dinner. We drank pinot grigio and ate fine food and flipped through images of long dead medicine men. Eating arugula across the table was my own real-life wise man, and I felt a peculiar mix of hope and fear that he would look me in the eyes deliver some new instruction that would pivot my life. Maybe to finally settle down, or buy a ticket to Japan. Every moment with a lama is a precious opportunity to tap into his wisdom. But he was on vacation. There was nothing to do but wait.Yellowstone National Park was a highlight: rich colors oozing out of the earth, the scent of magma, the abundant natural resources. I felt proud to show Rinpoche this jewel of the country. “It’s like Tibet,” he said as we passed a clear blue lake. But better, I thought. We weren’t supposed to get out of the car, but we couldn’t help ourselves. I had to take a photograph of Emily posing with a bison. “What’s the difference between a bison and a buffalo?” David joked dryly. “You can’t wash your hands in a buffalo.”Rinpoche loves a dumb joke and that this crack got a good laugh out of him inspired a twinge of petty jealousy. I sulked ridiculously.I was at the wheel along a stretch of beautiful roadway connecting Montana to Wyoming when a cloud of red dust appeared before us: a rock slide, which, it soon became clear, had just deposited a gigantic boulder in the center of the road. We pulled over, and David and I climbed out to inspect. As we strained to roll the boulder off to the side of the road, other drivers pulled over but stayed in their cars to watch, windows rolled up. This dislodged piece of earth, I realized, could have been the end of us.Our next stop, Thermopolis, Wyo., was a disappointment. My inner Juan squirmed as we checked into a hotel that was seeped in stinky sulfuric fumes, right down to the sheets. But there was a pool. So we sat in our bathing suits eavesdropping on some locals talking politics — red state, blue state stuff. David went down the giant slide while I tried to act like it was an everyday thing to be sitting around half-naked alongside the lineage holder of a great ecumenical Buddhist tradition.From there we went to Boulder, where we stayed for a week so that Rinpoche could take a photography class. On our last night we went to an art opening. Rinpoche wanted to go incognito so he wore an Andy Warhol wig and a pair of yellow sunglasses as he wandered among immense landscapes painted by the artist Peter Di Gesu.From there we continued, with some calamity, to Chicago.All trips have a low point, and I believe ours took place trying to escape Toledo, Ohio. We were hungry so we consulted the GPS, which directed us off the highway, onto an overpass and down several long roads to the parking lot of a boarded-up Mexican restaurant. Tumbleweed blew past and lightening flashed on the horizon.We should have turned back, grabbed snacks and high-tailed it to Chicago. Instead we headed deeper into downtown, where the AAA guide promised refuge in a place called Georgio’s Cafe International. By the time we got there it had started to rain heavily. I leaped out to the curb only to see a spindly hand draw the curtain across the window pane of the door. Closed.The rain was coming down in fat, hard dollops. Rinpoche spotted a grim Chinese restaurant down the block and we made a run for it. There we sat on China King’s plastic chairs, soaked to the bone, eating grubby chow mein from plastic foam plates. It was no place to bring a holy man.Rinpoche’s mood never changed. It’s hard to pinpoint what that unchanging mood was. He was on vacation, he was relieved of answering hundreds of questions, guiding lives, managing, mentoring, mediating (though perhaps he was still meditating). This greasy, loveless meal seemed to please him no less nor more than the fresh river trout we had eaten days before on the banks of the Clearwater.With David at the wheel, we got back onto I-90, the rain coming harder as our bellies turned from lunch. There was at least an inch of water on the road and obvious danger; cars were moving like turtles. I was in the back seat trying not to shout, “Pull over!”Finally Rinpoche spoke up: “Maybe we should stop.” So we pulled over and waited. The tension was thick in the car as the rain pounded down. I took a photo of Rinpoche from behind; the hair on his head seemed very alert. None of us knew how long this would last.We were lucky. The rain eased and from there it was mostly straight highway, a flirtatious nod at Lake Erie, a night in Pennsylvania. We finally reached New York City in the middle of a heat wave. Rinpoche had begun yawning in long syllables — “aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa” — as we crawled through the Lincoln Tunnel.Until the last moments, until his suitcases were safely inside the hotel, I was still waiting to be the one who killed him or the one who was enlightened by him. We said goodbye, he alive and me as deluded as ever.Later, when I asked Rinpoche what the highlight of the trip was, he said, “Listening to those people talk in the pool.”'"
"'12-05-20,'0','My natural instinct is to react angrily and dismiss the hypercapitalistic arguments of Edward Conard. But as I thought about it a little bit more, I decided he should be applauded. In a country where the 1 percent seem all too content to hide behind vague and self-serving arguments, Conard openly shares opinions that he has formed after considerable thought. I may not be interested in seeing these ideas carried out to reality, but this clarity helps me better understand fiscal conservatives and their logic. If I were a politician in this battle, I would feel better equipped to bridge an ever-widening partisan gap.The story’s author, Adam Davidson, did not go far enough to explore the ramifications of Conard’s argument, which is essentially that people’s lives are better just because they can buy a Big Mac, and it doesn’t much matter if they can afford to raise a child, get her educated or get her a doctor when she is sick. There is little concern from this guy for the heartbreak of struggling to raise a child when you have to work two jobs to support her and you can’t afford to get her into activities that will keep her out of trouble. I certainly don’t see a problem with developing cheap burgers or a better way to make a soda can,but to say that that is the way to make a better life and a better country shows just how stunted the 1 percent really is. Conard’s argument is a justification for heartlessness.The United States’ rise in productivity is not translating into higher wages for the average worker, as it always has in the past. During the past decade, productivity increases have been especially steep, while the median income has declined slightly. Rising productivity is great, but why isn’t it shared? Conard says it’s because the workforce includes a lot of rifraff who have “below-average productivity” — young people, the “marginally employed,” “near-retirees,” women who will later drop out to raise children. But even if you accept Conard’s claim that these workers are less productive than average, which I’m inclined to doubt, the United States’ workforce has always included these categories of worker. And previously, when productivity went up, median income went up, too.Conard is essentially correct, but blunders in trying to make his case on the basis of benefits to the masses. Don’t apologize. Be proud of your wealth! Why is it anyone’s business how much someone makes? What right does anyone have to hate the rich, which the article’s author implies is the norm? If you don’t dream, fine. But don’t snarl like a vicious predator when someone else does.The contempt some of the ultrawealthy have for people whose goal in life isn’t to be ultrawealthy is jarring sometimes.'"

However, a new smattering of more keyed-up performers — notably the headliners Primus, as well as the dance-pop duo Mates of State, the funk-inclined instrumental rock group Sound Tribe Sector 9 and the Malian-American electric experimentalists Toubab Krewe — indicate that the festival is growing more nuanced with each passing year; gatheringofthevibes.com.INTERNATIONAL FESTIVAL OF ARTS AND IDEAS New Haven, June 16-30.

"'12-05-20,'0','The Internet is, among other things, a massive, chaotic marketplace. Too much information, it turns out, is a lot like no information. “If we researched every single purchase, we wouldn’t have time to make any purchases,” says Anna Kirmani, a marketing professor at the University of Maryland. “I have better things to do with my time.”Signaling can be a shorthand to identify whom you want to buy from. That’s why we may need it now more than ever. Hemant Bhargava, a business professor at the University of California, Davis, told me that he has been thinking about signaling as he decorates his new home. Though he is looking for good deals, he still worries about vendors outside the major brands. Bhargava recently found one chandelier for $750 on Amazon and $650 on a cheaper site. He went with Amazon. “The lower price, it bothered me,” he said, indicating that he saw the discount as a signal that the company was willing to cut every cost imaginable. He ended up paying an extra $100 for some peace of mind.Is it better to live in an economy where there’s so much chaos that we spend more to ensure our chandelier shows up unbroken or our baby formula isn’t tainted? “Oh, definitely,” Bhargava says. Sure, there’s certainly a lot of wasteful signaling, but Bhargava says that the crucial difference is that now we can each choose, purchase by purchase, moment by moment, whether we want to research a product or just trust some signal instead. After all, the chances are good that somebody else has already done the hard work of researching any product we’re interested in. “If there is a critical-enough mass of informed buyers, that is sufficient” to pressure manufacturers to make better-quality goods, Bhargava says. “That group of informed consumers creates a force. It doesn’t have to be everybody.”According to classical theories, signaling thrives when consumers don’t have access to reliable information. But signaling actually works far better in an information-rich society than in a poor one. Port-au-Prince, Haiti, for example, is filled with numerous beautiful commuter buses that are painted with all sorts of bright, bold images — of naked women, Catholic saints, voodoo symbols, soccer players, musicians. Maintaining these paint jobs is enormously expensive. The buses need to be taken out of commission for at least a couple of weeks, and the painters demand hundreds of dollars, often more than a year’s wages in Haiti.Yet bus owners feel the need to get a fresh paint job once or twice each year because few people will pay to ride an unpainted bus. The extravagant decorations suggest that an owner cares about his business — that he spends money maintaining his engines, tires and brakes (no small matter in a country with steep mountains and lousy roads). My hunch, however, is that many owners, short of cash, are likely to invest in a visible new paint job over invisible brake maintenance. With no external authority — government inspectors or consumer-watchdogs or online consumer forums — there’s no way to know if the signal is accurate.The information-rich world is obviously better for consumers, but Bhargava says that it still offers considerable advantages for producers too, as demonstrated by my baby formula and his chandelier. While online competition generally drives down commodity prices, consumers have proved willing to pay more for their favorite specialty products. And there are many of them. Back when brand signaling tended to travel through broad channels like TV ads or the sides of buses, companies narrowed their offerings. They tended toward a few bland, least-common-denominator goods, like watery beer and one kind of minty toothpaste. The Internet and advances in manufacturing now allow for a much wider range of products aimed at narrower consumer interests. I might pay more for a craft beer and a bar of deluxe chocolate, but I’ll be happier than when I was saving money buying Bud Light and a waxy Hershey’s bar.Signals, of course, can be misleading, and excessive Internet research often leads to confusion. The psychologist Barry Schwartz says he believes that many of us suffer from the paradox of choice — the more options we have, the less happy we might be. I’m not convinced it’s that simple. I feel more shopping anxiety now than I did when I just bought whatever my brand loyalty told me. But I also know I don’t have to worry about so many other purchases that I used to fret about. I just discovered that Amazon users seem to really hate Crest Pro-Health Clean Mint toothpaste. I’ll buy the better-rated one, but I do hope those ratings force Crest to reformulate or kill the one nobody likes. And I bet they will.'"
"'12-05-20,'0','Indeed, the most symbolic Dream Team moment came during the medal ceremony when Jordan draped himself in the American flag — not out of patriotism but to cover the Reebok logo on his warm-ups. Jordan, of course, endorsed Nike.When you mix ego (wanting to avenge an Olympic defeat) with capitalism (marketing a team of star players), you get compromised idealism.The Dream Team’s creation ultimately led to the atmosphere that prompted two star players to suggest last month that N.B.A. players should be paid to play in the Olympics.The Miami Heat’s Dwyane Wade, who was 10 when the Dream Team made its debut in Barcelona, and the Boston Celtics’ Ray Allen suggested that N.B.A. Olympians be compensated. The suggestion was merely an extension of the pay-for-play foundation laid by the N.B.A. and USA Basketball in 1992.This is a concept whose time has come. Actually, it is overdue.N.B.A. players have become the Olympics’ big-name ticket and marketing magnets. While gymnasts and swimmers and runners and all the rest add to the excitement, they are forgotten, barring spectacular performances, the second the events are over. Memories of the basketball players, with the next N.B.A. season mere months away, live on.“It’s a lot of things you do for the Olympics — a lot of jerseys you sell,” Wade told reporters last month. “We play the whole summer. I do think guys should be compensated.“The biggest thing is now you get no rest. So you go to the end of the season; training camp is two weeks later. You’re giving up a lot to do it. It’s something you want to do, but it’s taxing on your body. You’re not playing for the dollar. But it would be nice if you would get compensated.”USA Basketball officials attempted to minimize the issue. Jerry Colangelo, the director of USA Basketball, said: “Afterward, Dwyane recognized that really wasn’t what he meant. He didn’t want it to be a real issue because he certainly has shown his dedication. It was over within 24, 48 hours.”Mike Krzyzewski, the national team coach, told reporters: “Our guys understand the privilege of playing for our country, and serving our country in a basketball sense is a privilege we truly appreciated. There is no need for money.”Clearly, Wade and Allen disagree. For veteran N.B.A. players, being an Olympian is as much work as it is an honor. And if you lose, there is no honor.Oscar Robertson, a Basketball Hall of Famer and Olympian himself, said he thought that compensation for Olympians should definitely be on the table.Before the Dream Team, Robertson’s 1960 Olympic team had been called the best ever. They were college and amateur players, and Robertson concedes that he did not have the same view of the Olympics at 21 that he would have at 31, let alone now at 73. And the modern N.B.A. player has a firmer hand on the business of the game, including the Olympics.“It was a totally different story,” Robertson said in an interview last week. “At that time, you just wanted to play basketball. You heard about the Russians and Yugoslavians and Italians. You just wanted to go out and beat them. It was competitive.“Guys are much smarter now. They think about all these things. I’m sure that if these guys were 19 and 20 coming out of school, they would just think it’s an honor playing in the Olympics for their country. But that’s all gone now. This is why they got the Dream Team — so they wouldn’t get beaten and so they could market the team.”Asked about compensating Olympic players, Robertson said: “Does anybody get paid who’s not an athlete with the Olympics? If some of the executives get paid, then I think some of the players should be paid as well.”Colangelo and the USA Basketball board of directors are not compensated, but four executives are. According to Form 990 of USA Basketball’s 2010 tax return, Jim Tooley, the chief executive and executive director, earned $287,446; Brent Baumberger, the chief financial officer, received $184,024; Carol Callan, director of the women’s national team, received $190,941; and Sean Ford, the men’s national team director, earned $192,510. Nine top employees of the United States Olympic Committee made an average of $365,000 in 2010.“I don’t think it’s wrong for them to say, ‘Hey, maybe we should get paid,’ ” Robertson said, referring to Wade and Allen. “They only asked the question; they made a statement: ‘Maybe we should get paid.’ ”He added: “By marketing USA Basketball, they bring in a lot of money. There are a lot of people involved with the Olympic committee who travel around first class. They live great lives.”N.B.A. players live great lives, albeit short ones athletically. An N.B.A. player has only so many dribbles in a career.“If they get injured, then what happens?” Robertson said. “The players are players. Their prime source of revenue comes from playing basketball. Period. Not from running multibillion-dollar corporations. What they have is talent they can bring to the Olympics, and trying to win basketball games where the USA Basketball reaps the benefits.”The Dream Team defeated Argentina, 128-87, in a pre-Olympic tournament in 1992. Twelve years later, during the 2004 Games in Athens, Argentina won the gold medal, defeating the United States along the way.The 2004 defeat (the United States won the bronze) set off yet another alarm. Colangelo was hired and Krzyzewski was named the coach. Team U.S.A., led by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, regained the gold medal at the 2008 Games in Beijing.More than any of their peers around the world, professional basketball players in the United States are wired to correlate performance with compensation. Once USA Basketball created a Dream Team, demands for compensation were inevitable.Allen and Wade may have been the only stars publicly floating the idea of compensation, but many more were no doubt saying, “Amen.”USA Basketball and the N.B.A. created this monster. It should be their responsibility to feed it. Rather than drown out calls for compensation, the basketball hierarchy had better listen. Now it’s a whisper; soon it will become a shout.The cold war naïveté of 1960 is long gone, and the revenge-based wonderment of 1992 has vanished. Like everything else, the price of a dream has soared.'"

"'12-05-20,'0','The agency’s proposal is just part of the larger political gamesmanship, likely to intensify in coming months, over what presidents can and should do during the months between an election and inauguration.If the president adopts the agency’s recommendations this summer, they could prove politically useful for him at a time when Republicans are stepping up attacks on his administration for what they describe as overzealous regulation. The president could take some credit for having — at least ostensibly — tried to impose protections against last-minute regulations.Mr. Obama issued an executive order this month mandating that existing regulations be periodically reviewed to see whether they provide the predicted benefits at a reasonable cost. Republicans remain worried about how Mr. Obama might handle last-minute regulations if he loses the election. And not without reason: studies have shown that midnight rules are more likely when a president serves only one term.In April, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and House Speaker John A. Boehner sent a letter to Mr. Obama saying he would be “ill advised” to issue last-minute regulations that they said could distract a new Congress and potentially a new administration.“We believe that issuing a raft of midnight regulations would be inconsistent with your January 2009 commitment to transparency and accountability in the rule-making process,” they wrote.Congressional Republicans are trying to get in front of the problem. In hopes of imposing tougher rules than the Administrative Conference has proposed, they are pushing legislation that would prevent presidents from issuing most kinds of midnight regulations.Senator Ron Johnson, the Wisconsin Republican who introduced the bill in the Senate, said his aim was simply to prevent lame-duck administrations from adding what he said were burdensome regulations that are “chains on job creation” and “holding down our economy.”“I don’t think we need to increase regulation; we need to limit it,” he said. “If this administration is inclined to reform or reduce regulation, I’d like to work with them on that.”Susan E. Dudley, a member of the Administrative Conference, said she believes the recommendations are a step in the right direction because they could help agency directors resist the temptation to rush through policy changes during their final days in office.“It’s like Cinderella leaving the ball,” Ms. Dudley, who served in the Bush administration’s Office of Management and Budget and is now a professor at George Washington University, said of agency officials who try to set rules “before they turn back into ordinary citizens at noon on Jan. 20.”Among the recommendations, the agency would call for administrations to refrain from proposing new rules during a president’s final months in office, except in “emergencies,” and for Congress to authorize new administrations to delay their predecessor’s midnight rules for 60 days.The recommendations also call for departing administrations to share more information about new rules with incoming administrations, and for departing presidents to explain their timing publicly in cases where their last-minute regulations could have major economic or policy implications.The conference, which was established in 1964, conducts research and makes recommendations to the president or agencies relating to various aspects of the administrative process. It has been reviewing midnight rule making since 2010. The conference’s chairman is Paul R. Verkuil, a regulatory scholar and Obama appointee.“Midnight regulations have presented challenges, both perceived and real, for incumbent and incoming administrations since the Carter years,” Mr. Verkuil said.Jason Schwartz, legal director for the Institute for Policy Integrity at the New York University School of Law, praised the agency’s draft recommendations but warned that an overreaction to last-minute rule making can create problems of its own.He said the legislation being considered in Congress, for example, goes too far because it prevents federal agencies from not only proposing regulations during the midnight period but also approving regulations that were proposed before the midnight period.“If a rule was proposed a long time ago, and has gone through all the required analysis and public scrutiny and internal vetting, then finalizing it in the midnight period doesn’t raise concerns for us,” he said.He added that he believes the Administrative Conference’s proposal will do a better job than the legislation at addressing the real problem of midnight rule making, which is that administrations eager to get their regulations in place truncate the amount of time allotted for analysis and public comment.Other regulatory experts have complained that the legislation is biased because it would allow presidents to repeal regulations during the midnight period but not add new ones.“The bill would stop efforts to protect the public but would expedite those that would help big corporations,” said Gary Bass, a professor at Georgetown University’s Public Policy Institute. Representative Reid Ribble, a Wisconsin Republican and a sponsor of the bill in the House, rejected those criticisms.The legislation, he said, simply protects the right of an incoming president to overturn regulations from a prior administration “through the appropriate channels.”“If a rule has been in the pipeline for months or years, there is obviously some sort of controversy surrounding it,” he said.Mr. Ribble’s bill, which several Congressional staff members said has a good chance of being passed, has 11 co-sponsors.Its companion bill in the Senate, sponsored by Mr. Johnson and 35 others, has less certain prospects, these staff members said.'"
"'12-05-20,'0','But the group, whose first record came out in 1963, had a history that preceded its disco hits, starting with upbeat ditties inspired by the and the , then with lachrymose ballads like “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.”Barry, the oldest brother, was the dominant Bee Gee for most of the group’s existence. But the lead singer for many of the early hits was Robin, whose breaking voice, gaunt frame and gloomy eyes were well suited to convey adolescent fragility. “I Started a Joke” (with the second line, “Which started the whole world crying”), “I’ve Gotta Get a Message to You,” “Massachusetts” and other heavy-hearted songs brought the Bee Gees to the top of the charts as one of the British Invasion’s most musically conservative groups.“While other guys, like Ray Davies of , were writing about social problems, we were writing about emotions,” Robin Gibb told a British newspaper last year. “They were something boys didn’t write about then because it was seen as a bit soft. But people love songs that melt your heart.”Robin Hugh Gibb and his twin, Maurice, were born on Dec. 22, 1949, on the Isle of Man, a British dependency in the Irish Sea. (Barry was born there in 1946.) The boys largely grew up in , England, where the family lived on the edge of poverty. Their father, Hugh, a drummer and bandleader, encouraged his sons to sing. Their mother, Barbara, was also a singer.According to Bee Gees lore, the boys’ first performance was sometime in the mid-1950s, and unplanned. They had been scheduled to perform as a lip-synching act at a movie theater in Manchester when the record broke, forcing them to sing for real.The family moved to in 1958, and before long the brothers, performing as the Bee Gees — for Brothers Gibb — began scoring local hits and appearing on television. They left for London in early 1967 and within weeks had signed with Robert Stigwood, the impresario who guided them in their peak years.The band’s first single in , “New York Mining Disaster 1941,” was released in April 1967 and reached the Top 20.In performance, Robin and Maurice usually played second fiddle to Barry, and Robin’s taciturn manner was part of his public persona. On “The Barry Gibb Talk Show,” a recurring skit on “Saturday Night Live,” Barry, played by , would repeatedly ask Robin, played by , if he had anything to add to his talks with congressmen and justices. Robin would reply softly. “No, I don’t.”But in private Robin was far from dull. He and his wife, Dwina Murphy, who survives him, lived in a 12th-century former monastery in Oxfordshire that he had restored and filled with statues of Buddha and suits of armor. In , his mansion was open to celebrities and politicians like .Robin briefly left the group in 1969 and tried out a solo career. After he rejoined his brothers, they scored their first No. 1 in the with “How Can You Mend a Broken Heart” in 1971. But with harder rock taking over, the Bee Gees’ popularity ebbed, reaching bottom in 1974 with a series of supper-club gigs in England to pay off debts.At that point their label, Atlantic, sent the brothers to Miami for musical experimentation. There, with the 1975 album “Main Course,” they reinvented the Bee Gees’ sound with Latin and funk rhythms, electronic keyboards and vocals that owed a debt to soul. It brought the band its first hits in years: “Nights on Broadway” and “Jive Talkin’,” which went to No. 1.From there it moved further toward disco. The soundtrack to “Saturday Night Fever,” in 1977 — with “You Should Be Dancing,” “How Deep Is Your Love?,” “Stayin’ Alive” and “Night ,” all No. 1’s — became the biggest-selling album ever. (It was overtaken by ’s in 1984.)For many listeners, the Gibbs were the face of disco. Even “Sesame Street” got caught up in the trend, with Robin singing on the disco-themed album “Sesame Street Fever.” It went gold.The Bee Gees’ 1979 album, “Spirits Having Flown,” produced three more No. 1 singles, “Too Much Heaven,” “Tragedy” and “Love You Inside Out.” Then, in 1980, the band filed a $200 million lawsuit against Mr. Stigwood, saying he had swindled them out of royalties. Mr. Stigwood countersued for defamation and breach of contract. They settled out of court and publicly reconciled.In the ’80s the band’s popularity waned in the United States but remained strong abroad. Robin released three solo albums, with limited success. The Bee Gees returned with some moderate hits in the late 1990s and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. With his brothers, Mr. Gibb won six .In addition to his wife and his brother Barry, Robin Gibb is survived by his sons, Spencer and Robin-John, known as R J; his daughters, Melissa and Snow; a sister, Lesley; and his mother. An earlier marriage, to Molly Hullis, ended in divorce.Mr. Gibb had recently been working on a classical piece, “The Titanic Requiem,” with Robin-John. It had its premiere in London on April 10, played by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, but Robin was too ill to attend.Despite the Bee Gees’ close association with disco, the Gibb brothers had long insisted that they had no stake in the genre. They had simply written songs that suited their voices and caught their fancy, they said.“We always thought we were writing R&B grooves, what they called blue-eyed soul,” Robin said in 2010. “We never heard the word disco; we just wrote groove songs we could harmonize strongly to, and with great melodies.”“The fact you could dance to them,” he added, “we never thought about.”'"
"'12-05-20,'0','In an op-ed article in The Star-Ledger of Newark last month, , who resigned as New Jersey’s governor after declaring himself “a gay American,” argued that Mr. Ravi’s conviction “showed how far we have traveled from the hateful, homophobic past.”“The criminal justice system worked, this time for a gay victim,” Mr. McGreevey wrote. “But there was something disquieting about the prospect of retributive punishment being meted out on behalf of a gay young man.”Mr. McGreevey, who now counsels prisoners, argued that jail time would neither rehabilitate nor send a message. “Perhaps the long trail of gay history inevitably leads to this call for punishment,” he wrote, “but it need not.”The discussion itself is causing some gay rights advocates discomfort. Richard Kim, the executive editor of The Nation online, who wrote after Mr. Clementi’s suicide about his own experience growing up gay in New Jersey, said he was wary that expressing opposition to a prison sentence would make him appear to link hands with those who accuse gay men and lesbians of seeking “special treatment” with laws against bullying.“That’s not my argument,” Mr. Kim said. Still, he added, he does not think the verdict against Mr. Ravi was justified, and he does not think he should serve jail time.“I haven’t seen anything to convince me it has any deterrent effect,” he said.Mr. Ravi set up a webcam to spy on Mr. Clementi three weeks into their freshman year at , after Mr. Clementi asked to have the room alone so he could be with a man he had recently met on a Web site for gay men.Mr. Clementi’s suicide three days later prompted an outcry from celebrities and politicians, and pushed New Jersey to pass one of the nation’s strictest anti-bullying laws.In court, prosecutors used an extensive electronic record to show how Mr. Ravi, 20, had sent and text messages declaring that he had seen his roommate “making out with a dude,” and encouraging others to watch. The jury convicted Mr. Ravi on all 15 counts, including invasion of privacy, hate crimes and tampering with evidence after he tried to cover up his Twitter trail.Dan Savage, a gay columnist whose video campaign, “It Gets Better,” began in response to other suicides of gay teenagers just before Mr. Clementi, 18, jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, argued that simply locking up Mr. Ravi was a lost opportunity to talk about the other institutions and people “complicit” in Mr. Clementi’s death.“What was he told about being gay growing up, by his faith leaders, by the media, by the culture?” Mr. Savage said. “Ravi may have been the last person who made him feel unsafe and abused and worthless, but he couldn’t have been the first.“The rush to pin all the responsibility on Ravi and then wash our hands and walk away means we’re not going to learn the lessons of these kids.”In an essay, J. Bryan Lowder, a columnist at Slate, urged against a prison sentence: “Unfortunately, we can’t lock the bully up, because the bully is in all of us.”Mr. Lowder, 24, argued that Mr. Ravi’s remarks had to be viewed in the context of being a teenager in a culture where low-level homophobia is pervasive — whether it is high school students dismissing things not vaguely homosexual as “so gay,” or Mr. Ravi’s texts suggesting that gay men were at least a bit icky.“It’s not to say that those things don’t hurt and those things are fine,” Mr. Lowder said in an interview. “But to pin the whole weight of our culture of homophobia on Ravi and to think that sending him a message is going to fix all that is misguided.”He suggested that Mr. Ravi be sentenced to speaking about the outsize effects that small words can have.In a memo this month, the prosecutor, Julia McClure, urged that Mr. Ravi be imprisoned as a deterrent to antigay bias. She “adamantly disputed” that his was the exceptional case that should make the judge deviate from awarding him the 5- to 10-year prison sentence associated with the charges.In the memo, Ms. McClure quoted a text message, not introduced in court, that Mr. Ravi had sent to a friend the day after Mr. Clementi killed himself, arguing that it showed a lack of remorse. Mr. Ravi, who had by then left Rutgers, asked, “How can I convince my mom to let me go back Friday night and get drunk?”Mr. Ravi rejected two plea deals that would have included what his supporters are arguing for now: community service, probation and no jail time.Ms. McClure said she would not push for the maximum prison sentence. But she urged the judge, Glenn Berman, to ignore pleas from pundits.“Those opinions are largely, if not entirely, uninformed and discredit the intelligence and commitment of the citizens who were selected to serve on the jury panel,” she wrote.And many gay rights advocates have argued against leniency, to reinforce the message that Mr. Ravi’s behavior should not be written off as teenage foolishness.Suzanne B. Goldberg, a law professor at Columbia, said the sentence had to match what others would get.“Most 20-year-olds who commit serious crimes don’t get community service,” she said.Ms. Goldberg compared Mr. Ravi’s case to that of a teenager who kills someone while sending text messages and driving. “It shows the same disregard of human life and human dignity that stems in part from immaturity,” she said. “The texters are not texting with the intent of causing someone’s death, but if they cause injury or death, they are held accountable. To have them just engage in a public-service campaign against texting while driving is not what we do in our current system.”Mr. Ravi could face deportation to his native if he is given a prison sentence. Many Indians have been among his biggest supporters. At a rally on the State House steps in Trenton last week, some waved signs with the headline on Mr. McGreevey’s article: “Don’t Make Dharun Ravi Our Antigay Scapegoat.”Peter Frycki, the publisher of Out in Jersey, a magazine for gay people, said his readers had been split, with about two-thirds saying they believed that the jury had done the right thing, and one-third disagreeing. But many, he said, are arguing that Mr. Ravi should be forced to do community service against bullying, rather than serve jail time.“If he was as antigay as the prosecution made him out to be, that would be a learning lesson,” he said. “That would be something good. There’s not a lot of good in this case.”'"

"'12-05-20,'0','Then, when Pressel thought Munoz had committed a violation by touching the line of her birdie putt on the 15th hole, the L.P.G.A. did not have video or other evidence to deliver Munoz her own loss-of-hole penalty.Such a penalty would have left Munoz two holes down with three to play. Instead, she squared the match by making her putt and clinched it by winning the next two holes.There is no guarantee of how things would have played out had the rulings gone differently. But Munoz said she carried no concerns from the semifinal match into the final.“Just knowing that everything was fine was all that mattered,” she said of Pressel’s pep talk.Pressel was not available for comment after Munoz closed out Kung on the next-to-last green. But after Pressel’s 2-and-1 victory over Vicky Hurst in the third-place match, Pressel said, “I don’t have to answer that one,” when asked if the way the incidents played out was the worst thing to happen to her in golf.After Munoz and Pressel were warned about their pace on the 10th tee, Pressel was clocked taking 2 minutes 9 seconds, including 57 seconds on the tee, to play the three shots that produced a par at the 178-yard 12th, the match timer Doug Brecht said.That was 28 seconds more than the 1:41 threshold at which a player can incur a violation on a hole in which a player hits three shots, according to tour policy, although Heather Daly-Donofrio, the L.P.G.A. senior vice president for operations, said there was leeway given players in some circumstances.“It’s not an easy thing to deliver a pace-of-play penalty, particularly in a situation like this,” Daly-Donofrio, a former tour player, said of the penalty issued to Pressel on the 13th tee. “But at the end of the day, to protect the fairness of the game, we do apply the policy consistently across the field.”At the par-4 15th hole, as Munoz lined up a 15-foot birdie attempt by waving her putter over the green near the hole, Pressel told the match referee, Marty Robinson, that she thought Munoz touched the green in front of her ball.According to the Rules of Golf, touching the green along the line of the putt in front of the ball is forbidden.Robinson said Munoz told him she did not touch the line. He then reviewed video in an on-site television truck but said it was inconclusive.“I want to say I didn’t,” Munoz said when asked about touching the green, “but I can’t say 100 percent I didn’t.”Munoz made her birdie putt and closed out the match two holes later.She later won three of four holes in one midround stretch against Kung to overcome a one-hole deficit and produce a victory she called amazing.'"

"'12-05-21,'1','Indeed, the most symbolic Dream Team moment came during the medal ceremony when Jordan draped himself in the American flag — not out of patriotism but to cover the Reebok logo on his warm-ups. Jordan, of course, endorsed Nike.When you mix ego (wanting to avenge an Olympic defeat) with capitalism (marketing a team of star players), you get compromised idealism.The Dream Team’s creation ultimately led to the atmosphere that prompted two star players to suggest last month that N.B.A. players should be paid to play in the Olympics.The Miami Heat’s Dwyane Wade, who was 10 when the Dream Team made its debut in Barcelona, and the Boston Celtics’ Ray Allen suggested that N.B.A. Olympians be compensated. The suggestion was merely an extension of the pay-for-play foundation laid by the N.B.A. and USA Basketball in 1992.This is a concept whose time has come. Actually, it is overdue.N.B.A. players have become the Olympics’ big-name ticket and marketing magnets. While gymnasts and swimmers and runners and all the rest add to the excitement, they are forgotten, barring spectacular performances, the second the events are over. Memories of the basketball players, with the next N.B.A. season mere months away, live on.“It’s a lot of things you do for the Olympics — a lot of jerseys you sell,” Wade told reporters last month. “We play the whole summer. I do think guys should be compensated.“The biggest thing is now you get no rest. So you go to the end of the season; training camp is two weeks later. You’re giving up a lot to do it. It’s something you want to do, but it’s taxing on your body. You’re not playing for the dollar. But it would be nice if you would get compensated.”USA Basketball officials attempted to minimize the issue. Jerry Colangelo, the director of USA Basketball, said: “Afterward, Dwyane recognized that really wasn’t what he meant. He didn’t want it to be a real issue because he certainly has shown his dedication. It was over within 24, 48 hours.”Mike Krzyzewski, the national team coach, told reporters: “Our guys understand the privilege of playing for our country, and serving our country in a basketball sense is a privilege we truly appreciated. There is no need for money.”Clearly, Wade and Allen disagree. For veteran N.B.A. players, being an Olympian is as much work as it is an honor. And if you lose, there is no honor.Oscar Robertson, a Basketball Hall of Famer and Olympian himself, said he thought that compensation for Olympians should definitely be on the table.Before the Dream Team, Robertson’s 1960 Olympic team had been called the best ever. They were college and amateur players, and Robertson concedes that he did not have the same view of the Olympics at 21 that he would have at 31, let alone now at 73. And the modern N.B.A. player has a firmer hand on the business of the game, including the Olympics.“It was a totally different story,” Robertson said in an interview last week. “At that time, you just wanted to play basketball. You heard about the Russians and Yugoslavians and Italians. You just wanted to go out and beat them. It was competitive.“Guys are much smarter now. They think about all these things. I’m sure that if these guys were 19 and 20 coming out of school, they would just think it’s an honor playing in the Olympics for their country. But that’s all gone now. This is why they got the Dream Team — so they wouldn’t get beaten and so they could market the team.”Asked about compensating Olympic players, Robertson said: “Does anybody get paid who’s not an athlete with the Olympics? If some of the executives get paid, then I think some of the players should be paid as well.”Colangelo and the USA Basketball board of directors are not compensated, but four executives are. According to Form 990 of USA Basketball’s 2010 tax return, Jim Tooley, the chief executive and executive director, earned $287,446; Brent Baumberger, the chief financial officer, received $184,024; Carol Callan, director of the women’s national team, received $190,941; and Sean Ford, the men’s national team director, earned $192,510. Nine top employees of the United States Olympic Committee made an average of $365,000 in 2010.“I don’t think it’s wrong for them to say, ‘Hey, maybe we should get paid,’ ” Robertson said, referring to Wade and Allen. “They only asked the question; they made a statement: ‘Maybe we should get paid.’ ”He added: “By marketing USA Basketball, they bring in a lot of money. There are a lot of people involved with the Olympic committee who travel around first class. They live great lives.”N.B.A. players live great lives, albeit short ones athletically. An N.B.A. player has only so many dribbles in a career.“If they get injured, then what happens?” Robertson said. “The players are players. Their prime source of revenue comes from playing basketball. Period. Not from running multibillion-dollar corporations. What they have is talent they can bring to the Olympics, and trying to win basketball games where the USA Basketball reaps the benefits.”The Dream Team defeated Argentina, 128-87, in a pre-Olympic tournament in 1992. Twelve years later, during the 2004 Games in Athens, Argentina won the gold medal, defeating the United States along the way.The 2004 defeat (the United States won the bronze) set off yet another alarm. Colangelo was hired and Krzyzewski was named the coach. Team U.S.A., led by Kobe Bryant and LeBron James, regained the gold medal at the 2008 Games in Beijing.More than any of their peers around the world, professional basketball players in the United States are wired to correlate performance with compensation. Once USA Basketball created a Dream Team, demands for compensation were inevitable.Allen and Wade may have been the only stars publicly floating the idea of compensation, but many more were no doubt saying, “Amen.”USA Basketball and the N.B.A. created this monster. It should be their responsibility to feed it. Rather than drown out calls for compensation, the basketball hierarchy had better listen. Now it’s a whisper; soon it will become a shout.The cold war naïveté of 1960 is long gone, and the revenge-based wonderment of 1992 has vanished. Like everything else, the price of a dream has soared.'"
"'12-05-21,'1','Then, when Pressel thought Munoz had committed a violation by touching the line of her birdie putt on the 15th hole, the L.P.G.A. did not have video or other evidence to deliver Munoz her own loss-of-hole penalty.Such a penalty would have left Munoz two holes down with three to play. Instead, she squared the match by making her putt and clinched it by winning the next two holes.There is no guarantee of how things would have played out had the rulings gone differently. But Munoz said she carried no concerns from the semifinal match into the final.“Just knowing that everything was fine was all that mattered,” she said of Pressel’s pep talk.Pressel was not available for comment after Munoz closed out Kung on the next-to-last green. But after Pressel’s 2-and-1 victory over Vicky Hurst in the third-place match, Pressel said, “I don’t have to answer that one,” when asked if the way the incidents played out was the worst thing to happen to her in golf.After Munoz and Pressel were warned about their pace on the 10th tee, Pressel was clocked taking 2 minutes 9 seconds, including 57 seconds on the tee, to play the three shots that produced a par at the 178-yard 12th, the match timer Doug Brecht said.That was 28 seconds more than the 1:41 threshold at which a player can incur a violation on a hole in which a player hits three shots, according to tour policy, although Heather Daly-Donofrio, the L.P.G.A. senior vice president for operations, said there was leeway given players in some circumstances.“It’s not an easy thing to deliver a pace-of-play penalty, particularly in a situation like this,” Daly-Donofrio, a former tour player, said of the penalty issued to Pressel on the 13th tee. “But at the end of the day, to protect the fairness of the game, we do apply the policy consistently across the field.”At the par-4 15th hole, as Munoz lined up a 15-foot birdie attempt by waving her putter over the green near the hole, Pressel told the match referee, Marty Robinson, that she thought Munoz touched the green in front of her ball.According to the Rules of Golf, touching the green along the line of the putt in front of the ball is forbidden.Robinson said Munoz told him she did not touch the line. He then reviewed video in an on-site television truck but said it was inconclusive.“I want to say I didn’t,” Munoz said when asked about touching the green, “but I can’t say 100 percent I didn’t.”Munoz made her birdie putt and closed out the match two holes later.She later won three of four holes in one midround stretch against Kung to overcome a one-hole deficit and produce a victory she called amazing.'"
"'12-05-21,'1','Still, many attendees readily conceded that the Internet played a big role in their lives.Shlomo Cohen, 24, of Toronto, said he used the Internet for shopping, business and staying in touch with friends — “Everyone needs e-mail,” he said.Mr. Cohen said he came to Citi Field on Sunday because the rally was a good way to remind his community to keep temptation at bay.“Desires are out there,” Mr. Cohen said, adding that men could be particularly susceptible. “We have to learn how to control ourselves.”For an event billed as taking aim at the Internet, signs of the digital age seemed to pop up everywhere.On a No. 7 train headed toward the stadium, several men wearing the clothing of the ultra-Orthodox whipped out smartphones as soon as the subway emerged from the East River tunnel, poking at e-mail in-boxes and checking voice mail messages.Several opponents of the rally gathered outside the stadium, including a crowd that stood by police barricades holding signs that read, “The Internet Is Not the Problem.”Many of the protesters said they shared the religious beliefs of the attendees but wanted to show support for victims of child sexual abuse, some of whom in ultra-Orthodox communities have been discouraged from calling the police and have been shunned after the crimes against them were reported.The rally in Citi Field on Sunday was sponsored by a rabbinical group, Ichud Hakehillos Letohar Hamachane, that is linked to a nonprofit organization that provides advice and technical support to people seeking to filter the Internet. Those in attendance were handed fliers that advertised services like a “kosher GPS App” for iPhone and Android phones, which helps users locate synagogues and kosher restaurants.Nat Levy, 25, who traveled from Lakewood, N.J., to attend, said he frequently surfed the Web at a cafe, overseen by a local rabbi, that filtered out certain types of online content and monitored which Web sites he visited.He said he often used the Internet to deal with customers for his company. “You get to do business the same way,” he said. “I have unlimited access, but it’s done in a kosher manner.”Eytan Kobre, a spokesman for the event, delivered a more intense message to reporters outside the stadium. “The siren song of the Internet entices us!” he pronounced in a booming voice. “It brings out the worst of us!”Still, Mr. Kobre confirmed that the event would be broadcast live on the Internet, via a stream available to homes and synagogues in Orthodox communities around the New York area. He said the general public would not be able to gain access, but several unauthorized streams appeared soon after the rally began.The rally was also a hot topic on many Twitter feeds on Sunday evening.The gathering had the feel of a gigantic family reunion — or perhaps, given the single-sex attendance, the religious version of a scouts’ jamboree — but many guests had arrived with only a friend or two.“It may look like a community because we all look the same,” said Mr. Cohen, of Toronto. “But I don’t know almost any of the people here.”For some attendees, the dangers of the Internet seemed more in line with the usual complaints voiced by any New Yorker tethered to a BlackBerry or besieged with Twitter messages.Raphael Hess, 29, of New Jersey, pointed at his LG phone and said he found peace in simply keeping its Internet connection turned off.“Life is more pleasant without it sometimes,” he said with a shrug.'"
"'12-05-21,'1','In an op-ed article in The Star-Ledger of Newark last month, , who resigned as New Jersey’s governor after declaring himself “a gay American,” argued that Mr. Ravi’s conviction “showed how far we have traveled from the hateful, homophobic past.”“The criminal justice system worked, this time for a gay victim,” Mr. McGreevey wrote. “But there was something disquieting about the prospect of retributive punishment being meted out on behalf of a gay young man.”Mr. McGreevey, who now counsels prisoners, argued that jail time would neither rehabilitate nor send a message. “Perhaps the long trail of gay history inevitably leads to this call for punishment,” he wrote, “but it need not.”The discussion itself is causing some gay rights advocates discomfort. Richard Kim, the executive editor of The Nation online, who wrote after Mr. Clementi’s suicide about his own experience growing up gay in New Jersey, said he was wary that expressing opposition to a prison sentence would make him appear to link hands with those who accuse gay men and lesbians of seeking “special treatment” with laws against bullying.“That’s not my argument,” Mr. Kim said. Still, he added, he does not think the verdict against Mr. Ravi was justified, and he does not think he should serve jail time.“I haven’t seen anything to convince me it has any deterrent effect,” he said.Mr. Ravi set up a webcam to spy on Mr. Clementi three weeks into their freshman year at , after Mr. Clementi asked to have the room alone so he could be with a man he had recently met on a Web site for gay men.Mr. Clementi’s suicide three days later prompted an outcry from celebrities and politicians, and pushed New Jersey to pass one of the nation’s strictest anti-bullying laws.In court, prosecutors used an extensive electronic record to show how Mr. Ravi, 20, had sent and text messages declaring that he had seen his roommate “making out with a dude,” and encouraging others to watch. The jury convicted Mr. Ravi on all 15 counts, including invasion of privacy, hate crimes and tampering with evidence after he tried to cover up his Twitter trail.Dan Savage, a gay columnist whose video campaign, “It Gets Better,” began in response to other suicides of gay teenagers just before Mr. Clementi, 18, jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, argued that simply locking up Mr. Ravi was a lost opportunity to talk about the other institutions and people “complicit” in Mr. Clementi’s death.“What was he told about being gay growing up, by his faith leaders, by the media, by the culture?” Mr. Savage said. “Ravi may have been the last person who made him feel unsafe and abused and worthless, but he couldn’t have been the first.“The rush to pin all the responsibility on Ravi and then wash our hands and walk away means we’re not going to learn the lessons of these kids.”In an essay, J. Bryan Lowder, a columnist at Slate, urged against a prison sentence: “Unfortunately, we can’t lock the bully up, because the bully is in all of us.”Mr. Lowder, 24, argued that Mr. Ravi’s remarks had to be viewed in the context of being a teenager in a culture where low-level homophobia is pervasive — whether it is high school students dismissing things not vaguely homosexual as “so gay,” or Mr. Ravi’s texts suggesting that gay men were at least a bit icky.“It’s not to say that those things don’t hurt and those things are fine,” Mr. Lowder said in an interview. “But to pin the whole weight of our culture of homophobia on Ravi and to think that sending him a message is going to fix all that is misguided.”He suggested that Mr. Ravi be sentenced to speaking about the outsize effects that small words can have.In a memo this month, the prosecutor, Julia McClure, urged that Mr. Ravi be imprisoned as a deterrent to antigay bias. She “adamantly disputed” that his was the exceptional case that should make the judge deviate from awarding him the 5- to 10-year prison sentence associated with the charges.In the memo, Ms. McClure quoted a text message, not introduced in court, that Mr. Ravi had sent to a friend the day after Mr. Clementi killed himself, arguing that it showed a lack of remorse. Mr. Ravi, who had by then left Rutgers, asked, “How can I convince my mom to let me go back Friday night and get drunk?”Mr. Ravi rejected two plea deals that would have included what his supporters are arguing for now: community service, probation and no jail time.Ms. McClure said she would not push for the maximum prison sentence. But she urged the judge, Glenn Berman, to ignore pleas from pundits.“Those opinions are largely, if not entirely, uninformed and discredit the intelligence and commitment of the citizens who were selected to serve on the jury panel,” she wrote.And many gay rights advocates have argued against leniency, to reinforce the message that Mr. Ravi’s behavior should not be written off as teenage foolishness.Suzanne B. Goldberg, a law professor at Columbia, said the sentence had to match what others would get.“Most 20-year-olds who commit serious crimes don’t get community service,” she said.Ms. Goldberg compared Mr. Ravi’s case to that of a teenager who kills someone while sending text messages and driving. “It shows the same disregard of human life and human dignity that stems in part from immaturity,” she said. “The texters are not texting with the intent of causing someone’s death, but if they cause injury or death, they are held accountable. To have them just engage in a public-service campaign against texting while driving is not what we do in our current system.”Mr. Ravi could face deportation to his native if he is given a prison sentence. Many Indians have been among his biggest supporters. At a rally on the State House steps in Trenton last week, some waved signs with the headline on Mr. McGreevey’s article: “Don’t Make Dharun Ravi Our Antigay Scapegoat.”Peter Frycki, the publisher of Out in Jersey, a magazine for gay people, said his readers had been split, with about two-thirds saying they believed that the jury had done the right thing, and one-third disagreeing. But many, he said, are arguing that Mr. Ravi should be forced to do community service against bullying, rather than serve jail time.“If he was as antigay as the prosecution made him out to be, that would be a learning lesson,” he said. “That would be something good. There’s not a lot of good in this case.”'"
"'12-05-21,'1','“When NATO extended the invitation, we thought it would move the Pakistanis off the dime,” said a senior American official, adding that without the deal, it would be “really uncomfortable” for Mr. Zardari at the summit. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the negotiations.Mr. Obama did, however, begin the summit meeting with another leader with whom he has had a prickly relationship, President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. The two leaders met on Sunday morning, fresh off Mr. Obama’s unannounced trip to Kabul this month to sign a strategic partnership agreement with Mr. Karzai that set the terms for relations after the departure of American troops in 2014.Mr. Karzai and Mr. Obama, whose relationship has been alternately awkward or tense, have been presenting a more unified front than they have in the past.“I want to express my appreciation for the hard work that President Karzai has done,” Mr. Obama said after their meeting, standing next to the Afghan leader. “He recognizes the enormous sacrifices American troops have made.”Mr. Karzai, for his part, said he would work to make sure that Afghanistan was not a “burden on the shoulders of our friends” in the world.But overshadowing the summit meeting was the issue of restarting the supply routes through Pakistan. American officials said the main sticking point was the amount NATO would pay for each truck carrying supplies from Karachi, on Pakistan’s Arabian Sea coast, to the Afghan border. Before the closure, the cost per truck was about $250. Pakistan is now asking for “upward of $5,000,” another American official said.Pakistan was also seeking an indemnity waiver in case American cargo was damaged, as well as more money to repair road damage caused by the heavy trucks traveling Pakistani highways.“We’re not anticipating necessarily closing out those negotiations this weekend,” Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser, said on Saturday evening during a briefing with reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Chicago. He said the White House believed a deal would eventually be reached, but declined to say when it could be expected.“It’s our sense that both sides want to get it done, it will get done,” he said. “But right now, we’re in a process of negotiation about how exactly that’s going to happen.”Pakistan’s ambassador to the United States, Sherry Rehman, expressed similar sentiments in an interview with CNN on Friday, saying “there has been some movement forward.”Ms. Rehman also said it was a sign of “good tidings” that Pakistan had allowed a few trucks to carry supplies to the American Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, late last week.But the senior American official said Saturday that such public displays by Pakistan were not credible in the face of a seeming inability to make the deal happen, and was only further exasperating American officials who had believed they were on the brink of breaking the six-month impasse, the official said.Pakistan had been seeking an unconditional apology from the United States for the fatal airstrike in November. But as it became clear that no direct apology would be forthcoming, Pakistan’s civilian and military leaders decided last week to increase their financial demands for reopening the supply routes, one Pakistani official said. A member of Mr. Zardari’s political party said the government, facing the prospect of a political backlash and protests over reopening the routes, was hoping that a rich deal with the United States would cool tempers at home, and give the president political breathing space.“We cannot allow our opponents to gain political mileage on this issue when the next general elections are approaching,” said the politician, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue. Elections are due next year in Pakistan.American officials said Washington’s renewed push to reopen the routes was being driven in large part by the accelerating drawdown of forces from Afghanistan, which will begin in earnest after the NATO meeting.American officials hope that restoring the supply lines through Pakistan will help bring down costs and alleviate pressure on a northern route through Central Asia that has been developed over the past few years. The northern route allows the NATO-led coalition to work around the closed Pakistani routes. Even remote bases have remained well-stocked with the little extras that during previous Pakistani closings were usually the first things to become scarce, like soft drinks and snack food and a steady supply of gym equipment.But American officials said they are uncomfortable with relying on a single supply route. That was the reason they developed the northern alternative. They would ideally like to have both the northern option and the southern approaches available as the withdrawal picks up pace in the coming months.The coalition does not need the supply lines “to be open to support the campaign,” Gen. John R. Allen of the Marines was quoted as saying in an interview Sunday with Reuters.“But they’re helpful to us in sending home our equipment,” Gen. Allen said. “We don’t want an agreement fast, we want an agreement that’s right. So we’re going to take the time to get it right.”'"
"'12-05-21,'1','HONG KONG — Premier Wen Jiabao is calling for Chinese economic policies to tilt a little more toward fostering growth, official media reported on Monday, in the latest sign of concern in China about a faltering in the country’s economic expansion.Speaking during a weekend trip to Wuhan in south-central China, Mr. Wen mostly endorsed existing policies but also indicated a new willingness to countenance economic stimulus.“We should continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy while giving more priority to maintaining growth,” Mr. Wen said, according to the official Xinhua news agency.In April, industrial production in China slackened to its slowest growth in nearly two years, fixed-asset investment grew at its weakest pace in nearly a decade and imports practically stopped growing, all signs of eroding confidence in the business environment. But Chinese officials have said before that they would make sure economic growth at least meets their minimum target of 7.5 percent.Jing Ulrich, the chairwoman of China markets at JPMorgan Chase, said that the comments made it likely that China would reduce two or three more times this year the minimum reserves that banks must set aside as protection, leaving banks with more cash available to lend. “Premier Wen’s comments indicate we are likely to see further monetary easing in the coming months,” she wrote in an e-mail.'"
"'12-05-21,'1','Only $77,158 separates the prices for the Ruth jersey and the Naismith rules, two very different historical pieces. A Ruth artifact made of paper — the six-page sale contract that sent him to the Yankees from the Boston Red Sox in late 1919 — was bought for $996,000 seven years ago.Ruth is central to the modern sports memorabilia marketplace even if he predated car shows and QVC appearances. He revolutionized baseball with his power, his charisma and his Rabelaisian appetites. Everything about him suggested that he was his own reality show.It is almost as if Ruth is still alive and preparing to compete in the July 4 hot dog eating contest in Coney Island. He is still a sports icon. And while he signed innumerable balls during his career and until he died in 1948, there are few of his game-used bats, caps or uniforms in existence.“This is the holy grail of sports memorabilia,” said David Kohler, the president of SCP Auctions, which sold the 1920 Ruth jersey to Lelands, another auction house, which plans to resell it to a private buyer for what its president said would be another record. Kohler added, “This is the finest authenticated jersey — and the best piece of sports memorabilia — we’ve ever sold.”How much Ruth wore the jersey cannot be answered. But there was no memorabilia market for him to enrich himself by selling his uniforms. Chris Ivy, the director of sports auctions at Heritage Auctions, said: “The common belief is that players had two road and two home jerseys. They’d wear one, while the other was sent to the laundry. And they’d use the past season’s uniforms during spring training.”At some point in Ruth’s flannel annals, his pants took a walk, leaving the more valuable jersey behind. Dunbar said the woolen legwear might have fetched another $100,000.Michael Heffner, the president of Lelands, said that despite the uncertain economy, buyers were willing to pay seemingly absurd amounts for the best memorabilia. In the art world, where the numbers are even more breathtaking, one of the four copies of the Edvard Munch masterpiece, “The Scream,” sold for $119.9 million. Heffner said he would rather have the jersey to display.“The closer you get to the player, the more the value of the piece,” he said. “The bat is worth so much. The cap is worth so much. But the jersey he wore, well, they retire the jersey. Not the bat.”Still, a size 7‹ Ruth cap owned by the former Yankees pitcher David Wells performed as if it were a Ruth bat Sunday at SCP’s auction. Wells paid $35,000 for the 1930s-era cap and wore it in the first inning of a game in 1997. It sold for $537,278 — more than a 1927-28 Ruth bat, which fetched $491,007.The search is on, of course, for the next great Ruth artifact, if it exists.“It would be great to find one of his Boston Red Sox uniforms,” Kohler said.'"
"'12-05-21,'1','But despite misgivings about the subject matter — the books tell the tale of a dominant-submissive affair between a manipulative millionaire and a naïve younger woman — library officials feel that they need to make it available.“This is the ‘Lady Chatterley’s Lover’ of 2012,” Mr. Cole said. “Demand is a big issue with us, because we want to be able to provide popular best-selling material to our patrons.”But some libraries have been caught on the other side of the issue. The Brevard County Public Library in east central Florida pulled copies of the books from its shelves after library officials decided they were not appropriate for the public.“We have criteria that we use, and in this case we view this as pornographic material,” said Don Walker, a spokesman for the Brevard County government.In Fond du Lac, Wis., the library did not order any copies, saying the books did not meet the standards of the community. In Georgia the Gwinnett County Public Library, near Atlanta, declined to make the books available in its 15 branches, saying that the trilogy’s graphic writing violated its no-erotica policy.Last week a group of organizations that included the National Coalition Against Censorship formally responded, sending a letter to the library board in Brevard County scolding it for refusing to stock the book alongside standards like “Tropic of Cancer” or “Fear of Flying.”“There is no rational basis to provide access to erotic novels like these, and at the same time exclude contemporary fiction with similar content,” the letter said. “The very act of rejecting erotica as a category suitable for public libraries sends an unmistakable message of condemnation that is moralistic in tone, and totally inappropriate in a public institution dedicated to serving the needs and interests of all members of the community.”Joan Bertin, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship, said in an interview that it was unusual for a library to remove a book from its section for adults.“The vast majority of cases that we deal with have to do with removing books to keep kids from seeing them,” she said. “That’s what makes this so egregious. There are some possible arguments for trying to keep kids away from certain kinds of content, but in the case of adults, other than the restrictions on obscenity and child pornography, there’s simply no excuse. This is really very much against the norms in the profession.”Vintage, which is part of Random House, said in a statement, “Random House fervently opposes literary censorship and supports the First Amendment rights of readers to make their own reading choices. We believe the Brevard County Public Library System is indulging in an act of censorship, and essentially is saying to library patrons: We will judge what you can read.”Decisions about which books to stock tend to rest in the hands of local library officials, calculations based on what patrons are asking for and how much money a library system has to spend.The number of patrons waiting in line for “Fifty Shades of Grey” is extraordinary, higher than the usual demand for the latest John Grisham or Danielle Steel novel, library officials say.And the line is getting longer every week. At the Cuyahoga County Public Library in Ohio, a system that includes Cleveland, 454 holds were placed on the book in early April; last week there were 1,399.Robert J. Rua, an official with the Cuyahoga library, said they had bought 539 copies of the trilogy’s first book. There is no section for erotic fiction in the library, he said, so “Fifty Shades” has been placed among the other trade books for adults.Paul Bogaards, a spokesman for Vintage Books, declined to provide a current sales figure for the trilogy, but said millions had sold so far.Marcee Challener, the manager of materials and circulation services for the Tampa-Hillsborough County Public Libraries, said that library officials there carefully considered the book before ordering it, but ultimately decided that it was no different from one of the paranormal romances featuring vampires that have been popular for years.“There’s sex and eroticism in many well-written literary novels,” she said. “It’s part of the human experience.”But Ken Hall, the library director in Fond du Lac, said he would rather spend precious library funds on books that had literary or artistic value.Since the library publicly announced that it would not stock the book, he has been hounded by insults, with some people calling him a useless bureaucrat. But he said he had also received numerous compliments from residents urging him not to back down.“With this type of book, we will get somebody questioning our decision no matter what decision we make,” Mr. Hall said. “We live in an age where people don’t like to talk about gray areas. No pun intended.”'"
"'12-05-21,'1','Eastman Kodak lost a ruling in a two-year legal fight against Apple and Research in Motion over a patent for digital image-preview technology. The decision may hurt the value of assets Kodak is selling.RIM and Apple did not violate Kodak’s rights because the patent was invalid, said Thomas Pender, a judge for the United States International Trade Commission, in a notice posted on the agency’s Web site. Kodak said it would appeal the findings with the six-member commission in Washington, which has the power to block imports of products that infringe on American patents.Kodak, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January, contends Apple already owes it more than $1 billion in damages for infringement of this and other digital capture patents, according to a bankruptcy court filing this month. Kodak has said a victory in the case may force RIM and Apple to pay for licensing and bolster the value of patent portfolios the company is seeking to sell.The judge’s recommendation “represents a preliminary step in a process that we are confident will conclude in Kodak’s favor,” Timothy Lynch, Kodak’s chief intellectual property officer, said in a statement. “Kodak has invested billions of dollars to develop its pioneering digital imaging technology, and we intend to protect these valuable assets.”The company’s two digital patent portfolios may be its most valuable assets. The patent in Monday’s ruling is part of a portfolio of more than 1,100 related to digital capture that Kodak is selling. The other collection covers imaging systems and services.Together, the technology is valued at $2.21 billion to $2.57 billion, based on an estimate by 284 Partners L.L.C., a patent advisory firm cited in a debtor’s motion it filed before a United States bankruptcy court in January.'"

It was issued after an Federal Trade Commission complaint two years ago, contending that Pom Wonderful had engaged in false and misleading advertising,“The greater weight of the persuasive expert testimony demonstrates that there is insufficient competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate claims that the Pom products treat, prevent or reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction or that they are clinically proven to do so,” D.

"'12-05-22,'0','HONG KONG — Premier Wen Jiabao is calling for Chinese economic policies to tilt a little more toward fostering growth, official media reported on Monday, in the latest sign of concern in China about a faltering in the country’s economic expansion.Speaking during a weekend trip to Wuhan in south-central China, Mr. Wen mostly endorsed existing policies but also indicated a new willingness to countenance economic stimulus.“We should continue to implement a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy while giving more priority to maintaining growth,” Mr. Wen said, according to the official Xinhua news agency.In April, industrial production in China slackened to its slowest growth in nearly two years, fixed-asset investment grew at its weakest pace in nearly a decade and imports practically stopped growing, all signs of eroding confidence in the business environment.

"'12-05-22,'0','Then it fell for most of April and May, declining to about $530 on Friday, partly because of concern among investors that phone companies will tire of subsidizing the expensive phones to sell to customers.But Apple’s gain of $30.90 on Monday to $561.28, its second-largest increase this year, occurred after several analysts said they expected the iPhone business to continue to do well.Facebook, which struggled Friday to remain above $38 a share, its initial public offering price, fell $4.20 on Monday, to $34.03.The stock market’s strength on Monday was welcome relief after a month in which investors were concerned about Greece, which failed to elect a new government two weeks ago and is close to leaving the euro.Investors are growing more worried that the European debt problems “might not be as manageable as they previously believed,” said Clark Yingst, chief market analyst for the investment banking firm Joseph Gunnar in New York. “Today’s rally has nothing to do with what is evolving around Greece.”Investors desperate for good news took consolation in weekend statements from Premier Wen Jiabao of China, who promised to increase his country’s growth, a shift from previous talk that focused on curbing inflation.The drumbeat of bad news about Europe continued, but Apple helped investors shrug it off. The weekend’s Group of 8 meeting of world leaders brought only an ambiguous conclusion, producing promises to pursue growth in Europe but few concrete plans on how.“I wish I could say the coast is clear,” said Katherine Nixon, chief investment officer for Northern Trust’s personal financial services unit in Chicago. But, she said, “the G-8 didn’t really solve anything.”Caterpillar, which relies heavily on demand from China, climbed 3.7 percent to $91.98, for only its fourth gain in May.Several big financial institutions, including Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, declined. Bank stocks tend to fall when investors are concerned about Europe because of the banks’ investments there. JPMorgan Chase, still smarting from an embarrassing trading loss, fell 2.9 percent to $32.51 after announcing that it would halt plans to buy back its stock.Major stock indexes in France and Germany rose, but those in Greece and Spain fell.Monday was the Dow’s first gain after six consecutive days of losses, and only its third day of gains this month.

The month has wiped out nearly three-fourths of the Dow’s first-quarter gains.In the bond market, the price of the Treasury’s 10-year note fell 6/32, to 100 2/32, while its yield rose to 1.74 percent, from 1.72 percent late Friday.'"
"'12-05-22,'0','A private prison for illegal immigrants in Mississippi remained on lockdown Tuesday after a violent outbreak on Sunday that ended with the death of a guard and 20 people injured.The F.B.I. was investigating what caused as many as 300 inmates to riot with broomsticks and other makeshift weapons at the prison, the Adams County Correctional Center, in Natchez.A gang fight grew into a prisonwide riot that lasted eight hours before armed guards retook control, Sheriff Chuck Mayfield of Adams County said. Inmates took more than 20 prison workers hostage. They started a fire in the prison yard. And they attacked a guard, Catlin Carithers, 24, who later died from blunt head trauma, officials said.All 2,542 of the prison’s inmates are immigrants, from more than 70 countries, who are serving time for felonies before they are deported, said Steve Owen, a spokesman for the private company that operates the prison, the Corrections Corporation of America, of Nashville. The inmates were classified as low risk, Mr. Owen said.“There’s a risk with any prison population,” he said. “You always have to be vigilant.”The company is the nation’s largest private prison contractor, with 75,000 inmates at 44 centers. This is the second time in its 30 years that an employee has been killed by an inmate, the company said. Seventeen prison employees and three inmates were injured and hospitalized in the riot.Representative Bennie G. Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, on Tuesday called for an investigation into the company, saying the riot “brings into question the effectiveness of privately owned and operated prison facilities.”'"
"'12-05-22,'0','In Sharqiya, an Islamist stronghold, some place blame for the crime wave on “a lack of religious awareness,” said Mahmoud al Herawy, 51, a member of the ultraconservative Al Nour Party who supports the liberal Islamist candidate . But crime victims, like Mohamed Ibrahim Yousseff, 63, often pine for the perceived security of the Mubarak era.Three months ago, Mr. Yousseff saw his son Mahmoud, 29, killed, and another son, Abdullah, 24, crippled when carjackers opened fire with shotguns. A mob of villagers avenged the death by killing and incinerating one of the suspected attackers.Mr. Yousseff said he would vote for Mr. Shafik, who served as Mr. Mubarak’s last prime minister. “He is a military man who has been raised on discipline,” Mr. Yousseff said, explaining his support for Mr. Shafik.“It is becoming the culture of the Egyptian countryside to confront thuggery with thuggery, to take matters into our own hands,” he lamented.Some say Egyptian police officers know only two extremes: the excessive brutality they used to employ, or the timid approach they have taken since the revolution.Others contend that the lack of effective law enforcement is a grand conspiracy to spread nostalgia for the ousted authoritarian government. Said Sadek, a sociology professor at the , argued that the internal security forces had, in effect, gone on an undeclared strike in protest against their public indictment for the repression of the past.“The Ministry of Interior is trying to punish the people,” he said. “ ‘You want a revolution? Enjoy!’ ”Though he said the hysteria was exaggerated, Mr. Sadek acknowledged that he drove with his car doors carefully locked. “A number of my friends had their cars stolen and never recovered.”Even Egypt’s best-known politicians have fallen victim to crime. In the last year, the independent presidential candidate Abdel Moneim Aboul Fotouh; the ’s parliamentary leader, Mohamed Beltagy; and the liberal political organizer Amr Hamzawy have all been attacked by armed men on or near Cairo’s ring road. Mr. Aboul Fotouh lost his car and ended up in the hospital, Mr. Beltagy lost his car, and Mr. Hamzawy’s girlfriend, an actress, was briefly kidnapped.Amani El Sharkawi, 25, an English teacher, recalled a cab ride that ended abruptly when her driver saw men with chains and weapons stopping cars on a deserted stretch ahead; the driver threw the car into reverse and drove backward down the highway. “Can you imagine that?” she said.One evening about two months ago, Rena Effendi, 35, a photographer, entered a cab with a licensed driver in one of Cairo’s wealthiest neighborhoods — as she had done countless times without a thought before. But the driver diverted the car; locking the doors, he pulled a knife and tried to her. She fought back until he just took her handbag and left her.On Monday, Ms. Effendi said that the police later showed her a suspect who turned out to be using her stolen cellphone with a different SIM card. But they had made no progress in identifying the driver. “It tells me that if they want to find him they could,” she said. “I don’t know if they are looking very hard.”Sayid Fathy Mohamed, 32, a cabdriver himself, said he was robbed in broad daylight by two knife-wielding passengers and two accomplices with shotguns who pulled up alongside on a motorcycle. They took his car, cellphone and wallet and left him bloody in a field. But the police showed little interest. “They were scared of coming with me to the location of the incident,” Mr. Mohamed said.So he called his cellphone and eventually negotiated a ransom of about $2,000 for the return of the cab. “People back in my neighborhood collected the money,” he said. “I paid the money and took the car on the spot.”In Sharqiya, the recent revenge killings began about four months ago in the village of Haryet Razna. Witnesses said Hazem Farrag, 28, stepped outside his family’s storefront auto supply store one night to help defend the young driver of a motorized cart known as a tuktuk from a threatening passenger.The passenger shot and killed Mr. Farrag, witnesses said, and a mob of villagers beat to death both the passenger and a relative who they said tried to defend him. Then the villagers strung their nearly naked bodies from a lamppost and filmed the spectacle.“It was disgraceful,” said Mr. Herawy, 51, an Arabic teacher who said he found the bodies the next morning. “That is not the way to enforce the law.”Mr. Yousseff, of the village Ezbet el Tamanin, said his sons were shot in February as they tried to intercede in the carjacking of a cousin. They had just left the funeral of another cousin, who was killed in a carjacking just two days before, he said.“Should we surrender them to the police so they can release him in two hours?” he asked, defending the mob’s killing of one of the suspects. The police have brought no charges against any of the vigilantes. Other communities are banding together to demand law enforcement. Residents of the village of Abu Hammad said the police were initially slow to respond after burglars robbed the home of Hussein Abu Khisha, 50, and kidnapped two children from his family — Ibrahim, 10, and Kareem, 7.The villagers closed down the main road through town, cutting off traffic. After two days, Mr. Abu Khisha said, the army sent tanks to break up the protests, and after six days the police finally traced the kidnappers’ cellphone to find his children.Now he has decorated his yard with posters of Mr. Moussa, the former foreign minister who is running as a secular champion of law and order.The Islamists, often jailed under Mr. Mubarak, just want revenge against the police, Mr. Abu Khisha argued. “They insult the police and talk about all the things they will do to them,” he said. “When you are sick like this, you go to a specialized doctor. You don’t go to a beginner.”'"
"'12-05-22,'0','Dell, the personal computer maker, forecast second-quarter revenue on Tuesday that fell short of analysts’ estimates as businesses held off on buying personal computers and smartphones and tablets ate into the company’s sales.The company also reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that missed Wall Street’s expectations.Dell said its revenue for its fiscal second quarter ending in July would total $14.7 billion to $15 billion. Analysts had been projecting revenue of $15.4 billion according to a survey by Bloomberg News.“In my own interactions with larger customers, we are seeing a delay and a pause in spending activity,” Michael S.

Its revenue fell 4 percent, to $14.4 billion, below analysts’ average estimate of $14.9 billion.

"'12-05-22,'0','WASHINGTON — The economy could relapse into a recession if President Obama and Congress remain at an impasse and allow several big tax increases and spending cuts to take effect at the start of 2013, the Congressional Budget Office reported on Tuesday.The nonpartisan budget office analyzed the impact of what has come to be called the year-end fiscal cliff. Largely by coincidence, several big tax cuts, including those from the Bush era, will expire as deep across-the-board spending cuts take effect. Many economists say the jolt of tax increases and spending cuts would shock the economy after four years of stimulus measures.In the first half of 2013, the economy would contract at an annual rate of 1.3 percent, the report concluded, instead of growing by a similar rate. Slow growth would resume in the second half, it said.“Such a contraction in output in the first half of 2013 would probably be judged to be a recession,” the report said.Avoiding that danger in the short run, by extending tax cuts and repealing automatic spending cuts, would hold its own economic perils for the long term by adding to annual deficits, the budget office said. It suggested a combination of higher deficits in the short term with adoption of tax and spending policies meant to gradually reduce annual deficits later in the decade.'"
"'12-05-22,'0','Mr. Amano’s upbeat assessment, coming on top of recent optimistic signals from Western diplomats, suggested that Iran’s chief negotiator, Saeed Jalili, was signaling Iran’s sincerity in talks with the six powers — the United States, , , Germany, and — on a more wide-ranging deal to bring Iran back into compliance with Security Council resolutions and ensure that Iran is not trying to build a nuclear weapon.The most immediate goal of the Baghdad talks for the six appears to be to get an agreement by Tehran to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent purity — near the level required for a nuclear weapon — and to discuss exporting its stockpile of uranium enriched to that level. And the six want to be sure Iran is doing more than public relations and is prepared to move quickly to take concrete steps to calm global and regional concerns.The Baghdad talks were expected to get under way about noon, with a plenary session where the six powers will present a detailed proposal to Iran on concrete confidence-building steps and hear an Iranian presentation before a break for lunch and more discussions, said a senior Western official, who requested anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks.The official cautioned that an I.A.E.A. agreement with Iran on how to proceed to settle outstanding issues from the past would be good news but would take time to turn into action. The agency, the official said, is trying to get a picture of Iran’s past program, but the Baghdad negotiations are about divining Iran’s intentions and bringing the country into full compliance. “These are two separate processes,” the official said.The White House welcomed Mr. Amano’s announcement with caution. “It’s an agreement in principle that represents a step in the right direction,” said , the White House press secretary. “But as we’ve said in the past about the totality of Iran’s obligations and their fulfillment of them, we will make judgments about Iran’s behavior based on actions, not just promises or agreements.”Even Mr. Amano said the talks had not yet produced an agreement on how the I.A.E.A. could conduct the inspections and interviews it demands. “There remain some differences,” Mr. Amano said, but he noted that Mr. Jalili had told him that those differences “will not be the obstacle to reaching agreement.”In past meetings with the six, Mr. Jalili has argued that Iran’s compliance with the I.A.E.A. meant that sanctions should be lifted. That may be an argument he renews Wednesday.Iran’s state-run news media noted that no deal had been made so far with Mr. Amano, and focused instead on what the government has portrayed as steady Iranian advances in nuclear and rocket technology. Iran state television said scientists had successfully loaded uranium fuel into a medical isotope reactor on Tuesday, and the Islamic Republic News Agency said Iran would launch a satellite on Wednesday with an upgraded model of its Safir 2 rocket. The United States and its allies have expressed concern that such a rocket could be altered to carry a warhead.The negotiations with Iran on its nuclear program so far have been talks about talks. In Baghdad, American and European officials hope to begin the talks themselves — to start negotiating about what Iran must do to ease global concerns that it is developing a nuclear weapon, and then proceed through a series of detailed meetings and negotiations over the next few months.Iranian officials are eager for the , the United States, the European Union and their allies to lift economic sanctions that are clearly hurting Tehran. But Western officials have emphasized in recent days that any removal of sanctions — or postponement of sanctions on oil exports that take effect July 1 — will require concrete action by Iran of the kind that the Baghdad meeting alone is unlikely to yield.If the Baghdad talks produce progress, American officials have said, they are prepared to offer some easing of existing restrictions on the imports of airplane parts, technical assistance to Iran’s lagging energy industry, help with nuclear safety and even counternarcotics, or firm statements of Iran’s right under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to a peaceful nuclear program so long as it meets international safeguards.But if the sanctions are a prime reason for Iran to negotiate seriously, Western officials said, they must not be removed prematurely. Even more, they argue, the impending embargo on Iran’s oil exports is another incentive for Iran to grapple seriously with the problem and not play for time.A senior European diplomat who was not authorized to discuss the talks publicly said Iran’s uranium enrichment to 20 percent purity is a particular concern, since the stockpile reduces considerably the “breakout” period should Iran decide to assemble a nuclear weapon. It represents an especially delicate issue for Israel, which has said that it would act militarily, if necessary, to stop Iran from building a nuclear weapon.The Israeli defense minister, , reacted skeptically to Mr. Amano’s talk of an agreement. “It appears that the Iranians are trying to attain a technical agreement to create the illusion of progress in the talks, in order to relieve some of the pressure ahead of tomorrow’s discussions in Baghdad and to push back at the sharpening sanctions,” Mr. Barak said in an e-mailed statement. “Israel believes that Iran must be placed in an unequivocally clear position where there won’t be any window or crack for it to advance toward .”'"
"'12-05-22,'0','Given that the series has been on TV since 2002, Ms. Sanchez “probably can’t remember a world without ‘American Idol,’ ” said Jeff Alexander, who dutifully recaps the show each week as M. Giant for the Web site Television Without Pity. “She’s trained to be on the show since she was 5, and it’s like watching somebody who was grown in a vat for this purpose.”Some might say the same about Mr. Phillips, a Dave Matthews sound-alike who follows in the footsteps of the past four winners, Scotty McCreery, Lee DeWyze, Kris Allen and David Cook. Online odds-makers say Mr. Phillips is favored to win, but some social-media analysis companies say Ms. Sanchez, a powerhouse singer who idolizes Beyoncé, is more popular among online commenters. Fox has been paying close attention to the social-media chatter this season, and it says the millions of comments affirm that “Idol” remains the most culturally relevant show on television.But the ultimate judge remains the Nielsen ratings. Last year, when “Idol” rebounded slightly from lows that were a record in 2010, a typical episode garnered 24.7 million viewers, excluding the finale week. Of those viewers, 10.8 million were between the ages of 18 and 49. Compare that with this year, when a typical episode has attracted about 19.2 million viewers, 7.5 million of whom are in that same demographic.“The Voice,” which benefited from a post-Super Bowl premiere, came close to tying “Idol” in that demographic, with 7.2 million on a typical night. And ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars” came close among total viewers, with 18.3 million on dancing nights, and 16 million on results nights.This is something new for “Idol”: true competition. Peter Rice, chairman of the Fox Networks Group, said in an interview that the ratings decline for “Idol” was a surprise at first, but, “in hindsight, when you look at it, it became a much more crowded space.”Though “The Voice,” with its trademark red revolving judges’ chairs, was shown earlier in the week than “Idol,” the two still competed for attention and DVR space. Nigel Lythgoe, an executive producer of “Idol,” cited “The Voice” when he was asked to explain the ratings drop last week. “It’s never been like this before,” he said.Mr. Lythgoe also cited “The X Factor,” the rival singing competition created by Simon Cowell that had its premiere on Fox last fall. Presumably some viewers feel committed to “The X Factor” and Mr. Cowell instead of “Idol.” Fox had little choice but to broadcast “The X Factor”; Mr. Cowell would have taken it to another network if Fox had not bought it. “The X Factor” helped to juice Fox’s fall lineup last year, and it’s almost impossible to know what effect it has had on “Idol” this spring.For now “Idol” remains No. 1 after 11 seasons, an accomplishment even rival network executives note with awe. But it will have to fight to stay there. “The X Factor,” with two new judges in Britney Spears and Demi Lovato, will rival “The Voice” again in the fall, leading to even more concern that viewers will tire of the star-search format.Jess Cagle, managing editor of Entertainment Weekly, said he had seen evidence of “Idol” fatigue in the magazine’s sales and Web traffic. “While the show still does solid numbers for us online, it’s no longer the juggernaut it once was,” Mr. Cagle said. Online page views for “Idol” coverage this season are about half of what they were in 2010, he said.So cue the talk of changes to “Idol,” just as there was a few years ago when the show’s ratings started slipping. There is speculation that one “Idol” judge, Jennifer Lopez, will leave the show after this season, speculation aided by Ms. Lopez, who has said she has not decided whether to return. Fox has declined to comment.Chase Carey, the chief operating officer of Fox’s parent, News Corporation, reminded investors early this month that “Idol” was “a big, valuable franchise and makes a lot of money.” He added, “We certainly think we’ve got a lot of life left in it.” But this year, he suggested, the producers “probably didn’t do enough” to make the show feel fresh.They will do more next season, Mr. Lythgoe told reporters last week, though he had already ruled out one change: “I’ve rejected the revolving chairs.”'"
"'12-05-22,'0','EMMONAK, Alaska — There are no roads that lead to this tiny fishing village 500 miles west of Anchorage, no doctor and a single state trooper, who is also responsible for patrolling a dozen other far-flung Yup’ik Eskimo hamlets along the coast of the Bering Sea. The nearest village, Alakanuk, is eight miles away.For a woman who has been sexually assaulted, options for help or escape are limited.There is a boat, but it comes only during the short summers, when ice on the Kuskokwim and Yukon Rivers finally melts. Flights to Anchorage are not direct and happen only if the weather cooperates, which it often does not. Last winter, more than 80 inches of snow fell here.

"'12-05-22,'0','“This is a country of shopaholics,” said Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail group at Douglas Elliman, who is handling inquiries from retailers in , and about opening in this country.Overseas companies are looking to the American market because of relatively easy access to , fewer regulations than some other countries, cheaper rents because of the recession and the promise of getting Wall Street’s attention, she said. And many shoppers here like the panache of clothing from abroad.“It’s a fickle market here — the consumer always wants something new,” Ms. Consolo said.Uniqlo is drawing particular attention because it has succeeded in selling basic and affordable clothing, a category that American companies like Gap and Old Navy once dominated. But it failed in a previous effort to expand into American shopping malls. In 2006, it closed stores in three malls in it had opened in 2005.This time, company officials said, they have learned from their mistakes — most notably, a recognition that the Uniqlo (pronounced YOU-nee-klo) brand needed a bigger introduction in the United States. Last time, the retailer leased standard-size mall locations — about 7,000 square feet each — that did not distinguish the brand from competitors. The new Garden State Plaza space, by contrast, is 43,000 square feet, and it has external exposure, meaning Uniqlo’s signs can be seen from a nearby highway and the mall’s parking lot.“Our brand is still not a household name, so we need a bigger box than some of our competitors,” said Shin Odake, the chief executive of Uniqlo’s United States division.Well saturated in , Uniqlo is now posting most of its growth overseas. Fast Retailing, the Uniqlo parent company based in , said sales in Uniqlo’s international division grew 68 percent to 84.8 billion yen ($1.07 billion) in the first half of its fiscal year, from September to February. Profits increased 45 percent to 11.4 billion yen for non-Japan stores in that period.Uniqlo posted a loss at its United States stores for that period, but analysts say the region is crucial for the company’s growth.“They need to have a competitive positioning in the world’s largest market,” said Masafumi Shoda, an analyst at Nomura Securities, in an e-mail.Unlike other low-priced international brands, like Zara, H&M and , which rush fashionable items into stores weeks after trends are seen on runways, Uniqlo’s clothes are simple. There is “a strong emphasis on fabrication,” said Faye Landes, a retail analyst with Consumer Edge Research.Uniqlo is best known for its solid and striped basics like T-shirts, shorts and cashmere sweaters, available in a wide spectrum of colors. Uniqlo emphasizes high-tech fabric, for example, in a moisture-wicking T-shirt it sells in summer. And prices are low — T-shirts start at $9.90, and cashmere sweaters at $79.90.Yasunobu Kyogoku, chief operating officer for Uniqlo’s United States division, said the company was able to get prices that low because it did not change its merchandise plans based on the latest fashion fad. Instead, it books factory capacity in advance, and produces garments at a steady pace year-round, rather than rushing to produce trendy items from specialty factories.“Typically in retail there’s a seasonality to the products you sell and therefore a seasonality to factories — when they’re running at full capacity and when they’re not,” Mr. Kyogoku said. “To be able to balance out, over 365 days a year, full capacity, you’re able to create more efficiencies.”After retreating from its last foray into American malls, Uniqlo took a different approach, opening a store in New York’s high-traffic SoHo district in 2006 and adding two more stores in New York last year, on 34th Street and on Fifth Avenue. The stores, filled with spinning mannequins and steel and white décor, serve in part as an advertisement for Uniqlo.And the company almost quadrupled its spending on advertising in the United States in 2011 versus 2010, to $8.3 million, according to Kantar Media, with ads pushing its prices. With the promotions started, Uniqlo executives said it was time to re-enter malls.“If you have just another store in a shopping mall, there’s no reason for a customer to buy at your store because we are selling clothes, and it is not so much different from the clothes that other people are selling,” Mr. Odake said. “So unless the customer knows about your brand or what the company stands for, there is no reason for the customer to shop at your store.”To hit the company’s stated target of $10 billion in sales in the United States by , “we need to go where the customer is, and in the United States, malls are the premier location where Americans shop,” Mr. Kyogoku said. The Uniqlo executives declined to discuss specifics about the expansion plans, beyond saying they also included stores in other big American cities. The company is also working on an e-commerce site in the United States, the executives said.“Even though I think it may be too early to go to mall locations,” Mr. Shoda, the retail analyst, said, the company “needs actual trials in there.”'"
"'12-05-22,'0','The ethnic changes at CUNY’s top colleges confirm the predictions made during the battle over ending open admissions, one of the city’s most charged political disputes of the 1990s: Proponents said the colleges would rise in status, while opponents said black and Hispanic enrollment would fall.“We’re not condemning CUNY; we just don’t think they’ve taken into account the long-term effects of what’s happening,” said David R. Jones, the president and chief executive of the , an antipoverty group, which has just completed a study of the changes. “If you’re taking a lower percentage of blacks and Latinos out of high school, you should try to make sure this doesn’t continue.”The CUNY chancellor, , said enrollment changes among first-time freshmen were a concern, but he noted that transfer students had outnumbered first-time freshmen at the five top-tier colleges for the past three years. The racial and ethnic mix has shifted among transfer students, as well, but not as drastically, according to CUNY figures.Where students end up matters more than where they start, Dr. Goldstein said, adding, “We are graduating more black and Hispanic students than we ever have before.”Across the country, the most selective public colleges have been growing more so for decades, with many of them seeing a notable shift in the past few years. The share of entering freshmen who were in the top 10 percent of their high school classes rose to 73 percent last fall from 69 percent in 2007 at the University of Texas at Austin, to 57 percent from 49 percent at and to 80 percent from 76 percent at the at , to name a few.“There is plenty of evidence that our flagship public universities have been growing more selective for 30 years, with a decided uptick in this recession,” said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.Whether there has been a resulting demographic change is unclear, because most colleges have changed the way they record racial data, and in some states, new laws banning affirmative action have influenced enrollment.With 12 senior colleges, 6 , several graduate schools and about 260,000 students in degree-granting programs, CUNY is one of the largest systems in the country. Unlike most public and private universities, its admissions are race-blind, based entirely on grades and test scores.Tuition for the next school year will be $5,430 for a resident who is a full-time student at a four-year college, one of the lowest prices in the country. Considering the charged debate that surrounded the decisions to establish and then to abolish open admissions, the greatest surprise may be how little political noise the results have generated.For almost 30 years, beginning in 1970, CUNY admitted any high school graduate to at least one of its colleges, though that meant admitting many who needed remedial courses. Enrollment surged, graduation rates dropped, and more high-achieving students went elsewhere.Pressed by Mayor , CUNY’s senior colleges stopped accepting students who needed remedial work, and generally required applicants to meet minimum standards for SAT scores and other measures.Dr. Goldstein said the system’s increased use of transfer enrollment had been a success, with those students performing as well at the top-tier colleges as their peers who started there. A typical transfer student does not have good enough high school credentials to win acceptance directly to the most selective colleges, but is admitted after a successful term at a community college or a less-competitive senior college. The ethnic changes at those colleges have been less pronounced than at the top five.But Lazar Treschan, the director of youth policy at the Community Service Society and an author of the report, said that transfer students typically received one or two years’ benefit from a top college, rather than four, and that there were still far too few students making the jump from community colleges to four-year institutions.“Saying ‘we’ll let in more black and Hispanic students, but only after they’ve already had a couple of years of success in college’ really skews what we mean by opportunity and diversity,” he said.The changes at CUNY mimic, to some extent, changes in the city’s top public high schools, which admit students solely on the basis of an entrance exam and have become steadily more Asian and less black in recent years. The shift is evident in the faces at in , where the enrollment is almost half Asian and about 10 percent black, a regular topic of discussion, said David Mayomi, 33, a black student who studies international business and lives in Brooklyn.“This is our city, and we represent a large part of the community, but we represent a small percentage of the people here,” he said, questioning whether the college gave preferential treatment to Asians.Another student, Joyce Chan, 21, said that when Asian students chose to attend a CUNY college, their parents often pushed for Baruch because of its specialty, business education. A graduate of the whose parents are immigrants, Ms. Chan was initially accepted into Baruch’s honors program, which offered her a free computer, an and a travel stipend, in addition to complimentary tuition, she said. But a recent F grade in a math class forced her to withdraw from it.“Our parents want us to have jobs that are stable,” said Ms. Chan, who is majoring in public affairs. “They want us to have jobs that are better than what they have. Business and medicine and law are stable.”At another four-year college, the , a number of students said it had not been their first choice of a CUNY campus.“It was actually, like, my third,” said Brian Mercedes, 20, a junior from Manhattan who is studying criminal justice. He said he was one of several students he knew in high school who wanted to go to Baruch but did not get in.Students at Baruch and John Jay said they had been warned in high school that CUNY colleges, particularly the top tier, had become more selective.“The SAT scores for all of these schools are going up, but I was still pretty surprised I didn’t get into Hunter,” said Charles Cooper, 19, who is from Manhattan and is an economics major at John Jay. He said he might transfer to a more selective college.He said he had been accepted to several private colleges, but “this is the best deal out there, and who wants to take out at our age?”'"

Inmates took more than 20 prison workers hostage. They started a fire in the prison yard. And they attacked a guard, Catlin Carithers, 24, who later died from blunt head trauma, officials said.All 2,542 of the prison’s inmates are immigrants, from more than 70 countries, who are serving time for felonies before they are deported, said Steve Owen, a spokesman for the private company that operates the prison, the Corrections Corporation of America, of Nashville. The inmates were classified as low risk, Mr. Owen said.“There’s a risk with any prison population,” he said. “You always have to be vigilant.”The company is the nation’s largest private prison contractor, with 75,000 inmates at 44 centers.

Seventeen prison employees and three inmates were injured and hospitalized in the riot.Representative Bennie G.

"'12-05-23,'0','A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has dismissed a challenge to a $3.4 billion settlement between the federal government and hundreds of thousands of Native Americans whose land trust royalties were mismanaged by the Interior Department. The judges said Tuesday that the deal Congress approved in 2010 was fair and was the best that could be hoped for without more years of litigation. Kimberly Craven of Boulder, Colo., had objected to the settlement, saying that it did not account for how much money was lost and that some beneficiaries would be overcompensated. The deal is the result of a class-action lawsuit filed in 1996.'"
"'12-05-23,'0','The ethnic changes at CUNY’s top colleges confirm the predictions made during the battle over ending open admissions, one of the city’s most charged political disputes of the 1990s: Proponents said the colleges would rise in status, while opponents said black and Hispanic enrollment would fall.“We’re not condemning CUNY; we just don’t think they’ve taken into account the long-term effects of what’s happening,” said David R. Jones, the president and chief executive of the , an antipoverty group, which has just completed a study of the changes. “If you’re taking a lower percentage of blacks and Latinos out of high school, you should try to make sure this doesn’t continue.”The CUNY chancellor, , said enrollment changes among first-time freshmen were a concern, but he noted that transfer students had outnumbered first-time freshmen at the five top-tier colleges for the past three years. The racial and ethnic mix has shifted among transfer students, as well, but not as drastically, according to CUNY figures.Where students end up matters more than where they start, Dr. Goldstein said, adding, “We are graduating more black and Hispanic students than we ever have before.”Across the country, the most selective public colleges have been growing more so for decades, with many of them seeing a notable shift in the past few years. The share of entering freshmen who were in the top 10 percent of their high school classes rose to 73 percent last fall from 69 percent in 2007 at the University of Texas at Austin, to 57 percent from 49 percent at and to 80 percent from 76 percent at the at , to name a few.“There is plenty of evidence that our flagship public universities have been growing more selective for 30 years, with a decided uptick in this recession,” said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.Whether there has been a resulting demographic change is unclear, because most colleges have changed the way they record racial data, and in some states, new laws banning affirmative action have influenced enrollment.With 12 senior colleges, 6 , several graduate schools and about 260,000 students in degree-granting programs, CUNY is one of the largest systems in the country. Unlike most public and private universities, its admissions are race-blind, based entirely on grades and test scores.Tuition for the next school year will be $5,430 for a resident who is a full-time student at a four-year college, one of the lowest prices in the country. Considering the charged debate that surrounded the decisions to establish and then to abolish open admissions, the greatest surprise may be how little political noise the results have generated.For almost 30 years, beginning in 1970, CUNY admitted any high school graduate to at least one of its colleges, though that meant admitting many who needed remedial courses. Enrollment surged, graduation rates dropped, and more high-achieving students went elsewhere.Pressed by Mayor , CUNY’s senior colleges stopped accepting students who needed remedial work, and generally required applicants to meet minimum standards for SAT scores and other measures.Dr. Goldstein said the system’s increased use of transfer enrollment had been a success, with those students performing as well at the top-tier colleges as their peers who started there. A typical transfer student does not have good enough high school credentials to win acceptance directly to the most selective colleges, but is admitted after a successful term at a community college or a less-competitive senior college. The ethnic changes at those colleges have been less pronounced than at the top five.But Lazar Treschan, the director of youth policy at the Community Service Society and an author of the report, said that transfer students typically received one or two years’ benefit from a top college, rather than four, and that there were still far too few students making the jump from community colleges to four-year institutions.“Saying ‘we’ll let in more black and Hispanic students, but only after they’ve already had a couple of years of success in college’ really skews what we mean by opportunity and diversity,” he said.The changes at CUNY mimic, to some extent, changes in the city’s top public high schools, which admit students solely on the basis of an entrance exam and have become steadily more Asian and less black in recent years. The shift is evident in the faces at in , where the enrollment is almost half Asian and about 10 percent black, a regular topic of discussion, said David Mayomi, 33, a black student who studies international business and lives in Brooklyn.“This is our city, and we represent a large part of the community, but we represent a small percentage of the people here,” he said, questioning whether the college gave preferential treatment to Asians.Another student, Joyce Chan, 21, said that when Asian students chose to attend a CUNY college, their parents often pushed for Baruch because of its specialty, business education. A graduate of the whose parents are immigrants, Ms. Chan was initially accepted into Baruch’s honors program, which offered her a free computer, an and a travel stipend, in addition to complimentary tuition, she said. But a recent F grade in a math class forced her to withdraw from it.“Our parents want us to have jobs that are stable,” said Ms. Chan, who is majoring in public affairs. “They want us to have jobs that are better than what they have. Business and medicine and law are stable.”At another four-year college, the , a number of students said it had not been their first choice of a CUNY campus.“It was actually, like, my third,” said Brian Mercedes, 20, a junior from Manhattan who is studying criminal justice. He said he was one of several students he knew in high school who wanted to go to Baruch but did not get in.Students at Baruch and John Jay said they had been warned in high school that CUNY colleges, particularly the top tier, had become more selective.“The SAT scores for all of these schools are going up, but I was still pretty surprised I didn’t get into Hunter,” said Charles Cooper, 19, who is from Manhattan and is an economics major at John Jay. He said he might transfer to a more selective college.He said he had been accepted to several private colleges, but “this is the best deal out there, and who wants to take out at our age?”'"
"'12-05-23,'0','WASHINGTON — The economy could relapse into a recession if President Obama and Congress remain at an impasse and allow several big tax increases and spending cuts to take effect at the start of 2013, the Congressional Budget Office reported on Tuesday.The nonpartisan budget office analyzed the impact of what has come to be called the year-end fiscal cliff. Largely by coincidence, several big tax cuts, including those from the Bush era, will expire as deep across-the-board spending cuts take effect. Many economists say the jolt of tax increases and spending cuts would shock the economy after four years of stimulus measures.In the first half of 2013, the economy would contract at an annual rate of 1.3 percent, the report concluded, instead of growing by a similar rate. Slow growth would resume in the second half, it said.“Such a contraction in output in the first half of 2013 would probably be judged to be a recession,” the report said.Avoiding that danger in the short run, by extending tax cuts and repealing automatic spending cuts, would hold its own economic perils for the long term by adding to annual deficits, the budget office said. It suggested a combination of higher deficits in the short term with adoption of tax and spending policies meant to gradually reduce annual deficits later in the decade.'"
"'12-05-23,'0','Given that the series has been on TV since 2002, Ms. Sanchez “probably can’t remember a world without ‘American Idol,’ ” said Jeff Alexander, who dutifully recaps the show each week as M. Giant for the Web site Television Without Pity. “She’s trained to be on the show since she was 5, and it’s like watching somebody who was grown in a vat for this purpose.”Some might say the same about Mr. Phillips, a Dave Matthews sound-alike who follows in the footsteps of the past four winners, Scotty McCreery, Lee DeWyze, Kris Allen and David Cook. Online odds-makers say Mr. Phillips is favored to win, but some social-media analysis companies say Ms. Sanchez, a powerhouse singer who idolizes Beyoncé, is more popular among online commenters. Fox has been paying close attention to the social-media chatter this season, and it says the millions of comments affirm that “Idol” remains the most culturally relevant show on television.But the ultimate judge remains the Nielsen ratings. Last year, when “Idol” rebounded slightly from lows that were a record in 2010, a typical episode garnered 24.7 million viewers, excluding the finale week. Of those viewers, 10.8 million were between the ages of 18 and 49. Compare that with this year, when a typical episode has attracted about 19.2 million viewers, 7.5 million of whom are in that same demographic.“The Voice,” which benefited from a post-Super Bowl premiere, came close to tying “Idol” in that demographic, with 7.2 million on a typical night. And ABC’s “Dancing With the Stars” came close among total viewers, with 18.3 million on dancing nights, and 16 million on results nights.This is something new for “Idol”: true competition. Peter Rice, chairman of the Fox Networks Group, said in an interview that the ratings decline for “Idol” was a surprise at first, but, “in hindsight, when you look at it, it became a much more crowded space.”Though “The Voice,” with its trademark red revolving judges’ chairs, was shown earlier in the week than “Idol,” the two still competed for attention and DVR space. Nigel Lythgoe, an executive producer of “Idol,” cited “The Voice” when he was asked to explain the ratings drop last week. “It’s never been like this before,” he said.Mr. Lythgoe also cited “The X Factor,” the rival singing competition created by Simon Cowell that had its premiere on Fox last fall. Presumably some viewers feel committed to “The X Factor” and Mr. Cowell instead of “Idol.” Fox had little choice but to broadcast “The X Factor”; Mr. Cowell would have taken it to another network if Fox had not bought it. “The X Factor” helped to juice Fox’s fall lineup last year, and it’s almost impossible to know what effect it has had on “Idol” this spring.For now “Idol” remains No. 1 after 11 seasons, an accomplishment even rival network executives note with awe. But it will have to fight to stay there. “The X Factor,” with two new judges in Britney Spears and Demi Lovato, will rival “The Voice” again in the fall, leading to even more concern that viewers will tire of the star-search format.Jess Cagle, managing editor of Entertainment Weekly, said he had seen evidence of “Idol” fatigue in the magazine’s sales and Web traffic. “While the show still does solid numbers for us online, it’s no longer the juggernaut it once was,” Mr. Cagle said. Online page views for “Idol” coverage this season are about half of what they were in 2010, he said.So cue the talk of changes to “Idol,” just as there was a few years ago when the show’s ratings started slipping. There is speculation that one “Idol” judge, Jennifer Lopez, will leave the show after this season, speculation aided by Ms. Lopez, who has said she has not decided whether to return. Fox has declined to comment.Chase Carey, the chief operating officer of Fox’s parent, News Corporation, reminded investors early this month that “Idol” was “a big, valuable franchise and makes a lot of money.” He added, “We certainly think we’ve got a lot of life left in it.” But this year, he suggested, the producers “probably didn’t do enough” to make the show feel fresh.They will do more next season, Mr. Lythgoe told reporters last week, though he had already ruled out one change: “I’ve rejected the revolving chairs.”'"
"'12-05-23,'0','But these days, few people are taking chances.Big tourism operators like TUI of Germany and Kuoni of Britain are demanding the addition of so-called drachma clauses to contracts with Greek hoteliers should the euro no longer be in use here. British newspapers are filled with advice columns for travelers worried about the wisdom of planning a vacation in Greece, or even Portugal and Spain, should the euro crisis worsen. Large multinational companies like Vodafone Group, Reckitt Benckiser and Diageo have taken to sweeping cash every day from euro accounts back to Britain to limit their exposure.But coming up with a Plan B is proving difficult for Greek businesses, especially smaller ones. There are so many unknowns involved that many of them cannot even conceive of how they would cope. Economists say the drachma would be devalued by an estimated 50 to 70 percent compared with the euro.“How do you prepare for the apocalypse?” asked Dimitrios Manolis, the owner of AlfaSolid, a small company that makes design software. He has had to whittle his staff of six engineers down to two, as firms he did business with have collapsed amid a credit squeeze. “If Greece leaves the euro, there will be no work for me,” he said.Dimitris Mamoglu, the owner of a fine-jewelry store near Syntagma Square, said small businesses had “absolutely no plans” to handle a return to the drachma. “Nobody can calculate how much money or time it would take to change over,” he said.Tens of thousands of Greek businesses could collapse from one day to the next, said Constantine Mihalos, the president of the Athens Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Around 85 percent of Greek companies employ fewer than 10 people, and many are already near bankruptcy as the Greek economy nose-dives and bank credit dries up.With a devalued currency, inflation would rise rapidly, and Greek companies would struggle to pay the euro-denominated bills of their suppliers. Trade with other countries would slow sharply for a while, as suppliers halted deliveries, further crippling Greek businesses that depend heavily on imports.Even large Greek exporters that might benefit from a devalued currency are opposed to a return to the drachma, fearing damage to the country’s image as a place to do business.The troubled Greek banking system, which is already running on fumes, would face a serious run as depositors pulled their funds. An estimated 72 billion euros, or about $91 billion, has already left Greek banks since the crisis first broke open three years ago. In the days after this month’s elections, more than 700 million euros, worth about $890 million, were pulled, a pattern that Greek bankers expect to continue until greater political and economic certainty is restored.The International Monetary Fund estimates that a Greek exit from the euro would lop more than 10 percent from Greece’s gross domestic product for at least the first year after a return to the drachma.After that, the thinking goes, a new dawn would break, as the weakened Greek currency lowers the cost of Greek labor and products like olive oil. As was the case in Argentina, businesses and consumers in other countries would eventually start buying Greek goods and services once they improved in value.That may help the tourism industry as vacationers come seeking bargains. But hopes of a broader export-led recovery may be little more than a chimera, said Mr. Mihalos, the chamber of commerce president.Aside from shipbuilding, most of Greece’s industrial base has eroded in the 30 years since the government nationalized large areas of industry. Wealth-generating businesses diminished, and tens of thousands of laid-off workers were absorbed by the state to reduce unemployment.Today, Greek exports of manufactured products account for only 10 percent of gross domestic product, compared with a 30 percent average for the rest of the euro zone. In addition, Greece’s adoption of the euro hastened a steady shift away from agricultural production. Today, Greece imports nearly 40 percent of its food, most of its medicine and almost all of its oil and natural gas, a situation that may lead to shortages if international suppliers halt business for a period.Should that happen, observers say Greece may need to prepare for civil unrest.“If we go to the worst case, and I pray that we don’t, it’s going to be a complete Greek tragedy before normalcy is restored,” Mr. Mihalos said.'"
"'12-05-23,'0','“This is a country of shopaholics,” said Faith Hope Consolo, chairman of the retail group at Douglas Elliman, who is handling inquiries from retailers in , and about opening in this country.Overseas companies are looking to the American market because of relatively easy access to , fewer regulations than some other countries, cheaper rents because of the recession and the promise of getting Wall Street’s attention, she said. And many shoppers here like the panache of clothing from abroad.“It’s a fickle market here — the consumer always wants something new,” Ms. Consolo said.Uniqlo is drawing particular attention because it has succeeded in selling basic and affordable clothing, a category that American companies like Gap and Old Navy once dominated. But it failed in a previous effort to expand into American shopping malls. In 2006, it closed stores in three malls in it had opened in 2005.This time, company officials said, they have learned from their mistakes — most notably, a recognition that the Uniqlo (pronounced YOU-nee-klo) brand needed a bigger introduction in the United States. Last time, the retailer leased standard-size mall locations — about 7,000 square feet each — that did not distinguish the brand from competitors. The new Garden State Plaza space, by contrast, is 43,000 square feet, and it has external exposure, meaning Uniqlo’s signs can be seen from a nearby highway and the mall’s parking lot.“Our brand is still not a household name, so we need a bigger box than some of our competitors,” said Shin Odake, the chief executive of Uniqlo’s United States division.Well saturated in , Uniqlo is now posting most of its growth overseas. Fast Retailing, the Uniqlo parent company based in , said sales in Uniqlo’s international division grew 68 percent to 84.8 billion yen ($1.07 billion) in the first half of its fiscal year, from September to February. Profits increased 45 percent to 11.4 billion yen for non-Japan stores in that period.Uniqlo posted a loss at its United States stores for that period, but analysts say the region is crucial for the company’s growth.“They need to have a competitive positioning in the world’s largest market,” said Masafumi Shoda, an analyst at Nomura Securities, in an e-mail.Unlike other low-priced international brands, like Zara, H&M and , which rush fashionable items into stores weeks after trends are seen on runways, Uniqlo’s clothes are simple. There is “a strong emphasis on fabrication,” said Faye Landes, a retail analyst with Consumer Edge Research.Uniqlo is best known for its solid and striped basics like T-shirts, shorts and cashmere sweaters, available in a wide spectrum of colors. Uniqlo emphasizes high-tech fabric, for example, in a moisture-wicking T-shirt it sells in summer. And prices are low — T-shirts start at $9.90, and cashmere sweaters at $79.90.Yasunobu Kyogoku, chief operating officer for Uniqlo’s United States division, said the company was able to get prices that low because it did not change its merchandise plans based on the latest fashion fad. Instead, it books factory capacity in advance, and produces garments at a steady pace year-round, rather than rushing to produce trendy items from specialty factories.“Typically in retail there’s a seasonality to the products you sell and therefore a seasonality to factories — when they’re running at full capacity and when they’re not,” Mr. Kyogoku said. “To be able to balance out, over 365 days a year, full capacity, you’re able to create more efficiencies.”After retreating from its last foray into American malls, Uniqlo took a different approach, opening a store in New York’s high-traffic SoHo district in 2006 and adding two more stores in New York last year, on 34th Street and on Fifth Avenue. The stores, filled with spinning mannequins and steel and white décor, serve in part as an advertisement for Uniqlo.And the company almost quadrupled its spending on advertising in the United States in 2011 versus 2010, to $8.3 million, according to Kantar Media, with ads pushing its prices. With the promotions started, Uniqlo executives said it was time to re-enter malls.“If you have just another store in a shopping mall, there’s no reason for a customer to buy at your store because we are selling clothes, and it is not so much different from the clothes that other people are selling,” Mr. Odake said. “So unless the customer knows about your brand or what the company stands for, there is no reason for the customer to shop at your store.”To hit the company’s stated target of $10 billion in sales in the United States by , “we need to go where the customer is, and in the United States, malls are the premier location where Americans shop,” Mr. Kyogoku said. The Uniqlo executives declined to discuss specifics about the expansion plans, beyond saying they also included stores in other big American cities. The company is also working on an e-commerce site in the United States, the executives said.“Even though I think it may be too early to go to mall locations,” Mr. Shoda, the retail analyst, said, the company “needs actual trials in there.”'"
"'12-05-23,'0','Commissioner Raymond Kelly of the New York Police Department issued a weak statement last week on efforts to “increase public confidence” in the city’s abusive program, which ensnares hundreds of thousands of mainly minority New Yorkers every year. Mr. Kelly seems to believe that tinkering at the margins will cure the program’s constitutional flaws. It will not.New York should learn from , where the stop-and-frisk policy was the subject of a 2010 class-action suit for racial discrimination and violations of Fourth Amendment guarantees of freedom from unreasonable searches and . Like New York police officers, Philadelphia’s were accused of using race as the basis for stops. Philadelphia settled the suit, accepting a consent decree that explicitly defined and prohibited illegal stops and put in place a court-appointed monitor to oversee stop-and-frisk practices.Mr. Kelly’s plan, laid out in a letter to the City Council speaker, , is unlikely to end the enormous annual number of street stops, from which only a tiny percentage results in a gun or an arrest. It re-emphasizes an existing directive banning racial profiling and tells commanders to review the forms that officers fill out after each stop. But such reviews are worthless if the forms allow stops based on vague and meaningless reasons, like an individual’s “furtive movement.”The implication in Mr. Kelly’s letter is that street-level officers are refusing to follow proper policy and are responsible for a growing number of illegal stops made without objective “reasonable suspicion,” as required by law.But Judge of Federal District Court demolished that argument last week in a ruling granting class-action status to a lawsuit filed against the department. She found the problem was the command structure itself and “the department’s policy of establishing performance standards and demanding increased levels of stops and frisks.” Stops increased from under 100,000 in 2002 to nearly 700,000 last year.By pointing out the vague and unlawful criteria used to justify stops in New York, the court decision suggested a kind of road map to reform. In tens of thousands of cases, for example, officers reported “furtive movement.” They reported that other stops had taken place in “high crime areas,” when, in fact, some had not. And, in more than 10 percent of all stops, officers reported a “suspicious bulge” — suggesting a gun — in the clothing of people they stopped, but seized guns only 0.15 percent of the time. New York needs to stop these practices, which may have infected Philadelphia’s program.The Philadelphia data showed stops had increased from about 102,000 in 2005 to more 253,000 in 2009, with blacks making up more than 72 percent of the people stopped, though they are about 44 percent of the population. The consent decree explicitly prohibits stops made solely on the basis of “furtive movement” or acting “suspiciously” or because the person was in a “high crime” or “high drug” area.'"

"'12-05-23,'0','Russia launched the missile four days after leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, meeting in Chicago, confirmed their commitment to building the European missile shield, rendering the blastoff something of a Russian retort.In Washington, Jamie F. Mannina, a State Department spokesman, said Russia had complied with its treaty obligations to notify the United States of the launching.“Russia is currently testing a new ICBM as permitted under the New Start treaty,” he said. “Russia’s development of such systems that employ countermeasures would not trigger any arms race with the United States since the U.S. missile defense systems are not being developed or deployed to counter or undermine Russia’s strategic nuclear forces.”The test on Wednesday took on added political significance coming two weeks after Vladimir V. Putin assumed the presidency for a third term. In another worrying sign for relations between Russia and the United States, Mr. Putin canceled a visit to the United States for a summit meeting of the Group of 8 nations last weekend at Camp David in Maryland.Russia’s objection to the missile defense plan has touched the American presidential race. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican candidate, has criticized Mr. Obama as trying to soothe Russia’s concerns through the détente known as the reset.Like the Bush administration before it, the Obama administration insists that the defensive system is not directed against Russia, but instead at emerging threats from Iran or North Korea. American officials under both presidents have noted that Russia’s strategic nuclear arsenal, now estimated at more than 2,400 warheads, could easily overcome the planned system with its limited number of interceptors.Russian officials say they remain unconvinced by the American assurances, and Mr. Putin has called for the production of new missile systems to be doubled in 2013. But development of weapons designed to be able to overcome defense systems has been slow and has faced costly failures. Russia’s civilian space rockets have also crashed recently. Analysts cite overall post-Soviet decay in the aerospace supply chain, as small factories making specialized parts have closed.The missile launched on Wednesday is not entirely new, the Gazeta.ru news Web site and other Russian media reported. It is an upgrade of an existing model of land-based rocket the Russian military has been testing for years, called the Topol, or Poplar.In 2007, during an earlier period of tension between Russia and the United States over American plans to set up antimissile sites in Eastern Europe, the Russian military also announced the launching of the Yars missile, an upgrade to the Topol, also said to be designed to penetrate missile defenses.'"
"'12-05-23,'0','The technology revolution, though slow in coming here, has now penetrated the most far-flung corners of the Tibetan plateau, transforming ordinary life and playing an increasingly pivotal role in the spreading unrest over Chinese policies that many Tibetans describe as stifling.Rising political consciousness has found expression through a campaign of self-immolations that the authorities have been unable to stamp out. Since March 2010, at least 34 people have set themselves ablaze, the vast majority of them current or former Buddhist clerics, many of them young.Despite government efforts to restrict the flow of information, citizen journalists and ordinary monks have gathered details and photographs of the self-immolators, pole-vaulting them over the country’s so-called Great Firewall. In some cases, blurred images show their final fiery moments or the horrific aftermath before paramilitary police officers haul the protesters out of public view. News accounts, quickly packaged by advocacy groups and e-mailed to foreign journalists, often include the protesters’ demands: greater autonomy and the return of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, who has lived in exile since 1959.“Technology is facilitating an awareness that is rippling out faster than ever before,” said Kate Saunders, communications director of the International Campaign for Tibet in London.The awareness is influencing a generation raised under Chinese rule but skeptical of official propaganda that maligns the Dalai Lama or brands the self-immolators as terrorists.Even middle school students, thousands of whom took to the streets this year to protest the elimination of Tibetan textbooks, have become fluent in the language of resistance.Dicki Chhoyang, a minister in the Tibetan government in exile, said many of the self-immolators reflected a cohort that is better educated than the previous generation and increasingly connected to the outside world. “You’re seeing a generation that’s much bolder and has a high level of political consciousness,” Ms. Chhoyang said, speaking from Dharamsala, India. “They want to send an unequivocal message about how firmly they feel about the situation in Tibetan areas.”Many analysts say the contrast with the aftermath of unrest four years ago is striking, noting that it is still difficult to know exactly what happened during and after the 2008 rioting that started in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Tibetan advocacy groups say hundreds across the region died at the hands of the police. The government acknowledges only two dozen deaths, most of them of Han Chinese killed by rioters and several of Tibetans convicted and executed for their role in the violence.“We have no idea how many Tibetans died in 2008, but within 24 hours we have received photos of everyone who died by self-immolation,” said Robert J. Barnett, the director of the modern Tibetan studies program at Columbia University.Tibetan exiles and advocacy groups say they increasingly receive calls during impromptu street rallies. The communication pipeline goes both ways; during a demonstration in front of the Chinese Embassy in London, one participant beamed back live images to Tibetan friends via Skype.Monks like Dorje, a 23-year-old at the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai, are typical of an increasingly wired and worldly generation. His room is decorated with the acoustic guitar he sometimes fumbles with late at night, Kobe Bryant posters and images of a beloved living Buddha.His most prized possession, though, is the computer he uses to download Celine Dion ballads and news from Tibetan advocacy groups. “All of us know how to jump over the wall,” he said slyly, referring to software that circumvents Chinese Internet restrictions. “I think all of us are aware of our Tibetan identity more than ever.”Such activity, however, can be perilous. Dorje said a fellow monk was taken away by the police in March, days after a friend in Sichuan Province called to report the latest self-immolation. The monk’s mistake, he said, was to share the news with too many people. “The police are everywhere,” Dorje said.Exile groups say government efforts to choke off information have been largely successful in much of the Tibet Autonomous Region, where security is draconian and foreign journalists are forbidden to go. Chinese jamming equipment, for example, prevents most Lhasa residents from listening to Radio Free Asia, according to its executive editor, Dan Southerland.But to the east, in predominantly Tibetan areas that until recently were more lightly administered, the fear of retribution has yet to stanch the sharing of information. Once part of greater Tibet and known by the historic names Amdo and Kham, the areas are comparatively wealthy and have long been a crucible for intellectual ferment and dissent. It is here, in Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan Provinces, that the self-immolations and most of the mass protests have been taking place despite a heavy military presence.These days, the authorities require Tibetans who want to make photocopies of documents — from religious texts to farming manuals — to get permission from the local police, and Internet cafe customers must hand over their state-issued identification cards. After a self-immolation this year in Gansu Province, the police corralled witnesses inside a market, confiscated their cellphones and deleted photos of the episode, residents said.At Labrang, an enormous monastery popular with tourists, monks said the temporary tower that looms over the temple complex can intercept cellphone chatter, or shut it down entirely. Security officials, they say, did just that last summer during the visit of the Panchen Lama, the top religious figure handpicked by Beijing, whom many Tibetans view as illegitimate. “For five days, all our phones were dead,” one monk said.Losang, a high-ranking monk at Labrang, said such tactics were only briefly effective because the authorities must eventually restore service or risk crippling the local economy.On a recent afternoon, Losang, a sharp-tongued man in his mid-40s, latched the door to his home and showed off the contents of his computer: video footage of a recent religious festival, scanned images of government directives and banned images of the Dalai Lama. After lingering on a photo of the 21-year-old monk whose self-immolation last year set off the most recent spate of suicides, he was asked whether he thought such imagery inspired copycats.He shook his head and said government strictures, not photos of the dead, were prompting young people to take their own lives. “When you choke a person,” he said, “you should not be surprised when they kick back.”'"
"'12-05-23,'0','The senators pointed to an episode in 2008 in which a uniformed Secret Service officer was arrested and accused of having solicited, from his patrol car, an undercover Washington police officer he thought was a prostitute. In 2002, three to five agents were sent home from the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City for inappropriate conduct with alcohol and under-age girls in their hotel rooms. The service also looked into an allegation of nonconsensual sexual intercourse, but Mr. Sullivan said the matter was dropped after an inquiry.“If we ignore or downplay what happened here, it can be like a cancer,” Ms. Collins said about the Colombia episode.“This is like a wound to a body,” said Senator Joseph I. Leiberman, independent of Connecticut and the panel’s chairman. “You’ve got to get in it, find out what happened, clean it out and let it heal.”Mr. Sullivan’s appearance only heightened the senators’ discomfort with the Cartagena episode and the director’s attitude toward it. Again and again, the lawmakers raised past episodes to suggest there was a pattern of sexual misconduct that had been ignored or even condoned by supervisors. Each time, Mr. Sullivan defended the Secret Service’s culture and integrity, even as he vowed to pursue the investigation in the case vigorously.The senators did not call for Mr. Sullivan to step aside, but they did press Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security, to pursue an independent investigation, and not just look over the shoulders of the Secret Service in its own inquiry.“I think that the director’s a very fine individual who’s very proud of his own career — understandably so — and of the agency that he heads,” Ms. Collins said. “Therefore, I think he has a difficult time coming to grips with the fact that he has a broader problem than just this one incident.”For Mr. Sullivan, the appearance was a balancing act. He defended the integrity of the service and its nearly 7,000 employees but said he was taking accusations of a broader problem seriously.When the news media reported after the Cartagena episode that a similar incident might have happened during a presidential visit to El Salvador, Mr. Sullivan said the agency spent thousands of dollars to look into it. Investigators interviewed about 30 people, all the hotel managers and hotel security directors who came into contact with agents, seven or eight drivers, a police chief and the owner of the nightclub where the episode is said to have taken place. They found no evidence of anything untoward, Mr. Sullivan said.He has named a “professionalism reinforcement working group” to look at work force management, hiring, performance assessments, disciplinary policies and standards to “make sure there’s no margin of error in our culture,” he said.At the same time, Mr. Sullivan said his goal was to show his agents that he had confidence in them and understood that the actions of a few rogue agents were not indicative of a breakdown in ethics.“I would ask for your continued support,” he told the senators.The response to that was mixed. Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, cited the parable of Jesus and the adulterer, suggesting that he who is without sin cast the first stone. Others were less forgiving.“Based on the facts of the case, it’s hard to believe this is just a one-time occurrence,” said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. “I wish I could believe that, but it’s just hard to believe.”'"

"'12-05-23,'0','The district includes a diverse mix of semi-suburban enclaves and urbanized pockets of thrumming commerce. According to some estimates, Asians and whites each make up just under 40 percent of the population, while Hispanics account for 17 percent and blacks 4 percent.Officials with several campaigns said that based on the number of Jewish surnames on voter registration lists, they expected Jews to account for about 20 percent of the Democratic primary turnout.Of the Democrats in the race, political observers say that three of them have a good chance to win the nomination. Ms. Meng was endorsed by the county party and appears to lead in fund-raising. Mr. Lancman has support from leaders like Mr. Koch. Elizabeth Crowley, a Democratic councilwoman, is a well-known name; her cousin is Representative Joseph Crowley, the chairman of the Queens Democratic Party, and she has strong union ties. Robert Mittman, a physician, is also running.The Queens Republican Party endorsed Mr. Halloran as its candidate in the district.“It’s the quintessential fallacy of New York politics that everybody fight the present battle as if it’s the same as the last,” said Bruce N. Gyory, an adjunct professor of political science at the State University at Albany. “If you can make an issue hot, it can carry the day. But to assume automatically that the next election will be fought on that turf — it ain’t necessarily so.”The district is an area long represented by strong Israel advocates like Mr. Turner, Mr. Ackerman and Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who resigned from Congress after it was revealed that he had been sending inappropriate pictures of himself to women over the Internet. (Mr. Turner is running in the Republican primary for the Senate seat now held by Kirsten E. Gillibrand, a Democrat.)The large Jewish population here may not vote as a bloc. Though Mr. Turner’s district had a large Orthodox Jewish population, which has a history of putting a high priority on support for Israel, the reshaped district has more non-Orthodox Jews, for whom Israel is just one issue of many. A recent national poll by the Public Religion Research Institute showed that Israel currently registered low among Jewish Americans’ top concerns.Strategists tied to the various candidates have suggested that the Queens race may boil down to ethnic ties: with such politically similar candidates, voters may use the shorthand of choosing a candidate who looks most like them or has the same background. But Mr. Weprin, the Democratic assemblyman who ran against Mr. Turner in 2011, lost among the Jewish community even though his Orthodox Jewish faith was widely publicized. Mr. Turner is Roman Catholic.Analysts said Mr. Koch’s endorsement was a key factor in getting many Jewish residents to cast votes for Mr. Turner.This time around, Mr. Koch endorsed Mr. Lancman, because of Mr. Lancman’s record of speaking out about Israel, which is unusual among a field of candidates whose political careers have hovered at the local level. But the former mayor has stopped well short of the kind of advocacy he displayed in the Turner-Weprin race, where he said that a vote cast for Mr. Turner was a way to send a message to President Obama condemning his stance toward Israel at the time.In the Queens race, Mr. Koch said, all of the three leading candidates’ positions on Israel have met with his approval.If it comes to a showdown on who most strongly supports Israel, not all feel they can compete. Ms. Crowley plans to focus on topics like health care and the elderly. She said Israel was not the issue that would decide the election, calling it “a distraction.”With the primary on June 26 and little time for the candidates to distinguish themselves, squabbles have occurred over the courtship of Jewish voters.Mr. Lancman accused Ms. Meng and the Queens Democratic Party of recruiting a Board of Elections clerk, Jeffrey Gottlieb, to join the race because of his identifiably Jewish surname in an effort to split the Jewish vote. Mr. Gottlieb, who eventually pulled out of the race, denied the accusation, as has a Meng spokesman, Michael Tobman.Ms. Meng enlisted Mark S. Weprin and Karen Koslowitz, two Jewish Democrats on the City Council, to lead her campaign as chairman and chairwoman. And at campaign events before Jewish audiences, Ms. Meng often mentions that she graduated from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University — to the surprise and delight of audiences, Ms. Koslowitz said.When Mark Weprin introduced Ms. Meng before she announced her candidacy in March, he said, “I wanted to mention, as a Jewish American, that Grace Meng in Washington will immediately be the most visible advocate for the state of Israel that we’ve had in Washington in a long time.”In an interview, Ms. Meng emphasized that any winner would have to look beyond his or her base and “be able to cross into different ethnic boundaries.”'"
"'12-05-23,'0','Mr. Romney said that the failure of so many American schools with minority students “is the civil rights issue of our era,” echoing a mantra of the school choice movement. “It’s the great challenge of our time.”The challenge for Mr. Romney is that many of the ideas he touched on — increasing the number of charter schools, holding teachers more accountable for student success — have already been adopted by the Obama administration, whose education policies have all but co-opted traditional Republican positions.In response to Mr. Romney’s proposals, the Obama campaign released a compilation of Republican governors’ past praise for the president’s education policies, including comments from Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. Susana Martinez of New Mexico.Mr. Romney told donors at a private gathering in Florida last month that he would reduce the size of the Education Department or fold it into another agency. But on Wednesday he gave no hint of the cuts he would make to education spending. He said he would consolidate $4 billion in current expenditures on teacher quality across 10 federal agencies, and send the money to states as block grants.He also promised to break logjams that still hold up reforms by taking on teachers’ unions, which he called “the clearest example of a group that has lost its way.” He accused Mr. Obama of quavering before the unions because of their power within the Democratic Party. “President Obama has been unable to stand up to union bosses — and unwilling to stand up for our kids,” he said.In fact, Mr. Obama has crossed teachers’ unions, notably in 2010 when he praised a mass firing of teachers in Rhode Island in a showdown over an administration policy to radically overhaul failing high-poverty schools.In a policy paper released on Wednesday, the Romney campaign called for the elimination of such federal intervention.James Kvaal, policy director for Mr. Obama’s campaign, accused Mr. Romney of wanting “to stop the clock on decades of reform by no longer insisting action be taken” to reform struggling schools.In place of overhauling failing schools, which can include replacement of the staff or conversion to a charter school, Mr. Romney would substitute a “public report card,” one exposing a school’s failures so that parents, presumably, could steer clear. It is uncertain how that proposal differs from existing report cards now required under the No Child Left Behind law enacted under President Bush.Mr. Romney’s biggest departure from existing policy was his call for poor students and those with disabilities to be able to attend any public school in their state — “or a private school where permitted by law” — and to have federal funds follow them, rather than the current system in which the money stays with a student’s local school.The inclusion of private schools suggested that Mr. Romney favors voucher programs that use public dollars to pay private tuition, long a controversial idea but one that has lately been embraced by Republican lawmakers in Indiana and Louisiana.“For too long, we’ve merely talked about the virtues of school choice without really doing something about it,” Mr. Romney said.Chester E. Finn Jr., president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, an education policy group, said Mr. Romney’s proposal would significantly shift how the two largest Education Department programs for kindergarten through 12th grade students — those for poor students and those with disabilities — are now run.“It’s a fundamental structural change of focus away from districts and schools to focus on kids and families,” Mr. Finn, an education official under President Ronald Reagan, said. “It changes the allocation of power as well as money, from people running school systems to parents choosing schools.”But apart from the symbolism, the shift might not lead to many students choosing better schools, since the federal government pays only about 10 percent of education costs for students. States and school districts, which provide the balance, have in many cases already embraced the portability of financing when students choose a school beyond their neighborhood.“Frankly, it catches up the federal policy to what is already state policy” in many places, Mr. Finn said.'"

"'12-05-24,'1','Can you think of a new movie with less reason for existing than “Men in Black 3”? What? “Battleship”? Yes, O.K. Good point. Hadn’t thought of that. “What to Expect When You’re Expecting”? Fair enough. But still. “The Avengers”? Let’s not go there. And stop interrupting me when I’m trying to make a serious point.Apart from the urgent necessity of reminding us that Will Smith is a movie star (and the usual need to wring a few more dollars out of a profitable franchise), “Men in Black 3” arrives in the multiplexes of the world with no particular agenda. Which may be part of the reason it turns out to be so much fun. You don’t need to study up on the previous installments or master a body of bogus fanboy lore to enjoy this movie for the breezy pop throwaway it is. Your expectations may be pleasantly low, and you may therefore be pleasantly surprised when they are exceeded.The first “Men in Black” movie, a playful adaptation of Lowell Cunningham’s offbeat comic books, was released 15 years ago, and a decade has gone by since the sequel — called “Men in Black 2” and every bit as memorable as its name — cashed in big and skyrocketed into the realm of bloated, tongue-in-cheek, special-effects-heavy spectacle. No. 3, directed by Barry Sonnenfeld from a script by Etan Cohen, starts out somewhat dispiritingly in that tapped-out vein, with a barrage of state-of-the-art weaponry, meticulously rendered slime and jokes that seem more than a little stale. There are no talking dogs and not too many references to the earlier installments.We are back in the company of agents J and K — Mr. Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, who both seem a bit creaky as they haul out the same old shtick. K is the grouchy coot, J is his motor-mouthed protégé, and they break out the neuralyzers and the zap guns in their continuing mission to deal with the extraterrestrials hidden in our midst. They trade some banter with Emma Thompson, who plays their boss, and encounter weird creatures on the streets of New York.For the first 20 minutes or so, nothing special is going on, and it seems that “Men in Black 3” will be content to spin its wheels and collect its money en route through the usual overscaled action set pieces toward a superloud, planet-saving final showdown. The music sounds less like a score by Danny Elfman than like a score by Danny Elfman’s smartphone app, and it carries dreadful intimations of forced fun. But even as the movie carefully fulfills its blockbuster imperatives — with chases and explosions and elaborately contrived plot twists — it swerves into some marvelously silly, unexpectedly witty and genuinely fresh territory. Go figure.The first sign of promise is the early appearance of the interplanetary supervillain, a leonine fellow named Boris who is confined to a maximum-security prison on the Moon. Boris is played with thunderous mock pomposity by Jemaine Clement, a great and eccentric comic talent who has improved every Hollywood movie he has appeared in (“Dinner for Schmucks,” “Gentlemen Broncos”) and who has done New Zealand proud in “Flight of the Conchords” and “Eagle vs Shark.”Boris and K have some history, a simmering grudge that long predates K’s partnership with J and that necessitates a bit of time travel. Somehow one of the oldest science-fiction tricks in the book — remember that “Star Trek” episode with Captain Kirk, Joan Collins and Hitler? — becomes an occasion for oddball inventiveness. The casting helps. Not only Mr. Clement, but also Alice Eve (as Ms. Thompson’s chipper younger self), Bill Hader (as Andy Warhol, of all people) and Michael Stuhlbarg as a sweet and spacey alien who tries to help J and K.'"

"'12-05-24,'1','Commissioner Raymond Kelly of the New York Police Department issued a weak statement last week on efforts to “increase public confidence” in the city’s abusive program, which ensnares hundreds of thousands of mainly minority New Yorkers every year. Mr. Kelly seems to believe that tinkering at the margins will cure the program’s constitutional flaws. It will not.New York should learn from , where the stop-and-frisk policy was the subject of a 2010 class-action suit for racial discrimination and violations of Fourth Amendment guarantees of freedom from unreasonable searches and . Like New York police officers, Philadelphia’s were accused of using race as the basis for stops. Philadelphia settled the suit, accepting a consent decree that explicitly defined and prohibited illegal stops and put in place a court-appointed monitor to oversee stop-and-frisk practices.Mr. Kelly’s plan, laid out in a letter to the City Council speaker, , is unlikely to end the enormous annual number of street stops, from which only a tiny percentage results in a gun or an arrest. It re-emphasizes an existing directive banning racial profiling and tells commanders to review the forms that officers fill out after each stop. But such reviews are worthless if the forms allow stops based on vague and meaningless reasons, like an individual’s “furtive movement.”The implication in Mr. Kelly’s letter is that street-level officers are refusing to follow proper policy and are responsible for a growing number of illegal stops made without objective “reasonable suspicion,” as required by law.But Judge of Federal District Court demolished that argument last week in a ruling granting class-action status to a lawsuit filed against the department. She found the problem was the command structure itself and “the department’s policy of establishing performance standards and demanding increased levels of stops and frisks.” Stops increased from under 100,000 in 2002 to nearly 700,000 last year.By pointing out the vague and unlawful criteria used to justify stops in New York, the court decision suggested a kind of road map to reform. In tens of thousands of cases, for example, officers reported “furtive movement.” They reported that other stops had taken place in “high crime areas,” when, in fact, some had not. And, in more than 10 percent of all stops, officers reported a “suspicious bulge” — suggesting a gun — in the clothing of people they stopped, but seized guns only 0.15 percent of the time. New York needs to stop these practices, which may have infected Philadelphia’s program.The Philadelphia data showed stops had increased from about 102,000 in 2005 to more 253,000 in 2009, with blacks making up more than 72 percent of the people stopped, though they are about 44 percent of the population. The consent decree explicitly prohibits stops made solely on the basis of “furtive movement” or acting “suspiciously” or because the person was in a “high crime” or “high drug” area.'"

"'12-05-24,'1','The technology revolution, though slow in coming here, has now penetrated the most far-flung corners of the Tibetan plateau, transforming ordinary life and playing an increasingly pivotal role in the spreading unrest over Chinese policies that many Tibetans describe as stifling.Rising political consciousness has found expression through a campaign of self-immolations that the authorities have been unable to stamp out. Since March 2010, at least 34 people have set themselves ablaze, the vast majority of them current or former Buddhist clerics, many of them young.Despite government efforts to restrict the flow of information, citizen journalists and ordinary monks have gathered details and photographs of the self-immolators, pole-vaulting them over the country’s so-called Great Firewall. In some cases, blurred images show their final fiery moments or the horrific aftermath before paramilitary police officers haul the protesters out of public view. News accounts, quickly packaged by advocacy groups and e-mailed to foreign journalists, often include the protesters’ demands: greater autonomy and the return of the Dalai Lama, the Tibetan spiritual leader, who has lived in exile since 1959.“Technology is facilitating an awareness that is rippling out faster than ever before,” said Kate Saunders, communications director of the International Campaign for Tibet in London.The awareness is influencing a generation raised under Chinese rule but skeptical of official propaganda that maligns the Dalai Lama or brands the self-immolators as terrorists.Even middle school students, thousands of whom took to the streets this year to protest the elimination of Tibetan textbooks, have become fluent in the language of resistance.Dicki Chhoyang, a minister in the Tibetan government in exile, said many of the self-immolators reflected a cohort that is better educated than the previous generation and increasingly connected to the outside world. “You’re seeing a generation that’s much bolder and has a high level of political consciousness,” Ms. Chhoyang said, speaking from Dharamsala, India. “They want to send an unequivocal message about how firmly they feel about the situation in Tibetan areas.”Many analysts say the contrast with the aftermath of unrest four years ago is striking, noting that it is still difficult to know exactly what happened during and after the 2008 rioting that started in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region. Tibetan advocacy groups say hundreds across the region died at the hands of the police. The government acknowledges only two dozen deaths, most of them of Han Chinese killed by rioters and several of Tibetans convicted and executed for their role in the violence.“We have no idea how many Tibetans died in 2008, but within 24 hours we have received photos of everyone who died by self-immolation,” said Robert J. Barnett, the director of the modern Tibetan studies program at Columbia University.Tibetan exiles and advocacy groups say they increasingly receive calls during impromptu street rallies. The communication pipeline goes both ways; during a demonstration in front of the Chinese Embassy in London, one participant beamed back live images to Tibetan friends via Skype.Monks like Dorje, a 23-year-old at the Kumbum Monastery in Qinghai, are typical of an increasingly wired and worldly generation. His room is decorated with the acoustic guitar he sometimes fumbles with late at night, Kobe Bryant posters and images of a beloved living Buddha.His most prized possession, though, is the computer he uses to download Celine Dion ballads and news from Tibetan advocacy groups. “All of us know how to jump over the wall,” he said slyly, referring to software that circumvents Chinese Internet restrictions. “I think all of us are aware of our Tibetan identity more than ever.”Such activity, however, can be perilous. Dorje said a fellow monk was taken away by the police in March, days after a friend in Sichuan Province called to report the latest self-immolation. The monk’s mistake, he said, was to share the news with too many people. “The police are everywhere,” Dorje said.Exile groups say government efforts to choke off information have been largely successful in much of the Tibet Autonomous Region, where security is draconian and foreign journalists are forbidden to go. Chinese jamming equipment, for example, prevents most Lhasa residents from listening to Radio Free Asia, according to its executive editor, Dan Southerland.But to the east, in predominantly Tibetan areas that until recently were more lightly administered, the fear of retribution has yet to stanch the sharing of information. Once part of greater Tibet and known by the historic names Amdo and Kham, the areas are comparatively wealthy and have long been a crucible for intellectual ferment and dissent. It is here, in Qinghai, Gansu and Sichuan Provinces, that the self-immolations and most of the mass protests have been taking place despite a heavy military presence.These days, the authorities require Tibetans who want to make photocopies of documents — from religious texts to farming manuals — to get permission from the local police, and Internet cafe customers must hand over their state-issued identification cards. After a self-immolation this year in Gansu Province, the police corralled witnesses inside a market, confiscated their cellphones and deleted photos of the episode, residents said.At Labrang, an enormous monastery popular with tourists, monks said the temporary tower that looms over the temple complex can intercept cellphone chatter, or shut it down entirely. Security officials, they say, did just that last summer during the visit of the Panchen Lama, the top religious figure handpicked by Beijing, whom many Tibetans view as illegitimate. “For five days, all our phones were dead,” one monk said.Losang, a high-ranking monk at Labrang, said such tactics were only briefly effective because the authorities must eventually restore service or risk crippling the local economy.On a recent afternoon, Losang, a sharp-tongued man in his mid-40s, latched the door to his home and showed off the contents of his computer: video footage of a recent religious festival, scanned images of government directives and banned images of the Dalai Lama. After lingering on a photo of the 21-year-old monk whose self-immolation last year set off the most recent spate of suicides, he was asked whether he thought such imagery inspired copycats.He shook his head and said government strictures, not photos of the dead, were prompting young people to take their own lives. “When you choke a person,” he said, “you should not be surprised when they kick back.”'"
"'12-05-24,'1','The senators pointed to an episode in 2008 in which a uniformed Secret Service officer was arrested and accused of having solicited, from his patrol car, an undercover Washington police officer he thought was a prostitute. In 2002, three to five agents were sent home from the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City for inappropriate conduct with alcohol and under-age girls in their hotel rooms. The service also looked into an allegation of nonconsensual sexual intercourse, but Mr. Sullivan said the matter was dropped after an inquiry.“If we ignore or downplay what happened here, it can be like a cancer,” Ms. Collins said about the Colombia episode.“This is like a wound to a body,” said Senator Joseph I. Leiberman, independent of Connecticut and the panel’s chairman. “You’ve got to get in it, find out what happened, clean it out and let it heal.”Mr. Sullivan’s appearance only heightened the senators’ discomfort with the Cartagena episode and the director’s attitude toward it. Again and again, the lawmakers raised past episodes to suggest there was a pattern of sexual misconduct that had been ignored or even condoned by supervisors. Each time, Mr. Sullivan defended the Secret Service’s culture and integrity, even as he vowed to pursue the investigation in the case vigorously.The senators did not call for Mr. Sullivan to step aside, but they did press Charles K. Edwards, the acting inspector general at the Department of Homeland Security, to pursue an independent investigation, and not just look over the shoulders of the Secret Service in its own inquiry.“I think that the director’s a very fine individual who’s very proud of his own career — understandably so — and of the agency that he heads,” Ms. Collins said. “Therefore, I think he has a difficult time coming to grips with the fact that he has a broader problem than just this one incident.”For Mr. Sullivan, the appearance was a balancing act. He defended the integrity of the service and its nearly 7,000 employees but said he was taking accusations of a broader problem seriously.When the news media reported after the Cartagena episode that a similar incident might have happened during a presidential visit to El Salvador, Mr. Sullivan said the agency spent thousands of dollars to look into it. Investigators interviewed about 30 people, all the hotel managers and hotel security directors who came into contact with agents, seven or eight drivers, a police chief and the owner of the nightclub where the episode is said to have taken place. They found no evidence of anything untoward, Mr. Sullivan said.He has named a “professionalism reinforcement working group” to look at work force management, hiring, performance assessments, disciplinary policies and standards to “make sure there’s no margin of error in our culture,” he said.At the same time, Mr. Sullivan said his goal was to show his agents that he had confidence in them and understood that the actions of a few rogue agents were not indicative of a breakdown in ethics.“I would ask for your continued support,” he told the senators.The response to that was mixed. Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, cited the parable of Jesus and the adulterer, suggesting that he who is without sin cast the first stone. Others were less forgiving.“Based on the facts of the case, it’s hard to believe this is just a one-time occurrence,” said Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. “I wish I could believe that, but it’s just hard to believe.”'"
"'12-05-24,'1','Russia launched the missile four days after leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, meeting in Chicago, confirmed their commitment to building the European missile shield, rendering the blastoff something of a Russian retort.In Washington, Jamie F. Mannina, a State Department spokesman, said Russia had complied with its treaty obligations to notify the United States of the launching.“Russia is currently testing a new ICBM as permitted under the New Start treaty,” he said. “Russia’s development of such systems that employ countermeasures would not trigger any arms race with the United States since the U.S. missile defense systems are not being developed or deployed to counter or undermine Russia’s strategic nuclear forces.”The test on Wednesday took on added political significance coming two weeks after Vladimir V. Putin assumed the presidency for a third term. In another worrying sign for relations between Russia and the United States, Mr. Putin canceled a visit to the United States for a summit meeting of the Group of 8 nations last weekend at Camp David in Maryland.Russia’s objection to the missile defense plan has touched the American presidential race. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican candidate, has criticized Mr. Obama as trying to soothe Russia’s concerns through the détente known as the reset.Like the Bush administration before it, the Obama administration insists that the defensive system is not directed against Russia, but instead at emerging threats from Iran or North Korea. American officials under both presidents have noted that Russia’s strategic nuclear arsenal, now estimated at more than 2,400 warheads, could easily overcome the planned system with its limited number of interceptors.Russian officials say they remain unconvinced by the American assurances, and Mr. Putin has called for the production of new missile systems to be doubled in 2013. But development of weapons designed to be able to overcome defense systems has been slow and has faced costly failures. Russia’s civilian space rockets have also crashed recently. Analysts cite overall post-Soviet decay in the aerospace supply chain, as small factories making specialized parts have closed.The missile launched on Wednesday is not entirely new, the Gazeta.ru news Web site and other Russian media reported. It is an upgrade of an existing model of land-based rocket the Russian military has been testing for years, called the Topol, or Poplar.In 2007, during an earlier period of tension between Russia and the United States over American plans to set up antimissile sites in Eastern Europe, the Russian military also announced the launching of the Yars missile, an upgrade to the Topol, also said to be designed to penetrate missile defenses.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','In 1979, Mr. Hernandez worked at a bodega near where Etan’s bus stopped every morning. It was a seedy place, a 77-year-old man who has lived in the neighborhood for decades recalled on Thursday. Walking in, you sensed a “distinctly hostile feeling,” he said. He said the neighborhood rumor was that there was cockfighting in the basement.Later, Mr. Hernandez moved to South Jersey. Investigators assigned to the Patz case had focused on him as a suspect in the past, one official said. A tip that was called in last month prompted them to circle back.In the 33 years since that morning, New York has lived under four mayors, the nation under six presidents. The Patzes’ SoHo neighborhood has gone from gritty to glamorous. Even the street signs on the corner he apparently never reached — grimy yellow with black letters in 1979 — have been changed.Some things have become commonplace: Children’s faces on milk cartons and on breaks during television newscasts. Etan’s was one of the first.Some things have been added to the national calendar and the national consciousness: National Missing Children’s Day, observed since 1983 on May 25, the day on which he vanished.But some constants have remained. Etan’s father, Stanley K. Patz, said last year that he still sent copies of the “missing” poster to the man he considered responsible, a former mental patient named Jose A. Ramos, against whom Mr. Patz won a wrongful death case in 2004. On the back, he always wrote the same eight words: “What did you do to my little boy?”Today the little boy in the Eastern Airlines cap would be approaching middle age — he would turn 40 in October. But some of the touchstones of his life are long gone. Eastern Airlines went out of business in 1991, when Etan would have been 18.And Etan was declared dead in 2001, when he would have been 29.For a while after he disappeared, people in New York hunted for Etan Patz everywhere: on every playground, in every schoolyard, at every deli counter where children could buy candy — even in neighborhoods in which he had probably never spent much time. On the Upper West Side, on the Upper East Side, they looked for him.Years passed. There were impossible-to-ignore reminders that kept the case in the public consciousness. In 1985, when he would have been 12 1/2, a photograph of his face filled a giant electronic screen at Broadway and 47th Street twice every hour. “Last seen 5-25-79,” the caption said. “Still missing.”Six months later, at the request of investigators in New York, Etan’s photograph was published in an Israeli newspaper.No leads came in that panned out. Still the file in the Missing Persons Squad remained open. “Do I remember?” the squad’s commander said in 1988, when Etan would have turned 16. “Do you remember World War II?”Time and again, the police walked down the block from the family’s loft between Greene and Wooster Streets, just as Etan was to have done. He was to have boarded the bus at the corner of West Broadway. But the bus driver and other children on the bus said he never showed up that morning.The reports of sightings began all too soon.Howard Belasco, the manager of a lumber store in the neighborhood, said Etan and another youngster had walked in “around 4:30 or 5 p.m.” on the day he vanished. “They were outside playing in a Dumpster, pulling out scraps of lumber, and then they came here and bought two boxes of nails,” Mr. Belasco said the day after Etan disappeared after recognizing him from a school picture the police had passed out. “Then they went around back and took some more scraps, then they disappeared.”The police then said on May 27 that Etan had probably not been one of those two youngsters.Officers fanned out from the Patzes’ loft, where detectives stood around a table and listened in on the family’s telephone calls. “We’re doing a floor-by-floor, wall-by-wall, rooftop-by-rooftop, backyard-by-backyard search,” said Deputy Inspector Dennis Ryan, who initially led the investigation.A police helicopter circled overhead. Bloodhounds and their state trooper handlers tried to pick up his scent from the lumber store. Self-proclaimed psychics who said they had visions of the little boy were consulted. By the end of the following week, the police said that they had 300 detectives canvassing the city and that their search had taken them to New Jersey. One called the hunt for Etan the “No. 1 priority of the Police Department.”Detectives sifted through thousands of leads from people who thought they had seen Etan. In 1982, when Etan would have been 10, a newspaper story prompted a retired cabdriver to come forward, saying he had picked up Etan and his apparent abductor that morning. The retired driver’s explanation for keeping quiet in 1979 was: “I had problems of my own. I didn’t want to get involved.”He described a ride that was as troubling as it was brief. He said the man had not given him an address to go to, just a terse instruction: Drive. Before long, he said, “the kid started to scream, saying that they weren’t going the right way to school.”The man told the taxi driver to pull over, and he and the boy hopped out. The driver was so flummoxed, he did not collect any money for the trip.By 2001, Mr. Ramos had emerged as the prime suspect. Mr. Ramos, who has been in prison in Pennsylvania since 1987, is scheduled to be released later this year. But in 2004, in the lawsuit brought by Etan’s parents, a Manhattan judge ruled that Mr. Ramos had been responsible for the boy’s death.Mr. Ramos was said to have admitted that he was with Etan the day he vanished, but he denied abducting and killing him.But last month, the authorities searched a basement that had been used as a workshop by Othniel Miller, a handyman who had been considered a possible suspect early on. In her book “After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive,” Lisa R. Cohen wrote that Mr. Miller had paid Etan for doing chores the night before he vanished.She also wrote that in the early stages of the hunt for Etan, “there was talk of jackhammering” the cement floor in the basement “in search of a body” underneath. She said Mr. Miller had countered that if anyone did that, “someone’s going to have to pay for it.”The authorities backed off until last month, and after several days of digging, they left, saying they had found no sign of a body. But that search, the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said Thursday, prompted a call from a someone who led the police to Mr. Hernandez.'"

"'12-05-24,'1','“This is not a film about hand washing,” says Bud Clayman at the start of “OC87,” adding, “It’s a film about the fear of acting on thoughts.” Mr. Clayman has obsessive-compulsive disorder — specifically “harm O.C.D.,” which involves intense anger and violent imaginings — and Asperger’s syndrome, which inhibits the grasp of social cues. This moving, penetrating documentary records his attempt to describe his conditions, confront them and learn to manage them.Mr. Clayman, who experienced depression in high school, studied radio, film and video production at Temple University, and moved to Los Angeles after graduation, only to suffer a breakdown. (The title comes from 1987, when he had his darkest hour, a withdrawal from human interaction.) For eight years he lived at Project Transition, a therapeutic community in Pennsylvania, to receive treatment. In “OC87” he retraces those steps, and visits his parents, psychologists, an actor on “General Hospital” with bipolar disorder, and a San Francisco news anchor with O.C.D.“My O.C.D. tells me that I must control every thought and every action perfectly,” Mr. Clayman says.We get vivid, subjective glimpses into his mind-set, feeling his unease as he walks down a street, his struggle in a diner to gauge the proper length of time for, say, glancing at someone. (Less attention is paid to Asperger’s; we must wait for that definitive video diary.)On camera Mr. Clayman has a tentative and preoccupied mien, but he is persistent in reaching for self-improvement. And there is change: his squalid apartment is made over; he speed-dates; he participates (impressively) during karaoke. He also laughs, interacts, expresses gratitude and tries hard to listen closely to others. His problems often seem like agonizingly exaggerated versions of everyone’s. We can learn from his solutions.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','The endorsements have started to come in almost daily, as one side or another trumpets a new supporter. On Monday, it was a city councilman from the Bronx, declaring his support for the challenger. On Tuesday, a fellow representative stood next to the incumbent and sang his praises. On Wednesday came yet another endorsement for the incumbent, from a former challenger now embracing him and saying that they had “always been friends.”The incumbent, Representative Charles B. Rangel, and his most prominent primary opponent, State Senator Adriano Espaillat, have been engaged in a duel of endorsements in recent weeks, inviting reporters to City Hall, Harlem and the Bronx to hear their newest pledges of support.Endorsements, analysts say, do not make much difference to voters, but the frequency of the announcements points to the peculiar dynamic in this race. Mr. Rangel, 81, who has been in Congress since 1971, is trying to signal to donors, the news media and the city’s political class that despite health issues and ethics concerns he is still going strong; Mr. Espaillat, in turn, is trying to show that Mr. Rangel has lost influential support.“For Adriano, his endorsements are meant to show that he is getting traction, he’s building momentum, and that he himself is able to snatch away support from Charlie,” said Basil A. Smikle Jr., a political consultant who is not working for either candidate.“For Charlie, it’s more of, ‘I still have support in this community, and the institutions that have been around, that people know, still support me.”The endorsements also serve to remind the news media and voters that this year’s primary for federal offices is unusually early in New York: June 26. Mr. Rangel and Mr. Espaillat are both Democrats, and they will face each other in the primary, along with several other candidates. The district, which runs from Harlem to the northwest Bronx, is overwhelmingly Democratic, so the winner of the primary is expected to go on to win the general election in November.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','TACOMA, Wash. — A lot has come down the pike since the summer of 2008, which for many Americans may already feel like the closed chapter of an old book. But here on the West Coast there is an unhappy echo: gasoline prices.One thin dime separates the current average price of a regular gallon of gas from Tacoma’s historic high of $4.37 that was set in late June 2008. And while most Americans have caught a break over the last year, with the average price for a gallon of regular falling 15 cents compared with this time in 2011, in Western Washington it was up 32 cents as of Thursday, according to the Oil Price Information Service, a petroleum-pricing research group.A bottleneck in the archipelago of oil refineries that supply the region is the short explanation; some are closed for maintenance, and one here in Washington is temporarily disabled after a fire. The resulting pincers — a still-tough economy compounded by stinging transportation costs — have clipped wallets in places like Tacoma, a port city south of Seattle still tied to the world of timber and shipping.A few hours chatting around the pumps at a local gas stop on Monday underscored the pain.“Things are a little, little bit better than they were,” said Dennis Barker, a former construction worker who started a home-renovation business about a month ago with a friend. “But I’m spending more — I’m going around trying to drum up some business,” he said. The $50 a week he spends on gasoline imposes strict efficiencies, Mr. Barker said, on everything else.For people on fixed or reduced incomes, lingering high prices create a ripple that changes patterns of life in many ways, large and small. David Moceri, who was laid off this spring from a mattress factory, now buys no more than $10 of gasoline at a time. Harvey Johnson, a self-employed handyman, used to carry his handyman tools in a pickup truck from job to job.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','Can you think of a new movie with less reason for existing than “Men in Black 3”? What? “Battleship”? Yes, O.K. Good point. Hadn’t thought of that. “What to Expect When You’re Expecting”? Fair enough. But still. “The Avengers”? Let’s not go there. And stop interrupting me when I’m trying to make a serious point.Apart from the urgent necessity of reminding us that Will Smith is a movie star (and the usual need to wring a few more dollars out of a profitable franchise), “Men in Black 3” arrives in the multiplexes of the world with no particular agenda. Which may be part of the reason it turns out to be so much fun. You don’t need to study up on the previous installments or master a body of bogus fanboy lore to enjoy this movie for the breezy pop throwaway it is. Your expectations may be pleasantly low, and you may therefore be pleasantly surprised when they are exceeded.The first “Men in Black” movie, a playful adaptation of Lowell Cunningham’s offbeat comic books, was released 15 years ago, and a decade has gone by since the sequel — called “Men in Black 2” and every bit as memorable as its name — cashed in big and skyrocketed into the realm of bloated, tongue-in-cheek, special-effects-heavy spectacle. No. 3, directed by Barry Sonnenfeld from a script by Etan Cohen, starts out somewhat dispiritingly in that tapped-out vein, with a barrage of state-of-the-art weaponry, meticulously rendered slime and jokes that seem more than a little stale. There are no talking dogs and not too many references to the earlier installments.We are back in the company of agents J and K — Mr. Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, who both seem a bit creaky as they haul out the same old shtick. K is the grouchy coot, J is his motor-mouthed protégé, and they break out the neuralyzers and the zap guns in their continuing mission to deal with the extraterrestrials hidden in our midst. They trade some banter with Emma Thompson, who plays their boss, and encounter weird creatures on the streets of New York.For the first 20 minutes or so, nothing special is going on, and it seems that “Men in Black 3” will be content to spin its wheels and collect its money en route through the usual overscaled action set pieces toward a superloud, planet-saving final showdown. The music sounds less like a score by Danny Elfman than like a score by Danny Elfman’s smartphone app, and it carries dreadful intimations of forced fun. But even as the movie carefully fulfills its blockbuster imperatives — with chases and explosions and elaborately contrived plot twists — it swerves into some marvelously silly, unexpectedly witty and genuinely fresh territory. Go figure.The first sign of promise is the early appearance of the interplanetary supervillain, a leonine fellow named Boris who is confined to a maximum-security prison on the Moon. Boris is played with thunderous mock pomposity by Jemaine Clement, a great and eccentric comic talent who has improved every Hollywood movie he has appeared in (“Dinner for Schmucks,” “Gentlemen Broncos”) and who has done New Zealand proud in “Flight of the Conchords” and “Eagle vs Shark.”Boris and K have some history, a simmering grudge that long predates K’s partnership with J and that necessitates a bit of time travel. Somehow one of the oldest science-fiction tricks in the book — remember that “Star Trek” episode with Captain Kirk, Joan Collins and Hitler? — becomes an occasion for oddball inventiveness. The casting helps. Not only Mr. Clement, but also Alice Eve (as Ms. Thompson’s chipper younger self), Bill Hader (as Andy Warhol, of all people) and Michael Stuhlbarg as a sweet and spacey alien who tries to help J and K.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','WASHINGTON — After an “especially tumultuous and momentous year” for human rights, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Thursday, the challenge in many Arab countries has shifted from breaking the back of entrenched dictatorships to protecting new freedom during the often chaotic and sometimes violent transitions that follow.Mrs. Clinton made the remarks as she released the State Department’s report on global human rights for 2011, cataloging rights abuses in 194 countries.She cited Egypt as an example, noting that the violence of last year had given way to a peaceful presidential election on Wednesday and Thursday. The demands of reformers, she said, were “making a difference as Egyptians are going to the polls to determine for the first time in their history who their leaders will be.” Some chronic abusers of human rights remained at the bottom of the department’s list: Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Syria, Belarus and China.The report included tough words about Chinese rights practices, saying that conditions there had deteriorated. In 2008, the report dropped China from its list of the worst abusers. But the new report cites “repression and coercion” of rights advocates, tight restrictions on political dissidents, curbs on journalists and on Internet access, and “severe cultural and religious repression” of ethnic Uighurs and Tibetans.The recent diplomatic incident involving the Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng occurred after the time frame covered in the report. Still, Michael H. Posner, an assistant secretary of state, said that it demonstrated how the United States could criticize foreign nations for human rights shortcomings even while cooperating with them on economic or security issues.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','With acres of open ice because the teams were skating four a side, Kovalev took a pass near the left-side face-off dot, skated up a few feet and unleashed a wicked slap shot that slammed off Brodeur’s chest and fell kindly, invitingly, for Messier, who was gliding through the slot. Messier swung his stick, slashing the puck into the net (while also upending a defender) and suddenly, incredibly, the Rangers had the lead.Messier praised Keenan’s decision to move Kovalev to his and Adam Graves’s line, saying: “I thought it was a great move by Mike. We needed to penetrate and gain the blue line.”For his coup de grâce, however, Messier did not need any help. He was one of four Rangers skaters on the ice for a late penalty kill, as the Devils — trailing by a goal — pulled Brodeur to make it six on four with just under two minutes remaining and the face-off deep in the Rangers’ end.What followed is perhaps best described by the broadcaster Mike Emrick, who described the sequence as Messier intercepted a pass by John MacLean:“Many people standing as MacLean fed one to the front. Messier ... throws one down ... and in! The stuff of legend. The called shot. The hat trick.”On another network, Gary Thorne called Messier’s length-of-the-ice heave at the empty net this way: “For the empty net, Mark Messier ... Do you believe it? Do you believe it? He said, ‘We will win Game 6’ — he just picked up the hat trick!”The shot was impressive and, because of the distance, had the feel of a desperation pass in football. In most circumstances, a player might not shoot from so far away — Messier was just a few strides from his own net — but because the Devils were on a power play, the Rangers could fire at will since a short-handed team cannot be called for icing.So Messier did. And when his arcing wrist shot hit the back of the Devils’ net, the Rangers’ victory was assured along with Messier’s place in the annals of hockey history. Not for the guarantee, mind you, but for what he did to make the guarantee come true.Keenan called it “one of the single most impressive performances by any hockey player in the history of this league,” while Graves spoke admiringly about his center and close friend before summing up the impact of Messier’s night in a way that Rangers fans can only hope will apply to the series again this year.“This is what it’s all about,” Graves said, smiling. Then he added, “Game 7 will be one hell of a game, probably the best game of all.”'"

"'12-05-24,'1','Mitt Romney claims that he is a job creator and that, if elected, his private equity firm experience will enable him to do the same on a national basis.While extolling the productivity gains shown by companies acquired by private equity firms, Mr. Brooks concedes that “the overall effect on employment is modest.” For, in the race to become more efficient, many companies have served only one stakeholder, the stockholder, while ignoring all others, in particular, their employees and society at large. Yet, it is these other stakeholders who must ultimately be served if these businesses expect to have a market for their output.Private equity firm techniques adopted by many other companies — corporate downsizing, wage stagnation owing to a failure to share the fruits of productivity gains with the work force, the failure to retrain displaced workers — have combined to reduce demand for our nation’s goods and services. The last thing we need is to apply the techniques of private equity firms like Bain Capital to the government-dominated sectors of our economy, as Mr. Brooks proposes.In a Jan. 12 column, David Brooks correctly observed, “Romney’s Bain success is largely irrelevant to the question of whether he could be a good president.”Now Mr. Brooks defends Bain Capital and attacks the Obama campaign for unfairly criticizing it.

"'12-05-24,'1','MOSCOW — The economy in Russia is now as likely to sink into recession as it is to continue to grow, a prominent former finance minister said on Thursday.The former minister, Aleksei L. Kudrin, made the remark while presenting a report that also predicted a period of “destabilizing” politics if incomes declined in Russia.An economic downturn would most likely swell the ranks of protesters who opposed the recent re-election of Vladimir V. Putin as president and could spread the movement to rural areas from cities, where it has been centered until now, Mr. Kudrin said.Half a dozen prominent academics and former senior government officials gathered at a news conference to present their findings, sounding the first high-level alarm in Moscow’s political circles that Russia could suffer serious consequences if Greece exited the euro zone.Mr. Kudrin, a longtime close ally of Mr. Putin, is a weighty figure in Moscow political and banking circles. He is credited with anticipating the oil price collapse in 2008 and helping to soften its effect on the Russian economy by saving profits in advance in sovereign wealth funds. That added credibility to his predictions.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','Now, by paying $2.6 billion to acquire AMC, the Wanda Group is extending its reach globally. The deal, announced Sunday, is still subject to the approval of United States regulators, though there are no hints it will be blocked. The purchase signifies a new era for Mr. Wang and in China’s development. Companies here are moving away from low-cost manufacturing and going abroad in search of natural resources and global consumer brands, part of an effort to upgrade the nation’s economy.In an interview at his spacious headquarters in Beijing, Mr. Wang, the Wanda chairman, said he was pondering his next international destination: Europe.“We’re already negotiating,” he said.Wanda is a private company in a nation dominated by state-owned enterprises. But the AMC deal is closely aligned with the Chinese government’s priorities, which include encouraging Chinese companies to “go global,” pushing an overhaul of Chinese media and entertainment properties and placing greater emphasis on consumer spending.Policy makers in Beijing also want to bolster China’s “soft power” capabilities to extend its cultural influence internationally, and the film industry is considered one of the most promising avenues for doing so.But whether Wanda, a 24-year-old enterprise with little international experience, can make a success of such a big acquisition and create a global property and entertainment brand is debatable, analysts say.“China has great entrepreneurs,” says Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a Beijing-based investment advisory firm. “But the question is: How will they take these companies international? Are they going to be willing to learn and adapt?”One of the biggest experiments in this area is being undertaken by Mr. Wang, a former army officer who has turned a tiny real estate venture into a national brand. Wanda, which started in Dalian, a northeastern city, and moved its headquarters to Wanda Plaza in Beijing, is a colossus with 183 million square feet of land under development or operation.In 1988, Mr. Wang — who entered the army at 15, after middle school — says he left a job as a local government official in Dalian and borrowed $80,000 to start a business he now describes as a “sprinting elephant.”Wang Yongping, founder of the China Commercial Real Estate Association, described the chairman of Wanda as usually a step ahead of other Chinese real estate barons.“He always has a vision,” Mr. Wang, no relation, said. “When everybody was doing housing property, he jumped out to focus on commercial property. When everybody was chasing commercial property, he was eyeing culture and tourism — the industries that the government is stressing and cultivating.”That few Chinese companies have managed to establish global brands is of little concern to Wanda’s chairman. And buying a stake in a company focused on a quintessentially American experience — moviegoing — seemed hardly daunting for a man who survived the Cultural Revolution, a period of social and political madness in China.“In setting goals and executing a strategy, Wanda is sophisticated,” said Mr. Wang, the Wanda chairman. “We have good systems and departments. If targets are not reached, a yellow light goes off.”Mr. Wang usually hits his targets, he says. The company has experienced 30 percent growth in the last year, even in a down market. And he promises that by 2015 the Wanda Group will have overall revenue of about $30 billion.Which raises the question: Why invest in the United States cinema market at a time of weakness, when box office receipts are sluggish and American film producers are looking to China?Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Wang’s acquisition of AMC was political, an effort to curry favor with Chinese leaders, who are pushing their nation to enhance its influence by exporting cultural products. Others contend that Mr. Wang is eager to establish himself as China’s first global corporate chief.“This is kind of a statement deal for him,” said an executive familiar with the Wanda-AMC talks, but not authorized to discuss them. “He’s coming out of China, and this is an area he has great interest in. He kept emphasizing he just wants to learn how cinemas are operated in the U.S. It’s not just about the money.”But to pull off the deal, Wanda needed plenty of that: more than $3 billion in cash, including $500 million it has promised to invest in AMC in North America. Financing such a big deal in a tough credit environment, and with China’s property market in a slump, was some feat. In the end, much of the cash came from China’s big, state-controlled banks.To ensure that the deal succeeds, Mr. Wang said he would keep AMC’s management in place with long-term pay incentives, and invest heavily in renovating older American theaters in an effort to bolster revenue.Asked whether AMC would show films that the Chinese government found offensive, such as one dealing with the contentious issue of rebellions in Tibet, Mr. Wang said he would not interfere with decisions by his management team in the United States.He also dismissed speculation in China that his ties to Bo Xilai, the fallen Politburo leader who also got his start in Dalian, could harm the Wanda Group.“We knew each other, and were very familiar with one another,” he said. “But it was just a working relationship. There was no personal relationship.” He said the government had not asked to investigate the group.Throughout the interview, Mr. Wang — who spoke calmly and quietly, and occasionally twirled his thumbs — said he was focusing on targets and executing strategies, fast.Buying a Hollywood movie studio was not planned, he said, but he would not rule it out. Hotels and American shopping malls are more likely targets, he said.“We don’t have the strategy to go global in real estate,” he said. “But for globalization and going out, we would like to buy hotels and hotel management companies. We also like department stores.”'"
"'12-05-24,'1','Gasoline prices on the East Coast have fallen in part because one large refinery in Philadelphia that was scheduled to be closed by Sunoco at the end of June is now expected to remain open through at least most of the summer while the private equity firm the Carlyle Group negotiates to form a joint venture. Prospects for future gasoline prices in the region have also improved since Delta Air Lines bought an idled Pennsylvania refinery, which will probably produce more gasoline for the market by October.On the West Coast, however, particularly around Los Angeles, gasoline prices have actually risen in recent weeks because several refineries were forced to suspend operations because of power failures and repairs to compressors. But those problems are expected to be cleared up by June, and energy experts expect prices to ease afterward.The diverging refinery situations are reflected in the wide gap in gasoline prices from one coast to the other. The average price for regular gasoline on Thursday was $3.92 a gallon in New York but $4.31 a gallon in California.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Thursday was $3.67, nearly 30 cents below the high for the year reached in early April. A year ago, the average prices stood at $3.85 a gallon.Energy analysts say prices this summer should remain a few cents lower than last year but about 75 cents a gallon above the level in the summer of 2010. The economic effect of the lower prices is tentative because prices could easily surge again.“Compared to 2009 and 2010, these are still stiff prices,” said Tom Kloza, the chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service. “People talk about this wonderful dividend, but measured against history, gasoline still represents a considerable slice of consumer disposable income.”Mr. Kloza projected that the national average price for regular gasoline during the Memorial Day weekend would be at most only a few pennies below the current price, and would range from $3.50 to $3.75 for the rest of the summer.Light sweet crude, the benchmark of New York trading, remained stubbornly above $100 a barrel for most of the last year. In recent weeks it has fallen to just above $90, and remained near that level on Thursday.The spike in oil prices last year was because of the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East, especially the loss of more than a million barrels a day of high-quality crude from Libya during the insurrection against the Qaddafi dictatorship. After easing for a few months, prices surged again early this year over fears that Iran might block supplies from passing through the Strait of Hormuz in response to tightening European and United States sanctions or the possibility of an Israeli or American attack on Iranian nuclear plants.The sanctions have reduced Iranian exports, but increased exports from Libya, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have so far more than compensated for the drop-off in China, India and other Asian countries that have relied on supplies from Iran. Total OPEC output of oil and other liquid fuels is at a record high of 37.5 million barrels a day, despite the loss of Iranian exports.But oil analysts warn that prices could surge again if instability interrupts production in any number of shaky producing nations. Traders were watching how a second round of talks between members of the United Nations Security Council, Germany and Iran would proceed this week, but there appeared to have been little progress. Hopes that Iran would be willing to curb its nuclear program had helped send oil prices lower, but further tightening of sanctions on Iran could send crude prices higher in the months ahead.“If there are any problems on the supply side, as in Iran, Libya or Nigeria, then prices will be right back up,” said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research. “Global inventories are not that high, and production is pretty much flat out in OPEC. A lot depends on how negotiations go with Iran.”While production in the United States is about a million barrels a day higher than last year, now reaching 5.9 million barrels a day, several other international producers outside of OPEC are not doing nearly as well. Unrest in South Sudan has halted nearly half a million barrels a day of production. Offshore oil spills have dented output in China and Brazil, and production from the North Sea continues to decline.'"
"'12-05-24,'1','Dr. Shipman was careful to make these distinctions in her essay in American Scientist, and in an interview.First, she said, we know that modern humans and Neanderthals occupied at the same time, from about 45,000 to 25,000 years ago, and that the humans’ fortunes rose as the Neanderthals’ fell. Somehow modern humans outcompeted Neanderthals. And here we are now, with our computers, our research and our beloved dogs, which, scientists agree, evolved from wolves.Second, and this point is crucial, Dr. Shipman thinks dogs were very probably around during this time, although she recognizes that others disagree. She tells us about the research that convinced her: a 2009 report of three skulls, the oldest dating to 32,000 years ago, by Mietje Germonpré of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in The Journal of Archaeological Science.The skulls are clearly from canids, but those include wolves, jackals and foxes. Dr. Germonpré and her colleagues concluded the skulls belonged to dogs. That’s where things get sticky.The rest of Dr. Shipman’s essay is clear enough. If the humans had dogs, the dogs must have been helping somehow, in hunting or pulling travois. And they may have been so helpful that they gave modern humans an edge. If they helped in hunting, they might have watched human eyes for clues about what was going on, as they do now. Other researchers have suggested that the white of the human eye evolved to foster cooperation because we could more easily see where others were looking.If dogs were watching us too, that would have added survival value to having a partly white eye and thus played a role in our evolution. Fair enough, but the dogs had to be there at that time when humans and Neanderthals overlapped. I asked Dr. Larson about Dr. Shipman’s essay, and I confess I expected he might object to its speculative nature. Not so. “I love speculation,” he wrote back. “I do it all the time.” And, he said of Dr. Shipman’s essay, “it’s a lovely chain of reasoning.”But, he said, “it begins from the premise that the late Pleistocene canid remains are dogs. And they are not.”He wrote, “There is not a single piece of (credible) evidence to suggest that the domestication process was under way 30,000 years ago.” He cited an article in press in The Journal of Archaeological Science that is highly critical of the Germonpré paper. The article, by Susan J. Crockford at the University of Victoria and Yaroslav V. Kuzmin at the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, suggests the skulls in question came from short-faced wolves and do not indicate domestication. Dr. Crockford, who had read Dr. Shipman’s paper, thought it “too speculative for science.” But she did not view the case of early domestication as closed.She said in an e-mail: “We simply need more work on these ancient wolves before we can determine if these canids are incipient dogs (in the process of becoming dogs, although not there yet) or if they simply reflect the normal variation in ancient wolves. At present, I am leaning strongly toward the latter.”Perhaps the way to judge the scientific value of speculation would be to see if it prompts more research, more collecting of fossils, more study. Until then, only proximate answers will exist to the question of where dogs came from.Mine came from a shelter. How about yours?'"

"'12-05-24,'1','Mr. Cameron has repeatedly rejected calls by the opposition Labour Party and by some economists to scale back austerity measures, arguing that government spending cuts helped Britain keep its borrowing costs low and investor confidence high. The prime minister has said that the double-dip recession was the result of higher energy prices, a dearth of bank lending and, to a large extent, the economic crisis in the euro zone, Britain’s largest export market.Statistics released last week showed that the euro zone’s economy avoided slipping into recession in the first quarter, if only because the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the period, pulling up the average for the currency area. Britain is a member of the European Union but is outside the euro zone.Mr. Cameron irked some European leaders over the weekend when he weighed in on the debate about the euro zone crisis by calling on member states to do more to solve it.“What would be bad for Greece, bad for Europe and bad for the world is if we just allowed the can to be kicked further down the road with an inconclusive outcome,” Mr. Cameron said in Chicago after a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 8 large industrialized countries.The revised economic data give more ammunition to those who oppose the government’s budget cuts, which have resulted in pay freezes and tens of thousands of job cuts throughout the public sector. But Mr. Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, have said they will stick to their program to bring down the government deficit. They point to the relatively low interest rates Britain pays on its debt, and praise from the major debt rating agencies, as evidence that their plan is working.“Our complacent and out-of-touch prime minister and chancellor have spent the last week claiming their plan is on track, but these figures show that Britain’s double-dip recession is even deeper than first thought,” said Ed Balls, the Labour Party’s spokesman on fiscal issues. “What more evidence can David Cameron and George Osborne need that their policies have failed and that they now need a change of course and a Plan B for growth and jobs?”The government has rejected Labour’s repeated calls to spur economic growth by spending more, arguing that it was the previous Labour government’s excessive spending before the economic crisis that caused Britain’s difficulties in the first place.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, backed the austerity plan this week but also said Britain would need to consider incremental policy changes, which could include more stimulus from the Bank of England, if the economic recovery continued to falter.The Bank of England decided this month to halt a stimulus program that included the purchase of government bonds as it shifted its focus from economic recovery and back to controlling inflation, which has been running above the central bank’s 2 percent target. But minutes of the most recent meeting of the central bank’s policy committee showed that members remained open to expanding the stimulus program should the economy worsen.'"

"'12-05-25,'0','With acres of open ice because the teams were skating four a side, Kovalev took a pass near the left-side face-off dot, skated up a few feet and unleashed a wicked slap shot that slammed off Brodeur’s chest and fell kindly, invitingly, for Messier, who was gliding through the slot. Messier swung his stick, slashing the puck into the net (while also upending a defender) and suddenly, incredibly, the Rangers had the lead.Messier praised Keenan’s decision to move Kovalev to his and Adam Graves’s line, saying: “I thought it was a great move by Mike. We needed to penetrate and gain the blue line.”For his coup de grâce, however, Messier did not need any help. He was one of four Rangers skaters on the ice for a late penalty kill, as the Devils — trailing by a goal — pulled Brodeur to make it six on four with just under two minutes remaining and the face-off deep in the Rangers’ end.What followed is perhaps best described by the broadcaster Mike Emrick, who described the sequence as Messier intercepted a pass by John MacLean:“Many people standing as MacLean fed one to the front. Messier ... throws one down ... and in! The stuff of legend. The called shot. The hat trick.”On another network, Gary Thorne called Messier’s length-of-the-ice heave at the empty net this way: “For the empty net, Mark Messier ... Do you believe it? Do you believe it? He said, ‘We will win Game 6’ — he just picked up the hat trick!”The shot was impressive and, because of the distance, had the feel of a desperation pass in football. In most circumstances, a player might not shoot from so far away — Messier was just a few strides from his own net — but because the Devils were on a power play, the Rangers could fire at will since a short-handed team cannot be called for icing.So Messier did. And when his arcing wrist shot hit the back of the Devils’ net, the Rangers’ victory was assured along with Messier’s place in the annals of hockey history. Not for the guarantee, mind you, but for what he did to make the guarantee come true.Keenan called it “one of the single most impressive performances by any hockey player in the history of this league,” while Graves spoke admiringly about his center and close friend before summing up the impact of Messier’s night in a way that Rangers fans can only hope will apply to the series again this year.“This is what it’s all about,” Graves said, smiling. Then he added, “Game 7 will be one hell of a game, probably the best game of all.”'"
"'12-05-25,'0','The endorsements have started to come in almost daily, as one side or another trumpets a new supporter. On Monday, it was a city councilman from the Bronx, declaring his support for the challenger. On Tuesday, a fellow representative stood next to the incumbent and sang his praises. On Wednesday came yet another endorsement for the incumbent, from a former challenger now embracing him and saying that they had “always been friends.”The incumbent, Representative Charles B. Rangel, and his most prominent primary opponent, State Senator Adriano Espaillat, have been engaged in a duel of endorsements in recent weeks, inviting reporters to City Hall, Harlem and the Bronx to hear their newest pledges of support.Endorsements, analysts say, do not make much difference to voters, but the frequency of the announcements points to the peculiar dynamic in this race. Mr. Rangel, 81, who has been in Congress since 1971, is trying to signal to donors, the news media and the city’s political class that despite health issues and ethics concerns he is still going strong; Mr. Espaillat, in turn, is trying to show that Mr. Rangel has lost influential support.“For Adriano, his endorsements are meant to show that he is getting traction, he’s building momentum, and that he himself is able to snatch away support from Charlie,” said Basil A. Smikle Jr., a political consultant who is not working for either candidate.“For Charlie, it’s more of, ‘I still have support in this community, and the institutions that have been around, that people know, still support me.”The endorsements also serve to remind the news media and voters that this year’s primary for federal offices is unusually early in New York: June 26. Mr. Rangel and Mr. Espaillat are both Democrats, and they will face each other in the primary, along with several other candidates. The district, which runs from Harlem to the northwest Bronx, is overwhelmingly Democratic, so the winner of the primary is expected to go on to win the general election in November.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','Now, by paying $2.6 billion to acquire AMC, the Wanda Group is extending its reach globally. The deal, announced Sunday, is still subject to the approval of United States regulators, though there are no hints it will be blocked. The purchase signifies a new era for Mr. Wang and in China’s development. Companies here are moving away from low-cost manufacturing and going abroad in search of natural resources and global consumer brands, part of an effort to upgrade the nation’s economy.In an interview at his spacious headquarters in Beijing, Mr. Wang, the Wanda chairman, said he was pondering his next international destination: Europe.“We’re already negotiating,” he said.Wanda is a private company in a nation dominated by state-owned enterprises. But the AMC deal is closely aligned with the Chinese government’s priorities, which include encouraging Chinese companies to “go global,” pushing an overhaul of Chinese media and entertainment properties and placing greater emphasis on consumer spending.Policy makers in Beijing also want to bolster China’s “soft power” capabilities to extend its cultural influence internationally, and the film industry is considered one of the most promising avenues for doing so.But whether Wanda, a 24-year-old enterprise with little international experience, can make a success of such a big acquisition and create a global property and entertainment brand is debatable, analysts say.“China has great entrepreneurs,” says Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a Beijing-based investment advisory firm. “But the question is: How will they take these companies international? Are they going to be willing to learn and adapt?”One of the biggest experiments in this area is being undertaken by Mr. Wang, a former army officer who has turned a tiny real estate venture into a national brand. Wanda, which started in Dalian, a northeastern city, and moved its headquarters to Wanda Plaza in Beijing, is a colossus with 183 million square feet of land under development or operation.In 1988, Mr. Wang — who entered the army at 15, after middle school — says he left a job as a local government official in Dalian and borrowed $80,000 to start a business he now describes as a “sprinting elephant.”Wang Yongping, founder of the China Commercial Real Estate Association, described the chairman of Wanda as usually a step ahead of other Chinese real estate barons.“He always has a vision,” Mr. Wang, no relation, said. “When everybody was doing housing property, he jumped out to focus on commercial property. When everybody was chasing commercial property, he was eyeing culture and tourism — the industries that the government is stressing and cultivating.”That few Chinese companies have managed to establish global brands is of little concern to Wanda’s chairman. And buying a stake in a company focused on a quintessentially American experience — moviegoing — seemed hardly daunting for a man who survived the Cultural Revolution, a period of social and political madness in China.“In setting goals and executing a strategy, Wanda is sophisticated,” said Mr. Wang, the Wanda chairman. “We have good systems and departments. If targets are not reached, a yellow light goes off.”Mr. Wang usually hits his targets, he says. The company has experienced 30 percent growth in the last year, even in a down market. And he promises that by 2015 the Wanda Group will have overall revenue of about $30 billion.Which raises the question: Why invest in the United States cinema market at a time of weakness, when box office receipts are sluggish and American film producers are looking to China?Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Wang’s acquisition of AMC was political, an effort to curry favor with Chinese leaders, who are pushing their nation to enhance its influence by exporting cultural products. Others contend that Mr. Wang is eager to establish himself as China’s first global corporate chief.“This is kind of a statement deal for him,” said an executive familiar with the Wanda-AMC talks, but not authorized to discuss them. “He’s coming out of China, and this is an area he has great interest in. He kept emphasizing he just wants to learn how cinemas are operated in the U.S. It’s not just about the money.”But to pull off the deal, Wanda needed plenty of that: more than $3 billion in cash, including $500 million it has promised to invest in AMC in North America. Financing such a big deal in a tough credit environment, and with China’s property market in a slump, was some feat. In the end, much of the cash came from China’s big, state-controlled banks.To ensure that the deal succeeds, Mr. Wang said he would keep AMC’s management in place with long-term pay incentives, and invest heavily in renovating older American theaters in an effort to bolster revenue.Asked whether AMC would show films that the Chinese government found offensive, such as one dealing with the contentious issue of rebellions in Tibet, Mr. Wang said he would not interfere with decisions by his management team in the United States.He also dismissed speculation in China that his ties to Bo Xilai, the fallen Politburo leader who also got his start in Dalian, could harm the Wanda Group.“We knew each other, and were very familiar with one another,” he said. “But it was just a working relationship.

"'12-05-25,'0','In 1979, Mr. Hernandez worked at a bodega near where Etan’s bus stopped every morning. It was a seedy place, a 77-year-old man who has lived in the neighborhood for decades recalled on Thursday. Walking in, you sensed a “distinctly hostile feeling,” he said. He said the neighborhood rumor was that there was cockfighting in the basement.Later, Mr. Hernandez moved to South Jersey. Investigators assigned to the Patz case had focused on him as a suspect in the past, one official said. A tip that was called in last month prompted them to circle back.In the 33 years since that morning, New York has lived under four mayors, the nation under six presidents. The Patzes’ SoHo neighborhood has gone from gritty to glamorous. Even the street signs on the corner he apparently never reached — grimy yellow with black letters in 1979 — have been changed.Some things have become commonplace: Children’s faces on milk cartons and on breaks during television newscasts. Etan’s was one of the first.Some things have been added to the national calendar and the national consciousness: National Missing Children’s Day, observed since 1983 on May 25, the day on which he vanished.But some constants have remained. Etan’s father, Stanley K. Patz, said last year that he still sent copies of the “missing” poster to the man he considered responsible, a former mental patient named Jose A. Ramos, against whom Mr. Patz won a wrongful death case in 2004. On the back, he always wrote the same eight words: “What did you do to my little boy?”Today the little boy in the Eastern Airlines cap would be approaching middle age — he would turn 40 in October. But some of the touchstones of his life are long gone. Eastern Airlines went out of business in 1991, when Etan would have been 18.And Etan was declared dead in 2001, when he would have been 29.For a while after he disappeared, people in New York hunted for Etan Patz everywhere: on every playground, in every schoolyard, at every deli counter where children could buy candy — even in neighborhoods in which he had probably never spent much time. On the Upper West Side, on the Upper East Side, they looked for him.Years passed. There were impossible-to-ignore reminders that kept the case in the public consciousness. In 1985, when he would have been 12 1/2, a photograph of his face filled a giant electronic screen at Broadway and 47th Street twice every hour. “Last seen 5-25-79,” the caption said. “Still missing.”Six months later, at the request of investigators in New York, Etan’s photograph was published in an Israeli newspaper.No leads came in that panned out. Still the file in the Missing Persons Squad remained open. “Do I remember?” the squad’s commander said in 1988, when Etan would have turned 16. “Do you remember World War II?”Time and again, the police walked down the block from the family’s loft between Greene and Wooster Streets, just as Etan was to have done. He was to have boarded the bus at the corner of West Broadway. But the bus driver and other children on the bus said he never showed up that morning.The reports of sightings began all too soon.Howard Belasco, the manager of a lumber store in the neighborhood, said Etan and another youngster had walked in “around 4:30 or 5 p.m.” on the day he vanished. “They were outside playing in a Dumpster, pulling out scraps of lumber, and then they came here and bought two boxes of nails,” Mr. Belasco said the day after Etan disappeared after recognizing him from a school picture the police had passed out. “Then they went around back and took some more scraps, then they disappeared.”The police then said on May 27 that Etan had probably not been one of those two youngsters.Officers fanned out from the Patzes’ loft, where detectives stood around a table and listened in on the family’s telephone calls. “We’re doing a floor-by-floor, wall-by-wall, rooftop-by-rooftop, backyard-by-backyard search,” said Deputy Inspector Dennis Ryan, who initially led the investigation.A police helicopter circled overhead. Bloodhounds and their state trooper handlers tried to pick up his scent from the lumber store. Self-proclaimed psychics who said they had visions of the little boy were consulted. By the end of the following week, the police said that they had 300 detectives canvassing the city and that their search had taken them to New Jersey. One called the hunt for Etan the “No. 1 priority of the Police Department.”Detectives sifted through thousands of leads from people who thought they had seen Etan. In 1982, when Etan would have been 10, a newspaper story prompted a retired cabdriver to come forward, saying he had picked up Etan and his apparent abductor that morning. The retired driver’s explanation for keeping quiet in 1979 was: “I had problems of my own. I didn’t want to get involved.”He described a ride that was as troubling as it was brief. He said the man had not given him an address to go to, just a terse instruction: Drive. Before long, he said, “the kid started to scream, saying that they weren’t going the right way to school.”The man told the taxi driver to pull over, and he and the boy hopped out. The driver was so flummoxed, he did not collect any money for the trip.By 2001, Mr. Ramos had emerged as the prime suspect. Mr. Ramos, who has been in prison in Pennsylvania since 1987, is scheduled to be released later this year. But in 2004, in the lawsuit brought by Etan’s parents, a Manhattan judge ruled that Mr. Ramos had been responsible for the boy’s death.Mr. Ramos was said to have admitted that he was with Etan the day he vanished, but he denied abducting and killing him.But last month, the authorities searched a basement that had been used as a workshop by Othniel Miller, a handyman who had been considered a possible suspect early on. In her book “After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive,” Lisa R. Cohen wrote that Mr. Miller had paid Etan for doing chores the night before he vanished.She also wrote that in the early stages of the hunt for Etan, “there was talk of jackhammering” the cement floor in the basement “in search of a body” underneath. She said Mr. Miller had countered that if anyone did that, “someone’s going to have to pay for it.”The authorities backed off until last month, and after several days of digging, they left, saying they had found no sign of a body. But that search, the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said Thursday, prompted a call from a someone who led the police to Mr. Hernandez.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','Opens on Friday in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Dallas and Houston.At about seven times the length of the Iliad and the Odyssey combined, the great Indian epic the Mahabharata has story to burn. The 96-minute animated feature “Arjun — The Warrior Prince” obviously can’t tell the whole complicated tale (that would take weeks), so it concentrates on the life of young Arjun, one of five brothers who lose their kingdom in a game of dice, go into exile and then fight to regain it.An action movie, “Arjun” takes story liberties, but not always in the service of clarity. (The script is by Rajesh Devraj.) Children will probably be confused, and adults familiar with the tale may wonder where all the good bits went. We see Arjun win the green-eyed Draupadi, but never learn that she becomes the wife of his brothers too. (And Draupadi’s disrobing? Gone.)If you could separate spectacle from story, “Arjun” wouldn’t be half bad. Directed by Arnab Chaudhuri and accompanied by Vishal and Shekhar’s propulsive songs, the film is fast and exciting, weaving together different types of animation: a cartoony Disneyish style with a more “real” live-action look, a flat appearance with a more dimensional one.Two scenes stand out: To win Draupadi, Arjun does a high dive into a pool, where, below the surface, he shoots a fish with an arrow, tracking it only by its shadow on the top of the water. Later, when those dice are tossed up, the camera follows them; the whole world spins, turning upside down — as indeed it soon will in the epic — in a swirl of color and shapes.“Arjun” ends just as the war to win back the kingdom is about to begin.

"'12-05-25,'0','Mitt Romney claims that he is a job creator and that, if elected, his private equity firm experience will enable him to do the same on a national basis.While extolling the productivity gains shown by companies acquired by private equity firms, Mr. Brooks concedes that “the overall effect on employment is modest.” For, in the race to become more efficient, many companies have served only one stakeholder, the stockholder, while ignoring all others, in particular, their employees and society at large. Yet, it is these other stakeholders who must ultimately be served if these businesses expect to have a market for their output.Private equity firm techniques adopted by many other companies — corporate downsizing, wage stagnation owing to a failure to share the fruits of productivity gains with the work force, the failure to retrain displaced workers — have combined to reduce demand for our nation’s goods and services. The last thing we need is to apply the techniques of private equity firms like Bain Capital to the government-dominated sectors of our economy, as Mr. Brooks proposes.In a Jan. 12 column, David Brooks correctly observed, “Romney’s Bain success is largely irrelevant to the question of whether he could be a good president.”Now Mr. Brooks defends Bain Capital and attacks the Obama campaign for unfairly criticizing it.

"'12-05-25,'0','Government indexes show real estate prices are falling in more than half of the country’s top 70 urban markets, Xi’an among them. Ratings Services and each issued reports on Thursday warning that many of China’s real estate developers face a severe cash squeeze as apartment sales slow to a crawl. The developers still owe heavy interest payments on bank .“Weak property developers in China are likely to face a test of their survival this year,” S.& P. said.China’s economy was 8.1 percent larger in the first quarter of this year than a year earlier, but virtually all of that growth took place last year. The economy barely grew in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter of 2011, and the second quarter of this year is likely to show even less growth from the preceding quarter, said Diana Choyleva, a China economist in the office of Lombard Street Research.The also warned on Wednesday of a slowdown.“Clearly the economy is much, much weaker than most people thought until recently,” Ms. Choyleva said. “They have a real mess on their hands.”China is the world’s largest importer of a long list of commodities, like iron ore and copper. It has also been a big buyer of European factory equipment and luxury goods. The United States economy is much less exposed to a slowdown in the Chinese economy, with exports of goods to China representing less than 0.7 percent of American economic output last year.Benefiting from heavy government spending on highways and other infrastructure and voracious demand for apartments as poor laborers arrived from the countryside, China’s inland cities had continued to expand even when the rest of the world’s economy fell into serious difficulty in late 2008 and early 2009. But now the economic troubles are evident here in Xi’an, an economic cornerstone of northwestern China that serves as one of the country’s largest transportation and distribution hubs and a manufacturing center for everything from bulldozers to aircraft components.Sun Yufang, a wholesale dealer in Xi’an in ovens, ranges and water heaters, said that residents had nearly stopped outfitting new apartments or redecorating old ones.“We didn’t really feel the global financial crisis, but this year, we’ve really felt it — I don’t see a solution unless people start buying,” Ms. Sun said, sitting in a spacious shop with no customers in sight.Premier expressed concern last weekend about the economy after an inspection tour to Wuhan in east-central China. He then led a cabinet meeting on Wednesday that produced the government’s strongest statement yet.The government should “place stabilizing growth in a more important position and carry out pre-emptive policy adjustments and fine-tuning more forcefully according to the changing situation,” the cabinet statement said.An explanatory statement from the official Xinhua news agency drafted on Wednesday and posted on the Chinese government’s Web site on Thursday cited Zhang Liqun, a senior economist advising the cabinet, as saying that, “the sharp slowdown in the economy has aroused attention from policy makers.”A preliminary reading of a monthly purchasing managers index showed that manufacturing had continued to weaken in May, with the index falling to 48.7 from 49.3 in April; a figure below 50 indicates a slowing sector.The cabinet called for stimulating the economy through faster construction of railroads, schools, clinics and other infrastructure. With the Chinese economy still heavily dependent on investment spending, some economists are optimistic that China can quickly reignite growth.“When you’ve got state banks lending to state enterprises to implement the state’s five-year plan, you don’t have a lot of downside to investment,” said Paul Gruenwald, a former official in Hong Kong who is now the chief economist at ANZ, one of ’s biggest banks.China has the financial resources to expand government spending sharply. China has a low ratio of debt to economic output, even when sizable local government debts are added to the national debt. Chinese banks have among the world’s lowest rates of loans to deposits, although some banking analysts have questioned whether many loans by state-owned banks to politically influential borrowers will be repaid.But with the country having finished building much of its infrastructure, it is having a harder time finding further projects that can pass cost-benefit analyses. The Chinese interior has been the biggest beneficiary of infrastructure spending over the last decade, but now shows signs of catching up with the more developed coast.The Xi’an airport opened a third terminal and another runway on May 3, giving it the capacity to handle as many passengers as John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, despite considerably smaller daily traffic. Bullet trains connect Xi’an to Zhengzhou, nearly 300 miles to the east, while no fewer than three concentric beltways encircle Xi’an, although traffic jams continue to bedevil the ancient city’s core.One more big infrastructure project remains: the city opened its first subway line late last year, plans to finish a second line later this year and has begun construction on a third. But crisscross the city these days and there are fewer streets torn up for building projects than in the past.At the same time, residential real estate construction has slowed sharply after the government imposed a stringent ban last year on the purchase of multiple homes in an effort to discourage speculation and make housing more affordable. Wei Li, a real estate broker in downtown Xi’an, said that prices had fallen 20 percent since the start of this year for new apartments in the hundreds of towers under construction on the city’s periphery, but she said downtown real estate prices were stable. Construction material vendors here, however, say that apartment prices are also falling in downtown neighborhoods.Developers across the country have responded to the drop in prices by abandoning the longstanding practice of floodlighting construction sites and working around the clock. They have cut back to one daytime shift, sharply reducing the demand for construction workers.“It’s getting harder and harder to find work,” complained Li Bo, a construction worker here.Xi’an is best known in the West as an ancient capital of China, a Silk Road entrepôt that is home to the terra-cotta warriors. But modern-day Xi’an also plays an important role in the Chinese economy as a regional economic hub with eight million residents.Store owners and other traders from across northwestern China converge at large covered markets here to buy goods, making Xi’an one of the best places to take the pulse of China’s interior. And now, that pulse feels weak for consumer spending.Until late March, Ma Xiechuan sold pork at his butcher shop here by hacking large chunks and handing them to lines of customers to take home and carefully slice and dice. But with sales now down by a third, he has so much extra time that he deftly wields his steel cleaver to produce thin slivers, ready for the customer’s wok.“It’s the fastest downturn in business I’ve seen in more than 10 years here,” Mr. Ma said.Yian Leilei, a wholesaler of tablecloths and car seat covers, said that sales nose-dived after Chinese New Year on Jan. 23 and had not recovered. Wang Heiyen, a wholesaler of insulated food and beverage containerssaid his sales were sliding steadily and customers were becoming ever pickier. Ding Lei, the co-owner of a paint and plaster store said his sales had halved since the start of this year. “People are just not buying apartments,” Mr. Ding said. “It was O.K. in 2009. I’ve never seen it as bad as it is now.”Mayor Dong Jun of Xi’an expressed worry in a post last week on the city’s Web site.“The economic situation in the whole city from January through April this year is not that optimistic,” he said. “Maintaining the growth rate continues to be very difficult.”'"
"'12-05-25,'0','WASHINGTON — After an “especially tumultuous and momentous year” for human rights, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Thursday, the challenge in many Arab countries has shifted from breaking the back of entrenched dictatorships to protecting new freedom during the often chaotic and sometimes violent transitions that follow.Mrs. Clinton made the remarks as she released the State Department’s report on global human rights for 2011, cataloging rights abuses in 194 countries.She cited Egypt as an example, noting that the violence of last year had given way to a peaceful presidential election on Wednesday and Thursday. The demands of reformers, she said, were “making a difference as Egyptians are going to the polls to determine for the first time in their history who their leaders will be.” Some chronic abusers of human rights remained at the bottom of the department’s list: Iran, North Korea, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Syria, Belarus and China.The report included tough words about Chinese rights practices, saying that conditions there had deteriorated. In 2008, the report dropped China from its list of the worst abusers. But the new report cites “repression and coercion” of rights advocates, tight restrictions on political dissidents, curbs on journalists and on Internet access, and “severe cultural and religious repression” of ethnic Uighurs and Tibetans.The recent diplomatic incident involving the Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng occurred after the time frame covered in the report. Still, Michael H. Posner, an assistant secretary of state, said that it demonstrated how the United States could criticize foreign nations for human rights shortcomings even while cooperating with them on economic or security issues.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','Gasoline prices on the East Coast have fallen in part because one large refinery in Philadelphia that was scheduled to be closed by Sunoco at the end of June is now expected to remain open through at least most of the summer while the private equity firm the Carlyle Group negotiates to form a joint venture. Prospects for future gasoline prices in the region have also improved since Delta Air Lines bought an idled Pennsylvania refinery, which will probably produce more gasoline for the market by October.On the West Coast, however, particularly around Los Angeles, gasoline prices have actually risen in recent weeks because several refineries were forced to suspend operations because of power failures and repairs to compressors. But those problems are expected to be cleared up by June, and energy experts expect prices to ease afterward.The diverging refinery situations are reflected in the wide gap in gasoline prices from one coast to the other. The average price for regular gasoline on Thursday was $3.92 a gallon in New York but $4.31 a gallon in California.The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline on Thursday was $3.67, nearly 30 cents below the high for the year reached in early April. A year ago, the average prices stood at $3.85 a gallon.Energy analysts say prices this summer should remain a few cents lower than last year but about 75 cents a gallon above the level in the summer of 2010. The economic effect of the lower prices is tentative because prices could easily surge again.“Compared to 2009 and 2010, these are still stiff prices,” said Tom Kloza, the chief oil analyst at Oil Price Information Service. “People talk about this wonderful dividend, but measured against history, gasoline still represents a considerable slice of consumer disposable income.”Mr. Kloza projected that the national average price for regular gasoline during the Memorial Day weekend would be at most only a few pennies below the current price, and would range from $3.50 to $3.75 for the rest of the summer.Light sweet crude, the benchmark of New York trading, remained stubbornly above $100 a barrel for most of the last year. In recent weeks it has fallen to just above $90, and remained near that level on Thursday.The spike in oil prices last year was because of the turmoil in North Africa and the Middle East, especially the loss of more than a million barrels a day of high-quality crude from Libya during the insurrection against the Qaddafi dictatorship. After easing for a few months, prices surged again early this year over fears that Iran might block supplies from passing through the Strait of Hormuz in response to tightening European and United States sanctions or the possibility of an Israeli or American attack on Iranian nuclear plants.The sanctions have reduced Iranian exports, but increased exports from Libya, Saudi Arabia and Iraq have so far more than compensated for the drop-off in China, India and other Asian countries that have relied on supplies from Iran. Total OPEC output of oil and other liquid fuels is at a record high of 37.5 million barrels a day, despite the loss of Iranian exports.But oil analysts warn that prices could surge again if instability interrupts production in any number of shaky producing nations. Traders were watching how a second round of talks between members of the United Nations Security Council, Germany and Iran would proceed this week, but there appeared to have been little progress. Hopes that Iran would be willing to curb its nuclear program had helped send oil prices lower, but further tightening of sanctions on Iran could send crude prices higher in the months ahead.“If there are any problems on the supply side, as in Iran, Libya or Nigeria, then prices will be right back up,” said Michael C. Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research. “Global inventories are not that high, and production is pretty much flat out in OPEC. A lot depends on how negotiations go with Iran.”While production in the United States is about a million barrels a day higher than last year, now reaching 5.9 million barrels a day, several other international producers outside of OPEC are not doing nearly as well. Unrest in South Sudan has halted nearly half a million barrels a day of production. Offshore oil spills have dented output in China and Brazil, and production from the North Sea continues to decline.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','TACOMA, Wash. — A lot has come down the pike since the summer of 2008, which for many Americans may already feel like the closed chapter of an old book. But here on the West Coast there is an unhappy echo: gasoline prices.One thin dime separates the current average price of a regular gallon of gas from Tacoma’s historic high of $4.37 that was set in late June 2008. And while most Americans have caught a break over the last year, with the average price for a gallon of regular falling 15 cents compared with this time in 2011, in Western Washington it was up 32 cents as of Thursday, according to the Oil Price Information Service, a petroleum-pricing research group.A bottleneck in the archipelago of oil refineries that supply the region is the short explanation; some are closed for maintenance, and one here in Washington is temporarily disabled after a fire. The resulting pincers — a still-tough economy compounded by stinging transportation costs — have clipped wallets in places like Tacoma, a port city south of Seattle still tied to the world of timber and shipping.A few hours chatting around the pumps at a local gas stop on Monday underscored the pain.“Things are a little, little bit better than they were,” said Dennis Barker, a former construction worker who started a home-renovation business about a month ago with a friend. “But I’m spending more — I’m going around trying to drum up some business,” he said. The $50 a week he spends on gasoline imposes strict efficiencies, Mr. Barker said, on everything else.For people on fixed or reduced incomes, lingering high prices create a ripple that changes patterns of life in many ways, large and small. David Moceri, who was laid off this spring from a mattress factory, now buys no more than $10 of gasoline at a time. Harvey Johnson, a self-employed handyman, used to carry his handyman tools in a pickup truck from job to job.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','Mr. Cameron has repeatedly rejected calls by the opposition Labour Party and by some economists to scale back austerity measures, arguing that government spending cuts helped Britain keep its borrowing costs low and investor confidence high. The prime minister has said that the double-dip recession was the result of higher energy prices, a dearth of bank lending and, to a large extent, the economic crisis in the euro zone, Britain’s largest export market.Statistics released last week showed that the euro zone’s economy avoided slipping into recession in the first quarter, if only because the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the period, pulling up the average for the currency area. Britain is a member of the European Union but is outside the euro zone.Mr. Cameron irked some European leaders over the weekend when he weighed in on the debate about the euro zone crisis by calling on member states to do more to solve it.“What would be bad for Greece, bad for Europe and bad for the world is if we just allowed the can to be kicked further down the road with an inconclusive outcome,” Mr. Cameron said in Chicago after a meeting of the leaders of the Group of 8 large industrialized countries.The revised economic data give more ammunition to those who oppose the government’s budget cuts, which have resulted in pay freezes and tens of thousands of job cuts throughout the public sector. But Mr. Cameron and George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, have said they will stick to their program to bring down the government deficit. They point to the relatively low interest rates Britain pays on its debt, and praise from the major debt rating agencies, as evidence that their plan is working.“Our complacent and out-of-touch prime minister and chancellor have spent the last week claiming their plan is on track, but these figures show that Britain’s double-dip recession is even deeper than first thought,” said Ed Balls, the Labour Party’s spokesman on fiscal issues. “What more evidence can David Cameron and George Osborne need that their policies have failed and that they now need a change of course and a Plan B for growth and jobs?”The government has rejected Labour’s repeated calls to spur economic growth by spending more, arguing that it was the previous Labour government’s excessive spending before the economic crisis that caused Britain’s difficulties in the first place.Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, backed the austerity plan this week but also said Britain would need to consider incremental policy changes, which could include more stimulus from the Bank of England, if the economic recovery continued to falter.The Bank of England decided this month to halt a stimulus program that included the purchase of government bonds as it shifted its focus from economic recovery and back to controlling inflation, which has been running above the central bank’s 2 percent target. But minutes of the most recent meeting of the central bank’s policy committee showed that members remained open to expanding the stimulus program should the economy worsen.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','In remarks he made shortly before leaving China on Saturday, Mr. Chen said he was worried that his relatives, and the half-dozen activists who had helped him evade security agents in Beijing, would be punished after his departure.In the unwritten deal that paved the way for Mr. Chen to leave the embassy, Chinese officials said they would investigate the local Shandong officials who had orchestrated his 19 months of house arrest — and the retributive beatings periodically administered to him and his wife.It is unclear whether such an investigation has begun.“There is still some hope, but if nothing is done, it shows that these were just empty promises,” said Wang Songlian, a researcher at Chinese Human Rights Defenders.If the activists instrumental in Mr. Chen’s escape have so far avoided official prosecution, they are not exactly free. Most are under some form of residential surveillance, including Guo Yushan, a scholar and activist who Mr. Chen says drove him from Shandong to Beijing, and He Peirong, a former English teacher from Nanjing who was involved in helping him after he made it past the walls of his village.Others, like Teng Biao, a lawyer who helped persuade Mr. Chen to leave China, have been forced to leave Beijing, at least temporarily.So far it appears that Mr. Chen’s relatives in rural Shandong have suffered the most. In a video he recorded and posted online, Chen Guangfu, the older brother who arrived in Beijing on Wednesday, said he had been whipped and stomped on by angry interrogators who wanted to know how a blind man could have evaded dozens of guards and scaled several high walls. The abuse lasted 48 hours, he said.But it is Chen Guangfu’s son, Chen Kegui, 32, who stands to lose the most. He is being held at a detention center in Yinan County and faces attempted homicide charges. According to lawyers whom the family asked to defend him, Chen Kegui slashed several officers who broke down the door of his family’s home shortly before midnight on April 27. He claims that the men did not identify themselves as police officials and were beating his mother. Chen Kegui went into hiding but was later apprehended.The authorities have rebuffed the dozen or so lawyers who stepped forward to represent Chen Kegui. One said his license was revoked, and several others claimed travel bans or threats had prevented them from traveling to Shandong.The two lawyers left standing, Mr. Ding and Si Weijiang, prominent legal defenders from Shanghai, said officials in Yinan County refused to allow them to meet with Mr. Chen after they traveled there last week. The local Public Security Bureau told them their would-be client had already chosen to accept a public defender, the lawyers said.Mr. Ding rejected that contention, saying that Chen Kegui had told his wife to hire lawyers, and that it was unlikely he would have accepted a local government-appointed lawyer. They appealed the decision in a letter they sent to the authorities this week but have yet to hear back.“Our greatest fear is that in the meantime he will be tortured and forced to give a confession,” Mr. Ding said.'"

"'12-05-25,'0','“India” and “change” were once virtual antonyms: old India hands returned again and again in large part because the subcontinent was so dependably different from the West. But since 1991, when a financial crisis forced India’s government to devalue the rupee, lower import barriers and relax controls on private investment, things have nearly reversed themselves. As the journalist Akash Kapur demonstrates in his lucid, balanced new book, “India Becoming,” his homeland now seems almost synonymous with change.Kapur is especially qualified to assess the contrasts and contradictions all that change has brought. The son of an American mother and an Indian father, he was raised on the outskirts of Auroville, a utopian international community in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Sent away to boarding school in the United States at 16, he studied at Harvard and Oxford, then returned to South India 12 years later, in 2003. His lively “Letter From India” appeared for several years in The International Herald Tribune and the online edition of The New York Times.At first, he was dazzled. While the friends he’d left behind in America fretted about holding on to their jobs, it seemed to him that every other young person he met in India was eager to quit his or hers to become an entrepreneur. The Indian economy was then growing at about 8 percent, led by the expanding service and I.T. industries, and the country’s mood was “giddy, exuberant,” “ardently capitalist,” and aspirational. “For the first time — the first time in my life, but arguably in India’s history, too,” he writes, “people dared to imagine an existence for themselves that was unburdened by the past and tradition. India, I felt, had started to dream.”But, over time, as he settled permanently back into the countryside, married and had two sons, he found himself at least as appalled by the new India as he was admiring. For all the restaurants and yoga centers, colleges and gated communities that now lined the newly blacktopped country roads he’d known as a boy — and despite two decades of new money and new opportunities — poverty stubbornly persists. More than 300 million of India’s 1.2 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day, he tells us; more people have cellphones than access to a toilet. And heedless growth steadily despoils the environment; nearly half of India’s land is eroded; at least 70 percent of its surface water is polluted and, according to one recent study, India’s air is now the most toxic on earth — a fact vividly brought home to Kapur and his family one spring when the smoky reek of thousands of tons of smoldering untreated garbage dumped outside the town of Pondicherry seeped into his home and sickened one of his ­children.His conclusions about all this are rarely surprising and often reiterative: we are told too many times that change comes at a cost; that “unrelenting optimism” is “delusional”; that “India could often feel like two nations.” But Kapur is determinedly fair-minded, neither an apologist nor a scold, and he is a wonderfully empathetic listener, willing patiently to visit and revisit a large cast of men and women over several years to learn how they are benefiting from — and being battered by — the change going on all around them.He is on familiar ground when following the careers of middle-class young people who’ve left behind the small towns and ancient customs that had given shape to their lives in order to build wholly new ones in the brand-new big-city world of shopping malls and office towers. Hari, a gay I.T. worker in Chennai, finally comes out to his friends but can’t bring himself to confide in his parents. Selvi, a call-­center worker in the same city, disappointed to find that most of the Americans with whom she speaks each night are “rude and also quite stupid,” suddenly finds herself accused by neighbors and relatives of being a loose woman simply because one of her flatmates is found to have been involved in a love affair.'"

"'12-05-25,'0','At the chief justice’s trial, evidence was presented that he had more than $28 million in foreign currency deposits. That figure was disallowed, and prosecutors revised it to an estimate of $10 million to $12 million. Prosecutors have struggled to determine his assets because the Philippines has extremely stringent secrecy laws governing foreign currency deposits.“I never at any time had 10, 11, 12 million dollars,” he testified on Friday.He presented a signed waiver to the court that would give government authorities the right to open his foreign currency deposits. The Senate rejected the waiver and instead relied on his testimony regarding the balances in his bank accounts.Chief Justice Corona testified that his $2.4 million in deposits came from more than three decades of savings as well as his earnings as a corporate attorney before entering government service. “We’re talking here of more than 35 years of compounded interest,” he said.The chief justice said that the country’s foreign currency deposit law, which states that access to information about such deposits can only be granted by the person whose name is on the account, permitted him to not report the $2.4 million.In the Philippines, senior officials are required to file a statement of assets, liabilities and net worth each year in order to verify that they are not enriching themselves from their government positions. One of the impeachment articles against the chief justice states that he under-declared his assets on this form.On Tuesday, when Chief Justice Corona testified for the first time in his defense, he walked out of the hearing after giving a statement that ran more than three hours, in which he denied all wrongdoing. The Senate president, who is presiding over the trial, ordered the sergeant-at-arms to block the defendant’s exit. He was later allowed to leave.On Friday, the chief justice apologized to the court for his abrupt departure but said it was for medical reasons and that he was taken immediately to the hospital after his testimony. He said he suffers from hypoglycemia and heart problems.The prosecution and defense are expected to give closing arguments on Monday.

"'12-05-25,'0','President Dilma Rousseff on Friday vetoed portions of Brazil’s new Forest Code, a bill drafted to open big areas of protected forests to large-scale agriculture. The decision by Ms. Rousseff, which removes 12 articles from the bill, alters legislation sought by powerful agricultural groups. The bill had provoked outrage among environmentalists, some business leaders and cultural icons, especially over a provision that effectively granted amnesty to landowners who illegally deforested some areas. Responding to these concerns, Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said the president’s line-item vetoes ruled out amnesty. Still, Ms. Rousseff’s action fell short of the expectations of environmental groups, which had wanted her to veto the entire bill. Details about the changes to the bill were sparse on Friday, with Brazil’s powerful Agriculture and Livestock Confederation withholding comment. The official text of Ms. Rousseff’s alterations, which include dozens of suggested changes to the bill in addition to the vetoed portions, is expected to be published on Monday.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','After 13 years of backing the Labour Party, Mr. Murdoch switched support of his newspapers to Mr. Cameron’s Conservatives in the 2010 election that brought that party to power. In addition, Mr. Cameron has had longstanding ties, and in some cases close personal friendships, with top Murdoch executives, including Mr. Murdoch himself. That has led critics to say that the Conservatives reached a “quid pro quo” understanding that involved a promise of support for the BSkyB bid in return for Mr. Murdoch’s election backing.In the television interview, Mr. Cameron said he believed that Mr. Hunt had acted “impartially.” He said he gave the task to Mr. Hunt because of circumstances “which were not of my making.” This was a reference to the controversy that erupted when the trade and investment minister, Vince Cable, told undercover reporters for The Daily Telegraph that he had “declared war” on Mr. Murdoch over the BSkyB bid, and planned to block it. Mr. Cable is a leading figure with the Liberal Democrats, the left-of-center junior partners to Mr. Cameron’s Conservatives in the coalition government.“Some people are saying there was some great conspiracy between me and Rupert Murdoch to do some big deal to back them in return for support,” Mr. Cameron said. “Rupert Murdoch has said that’s not true, James Murdoch has said that’s not true, I have said that’s not true. There was no great conspiracy.”“As I have said,” he added, “I think the whole relationship between politicians on the one hand and the press on the other got too close.”The Labour Party’s deputy leader, Harriet Harman, dismissed Mr. Cameron’s remarks, saying that the prime minister knew when he gave Mr. Hunt oversight of the takeover bid that he was not “an impartial arbiter.”“David Cameron might think that he can brazenly say ‘no regrets’ and this will somehow draw a line under it, but people will not accept that,” she said.A crucial test for Mr. Hunt will come next Thursday, when he is to testify before the judicial inquiry, which Mr. Cameron ordered last year when public and political outrage was running at a fever pitch over revelations about a widespread pattern of cellphone hacking and other forms of newsroom wrongdoing at two Murdoch-owned tabloid newspapers, the daily Sun and the weekend News of the World, now defunct. The wrongdoing is purported to have involved bribing police officers and other government officials to disclose confidential information. Mounting public and political outrage over the tabloids’ excesses prompted Mr. Murdoch to formally abandon the BSkyB bid last July.Testimony at the inquiry on Friday appeared to support Mr. Hunt’s insistence that he did not seek to manipulate the regulatory oversight of the BSkyB bid. The top civil servant in the Department of Culture, Media and Sport that Mr. Hunt leads, Jonathan Stevens, said he had been “particularly struck” by Mr. Hunt’s understanding of the impartiality required when he was appointed to oversee the bid.“To reach a fair and unbiased decision was the secretary of state’s overriding concern to my observation, throughout the process,” he said.On Friday, Scotland Yard announced the arrest of the 30th person, a 37-year-old female News Corporation employee, in its investigation into illegal payments to public officials. About 50 editors, reporters and investigators working for the Murdoch titles have been arrested in several concurrent police investigations. Six of those, including Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of the Murdoch newspaper subsidiary in Britain, News International, have been charged with criminal offenses.'"
"'12-05-25,'0','People have snickered for years about “Cats,” suggesting that the reason the show became the second-longest-running hit in Broadway history (after “The Phantom of the Opera”) was that the dance-driven extravaganza was an ideal attraction for tourists who did not speak English. But I suspect that some who dismiss this musical as mere spectacle have never actually seen or heard it. Maybe it is time they did.Certainly, they will see a capably performed “Cats” at the Gateway Playhouse, which previously presented the musical in 2004. It is directed and choreographed this time by Jacob Brent, who performed in “Cats” on Broadway, in London and in the DVD version. The current revival in Bellport is a smaller-scale but otherwise fairly faithful rendition of the show, which ran for 7,485 performances at the Winter Garden Theater beginning in 1982, a year after it opened in London.As a bonus, Mr. Brent’s lively production stars Ken Page, a member of the original Broadway cast, who majestically recreates his leading role as Old Deuteronomy, the patriarch of those kitties cavorting around a moonlit junkyard.More a fanciful suite of songs and dances than a traditional musical with a story — there is no spoken dialogue and scarcely more plot — “Cats” is drawn from the whimsical verse of T. S. Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” and a few other choice morsels of the poet’s works. Arranged as a dozen musical vignettes that celebrate various feline characters and their midnight revels, the show reaches its high point when the bedraggled glamour puss, Grizabella, beatifically ascends to wherever good cats go in their next lives.Admittedly, it is a simple scenario, and some of the doings get precious, but Andrew Lloyd Webber’s score features a typically hummable assortment of glowing anthems, bouncy British music-hall ditties, clever parodies and syncopated marches crowned by that now-and-forever standard “Memory.” Frisky or wistful, the melodies cling to the ear, and their rhythmic vigor rarely flags. A six-member orchestra led by Jeffrey Buchsbaum delivers the score with considerable resonance.The revival is modeled after Trevor Nunn’s Broadway production. According to the program, the show’s nearly ceaseless movement is based on Gillian Lynne’s original choreography, which Mr. Brent satisfyingly replicates with all of its cat-characteristic prowling, slinking and preening behavior, with occasional cartwheeling acrobatics. The company has obviously been well drilled in the dances, and it moves energetically through the complex paces.'"

"'12-05-26,'0','President Dilma Rousseff on Friday vetoed portions of Brazil’s new Forest Code, a bill drafted to open big areas of protected forests to large-scale agriculture. The decision by Ms. Rousseff, which removes 12 articles from the bill, alters legislation sought by powerful agricultural groups. The bill had provoked outrage among environmentalists, some business leaders and cultural icons, especially over a provision that effectively granted amnesty to landowners who illegally deforested some areas. Responding to these concerns, Environment Minister Izabella Teixeira said the president’s line-item vetoes ruled out amnesty. Still, Ms. Rousseff’s action fell short of the expectations of environmental groups, which had wanted her to veto the entire bill.

The official text of Ms. Rousseff’s alterations, which include dozens of suggested changes to the bill in addition to the vetoed portions, is expected to be published on Monday.'"
"'12-05-26,'0','At the chief justice’s trial, evidence was presented that he had more than $28 million in foreign currency deposits. That figure was disallowed, and prosecutors revised it to an estimate of $10 million to $12 million. Prosecutors have struggled to determine his assets because the Philippines has extremely stringent secrecy laws governing foreign currency deposits.“I never at any time had 10, 11, 12 million dollars,” he testified on Friday.He presented a signed waiver to the court that would give government authorities the right to open his foreign currency deposits. The Senate rejected the waiver and instead relied on his testimony regarding the balances in his bank accounts.Chief Justice Corona testified that his $2.4 million in deposits came from more than three decades of savings as well as his earnings as a corporate attorney before entering government service. “We’re talking here of more than 35 years of compounded interest,” he said.The chief justice said that the country’s foreign currency deposit law, which states that access to information about such deposits can only be granted by the person whose name is on the account, permitted him to not report the $2.4 million.In the Philippines, senior officials are required to file a statement of assets, liabilities and net worth each year in order to verify that they are not enriching themselves from their government positions. One of the impeachment articles against the chief justice states that he under-declared his assets on this form.On Tuesday, when Chief Justice Corona testified for the first time in his defense, he walked out of the hearing after giving a statement that ran more than three hours, in which he denied all wrongdoing. The Senate president, who is presiding over the trial, ordered the sergeant-at-arms to block the defendant’s exit. He was later allowed to leave.On Friday, the chief justice apologized to the court for his abrupt departure but said it was for medical reasons and that he was taken immediately to the hospital after his testimony. He said he suffers from hypoglycemia and heart problems.The prosecution and defense are expected to give closing arguments on Monday.

"'12-05-26,'0','In 2005, however, Microsoft executives decided that “Live” could enliven its core Windows and Office brands, too. In a news briefing in 2005, Bill Gates said the goal of the company’s newly announced Live-branded services was to “make Windows, Office and Xbox further come alive for our customers at work, home and play.”What its customers were doing was spending more and more time using the Internet, and not giving much thought to the operating system that ran their PCs. But Microsoft executives apparently thought that “Live” was so powerful an adjective that it could make the Windows brand suitable for extension in all directions.In 2006, Microsoft unveiled Windows Live Messenger, a new version of what had been MSN Messenger. The company said it was the first of more than 20 Windows Live services that were being beta-tested. The message of the new brand, however, was not easily understood. “ ‘Windows Live’ — what does it mean? I can’t figure it out,” says Susan Fournier, an associate professor of marketing at Boston University. “I see no evidence of planning around a brand strategy.”Professor Fournier says Microsoft’s executives seem to have “assumed they had a brand” that could be extended to other products, “but you can’t extend something that doesn’t have resonance in people’s lives.”Rajeev Batra, a marketing professor at the University of Michigan and a co-author of a scholarly article titled “Brand Love,” says Microsoft failed to notice a basic principle: “When the same brand name is used on multiple new products, those new brands should be all similar in key ways,” he says. Trying to extend the “Live” from Xbox to Windows, with a bewilderingly diverse set of unrelated products and services was a mistake, in his view.Even if the services had been closely tied to Windows, the public didn’t perceive the brand as having the attributes that would serve associated products well. Professor Batra says, “Our brand-love research shows that loved brands reflect and symbolize deeply held personal values, such as Apple does for creativity,” he says. “Windows and Live each lack this type of brand strength.”After so many years of pushing the Windows Live brand in so many products, the company couldn’t easily drop the branding, even if executives had come around to the idea that it was misbegotten. But the imminent arrival of a new version of its flagship PC operating system, Windows 8, seems to provide cover for the change.Microsoft declined my request for an interview. But writing earlier this month on a company blog, Chris Jones, Microsoft’s vice president overseeing the Windows Live group, said: “Windows Live services and apps were built on versions of Windows that were simply not designed to be connected to a cloud service for anything other than updates, and as a result, they felt ‘bolted on’ to the experience.”With the new version of Windows, many of the Windows Live products and services that had been packaged separately will be installed as a part of the operating system. “There is no ‘separate brand’ to think about or a separate service to install,” Mr. Jones wrote.Most important, Windows 8 customers will be free to substitute non-Microsoft products and services in place of the re-branded Windows Live successors. “You’re welcome to mix and match them with the software and services you choose,” he says.“Windows Live” is disappearing. But “Live” will continue where it began, at Xbox — though the company has insisted on supersizing its rendering to “Xbox LIVE.”And if Microsoft executives wonder what kept the Windows brand extension from taking permanent hold, they should be told ever so gently that it’s a matter of the heart: the brand love just wasn’t there.'"

"'12-05-26,'0','Intrade is based in Dublin, though many of its traders live in the United States. People bet on contracts stating that a particular event will take place by a given time, and have traded more than $68 million worth of contracts this year through Thursday, according to Carl Wolfenden, exchange operations manager for the Web site.Like stock or bond prices, its predictions, often expressed as probabilities, are derived by matching buyers and sellers. The probabilities are intended to embody the aggregate information of the market — the “wisdom of crowds,” as the author James Surowiecki calls it.The pricing mechanism used by Intrade is “virtually identical” to that of mainline financial exchanges, Mr. Wolfers says. The site’s projections are imperfect, but, he added, “empirically, they have been better than the alternatives,” including opinion polls and individual expert opinion.To put the projection of a euro breakup into context, it is a slightly higher probability than the one Intrade lists for Mitt Romney’s chances of being elected president in November. As of Friday, it was 39.4 percent, the site says. At the same time, it gave Barack Obama a 57.1 percent chance of re-election. If Mr. Romney is formally nominated as the Republican candidate, his chances would presumably rise.THERE is no evidence that Intrade is being widely used to handicap events that are important to financial markets, but it isn’t being entirely ignored, either. Ned Davis Research, the financial research firm based in Venice, Fla., has included charts of the Intrade Greek probabilities in recent reports.“They correlate very closely with the flight to safety in the sovereign bond markets,” said Will Geisdorf, senior research analyst for the firm, which also relies on many other indicators that suggest deep pessimism and “high fear readings” among investors.Analysts using other indicators share the view that the euro crisis has unmoored many markets. Largely because of Greece and the euro quandary, for example, Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last week that the yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note, which dropped to a low of 1.698 percent this month, could tumble below 1.5 percent this year. Robert P. Brown, president of the bond group at Fidelity Asset Management, said in an interview that “if the Greek issue isn’t resolved,” he wouldn’t be surprised if yields fell below current levels, perhaps even below 1.5 percent.Falling bond yields — and rising bond prices — have been accompanied by a weak stock market, a reversal of the traditional pattern, Ed Yardeni, an independent economist, wrote recently. “Prior to the financial crisis that started in 2007,” he said, “ falling bond yields tended to be associated with rising valuation multiples in the stock market. The relationship has been reversed since then.”The primary reason has been fear of contagion from a financial collapse, originally in the United States and, in recent months, in Europe. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks have deliberately lowered interest rates, but the sinking yields of relatively safe government bonds in recent weeks have overshot the expectations of most investors.Hedging against the risk of a profound disruption helps explain the premium being paid for these low-yielding assets. And, at the moment, the Greek election on June 17 is being widely viewed as a pivotal event.If that election results in a government that rejects bailout terms that have already been imposed, a Greek exit from the euro zone could follow. In the financial markets, contingency planning for such an event is well under way.Some strategists see these concerns as overblown. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, for example, says he believes that the problems of the euro zone will be with us for years — but that they are manageable. And he says that compared with last year, the stock market’s response to euro zone stress is far more restrained. United States economic data is stronger than has been widely appreciated, he says, and the stock market “could easily rebound.”It’s time, he said, “that we learn that these euro crises are buying opportunities, not a time to sell.”For the moment, however, it is bond investors who have been buying. How much further will they drive down the yields of government bonds? Intrade may provide answers.'"
"'12-05-26,'0','But experts say there is little doubt that the loss of credit is hurting smaller businesses, contributing to Spain’s troubles by raising unemployment and cutting tax revenues, making it harder to bring its budget deficit down to manageable levels. The credit loss hits particularly hard in Spain, where more than 60 percent of the economy, and 80 percent of the jobs, come from small and medium-size companies. More than 500,000 small businesses have shut down in the last few years.Mr. Moreno said that one year his company, Nomad Skateboards, sold more than $1.3 million worth of skateboards and accessories in 20 countries. These days he is looking for a buyer for his warehouse and trimming his product line to just skateboards and T-shirts. “If you cannot buy, you cannot sell,” he said. “If you cannot sell, you cannot make a profit.”Many are done in by their inability to get the credit they need to run day-to-day operations. “The savings banks that these people got their loans from don’t even exist anymore,” said Alfonso García Mora, director general of AFI, a Madrid-based financial consultancy. “Those banks have been taken over by bigger banks that aren’t interested in these kinds of loans. Or they have been taken over by banks in another region, where the local businessman is not known.”Such changes might be felt for years to come.“We have lost that local knowledge,” Mr. Mora said, “and it was crucial to deciding whether or not to make a loan. It is a problem we will have for a long time.”A few years ago, Spain had 45 regional savings banks. Today, there are only 13 and even their future is uncertain. Some have been merged with other banks and others have been taken over by bigger, more robust banks as part of efforts to reassure global markets.Many business owners say the regional bankers they worked with, sometimes for decades, may still be sitting in their chairs at the local office. But they no longer have the power to approve loans, even if they wanted to, and usually they are just delivering bad news.That means trouble in a country with 25 percent unemployment and no signs of an economic recovery. The warehouse district that is home to Mr. Moreno’s company is virtually deserted these days. Charo Albás Vives, who owns a children’s shoe company, Colores, is in similar straits. Her bank withdrew her $65,000 credit line two years ago.At first, she said, the bank wanted her to return only half of it. But after she managed that, the bank told her that she would have to repay the rest, starting immediately.Ms. Albas, who has six children, said the payments forced her family to make all sorts of economies. “We stopped going to the good grocery store,” she said. “We cut back on everything, even the heating.”It also meant that she could no longer afford the brightly colored inventory her stores were famous for. “We concentrate on white and blue now,” she said.She has survived, she said, thanks to loans from her family, though 13 of 25 stores have closed.Before the crisis, experts say, it was probably too easy to get loans; banks operated with too little equity and lent too much. Regional banks, in fact, made many of the most problematic loans to real estate developers. Now, as the banking sector struggles for survival, lending to private companies and households has dropped precipitously.“The cuts in credit have been so abrupt that some businesses not only lost specific projects they were working on,” said Carlos Ruiz Fonseca, the director of economy and innovation at Cepyme, Spain’s association of small and medium-size companies. “Some companies have just gone out of business.”Despite the mergers and injections of capital from the banking bailout and reconstruction program begun by the government in 2009, there has been no improvement in lending. According to the Bank of Spain, credit to the private sector fell in March, as it has virtually every month since the fall of 2009. Some businesses say they do not even bother asking for loans anymore.Getting loans to start a company may be even harder. “How are you going to get new businesses going if there is no one willing to take a risk and lend you money?” said Edward Hugh, an economic guru who blogs on Spain’s economy. “The problems become circular and self-perpetuating.”Banking officials agree that the restructuring has made credit harder to come by, but they say they can do little about it. “The banks here are asked to provision more capital to guard against loan losses,” an official from CECA, the Spanish savings bank association, said. “And if they are asked for more capital, then the possibilities of giving credit are limited.”Some companies have found innovative ways to do business without credit. Emilio Díaz, for instance, who founded a bus and train window factory in Zaragoza in 1969, said that rather than borrow to cover the cost of glass for a big contract, he recently made an agreement with his supplier to pay for the glass after he is paid for the windows.Other companies have found that doing business with several different banks helps. Olga Rioja Navarro, the financial director of Lacasa, a chocolate manufacturer that has lost 20 percent of its credit line, says she juggles her business among nearly a dozen banks. These days she says the banks are more likely to give the company a loan against a specific unpaid invoice, for instance, than for day-to-day expenses.Mr. Moreno and his partner, Chus Castejón, hope they can find a private investor. But they fear that their brand will lose hard-to-reclaim momentum in the fashion-conscious world of skateboarding. “Sometimes you have your moment, and then you can’t get it back,” Mr. Castejón said. “And that makes me so angry.”Recently Mr. Moreno and his wife invited some friends for dinner. The gathering was hard for Sergio Eltoro, 34, who grew up with Mr. Moreno and worked for him for nearly 10 years before being laid off recently. He loved his job and now finds himself facing questions he thought were settled, like, “What am I going to do with myself tomorrow?”'"
"'12-05-26,'0','The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have repeatedly promised to do a better job of handling the medical evaluations of wounded and disabled service members. Instead, they are doing worse.The processing of disability cases is getting slower, not faster. Efforts to ensure a “seamless transition” out of the military are falling short. Men and women are languishing without treatment, struggling to readjust to civilian lives as they cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, brain injuries, drug addiction and other service-related afflictions. The system that should be producing reliable results is mired in delays and dissatisfaction.A new report by the Government Accountability Office lays out the problem. In 2007, the two departments began combining their separate, complicated and cumbersome processes for disability evaluations into one system. The system is now in place worldwide, and officials from both departments promised the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee a year ago that it had become “more transparent, consistent and expeditious.”But the accountability office found otherwise. It said processing times for disability cases had actually gone up — to an average of 394 days for active-duty troops and 420 days for National Guard members and reservists in 2011, well over the departments’ goals of 295 and 305 days. In fiscal year 2010, 32 percent of active-duty troops and 37 percent of Guard and Reserve troops completed evaluations and received benefits within established timelines. Last year, those figures fell to a dismal 19 percent and 18 percent.What’s going on? The report says the causes are not fully understood, but it points to persistent staffing shortages, problems in collecting and reporting data, and differences among the service branches and between the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department in the way cases are diagnosed and tracked. The accountability office says it will make recommendations later this year as it sees whether promised improvements are taking hold, including a hiring push by the Army — a huge source of processing bottlenecks — and the V.A.Senator Patty Murray, chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, deserves credit for focusing attention on these and other failings in a series of hearings, including one last Wednesday that examined the bureaucratic delays. She also used the hearing to bring up disturbing reports that doctors at an Army base in Washington State had repeatedly — and wrongly — rejected soldiers’ legitimate post-traumatic stress disorder claims.'"

"'12-05-26,'0','OPENED in the summer of 1936, the hottest on record in the United States, the McCarren pool, on the Greenpoint-Williamsburg border in Brooklyn, was one of 11 unveiled across the five boroughs that sweltering season, a statement in concrete of the city’s ability to do something big in the depths of the Great Depression. McCarren’s capacity said it all: 6,800 swimmers in a 55,440-square-foot basin. Now, after being shut for 28 years, the pool and its historic bathhouse are set to reopen at the end of June.The pool complex, which sits in McCarren Park, has undergone a $50 million restoration, and the enormous rectangular pool has been turned into a giant U, with the placement of a concrete beach at its center. Painters are applying a coat of cerulean blue, a hue evoking longings of escape — from the heat, from work, from summer in the city. Grab your suit! — LISA W. FODERAROFresh Idea When it opened on the Greenpoint-Williamsburg border, the McCarren pool was an alternative to the polluted rivers and bays where New York City children had been swimming, and it drew a crowd, as seen in July 1937, left. But after sliding into disrepair, the pool closed in 1984. And while the 10 other Robert Moses-era pools were renovated in the 1980s and ’90s, McCarren remained stubbornly shut amid bitter and racially charged debates over its fate. Some in the traditionally Polish and Italian Brooklyn neighborhood lobbied to have the complex torn down. Preservationists advocated for the restoration of the bathhouse and pool to their original size. Others pressed for a smaller recreation space. Starting in 2005, the empty pool became a site for cultural events, drawing throngs (like the one above, in 2007) to listen to music, take turns on the Slip ’N Slide and generally turn the basin into a hipster playground.Redesigned In 2007, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled his PlaNYC, with a huge capital infusion for new parks and park renovations. Eight lucky properties in underserved areas were identified as “regional parks,” getting $290 million among them. McCarren was one. As seen on the plan that Rogers Marvel Architects has created, a plaza is at the center of the pool, nicknamed “the beach.” It will be flecked with spray fountains that shoot water into the air, and become a skating rink come winter. It will also create three distinct swimming areas. The new design preserves many historical details, like the grand arched entrance on Lorimer Street. The bathhouse, originally used only for changing and showering, has been converted to year-round use. One wing will house a recreation center, with a weight room, basketball court and cardio-fitness room, while the other wing will contain space for after-school programs and community meetings.Novel Uses for Objects Recovered From New York City's PastOld Touches While architectural elements were plundered during the pool’s closing, there are nods to the past. Hundreds of wire mesh baskets once used by bathers to store their belongings, were discovered in storage. So the architects dipped them in silver paint and affixed them to the ceiling of the fitness center.'"

"'12-05-26,'0','HAS the pursuit of labor productivity reached its limit?Productivity — the amount of output delivered per hour of work in the economy — is often viewed as the engine of progress in modern capitalist economies. Output is everything. Time is money. The quest for increased productivity occupies reams of academic literature and haunts the waking hours of C.E.O.’s and finance ministers. Perhaps forgivably so: our ability to generate more output with fewer people has lifted our lives out of drudgery and delivered us a cornucopia of material wealth.But the relentless drive for productivity may also have some natural limits. Ever-increasing productivity means that if our economies don’t continue to expand, we risk putting people out of work. If more is possible each passing year with each working hour, then either output has to increase or else there is less work to go around. Like it or not, we find ourselves hooked on growth.What, then, should happen when, for one reason or another, growth just isn’t to be had anymore? Maybe it’s a financial crisis. Or rising prices for resources like oil. Or the need to rein in growth for the damage it’s inflicting on the planet: climate change, deforestation, the loss of biodiversity. Maybe it’s any of the reasons growth can no longer be safely and easily assumed in any of today’s economies. The result is the same. Increasing productivity threatens full employment.One solution would be to accept the productivity increases, shorten the workweek and share the available work. Such proposals — familiar since the 1930s — are now enjoying something of a revival in the face of continuing recession. The New Economics Foundation, a British think tank, proposes a 21-hour workweek. It may not be the workaholic’s choice. But it’s certainly a strategy worth thinking about.But there’s another strategy for keeping people in work when demand stagnates. Perhaps in the long run it’s an easier and a more compelling solution: to loosen our grip on the relentless pursuit of productivity. By easing up on the gas pedal of efficiency and creating jobs in what are traditionally seen as “low productivity” sectors, we have within our grasp the means to maintain or increase employment, even when the economy stagnates.At first, this may sound crazy; we’ve become so conditioned by the language of efficiency. But there are sectors of the economy where chasing productivity growth doesn’t make sense at all. Certain kinds of tasks rely inherently on the allocation of people’s time and attention. The caring professions are a good example: medicine, social work, education. Expanding our economies in these directions has all sorts of advantages.'"
"'12-05-26,'0','Now, the degree of intimacy Greg and I mustered near the peanut butter might appear excessive, though it was encouraged by the fact that we are both guys and share, though not with Thoreau, the experience of raising daughters.It was also made possible by the excellent social vibe of a Walmart in small-town America. I’m liable to see Greg again sometime around Christmas. I’ll tell him I’m having prostate issues, or that I’m under indictment, or whatever it may be that day.We are at a cultural moment when living in close proximity and having many close friends and a ceaseless embracing community are thought to be unalloyed goods. “Bowling alone” is our shorthand for personal despair and social disintegration.However, as I dare say you — like Jean-Paul Sartre — have noticed, people can be annoying. We need distance from, as much as we need association with, one another. Thoreau tried for both: he would walk from Walden Pond to Concord, hang out with his dear friends the Emersons and the Alcotts, and then retreat to his hovel to be fairly happily alone.If on such occasions Thoreau was thinking in his reflective way that human beings are animals and that what we do is natural, then he did not consider his stroll into Concord a departure from nature but an exploration of a bit of it. And this is the way I feel about Walmart, which — big-box island in a blacktop sea — is a perfectly natural object, as much an environment as my woods.Walmart is no Concord. And if Greg will pardon my saying so, he is no Emerson or Alcott, though possibly he is a better golfer than either. Then again, he is also not my dear friend. He’s just a guy I’m happy to run across in Walmart. He’s generous enough to give me sudden access to his life, without placing me under an obligation to do anything more than giggle and cluck. Ours is a perfectly good, serviceable relationship, shaped as it is by long aisles of distracting merchandise and extensive shopping lists.Like Thoreau, I am an anarchist berry picker. Like Thoreau, I lack both easy charm and extreme social desperation, the very features of personality that fit human beings for society. Like Thoreau, I am trying to reduce my expenses to something close to my income.Unlike Thoreau, I have cable.

"'12-05-26,'0','Re “Seeing Bailouts Through Rose-Colored Glasses” (Fair Game, May 20), which questioned how the Treasury Department accounts for the costs and benefits of the government’s financial stability programs, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program of 2008:First, we’re required by law to account for TARP’s direct fiscal cost by a method that measures the subsidy costs based on a market-risk adjusted rate. That’s partly why the original estimates of TARP’s costs were in the hundreds of billions. But those initial estimates ultimately proved wrong as we continue to recover most of the funds we invested.The larger issue is this: To compare the government’s investments to what a private investor would have charged misses the point of our programs. They were necessary because private investors were not willing or able to put out the financial fire, and the financial markets had all but ground to a halt. While there are many ways to calculate the programs’ broader economic impact, it’s clear that they helped stem the panic and stabilize the economy. Timothy G. MassadThe writer is the assistant Treasury secretary for financial stability.The column was right to criticize the logic that the financial bailouts of 2008 may ultimately be profitable for taxpayers.The true cost of the bailouts should include the interest that the nation’s savers (who are also taxpayers) have sacrificed over the past four years in the form of vastly lower interest rates. The amount is huge, given that interest rates on deposits are often at least three percentage points lower than they were four years ago — and are now near zero on many bank and money market accounts.Of course, the Federal Reserve, banks and borrowers are benefiting from this, but at the expense of savers. That’s a clear transfer of wealth from one group to another. Steve Paluszek'"

"'12-05-27,'0','In 2005, however, Microsoft executives decided that “Live” could enliven its core Windows and Office brands, too. In a news briefing in 2005, Bill Gates said the goal of the company’s newly announced Live-branded services was to “make Windows, Office and Xbox further come alive for our customers at work, home and play.”What its customers were doing was spending more and more time using the Internet, and not giving much thought to the operating system that ran their PCs. But Microsoft executives apparently thought that “Live” was so powerful an adjective that it could make the Windows brand suitable for extension in all directions.In 2006, Microsoft unveiled Windows Live Messenger, a new version of what had been MSN Messenger. The company said it was the first of more than 20 Windows Live services that were being beta-tested. The message of the new brand, however, was not easily understood. “ ‘Windows Live’ — what does it mean? I can’t figure it out,” says Susan Fournier, an associate professor of marketing at Boston University. “I see no evidence of planning around a brand strategy.”Professor Fournier says Microsoft’s executives seem to have “assumed they had a brand” that could be extended to other products, “but you can’t extend something that doesn’t have resonance in people’s lives.”Rajeev Batra, a marketing professor at the University of Michigan and a co-author of a scholarly article titled “Brand Love,” says Microsoft failed to notice a basic principle: “When the same brand name is used on multiple new products, those new brands should be all similar in key ways,” he says. Trying to extend the “Live” from Xbox to Windows, with a bewilderingly diverse set of unrelated products and services was a mistake, in his view.Even if the services had been closely tied to Windows, the public didn’t perceive the brand as having the attributes that would serve associated products well. Professor Batra says, “Our brand-love research shows that loved brands reflect and symbolize deeply held personal values, such as Apple does for creativity,” he says. “Windows and Live each lack this type of brand strength.”After so many years of pushing the Windows Live brand in so many products, the company couldn’t easily drop the branding, even if executives had come around to the idea that it was misbegotten. But the imminent arrival of a new version of its flagship PC operating system, Windows 8, seems to provide cover for the change.Microsoft declined my request for an interview. But writing earlier this month on a company blog, Chris Jones, Microsoft’s vice president overseeing the Windows Live group, said: “Windows Live services and apps were built on versions of Windows that were simply not designed to be connected to a cloud service for anything other than updates, and as a result, they felt ‘bolted on’ to the experience.”With the new version of Windows, many of the Windows Live products and services that had been packaged separately will be installed as a part of the operating system. “There is no ‘separate brand’ to think about or a separate service to install,” Mr. Jones wrote.Most important, Windows 8 customers will be free to substitute non-Microsoft products and services in place of the re-branded Windows Live successors. “You’re welcome to mix and match them with the software and services you choose,” he says.“Windows Live” is disappearing. But “Live” will continue where it began, at Xbox — though the company has insisted on supersizing its rendering to “Xbox LIVE.”And if Microsoft executives wonder what kept the Windows brand extension from taking permanent hold, they should be told ever so gently that it’s a matter of the heart: the brand love just wasn’t there.'"

"'12-05-27,'0','The Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs have repeatedly promised to do a better job of handling the medical evaluations of wounded and disabled service members. Instead, they are doing worse.The processing of disability cases is getting slower, not faster. Efforts to ensure a “seamless transition” out of the military are falling short. Men and women are languishing without treatment, struggling to readjust to civilian lives as they cope with post-traumatic stress disorder, brain injuries, drug addiction and other service-related afflictions. The system that should be producing reliable results is mired in delays and dissatisfaction.A new report by the Government Accountability Office lays out the problem. In 2007, the two departments began combining their separate, complicated and cumbersome processes for disability evaluations into one system. The system is now in place worldwide, and officials from both departments promised the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee a year ago that it had become “more transparent, consistent and expeditious.”But the accountability office found otherwise. It said processing times for disability cases had actually gone up — to an average of 394 days for active-duty troops and 420 days for National Guard members and reservists in 2011, well over the departments’ goals of 295 and 305 days. In fiscal year 2010, 32 percent of active-duty troops and 37 percent of Guard and Reserve troops completed evaluations and received benefits within established timelines. Last year, those figures fell to a dismal 19 percent and 18 percent.What’s going on? The report says the causes are not fully understood, but it points to persistent staffing shortages, problems in collecting and reporting data, and differences among the service branches and between the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department in the way cases are diagnosed and tracked. The accountability office says it will make recommendations later this year as it sees whether promised improvements are taking hold, including a hiring push by the Army — a huge source of processing bottlenecks — and the V.A.Senator Patty Murray, chairman of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, deserves credit for focusing attention on these and other failings in a series of hearings, including one last Wednesday that examined the bureaucratic delays. She also used the hearing to bring up disturbing reports that doctors at an Army base in Washington State had repeatedly — and wrongly — rejected soldiers’ legitimate post-traumatic stress disorder claims.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','Intrade is based in Dublin, though many of its traders live in the United States. People bet on contracts stating that a particular event will take place by a given time, and have traded more than $68 million worth of contracts this year through Thursday, according to Carl Wolfenden, exchange operations manager for the Web site.Like stock or bond prices, its predictions, often expressed as probabilities, are derived by matching buyers and sellers. The probabilities are intended to embody the aggregate information of the market — the “wisdom of crowds,” as the author James Surowiecki calls it.The pricing mechanism used by Intrade is “virtually identical” to that of mainline financial exchanges, Mr. Wolfers says. The site’s projections are imperfect, but, he added, “empirically, they have been better than the alternatives,” including opinion polls and individual expert opinion.To put the projection of a euro breakup into context, it is a slightly higher probability than the one Intrade lists for Mitt Romney’s chances of being elected president in November. As of Friday, it was 39.4 percent, the site says. At the same time, it gave Barack Obama a 57.1 percent chance of re-election. If Mr. Romney is formally nominated as the Republican candidate, his chances would presumably rise.THERE is no evidence that Intrade is being widely used to handicap events that are important to financial markets, but it isn’t being entirely ignored, either. Ned Davis Research, the financial research firm based in Venice, Fla., has included charts of the Intrade Greek probabilities in recent reports.“They correlate very closely with the flight to safety in the sovereign bond markets,” said Will Geisdorf, senior research analyst for the firm, which also relies on many other indicators that suggest deep pessimism and “high fear readings” among investors.Analysts using other indicators share the view that the euro crisis has unmoored many markets. Largely because of Greece and the euro quandary, for example, Deutsche Bank predicted in a report last week that the yield on the 10-year United States Treasury note, which dropped to a low of 1.698 percent this month, could tumble below 1.5 percent this year. Robert P. Brown, president of the bond group at Fidelity Asset Management, said in an interview that “if the Greek issue isn’t resolved,” he wouldn’t be surprised if yields fell below current levels, perhaps even below 1.5 percent.Falling bond yields — and rising bond prices — have been accompanied by a weak stock market, a reversal of the traditional pattern, Ed Yardeni, an independent economist, wrote recently. “Prior to the financial crisis that started in 2007,” he said, “ falling bond yields tended to be associated with rising valuation multiples in the stock market. The relationship has been reversed since then.”The primary reason has been fear of contagion from a financial collapse, originally in the United States and, in recent months, in Europe. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and other central banks have deliberately lowered interest rates, but the sinking yields of relatively safe government bonds in recent weeks have overshot the expectations of most investors.Hedging against the risk of a profound disruption helps explain the premium being paid for these low-yielding assets. And, at the moment, the Greek election on June 17 is being widely viewed as a pivotal event.If that election results in a government that rejects bailout terms that have already been imposed, a Greek exit from the euro zone could follow. In the financial markets, contingency planning for such an event is well under way.Some strategists see these concerns as overblown. James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, for example, says he believes that the problems of the euro zone will be with us for years — but that they are manageable. And he says that compared with last year, the stock market’s response to euro zone stress is far more restrained. United States economic data is stronger than has been widely appreciated, he says, and the stock market “could easily rebound.”It’s time, he said, “that we learn that these euro crises are buying opportunities, not a time to sell.”For the moment, however, it is bond investors who have been buying. How much further will they drive down the yields of government bonds? Intrade may provide answers.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','HAS the pursuit of labor productivity reached its limit?Productivity — the amount of output delivered per hour of work in the economy — is often viewed as the engine of progress in modern capitalist economies. Output is everything. Time is money. The quest for increased productivity occupies reams of academic literature and haunts the waking hours of C.E.O.’s and finance ministers. Perhaps forgivably so: our ability to generate more output with fewer people has lifted our lives out of drudgery and delivered us a cornucopia of material wealth.But the relentless drive for productivity may also have some natural limits. Ever-increasing productivity means that if our economies don’t continue to expand, we risk putting people out of work. If more is possible each passing year with each working hour, then either output has to increase or else there is less work to go around. Like it or not, we find ourselves hooked on growth.What, then, should happen when, for one reason or another, growth just isn’t to be had anymore? Maybe it’s a financial crisis. Or rising prices for resources like oil. Or the need to rein in growth for the damage it’s inflicting on the planet: climate change, deforestation, the loss of biodiversity. Maybe it’s any of the reasons growth can no longer be safely and easily assumed in any of today’s economies. The result is the same. Increasing productivity threatens full employment.One solution would be to accept the productivity increases, shorten the workweek and share the available work. Such proposals — familiar since the 1930s — are now enjoying something of a revival in the face of continuing recession. The New Economics Foundation, a British think tank, proposes a 21-hour workweek. It may not be the workaholic’s choice. But it’s certainly a strategy worth thinking about.But there’s another strategy for keeping people in work when demand stagnates. Perhaps in the long run it’s an easier and a more compelling solution: to loosen our grip on the relentless pursuit of productivity. By easing up on the gas pedal of efficiency and creating jobs in what are traditionally seen as “low productivity” sectors, we have within our grasp the means to maintain or increase employment, even when the economy stagnates.At first, this may sound crazy; we’ve become so conditioned by the language of efficiency. But there are sectors of the economy where chasing productivity growth doesn’t make sense at all. Certain kinds of tasks rely inherently on the allocation of people’s time and attention. The caring professions are a good example: medicine, social work, education. Expanding our economies in these directions has all sorts of advantages.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','Now, the degree of intimacy Greg and I mustered near the peanut butter might appear excessive, though it was encouraged by the fact that we are both guys and share, though not with Thoreau, the experience of raising daughters.It was also made possible by the excellent social vibe of a Walmart in small-town America. I’m liable to see Greg again sometime around Christmas. I’ll tell him I’m having prostate issues, or that I’m under indictment, or whatever it may be that day.We are at a cultural moment when living in close proximity and having many close friends and a ceaseless embracing community are thought to be unalloyed goods. “Bowling alone” is our shorthand for personal despair and social disintegration.However, as I dare say you — like Jean-Paul Sartre — have noticed, people can be annoying. We need distance from, as much as we need association with, one another. Thoreau tried for both: he would walk from Walden Pond to Concord, hang out with his dear friends the Emersons and the Alcotts, and then retreat to his hovel to be fairly happily alone.If on such occasions Thoreau was thinking in his reflective way that human beings are animals and that what we do is natural, then he did not consider his stroll into Concord a departure from nature but an exploration of a bit of it. And this is the way I feel about Walmart, which — big-box island in a blacktop sea — is a perfectly natural object, as much an environment as my woods.Walmart is no Concord. And if Greg will pardon my saying so, he is no Emerson or Alcott, though possibly he is a better golfer than either. Then again, he is also not my dear friend. He’s just a guy I’m happy to run across in Walmart. He’s generous enough to give me sudden access to his life, without placing me under an obligation to do anything more than giggle and cluck. Ours is a perfectly good, serviceable relationship, shaped as it is by long aisles of distracting merchandise and extensive shopping lists.Like Thoreau, I am an anarchist berry picker. Like Thoreau, I lack both easy charm and extreme social desperation, the very features of personality that fit human beings for society. Like Thoreau, I am trying to reduce my expenses to something close to my income.Unlike Thoreau, I have cable. Yet Thoreau and I commune, more or less the same way that Greg and I do, across space and time. And that’s how I can assure you that, if Thoreau were around today, he’d be pushing a cart through a Walmart three miles from Walden Pond with a bag of socks, a gallon of milk and a Blu-ray player, nodding pleasantly at people he sort of recognizes.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','But experts say there is little doubt that the loss of credit is hurting smaller businesses, contributing to Spain’s troubles by raising unemployment and cutting tax revenues, making it harder to bring its budget deficit down to manageable levels. The credit loss hits particularly hard in Spain, where more than 60 percent of the economy, and 80 percent of the jobs, come from small and medium-size companies. More than 500,000 small businesses have shut down in the last few years.Mr. Moreno said that one year his company, Nomad Skateboards, sold more than $1.3 million worth of skateboards and accessories in 20 countries. These days he is looking for a buyer for his warehouse and trimming his product line to just skateboards and T-shirts. “If you cannot buy, you cannot sell,” he said. “If you cannot sell, you cannot make a profit.”Many are done in by their inability to get the credit they need to run day-to-day operations. “The savings banks that these people got their loans from don’t even exist anymore,” said Alfonso García Mora, director general of AFI, a Madrid-based financial consultancy. “Those banks have been taken over by bigger banks that aren’t interested in these kinds of loans. Or they have been taken over by banks in another region, where the local businessman is not known.”Such changes might be felt for years to come.“We have lost that local knowledge,” Mr. Mora said, “and it was crucial to deciding whether or not to make a loan. It is a problem we will have for a long time.”A few years ago, Spain had 45 regional savings banks. Today, there are only 13 and even their future is uncertain. Some have been merged with other banks and others have been taken over by bigger, more robust banks as part of efforts to reassure global markets.Many business owners say the regional bankers they worked with, sometimes for decades, may still be sitting in their chairs at the local office. But they no longer have the power to approve loans, even if they wanted to, and usually they are just delivering bad news.That means trouble in a country with 25 percent unemployment and no signs of an economic recovery. The warehouse district that is home to Mr. Moreno’s company is virtually deserted these days. Charo Albás Vives, who owns a children’s shoe company, Colores, is in similar straits. Her bank withdrew her $65,000 credit line two years ago.At first, she said, the bank wanted her to return only half of it. But after she managed that, the bank told her that she would have to repay the rest, starting immediately.Ms. Albas, who has six children, said the payments forced her family to make all sorts of economies. “We stopped going to the good grocery store,” she said. “We cut back on everything, even the heating.”It also meant that she could no longer afford the brightly colored inventory her stores were famous for. “We concentrate on white and blue now,” she said.She has survived, she said, thanks to loans from her family, though 13 of 25 stores have closed.Before the crisis, experts say, it was probably too easy to get loans; banks operated with too little equity and lent too much. Regional banks, in fact, made many of the most problematic loans to real estate developers. Now, as the banking sector struggles for survival, lending to private companies and households has dropped precipitously.“The cuts in credit have been so abrupt that some businesses not only lost specific projects they were working on,” said Carlos Ruiz Fonseca, the director of economy and innovation at Cepyme, Spain’s association of small and medium-size companies. “Some companies have just gone out of business.”Despite the mergers and injections of capital from the banking bailout and reconstruction program begun by the government in 2009, there has been no improvement in lending. According to the Bank of Spain, credit to the private sector fell in March, as it has virtually every month since the fall of 2009. Some businesses say they do not even bother asking for loans anymore.Getting loans to start a company may be even harder. “How are you going to get new businesses going if there is no one willing to take a risk and lend you money?” said Edward Hugh, an economic guru who blogs on Spain’s economy. “The problems become circular and self-perpetuating.”Banking officials agree that the restructuring has made credit harder to come by, but they say they can do little about it. “The banks here are asked to provision more capital to guard against loan losses,” an official from CECA, the Spanish savings bank association, said. “And if they are asked for more capital, then the possibilities of giving credit are limited.”Some companies have found innovative ways to do business without credit. Emilio Díaz, for instance, who founded a bus and train window factory in Zaragoza in 1969, said that rather than borrow to cover the cost of glass for a big contract, he recently made an agreement with his supplier to pay for the glass after he is paid for the windows.Other companies have found that doing business with several different banks helps. Olga Rioja Navarro, the financial director of Lacasa, a chocolate manufacturer that has lost 20 percent of its credit line, says she juggles her business among nearly a dozen banks. These days she says the banks are more likely to give the company a loan against a specific unpaid invoice, for instance, than for day-to-day expenses.Mr. Moreno and his partner, Chus Castejón, hope they can find a private investor. But they fear that their brand will lose hard-to-reclaim momentum in the fashion-conscious world of skateboarding. “Sometimes you have your moment, and then you can’t get it back,” Mr. Castejón said. “And that makes me so angry.”Recently Mr. Moreno and his wife invited some friends for dinner. The gathering was hard for Sergio Eltoro, 34, who grew up with Mr. Moreno and worked for him for nearly 10 years before being laid off recently. He loved his job and now finds himself facing questions he thought were settled, like, “What am I going to do with myself tomorrow?”'"
"'12-05-27,'0','OPENED in the summer of 1936, the hottest on record in the United States, the McCarren pool, on the Greenpoint-Williamsburg border in Brooklyn, was one of 11 unveiled across the five boroughs that sweltering season, a statement in concrete of the city’s ability to do something big in the depths of the Great Depression. McCarren’s capacity said it all: 6,800 swimmers in a 55,440-square-foot basin. Now, after being shut for 28 years, the pool and its historic bathhouse are set to reopen at the end of June.The pool complex, which sits in McCarren Park, has undergone a $50 million restoration, and the enormous rectangular pool has been turned into a giant U, with the placement of a concrete beach at its center. Painters are applying a coat of cerulean blue, a hue evoking longings of escape — from the heat, from work, from summer in the city. Grab your suit! — LISA W. FODERAROFresh Idea When it opened on the Greenpoint-Williamsburg border, the McCarren pool was an alternative to the polluted rivers and bays where New York City children had been swimming, and it drew a crowd, as seen in July 1937, left. But after sliding into disrepair, the pool closed in 1984. And while the 10 other Robert Moses-era pools were renovated in the 1980s and ’90s, McCarren remained stubbornly shut amid bitter and racially charged debates over its fate. Some in the traditionally Polish and Italian Brooklyn neighborhood lobbied to have the complex torn down. Preservationists advocated for the restoration of the bathhouse and pool to their original size. Others pressed for a smaller recreation space. Starting in 2005, the empty pool became a site for cultural events, drawing throngs (like the one above, in 2007) to listen to music, take turns on the Slip ’N Slide and generally turn the basin into a hipster playground.Redesigned In 2007, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled his PlaNYC, with a huge capital infusion for new parks and park renovations. Eight lucky properties in underserved areas were identified as “regional parks,” getting $290 million among them. McCarren was one. As seen on the plan that Rogers Marvel Architects has created, a plaza is at the center of the pool, nicknamed “the beach.” It will be flecked with spray fountains that shoot water into the air, and become a skating rink come winter. It will also create three distinct swimming areas. The new design preserves many historical details, like the grand arched entrance on Lorimer Street. The bathhouse, originally used only for changing and showering, has been converted to year-round use. One wing will house a recreation center, with a weight room, basketball court and cardio-fitness room, while the other wing will contain space for after-school programs and community meetings.Novel Uses for Objects Recovered From New York City's PastOld Touches While architectural elements were plundered during the pool’s closing, there are nods to the past. Hundreds of wire mesh baskets, once used by bathers to store their belongings, were discovered in storage. So the architects dipped them in silver paint and affixed them to the ceiling of the fitness center.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','People have snickered for years about “Cats,” suggesting that the reason the show became the second-longest-running hit in Broadway history (after “The Phantom of the Opera”) was that the dance-driven extravaganza was an ideal attraction for tourists who did not speak English. But I suspect that some who dismiss this musical as mere spectacle have never actually seen or heard it. Maybe it is time they did.Certainly, they will see a capably performed “Cats” at the Gateway Playhouse, which previously presented the musical in 2004. It is directed and choreographed this time by Jacob Brent, who performed in “Cats” on Broadway, in London and in the DVD version. The current revival in Bellport is a smaller-scale but otherwise fairly faithful rendition of the show, which ran for 7,485 performances at the Winter Garden Theater beginning in 1982, a year after it opened in London.As a bonus, Mr. Brent’s lively production stars Ken Page, a member of the original Broadway cast, who majestically recreates his leading role as Old Deuteronomy, the patriarch of those kitties cavorting around a moonlit junkyard.More a fanciful suite of songs and dances than a traditional musical with a story — there is no spoken dialogue and scarcely more plot — “Cats” is drawn from the whimsical verse of T. S. Eliot’s “Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats” and a few other choice morsels of the poet’s works. Arranged as a dozen musical vignettes that celebrate various feline characters and their midnight revels, the show reaches its high point when the bedraggled glamour puss, Grizabella, beatifically ascends to wherever good cats go in their next lives.Admittedly, it is a simple scenario, and some of the doings get precious, but Andrew Lloyd Webber’s score features a typically hummable assortment of glowing anthems, bouncy British music-hall ditties, clever parodies and syncopated marches crowned by that now-and-forever standard “Memory.” Frisky or wistful, the melodies cling to the ear, and their rhythmic vigor rarely flags. A six-member orchestra led by Jeffrey Buchsbaum delivers the score with considerable resonance.The revival is modeled after Trevor Nunn’s Broadway production. According to the program, the show’s nearly ceaseless movement is based on Gillian Lynne’s original choreography, which Mr. Brent satisfyingly replicates with all of its cat-characteristic prowling, slinking and preening behavior, with occasional cartwheeling acrobatics. The company has obviously been well drilled in the dances, and it moves energetically through the complex paces.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','IF I say that I saw the future of Portuguese cooking in a martini glass, you might conclude that I was having drunken visions.Not at the meal and moment in question: when a server at the chef José Avillez’s brilliant restaurant Belcanto, in Lisbon, set the second in a series of amuse bouches before me. It was called an “inverted martini,” because the olive had the starring role, in the form of a pool of green juice. Gin played the cameo, having been turned into a translucent sphere the size and shape of an olive.It was pretty, witty and plenty delicious. And it spoke to the cunning and creativity of Mr. Avillez, a rising young star on the Portuguese food scene and a big reason Lisbon is such a culinary joy, especially these days.Over the last year Mr. Avillez, 32, has essentially opened two new restaurants. Essentially because Belcanto, in the city’s Chiado neighborhood, had been around for many decades before he took it over and gave it an elegant face-lift and entirely new, slightly avant-garde menu about six months ago. My long lunch there was perhaps the best meal I’ve eaten in 2012 so far.Mr. Avillez’s other, much more casual new restaurant, Cantinho do Avillez, is just blocks away, only a few months older and a convivial delight. It features a succinct menu of hearty Portuguese bistro fare that departs from the Lisbon norm by paying a bit more attention to fowl, organ meats and African and Asian spices, which underscore ethnic bridges built in Portugal’s colonial past.Mr. Avillez has helped to provide a needed complement of playfulness, modernism and global sophistication to a restaurant scene that tends toward — and excels at — the rustic and unvarnished. The city teems with straightforward seafood brasseries that mine the waters around Lisbon for all that they’re worth.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','“India” and “change” were once virtual antonyms: old India hands returned again and again in large part because the subcontinent was so dependably different from the West. But since 1991, when a financial crisis forced India’s government to devalue the rupee, lower import barriers and relax controls on private investment, things have nearly reversed themselves. As the journalist Akash Kapur demonstrates in his lucid, balanced new book, “India Becoming,” his homeland now seems almost synonymous with change.Kapur is especially qualified to assess the contrasts and contradictions all that change has brought. The son of an American mother and an Indian father, he was raised on the outskirts of Auroville, a utopian international community in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Sent away to boarding school in the United States at 16, he studied at Harvard and Oxford, then returned to South India 12 years later, in 2003. His lively “Letter From India” appeared for several years in The International Herald Tribune and the online edition of The New York Times.At first, he was dazzled. While the friends he’d left behind in America fretted about holding on to their jobs, it seemed to him that every other young person he met in India was eager to quit his or hers to become an entrepreneur. The Indian economy was then growing at about 8 percent, led by the expanding service and I.T. industries, and the country’s mood was “giddy, exuberant,” “ardently capitalist,” and aspirational. “For the first time — the first time in my life, but arguably in India’s history, too,” he writes, “people dared to imagine an existence for themselves that was unburdened by the past and tradition. India, I felt, had started to dream.”But, over time, as he settled permanently back into the countryside, married and had two sons, he found himself at least as appalled by the new India as he was admiring. For all the restaurants and yoga centers, colleges and gated communities that now lined the newly blacktopped country roads he’d known as a boy — and despite two decades of new money and new opportunities — poverty stubbornly persists. More than 300 million of India’s 1.2 billion people still live on less than a dollar a day, he tells us; more people have cellphones than access to a toilet. And heedless growth steadily despoils the environment; nearly half of India’s land is eroded; at least 70 percent of its surface water is polluted and, according to one recent study, India’s air is now the most toxic on earth — a fact vividly brought home to Kapur and his family one spring when the smoky reek of thousands of tons of smoldering untreated garbage dumped outside the town of Pondicherry seeped into his home and sickened one of his ­children.His conclusions about all this are rarely surprising and often reiterative: we are told too many times that change comes at a cost; that “unrelenting optimism” is “delusional”; that “India could often feel like two nations.” But Kapur is determinedly fair-minded, neither an apologist nor a scold, and he is a wonderfully empathetic listener, willing patiently to visit and revisit a large cast of men and women over several years to learn how they are benefiting from — and being battered by — the change going on all around them.He is on familiar ground when following the careers of middle-class young people who’ve left behind the small towns and ancient customs that had given shape to their lives in order to build wholly new ones in the brand-new big-city world of shopping malls and office towers. Hari, a gay I.T. worker in Chennai, finally comes out to his friends but can’t bring himself to confide in his parents. Selvi, a call-­center worker in the same city, disappointed to find that most of the Americans with whom she speaks each night are “rude and also quite stupid,” suddenly finds herself accused by neighbors and relatives of being a loose woman simply because one of her flatmates is found to have been involved in a love affair.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','The likelihood that any of the children in the article will “end up just fine” without intervention is extremely low. That’s the approach our society has taken for too long: do nothing, wait until they grow up and commit crimes, then imprison them. The researchers in this article should be commended for their pioneering work in addressing an important, understudied societal problem.Just about everyone has some idea of what the word “psychopath” means. To even hint that a child has those qualities colors the thinking of those around him or her and prompts people to reinforce that “diagnosis” in their minds. As a child therapist, I think it’s fine to try to identify “problematic social behavior” at an early age. But there are two important things to consider: We cannot fix everything that is human and problematic; and we often seriously inflate our ability to perceive and diagnose what we define as problematic behavior.I wish these parents all the best as they struggle to raise this boy. But surrounding him with other “callous, unemotional” children is misguided at best — it’s the equivalent of sending him to a seminar in how to be a successful psychopath. The children can learn better strategies for manipulative, sly behavior from each other. I’m not surprised Michael was worse when he came home.‘ DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE SIX PEOPLE YOU EXECUTED?’You can’t build a new state by taking “legal” vengeance upon the oppressors. That’s corruption, not a path to reconciliation.'"

"'12-05-27,'0','Mr. Rivera, 76, acknowledged that police detectives from New York came to question him last week.“The detectives told me not to say anything,” he said.“I am keeping my mouth shut,” he added, miming a zipper across his lips.In a case like Etan’s, with no physical evidence linking the suspect to the crime, any past statements by Mr. Hernandez regarding the boy’s disappearance and death could be crucial in corroborating his confession.There is no body, DNA, fingerprints or any other forensic evidence to speak of — only a confession from a man who is said to be taking psychiatric medications and has had diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Mr. Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty in the case and remains under observation at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, came to the attention of the police after a tip from one or more people describing past statements he had made. It is unclear whether any tips came from the prayer group.What is clear is that an admission at the church could be critical to the investigation in its timing. It is said to have occurred only a few years after Etan’s disappearance, when Mr. Hernandez would have been in his early 20s.Proof of an admission back then would undercut skepticism of his more recent confession, which could be tainted by time and his medical history.In light of that, detectives quickly expanded the current investigation beyond SoHo, trying to track down people to whom Mr. Hernandez may have spoken about a past crime.One police official familiar with the investigation said detectives had spoken to Mr. Hernandez’s ex-wife; a second police official said investigators went Friday to a home on North 25th Street in Camden where his sister Norma lives.Officers have also been seen going into the basement of the former bodega, now an eyeglasses boutique, in SoHo.As in the investigation into the prayer group, the police have not disclosed what, if anything, they have learned.The charismatic Christian gathering in Camden that Mr. Hernandez attended 30 years ago was described as a free-for-all of admissions of guilt, sometimes shocking.Mr. Rivera’s son, the Rev. David Rivera, a Roman Catholic priest at a nearby parish, said that public confessions, no matter how troubling, are common in charismatic groups, and that members of the groups grow hardened and numb to hearing them.People “feel the spirit and confess,” he said, adding, “If he confessed in the charismatic group, as many as 50 people might have heard him.”He added that he spoke to his father about the questioning by the police, but that the elder Mr. Rivera did not disclose what he was asked, only that the police told him not to speak of the matter with the news media.Born and raised in New Jersey, Mr. Hernandez moved to New York as a teenager and found work at the bodega, at 448 West Broadway. He left New York shortly after Etan’s disappearance and settled in Camden.His sister said that, in hindsight, his behavior was unusual.“He was not the same,” Ms. Hernandez said. “He was always nervous, always running to the bathroom — how you get nervous and your stomach starts acting up.”The brother and sister were among 12 siblings. Ms. Hernandez got Mr. Hernandez a job at a dress company, pressing fabric with a steam iron. A brother-in-law, Jose Lopez, was an active member of St. Anthony of Padua’s, Father Rivera said.Exactly when Mr. Hernandez began showing up at St. Anthony’s is unclear, but by then, Mr. Rivera was sometimes leading the prayer circles, said the Rev. William J. Weiksnar, the current pastor.Ms. Hernandez said that he never confessed in her presence and that they never talked about the case, but that it was considered an open family secret that he had confessed in the church.She did not say that he identified the boy. She said she believed that Mr. Hernandez attended the prayer group in question with their sister Margarita and her husband, Mr. Lopez, and Mr. Rivera and others, and that he made his statement shortly after the meeting ended. She did not say who was present at the time besides Mr. Rivera.Mr. Lopez, asked Friday whether he reported a confession to the police, said, “That doesn’t matter.”He added: “It’s already done. No matter who did, I didn’t say anything. My wife is taking this too hard and I don’t want to comment anymore. I am saying nothing.”Raymond W. Kelly, the New York police commissioner, told reporters last week that investigators believed that Mr. Hernandez had told a family member and others he had “done a bad thing and killed a child.” It is unclear whether this statement is the same as the one Ms. Hernandez described.Ms. Hernandez said that the admission was treated as family gossip, but that it was again discussed among siblings last month, with the digging for Etan’s remains in SoHo. The digging generated many tips to the police, Mr. Kelly said.It also seems to have caught Mr. Hernandez’s attention. The Star-Ledger in Newark reported last week that a relative said Mr. Hernandez called another sister, Luz, in New York City to talk about the Patz case during the digging, even though the two were not particularly close.Many churchgoers attending St. Anthony of Padua over the weekend said they did not know either Mr. Rivera, who Father Weiksnar said has long since left the church, or Mr. Hernandez.Another of Mr. Hernandez’s sisters, Maria Lopez, declined to comment on Sunday, but said, “Keep us in your prayers. Keep us in your prayers.”'"

"'12-05-27,'0','It’s possible to watch the six hours of “Hatfields & McCoys,” a three-night mini-series beginning on Monday on the History channel, and still be scratching your head over how, exactly, the whole thing got started.A Hatfield defected from the Confederate side during the Civil War and got a head start on postwar business, which irritated his former friend, a McCoy. But then there was already bad blood because a McCoy had accused another Hatfield of illicit relations with a dog.Well, it makes sense that the origins of a famous feud a century and a half ago might be confusing. A more timely question would be: How did the story of the West Virginia Hatfields and the Kentucky McCoys become a six-hour television drama? The answer to that is simple: Kevin Costner wanted it so.Mr. Costner stars in “Hatfields & McCoys” as Anse, the primary Hatfield, and is a producer of the project. It was directed by Kevin Reynolds, a feature film director whose credits include two Costner vehicles, “Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves” and “Waterworld.” And Mr. Costner’s involvement probably has something to do with the quality of the cast, which includes Bill Paxton as Mr. Costner’s opposite number, Randall McCoy, as well as Powers Boothe and Mare Winningham.Mr. Costner’s interest in the history of the American frontier has not had memorable results overall — the world wouldn’t be that much poorer without “Silverado,” “Wyatt Earp” or (contrarian alert) “Dances With Wolves” — but “Hatfields & McCoys” is a perfectly respectable piece of work, and probably better than we could have expected for a History mini-series. Mr. Costner and Mr. Paxton acquit themselves well, and Mr. Reynolds gives the ambushes and shootouts, filmed in Romania, a shambling, ugly realism. The writing, by Bill Kerby, Ted Mann and Ronald Parker, is florid within tolerable limits.The mini-series’s main problem is that six-hour running time. Filling it means that more attention than necessary is paid to things like an interfamily love affair, and legal and political wrangling, that are of historical interest but distract from the real business at hand, which is Hatfields and McCoys shooting at one another.'"
"'12-05-27,'0','“The Grand Old Party and the Sea” (editorial, May 17) criticized House Republicans for leading efforts to slow the expansion of “catch share” mechanisms in coastal fisheries by which allowable fish harvest of coastal stocks is awarded or sold to groups, corporations or individuals.The fact that environmental champions like Barney Frank and Frank Pallone joined 21 other House Democrats in a vote for the amendment shows that, despite what you suggest, catch shares do not have the support of the fishing communities. In fact, commoditizing coastal fish stocks, to the exclusion of local fishermen, is proving to be a devastating failure in the New England cod fishery.Summer flounder were not rebuilt as a result of catch shares. While New England’s commercial groundfish quota is now managed through catch shares, this privatization mechanism is not in place for summer flounder, and coastal anglers would like to keep it that way.Considering the importance of summer flounder to New York anglers, and red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, Representatives Michael Grimm and Steve Southerland are to be applauded for standing up for saltwater fishermen, as are the other 218 members of the House who voted in a bipartisan fashion (220 to 191) to protect public access to a sustainable natural public resource.The writer is managing director of the Recreational Fishing Alliance and president of the New York Sportfishing Federation.'"

"'12-05-27,'0','It was the quickest 600 in history, wrapping up in 3 hours 51 minutes with no multicar pileups along the way. But no one was quicker than Kahne, whose car best adapted to the cooling temperatures of the season’s longest race, which started in the heat of the afternoon and ended shortly after 10 p.m.Kahne’s victory was hardly a surprise even though he entered the race 16th in the standings. He had fallen as low as 33rd in the standings and was 31st after losing his engine at Martinsville, Va., on April 1. But Kahne had put together five consecutive top-10 finishes going into the 600 — six if you include his ninth-place showing in the All-Star race.“We’re gaining,” said Kahne, who moved up to 15th in the standings. “I think that’s like seven top 10s in a row counting the All-Star race, so we’re making big strides.”It was another dominant night for Hendrick Motorsports, which struggled to find victory lane this season until Johnson won the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway. Johnson followed with a win May 19 in the All-Star race worth $1 million, and Kahne gave Hendrick his third victory in a row.Hendrick had all four of its cars challenging at various points. But none of the others could keep up with Kahne, who led 96 laps. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was sixth, his seventh top 10 in the last eight races.“We want to win so bad we can’t stand it,” Earnhardt said. “And we’re getting kind of close. It feels good to be competitive. I don’t want to take our consistency for granted, but we would like to improve just a little bit more and we’ll get some wins.”Jeff Gordon finished seventh and Johnson finished 11th after a pit-road miscue late in the race.“It happens,” Johnson said. “Last week things couldn’t have gone any better, Darlington they went amazing and this week we had a few little issues.”Biffle, the series points leader, appeared to have the car to beat. He led 194 of the first 300 laps of the 400-lap race before falling back. The fourth-place finish did keep him in first place, 10 points ahead of his Roush Fenway Racing teammate Matt Kenseth.Chip Ganassi, the car owner who won the Indianapolis 500 earlier Sunday with Dario Franchitti, arrived in Charlotte in time to spend most of the race on pit road. But he did not manage a double. Juan Pablo Montoya was 20th for Ganassi, with his teammate Jamie McMurray 21st.Danica Patrick, who said Thursday she could race in the Indianapolis 500 again, may want to return sooner rather than later. Patrick, who finished third in the Indy 500 in 2009, became the second woman to race in the 600, after Janet Guthrie in 1976.But Patrick fell a lap behind 42 laps into the 600 and was five laps back by the end. She finished 30th as she continued to learn how to race stock cars. She is racing full time in the lower-level Nationwide Series and running 10 Cup events as well as she tries to get up to speed in Nascar. The plan is for Patrick to race full time in the Cup series next year.'"

"'12-05-28,'0','BEIJING — The older brother of Chen Guangcheng, the persecuted rights advocate who left China for the United States this month, is back in the family’s home village after evading guards there to travel to Beijing to meet with a lawyer, an American legal scholar who is advising Mr. Chen said Sunday.The scholar, Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University, wrote in an e-mail that the brother, Chen Guangfu, was back at home as of Saturday night and “unguarded but under great pressure.” Like his younger brother, Mr. Chen is from the village of Dongshigu, in Shandong Province, a place infamous for the guards who were assigned by local officials to keep Chen Guangcheng and his family under severe house arrest and to bar any outsiders from seeing them.After Mr. Chen made a daring nighttime escape last month, police officers detained his older brother and his nephew, Chen Kegui, who was charged with intent to commit homicide when he slashed local officials with a kitchen knife, seriously injuring at least one, after the officials broke into the home of his father following his uncle’s escape.Chen Guangfu had left the village in the middle of the night last week to travel to Beijing to meet with a lawyer, Ding Xikui, who had agreed to advocate on behalf of his son. Family members insist the son was acting only in self-defense, since he did not know the men breaking into the home were officials. The son’s wife, Liu Fang, sent a letter to the local authorities late last week demanding that her husband be allowed to meet with lawyers.It is unclear whether the father had been forced to return to Dongshigu by security officers or went back on his own. Local officials in China often send police officers to Beijing to retrieve discontented citizens who travel to the Chinese capital to try to make their grievances known to central officials. Chen Guangcheng was himself seized in Beijing by such officers in September 2005.Mr. Chen has been given a fellowship to study at the New York University School of Law, where Mr. Cohen has long been a professor. Mr. Chen, his wife and their daughter now live near Washington Square Park in Lower Manhattan, but he has said he plans to return to China after a period of study.'"
"'12-05-28,'0','It was the quickest 600 in history, wrapping up in 3 hours 51 minutes with no multicar pileups along the way. But no one was quicker than Kahne, whose car best adapted to the cooling temperatures of the season’s longest race, which started in the heat of the afternoon and ended shortly after 10 p.m.Kahne’s victory was hardly a surprise even though he entered the race 16th in the standings. He had fallen as low as 33rd in the standings and was 31st after losing his engine at Martinsville, Va., on April 1. But Kahne had put together five consecutive top-10 finishes going into the 600 — six if you include his ninth-place showing in the All-Star race.“We’re gaining,” said Kahne, who moved up to 15th in the standings. “I think that’s like seven top 10s in a row counting the All-Star race, so we’re making big strides.”It was another dominant night for Hendrick Motorsports, which struggled to find victory lane this season until Johnson won the Southern 500 at Darlington Raceway. Johnson followed with a win May 19 in the All-Star race worth $1 million, and Kahne gave Hendrick his third victory in a row.Hendrick had all four of its cars challenging at various points. But none of the others could keep up with Kahne, who led 96 laps. Dale Earnhardt Jr. was sixth, his seventh top 10 in the last eight races.“We want to win so bad we can’t stand it,” Earnhardt said. “And we’re getting kind of close. It feels good to be competitive. I don’t want to take our consistency for granted, but we would like to improve just a little bit more and we’ll get some wins.”Jeff Gordon finished seventh and Johnson finished 11th after a pit-road miscue late in the race.“It happens,” Johnson said. “Last week things couldn’t have gone any better, Darlington they went amazing and this week we had a few little issues.”Biffle, the series points leader, appeared to have the car to beat. He led 194 of the first 300 laps of the 400-lap race before falling back. The fourth-place finish did keep him in first place, 10 points ahead of his Roush Fenway Racing teammate Matt Kenseth.Chip Ganassi, the car owner who won the Indianapolis 500 earlier Sunday with Dario Franchitti, arrived in Charlotte in time to spend most of the race on pit road. But he did not manage a double. Juan Pablo Montoya was 20th for Ganassi, with his teammate Jamie McMurray 21st.Danica Patrick, who said Thursday she could race in the Indianapolis 500 again, may want to return sooner rather than later. Patrick, who finished third in the Indy 500 in 2009, became the second woman to race in the 600, after Janet Guthrie in 1976.But Patrick fell a lap behind 42 laps into the 600 and was five laps back by the end. She finished 30th as she continued to learn how to race stock cars. She is racing full time in the lower-level Nationwide Series and running 10 Cup events as well as she tries to get up to speed in Nascar. The plan is for Patrick to race full time in the Cup series next year.'"
"'12-05-28,'0','Mr. Rivera, 76, acknowledged that police detectives from New York came to question him last week.“The detectives told me not to say anything,” he said.“I am keeping my mouth shut,” he added, miming a zipper across his lips.In a case like Etan’s, with no physical evidence linking the suspect to the crime, any past statements by Mr. Hernandez regarding the boy’s disappearance and death could be crucial in corroborating his confession.There is no body, DNA, fingerprints or any other forensic evidence to speak of — only a confession from a man who is said to be taking psychiatric medications and has had diagnoses of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.Mr. Hernandez, who has pleaded not guilty in the case and remains under observation at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, came to the attention of the police after a tip from one or more people describing past statements he had made. It is unclear whether any tips came from the prayer group.What is clear is that an admission at the church could be critical to the investigation in its timing. It is said to have occurred only a few years after Etan’s disappearance, when Mr. Hernandez would have been in his early 20s.Proof of an admission back then would undercut skepticism of his more recent confession, which could be tainted by time and his medical history.In light of that, detectives quickly expanded the current investigation beyond SoHo, trying to track down people to whom Mr. Hernandez may have spoken about a past crime.One police official familiar with the investigation said detectives had spoken to Mr. Hernandez’s ex-wife; a second police official said investigators went Friday to a home on North 25th Street in Camden where his sister Norma lives.Officers have also been seen going into the basement of the former bodega, now an eyeglasses boutique, in SoHo.As in the investigation into the prayer group, the police have not disclosed what, if anything, they have learned.The charismatic Christian gathering in Camden that Mr. Hernandez attended 30 years ago was described as a free-for-all of admissions of guilt, sometimes shocking.Mr. Rivera’s son, the Rev. David Rivera, a Roman Catholic priest at a nearby parish, said that public confessions, no matter how troubling, are common in charismatic groups, and that members of the groups grow hardened and numb to hearing them.People “feel the spirit and confess,” he said, adding, “If he confessed in the charismatic group, as many as 50 people might have heard him.”He added that he spoke to his father about the questioning by the police, but that the elder Mr. Rivera did not disclose what he was asked, only that the police told him not to speak of the matter with the news media.Born and raised in New Jersey, Mr. Hernandez moved to New York as a teenager and found work at the bodega, at 448 West Broadway. He left New York shortly after Etan’s disappearance and settled in Camden.His sister said that, in hindsight, his behavior was unusual.“He was not the same,” Ms. Hernandez said. “He was always nervous, always running to the bathroom — how you get nervous and your stomach starts acting up.”The brother and sister were among 12 siblings. Ms. Hernandez got Mr. Hernandez a job at a dress company, pressing fabric with a steam iron. A brother-in-law, Jose Lopez, was an active member of St. Anthony of Padua’s, Father Rivera said.Exactly when Mr. Hernandez began showing up at St. Anthony’s is unclear, but by then, Mr. Rivera was sometimes leading the prayer circles, said the Rev. William J. Weiksnar, the current pastor.Ms. Hernandez said that he never confessed in her presence and that they never talked about the case, but that it was considered an open family secret that he had confessed in the church.She did not say that he identified the boy. She said she believed that Mr. Hernandez attended the prayer group in question with their sister Margarita and her husband, Mr. Lopez, and Mr. Rivera and others, and that he made his statement shortly after the meeting ended. She did not say who was present at the time besides Mr. Rivera.Mr. Lopez, asked Friday whether he reported a confession to the police, said, “That doesn’t matter.”He added: “It’s already done. No matter who did, I didn’t say anything. My wife is taking this too hard and I don’t want to comment anymore. I am saying nothing.”Raymond W. Kelly, the New York police commissioner, told reporters last week that investigators believed that Mr. Hernandez had told a family member and others he had “done a bad thing and killed a child.” It is unclear whether this statement is the same as the one Ms. Hernandez described.Ms. Hernandez said that the admission was treated as family gossip, but that it was again discussed among siblings last month, with the digging for Etan’s remains in SoHo. The digging generated many tips to the police, Mr. Kelly said.It also seems to have caught Mr. Hernandez’s attention. The Star-Ledger in Newark reported last week that a relative said Mr. Hernandez called another sister, Luz, in New York City to talk about the Patz case during the digging, even though the two were not particularly close.Many churchgoers attending St. Anthony of Padua over the weekend said they did not know either Mr. Rivera, who Father Weiksnar said has long since left the church, or Mr. Hernandez.Another of Mr. Hernandez’s sisters, Maria Lopez, declined to comment on Sunday, but said, “Keep us in your prayers. Keep us in your prayers.”'"
"'12-05-28,'0','“The Grand Old Party and the Sea” (editorial, May 17) criticized House Republicans for leading efforts to slow the expansion of “catch share” mechanisms in coastal fisheries by which allowable fish harvest of coastal stocks is awarded or sold to groups, corporations or individuals.The fact that environmental champions like Barney Frank and Frank Pallone joined 21 other House Democrats in a vote for the amendment shows that, despite what you suggest, catch shares do not have the support of the fishing communities. In fact, commoditizing coastal fish stocks, to the exclusion of local fishermen, is proving to be a devastating failure in the New England cod fishery.Summer flounder were not rebuilt as a result of catch shares. While New England’s commercial groundfish quota is now managed through catch shares, this privatization mechanism is not in place for summer flounder, and coastal anglers would like to keep it that way.Considering the importance of summer flounder to New York anglers, and red snapper in the Gulf of Mexico, Representatives Michael Grimm and Steve Southerland are to be applauded for standing up for saltwater fishermen, as are the other 218 members of the House who voted in a bipartisan fashion (220 to 191) to protect public access to a sustainable natural public resource.The writer is managing director of the Recreational Fishing Alliance and president of the New York Sportfishing Federation.'"
"'12-05-28,'0','MADRID (AP) — The troubled Spanish lender Bankia will treat the billions of euros of state aid that it will receive in the country’s biggest-ever bank bailout as an investment meant to make a profit for the Spanish government and not as a loan, its president said Sunday.José Ignacio Goirigolzarri, Bankia’s president, appeared to be trying to reassure markets after the Spanish media questioned what he had meant by saying a day earlier: “We don’t need to talk about giving any of it back.”In a statement on Sunday, he said Bankia’s obligation is “not to return that capital but to be able to generate value and profitability for that contribution.”Mr. Goirigolzarri said the Spanish state would decide “when it deems appropriate, and through the mechanism it chooses,” when to sell its stake in Bankia to obtain the highest possible price to benefit taxpayers.On Friday, Bankia sought 19 billion euros ($24 billion) in bailout money from the Spanish government. This comes on top of 4.5 billion euros that it expects to receive in an emergency loan in June.Bankia is stuck with 32 billion euros ($40 billion) in bad assets on its books from loans in the property sector before Spain’s real estate bubble burst.The Bank of Spain has estimated that the country’s banks are sitting on some 180 billion euros ($225 billion) in tenuous assets.'"
"'12-05-28,'0','The Council’s statement is sure to be a factor in efforts by a former United Nations secretary general, , to begin negotiating with the government on Monday on carrying out the six-point peace plan that he engineered as a special envoy.But Mr. Assad has repeatedly shown himself to be impervious to international pressure. A string of international leaders have criticized Mr. Assad for making promises like respecting the cease-fire, and then continuing his attempt to put down the uprising by force. Indeed, there were reports of another case of Syrian shelling of civilians on Sunday, this time at Hama, a center of resistance where activists said dozens had been killed in new attacks. The details could not be confirmed.Some Syrian opposition figures have criticized Western efforts to push the cease-fire when it was so clear that the government held it in contempt, and a few threatened vengeance against Alawites.The issue also reverberated in partisan politics in the , with , the presumed Republican presidential candidate, calling the massacre “horrific” and criticizing for backing the Annan plan.“The Annan ‘peace’ plan — which President Obama still supports — has merely granted the Assad regime more time to execute its military onslaught,” the Romney statement said. “The United States should work with partners to organize and arm Syrian opposition groups so they can defend themselves.”has typically rejected any international effort to support the opposition in a way that might repeat the military intervention in , and despite strong statements, the West has avoided getting further embroiled in the fighting out of fear of the long-term consequences.On Sunday, the Council statement said that the “outrageous use of force” against civilians violated international law and commitments the Syrian government had made under the plan to stop using its heavy weapons in populated areas. It demanded that the Syrian government cease using heavy weapons immediately and pull its troops out of cities and towns. It also asked the United Nations observer mission in Syria to continue investigating the Houla attacks.An earlier draft of the statement had more directly blamed the Syrian government for the massacre, but the Russians balked, saying they wanted to hear a closed briefing from the observers’ leader, Gen. Robert Mood, in Damascus. The Council statement emerged after that briefing.Diplomats said the details General Mood presented closely followed those laid out by , the United Nations secretary general, whose three-page letter demanded a concrete attempt to censure Syria and endorse the cease-fire.In his letter, Mr. Ban skated very close to blaming Syrian government shelling for at least some of the deaths while carefully noting that the cause had not been completely determined. United Nations monitors “observed shotgun wounds and wounds consistent with artillery fire.”The Russians seemed to be swayed by the arguments that it made little sense that the opposition, which is heavily Sunni Muslim, or even extremist jihadist elements, would kill so many of their own faith in cold blood, said one Security Council diplomat, speaking anonymously about a closed-door session.“The patrol also saw artillery and tank shells, as well as fresh tank tracks,” Mr. Ban told the Council. “Many buildings had been destroyed by heavy artillery.”The letter included other hints that government forces were involved, including the fact that up to eight bodies of civilians were removed from a government checkpoint in Teldo village. “The bodies bore signs of severe ,” the letter said.Over all, the letter said the monitors found evidence of “appalling and brutal crimes, which involved indiscriminate and disproportionate use of force.”One of the reasons that the Security Council had to act firmly, Mr. Ban said, is that ordinary Syrians are blaming the unarmed United Nations observers for not doing more to stop the violence, even if there are misconceptions about their role.In , the top United Nations human rights official issued a statement saying that the “indiscriminate and possibly deliberate targeting of civilians” in Houla might amount to crimes against humanity or other international crimes. Navi Pillay, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, called for Syrian cooperation with an independent, international investigation to determine what happened.In Damascus earlier, the Syrian government rejected any tie to the massacre. “We unequivocally deny the responsibility of government forces for the massacre,” Jihad Makdissi, the spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, told a news conference. He reiterated government claims that the killings were the result of a terrorist attack, and he regretted that the United Nations and other foreign governments seemed to have accepted the opposition’s version of events.Amateur videos said to be taken in the aftermath showed row after row of victims, many of them small children with what appeared to be bullet holes in their temples or what the opposition said were stab wounds.Mr. Makdissi said the army did not send any tanks into the town of Houla, that security forces did not leave their positions and remained in a defensive posture. Instead, he said, hundreds of gunmen armed with machine guns, mortars and antitank missiles began attacking government positions in a skirmish that lasted much of the day and well into the night. Three soldiers were killed and 16 wounded, he said.Yet he seemed to sidestep the main accusation made by the United Nations about shelling civilians. Mr. Makdissi did say that the Syrian government would not fire on its own civilians. Yet it has an established history of doing so throughout the uprising.Mr. Makdissi said a judicial military committee inquiry had been formed that would investigate the killings and report back in three days., which currently holds the presidency of the , announced an emergency meeting of Arab foreign ministers on the massacre. Syrian ties with the League were strained last year after its membership was suspended.In , Burhan Ghalioun, the president of the Syrian National Council, the main opposition group in exile, called on the international community to honor its commitment to protect Syrian civilians, saying if it did not, they would have no choice than to take matters into their own hands. “The international community suffers from a lack of will when it comes to protecting Syrian civilians,” Mr. Ghalioun, who is leaving the presidency, told a news conference. “The situation in Syria is truly explosive.”His statement reflected the popular anger in Syria, especially among Sunni Muslims, that they were being targeted with impunity. Community chat rooms were filled with harsh, angry comments suggesting that the only solution to the crisis was to rid the country of the minority Alawite sect.“Such massacres, such atrocities, definitely push the narrative of those who say this is a sectarian conflict,” said Fadi Salem, a program director at the School of Government. “The atmosphere is charged with sectarian feelings on both sides and this is a real threat.”'"
"'12-05-28,'0','Because standard clothing must be densely woven or dark colored to offer advanced UV protection, these specially treated clothes are “good if you want something long-sleeved that is also lightweight,” Dr. Lawrence said.But as sun-protective clothing has made its way into the mainstream, seemingly obvious features like sleeves have occasionally been sacrificed, defeating part of the purpose. Lesser offenses include shorts and sleeveless shirts, while items like bikinis — which claim to offer the maximum degree of sun protection — might be a bit of a stretch.Consumers seem understandably puzzled by these UV-protective wares, perhaps buying them with fingers crossed. “I have used this product occasionally for several years with the hope that it works,” said one reviewer on Amazon.com for Sun Guard, a laundry treatment that says it puts “an invisible shield into clothing that helps block more than 96 percent of the sun’s harmful rays from reaching your skin.” The reviewer added, “Preferring white shirts for outdoor activities, I trust that this dye is blocking UV radiation, but I can’t say for sure.”To some critics, introducing chemicals to a naturally sun-protective category like clothing seems wasteful. “Our recommendation is that you stick to clothes with tighter weave and that will provide adequate UPF protection,” said David Andrews, a senior researcher with the Environmental Working Group, which compiles an annual guide to sunscreens. “Not to mention there’s no need to do a full load of wash with all your undergarments and everything to make them UPF protected.”The Food and Drug Administration briefly regulated sun-protective clothes in the early 1990s, classifying them as medical devices. While it no longer does that, the Federal Trade Commission does monitor marketing claims about garments and sun protection. A measurement called UPF, or ultraviolet protection factor, is the standard for UV-protective clothing. Developed in 2001 by ASTM International, a product-testing agency, a UPF ranges from 1 to 50, with 50 being the most UV light that is blocked by a garment.The F.D.A. does continue to regulate claims made by traditional sunscreens, which will soon undergo the first significant changes in decades. Manufacturers will have to show that their products protect against both UVB rays, which cause burns, and UVA rays, which are linked to skin cancers. Gone will be labels of “waterproof” or “sweatproof,” and lotions will have to indicate how often they need to be reapplied. Originally slated to go into effect in June, the new labeling requirements have been delayed until December to give manufacturers time to comply.Other products that are not traditionally associated with sun protection seem to be marketed to imply that they can do more than they can deliver. Sun-related claims are now common among hair products, like TRESemmé’s “Climate Control” shampoo and conditioner, which both use ingredients like olive oil, keratin and a UV-blocking chemical called avobenzone to prevent frizz and drying. Outside of those benefits, the products offer no actual UV protection, according to the company.But keeping your hair bouncy and protecting your scalp from the sun are different things, dermatologists say. “The UV-protection for your hair will obviously not prevent skin cancer,” said Dr. D’Anne M. Kleinsmith, a dermatologist in West Bloomfield, Mich., “but it will prevent hair color from fading and protect the hair so that it does not become dry and brittle from the sun.”One risk to the proliferation of sun-protective marketing language (Pink Ladybug Water Shoes with UPF 50, anyone?) is that consumers may be lulled into a false sense of security, said Dr. Lawrence of Cooper University Medical Center. For example, cosmetics companies now sell foundation with SPF protection. Neutrogena’s Healthy Skin Compact Makeup SPF 55, to use one example, includes avobenzone, the same chemical found in TRESemmé’s “Climate Control” line.While these products may reflect UV rays, Dr. Lawrence said, rarely do women wear enough foundation for the protective properties to kick in. “You have to put sunscreen on pretty thick,” she said. So, to wear enough foundation as sunscreen, “you’d look like you had it caked on.” Better to apply an actual sunscreen, then foundation, she said.While no one tracks sales of sun-protective products across categories, the market for them is clearly growing, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst with the NPD Group, a research company.“Coming out of the recession, consumers are looking at products with a greater level of scrutiny and greater expectations,” he said. “They want their products to do more than just one thing, not just to look good, but to travel well and to match their lifestyle and to protect them from the environment.”Also fueling demand are new technologies that allow chemicals to be added to thinner fabrics. Dr. Heidi Waldorf, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, recalls wearing earlier, less stylish UV-protective clothing.“I looked like I escaped from a nuclear site,” she said of the head-to-toe attire she wore on a bike trip through the Canadian Rockies 10 years ago. “But I never got burned.”'"
"'12-05-28,'0','The so-called risk premium demanded by investors for holding 10-year Spanish government bonds, instead of German bonds, reached 5.1 percentage points Monday, the biggest differential since the introduction of the euro.While the government could seek to raise cash on the bond markets, it now would have to pay interest rates near a record. On Monday, the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds rose as high as 6.5 percent, close to the 7 percent level that led to bailouts in Greece, Ireland and Portugal.“If Spain wants to calm the markets and reduce the risk premium, the only possibility seems to be to appeal for help to the European institutions,” said Arturo Bris, a Spanish economist who teaches finance at the International Institute of Management Development, known as I.M.D., in Switzerland. “It’s just too late for the government to make strong statements in order to appease the markets.”Daragh Quinn, a banking analyst in London for Nomura, on Monday described the Bankia collapse as “grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented.” The phrase was coined as the acronym G.U.B.U. in Ireland, where the economy was sunk by the collapse of its banking sector and received an 85 billion euro bailout in late 2010 from the European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund.As investors seek havens from the euro zone’s troubles, Switzerland — which is not part of the European Union and uses its own currency, the franc — has begun considering new controls to stop a destabilizing inflow of foreign currency into the country. The Swiss National Bank worries that too much money rushing in would bid up the value of the franc so high that Switzerland’s industries would have trouble competing on global markets.In Spain, Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, had forecast this month that the cost of rescuing Bankia and other Spanish banks would not exceed 15 billion euros. Mr. Quinn, however, estimated Monday that recapitalizing Spanish banks would cost up to an additional 60 billion euros.Madrid does not have that kind of money, having depleted the funds previously set aside to cover smaller banks. Bankia has already received a 4.5 billion euro emergency loan, bringing the total cost of its rescue to 23.5 billion euros, including the 19 billion euros requested Friday.The Spanish government seized control of Bankia on May 9, two days after its executive chairman quit. On Friday, the bank’s board revised its accounts, posting a 2011 loss of almost 3 billion euros instead of the 309 million euros in profit reported in February.The government could soon get saddled with three other banks — CatalunyaCaixa, Novacaixagalicia and Banco de Valencia — that have been put up for sale, so far unsuccessfully.The Spanish prime minister said on Monday that the government had not discussed its banking problems with the European Central Bank. That followed weekend news reports suggesting that because Spain hoped to avoid a European bailout — in particular the conditions that creditors might set in return for emergency financing — Madrid would instead try to rely on more central bank financing.The European Central Bank has already helped sustain ailing banks in Spain and across Europe by providing them with low-cost, three-year loans. But the idea that it would be willing to do much more on its own was dismissed by Edward Hugh, an economist in Barcelona who has been tracking the financial crisis. “The E.C.B. could be involved, but only as part of a broader European solution,” he added.Failure to rescue Bankia could turn the trickle of domestic money leaving Spain into a full-fledged flight.Bankia has also become a political liability for the government, partly because it failed to recognize earlier the extent of the banking problem. Investors have lost billions of euros in the shares of Bankia since they were publicly listed in July. The offering, which raised 3.1 billion euros, was strongly backed by the Socialist administration as part of its efforts to bolster the savings banks, or cajas, with more private capital.The Socialists, now the main opposition party, vowed over the weekend to oppose any further use of public money to head off Bankia’s collapse until a full investigation could determine responsibility for the bank’s misstated accounts.Still, the conservative government has a parliamentary majority, and Alberto Ruiz-Gallardón, the justice minister, suggested that regulators should wait for “the opportune moment” to review Bankia’s demise from a successful stock sale to the biggest bailout in Spanish banking history.“We have to handle these times thinking about what is best for Spain,” Mr. Ruiz-Gallardón said Sunday in a radio interview.'"
"'12-05-28,'0','In an interview in his spacious office here in Palo Alto, Mr. Bates, an affable Briton, said he insisted that his employees receive new security badges stamped with the Skype logo, not the standard Microsoft badges.Another sign of his independence is the Apple MacBook Air on his desk. While using Apple products publicly is not unheard-of among Microsoft executives, it is nevertheless considered a mild form of sacrilege at a company where everyone is expected to fly the Windows flag.“We’ve kept our identity and our autonomy,” Mr. Bates, 45, said.The distance has helped Skype stay true to its mission of allowing people to make calls from practically any device connected to the Internet, not just the ones powered by Microsoft software. In the last several months, Skype has cranked out versions of its calling software for Google Android smartphones, a Sony portable game console, Comcast set-top boxes and Apple mobile devices. Skype is the fourth most-downloaded free app of all time for both the iPhone and iPad.The level of attention to building software for other companies’ devices is remarkable at Microsoft, a company for which Windows and related software products account for a vast majority of profits. While most Skype calls still happen on Windows PCs, much of Skype’s growth is likely to come from new mobile devices, a category in which Microsoft is struggling to play a major role.When Microsoft announced plans to acquire Skype a year ago, some skeptics feared it would be just a matter of time before Microsoft began turning Skype into a communications network for its own products, treating all the smartphones, tablets and other non-Microsoft devices that Skype ran on as an afterthought. Apple, after all, had done something similar when it created FaceTime, a video calling service that works only on iPhones, iPads and Macintoshes.“We always want Skype to be first and best on Windows, but certainly a strategic part of the value in communications software is working on all platforms,” Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, said recently in an interview. “We’re committed to that cross-platform support.”Beloved for its cheap and free Internet calls, Skype’s use has continued to grow briskly, jumping 40 percent to 100 billion minutes of calls in the first three months of this year from the same period last year.Still, Mr. Bates and other Microsoft executives cannot afford for Skype to be too independent. They want to avoid repeating what happened after Skype was acquired by the auction site eBay for $2.6 billion in 2005. The audience for Skype soared after that deal too. But when expected synergies with eBay did not materialize, eBay spun off Skype into a separate company with new investors.Microsoft plans to integrate Skype into Lync, a Microsoft communications product aimed at businesses. Another priority is making Skype video conferencing work on Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console, though that product is not likely to be released this year. In a sign of the investment Microsoft is making in its new acquisition, Skype has about 400 job openings, Mr. Bates said.One of Skype’s most recent efforts, a version of the calling software for smartphones that run Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system, has received disappointing reviews. When users shut the Skype application down on their Windows Phones, they can no longer receive calls. In the same situation on iPhones and other devices, Skype users receive a notification of an incoming call.Brian O’Shaughnessy, a spokesman for Skype, said that shortcoming would be addressed in a future version of the software.Microsoft’s ownership of Skype has added a twist in the parent company’s efforts to get wireless carriers to sell Windows Phone devices.Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, a maker of Windows Phones, told an audience at a recent conference that “the feedback from operators is they don’t like Skype” because its cheap and free phone calls can steal revenue from traditional phone businesses. Nokia is talking to carriers about ways to bundle Nokia Windows Phones with Skype and lucrative high-speed data plans, Mr. Elop added.Mr. Ballmer said Skype has not been an impediment to Windows Phone. “I think any savvy operator understands that the future of communications doesn’t look like the present of communications,” he said.Mr. Ballmer keeps close tabs on Skype’s progress. He confers regularly with Mr. Bates using Skype software, Mr. Bates said. While Microsoft has a spotty record of successfully acquiring other companies, Mr. Ballmer has worked hard to bond with Skype’s employees.Shortly after announcing the acquisition, Mr. Ballmer flew to meet with Skype engineers in its offices in Tallinn, Estonia. He took part in an initiation ritual for new Skype employees there by drinking Millimallikas, a mixture of sambuca, tequila and Tabasco sauce.“I think it created an instant kinship,” Mr. Bates said.'"
"'12-05-28,'0','Falling behind, 0-5, in the second set might have made a major upset just about inevitable, even though the 32-year-old Brianti, ranked 105th, had shown no previous inclinations to create shock waves at major tournaments. But Azarenka, still tempestuous but no longer overwrought when confronted with her own tennis imperfections, proceeded to rear back and, suspect right shoulder and all, smack an ace on the line with her second serve.If the ball had bounced another inch or so to the left, she might have been booking a flight to Minsk or Monte Carlo instead of her next practice court in Paris. But she held serve and proceeded to win six straight games to even the match at one set apiece and ultimately prevail, 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-2, despite making an unsightly 60 unforced errors and struggling to generate her customary speed and rhythm with her serve.“Sometimes, I felt it was not my day,” said Azarenka, who said the shoulder problem, which caused her to retire from her last tournament in Rome, was much improved. “Sometimes I thought: ‘Yeah, maybe I still fight. I still have a chance.’ Sometimes it was like: ‘You know what? Forget it. I don’t want to do it.’ But the important thing in that really miserable, if you can say, moment, is I stay strong, and I just went for my shots. I just went for what I had to do, and I didn’t do before.“That shows a little bit of not losing courage, I guess.”The French Open has become a home tournament of sorts for Azarenka. She is based in French-speaking Monaco after leaving her former training base in Arizona. She began working with the French coach Sam Sumyk in 2010, and her physical therapist Jean-Pierre Bruyère, her sparring partner Julien Jeanpierre and her new star recruit, Mauresmo, also are French. All this explains Azarenka’s crash course in the language, even if most members of the team have a global outlook and, in most cases, home addresses outside France.“That’s why we are smiling when we see or hear or read about the French connection,” Sumyk said. “Of course we are French, but we feel like citizens of the world a little bit. It’s weird to say that, but we feel like, I don’t know, this is not really a French team.”Sumyk, a modest club player in his youth in Brittany, left for Florida in his 20s and eventually began coaching Meilen Tu, the former tour player from the United States who is now his wife and Azarenka’s agent. He and Tu live in Calabasas, Calif., north of Los Angeles. Bruyère lives outside London. Mauresmo, like many present and former French tennis stars, resides officially in Switzerland.But Monte Carlo is now the hub in the spinning wheel of Azarenka’s peripatetic life. She and her team gather there or, more often than not, elsewhere. They spent Christmas in Dubai with her boyfriend, the tennis player Sergei Bubka Jr., and his father Sergei Bubka, the former world-champion pole-vaulter from Ukraine.“This lifestyle is really difficult, but it’s also really interesting,” Azarenka said in an interview Monday. “I don’t know on the part of being a coach, but as a player you can only appreciate those people who travel with you so much and they just kind of dedicate their life to you. So that’s really something that you cannot say thank you with words.”Sumyk, tan and tattooed, has also coached the tour players Elena Likhovtseva, Gisela Dulko, Ann Kremer and Vera Zvonareva. He was between jobs and spending a rare Christmas with his French family when Azarenka, who knew him through his wife, Meilen Tu, called and asked him to be her coach.Two and a half years into their professional relationship, Sumyk still has no formal contract with Azarenka, which they say suits them both.“I’m a very honest person,” Azarenka said. “We never have a problem with that. We have complete trust, which is perfect. We don’t need that. We are fair with each other. A lot of coaches sometimes wouldn’t say something that you are doing wrong just because they are afraid to lose their job. Sam will tell me right away. He’s not afraid to lose his job. He said, ‘Well I’m always going to be honest with you.’ And I appreciate that.”It has not been a trouble-free rise to the top. Azarenka dropped from No. 7 at the end of 2009 to No. 10 at the end of 2010. An intense personality with a perfectionist streak, Azarenka considered quitting the sport early in 2011, only to find renewed inspiration from her grandmother in Minsk, who urged her to press on and emphasize the positive. But her climb has been steady and convincing since then. Her fiery on-court behavior still resurfaces, — she dropped a racket and shrieked in dismay on Monday — but Azarenka credits Sumyk for helping her manage it better.“I don’t think he made me do it,” she said. “I feel he was guiding me, which is the smartest way, because when you push somebody to do something they don’t know or they have never experienced, they kind of put a block on it and reject it. It’s like a parents-kid relationship.”Sumyk was also open and confident enough to agree to add Mauresmo as a consultant in April after Azarenka had already won her first Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open this year and risen to No. 1. The idea was to avoid complacency and to bring on board a former champion who knew how to navigate the game’s biggest tournaments.“She was the same as me,” Azarenka said of Mauresmo’s approach to her career. “We built a team around us, and we are working toward the same goal. There might be better coaches, there might be better fitness trainers, there might be better physios in the world. But for me, it’s important to have people who really have my back and who really care about me and who really want to succeed with me.”It is interesting that Mauresmo’s first Grand Slam tournament with Azarenka is the French Open, a tournament Mauresmo never came close to winning — despite her clay-court prowess — because of the weight of expectations, both her own and the French public’s.Azarenka’s edgy, erratic performance Monday must have looked uncomfortably familiar to Mauresmo, who was sitting next to Sumyk in the players’ box, folding and unfolding her arms as the errors and shrieks piled up.“To be honest, I think it’s a new situation for her,” Mauresmo said on the British network ITV. “It’s the first time she is playing a Grand Slam tournament as the No. 1 player in the world. She was maybe not expecting this emotion to get to her, but it got to her today. So now I think my role and Sam’s role is to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Or at least if it happens that she react a little quicker than she did today.”It all worked out in the end this time, though, unless of course you were a Brianti fan, and now Azarenka can keep working on her French. A victory speech “en français” does not seem likely, however, unless she starts playing much better tennis.'"

"'12-05-28,'0','Mr. Rehn must be tough enough on big countries like France — which is set to exceed its deficit targets by a wide margin — to earn recognition as a credible watchdog. Yet he also will want to avoid antagonizing elected leaders like the new French president, François Hollande, who has vowed to make growth rather than austerity his priority.In the case of Italy, Mr. Rehn could hold the government led by Prime Minister Mario Monti to commitments to make important structural changes, like improving tax collection.In the case of Spain, Mr. Rehn could seek to hold the government of Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to ambitious deficit targets — and yet offer more time to meet those targets in light of the worsening economic outlook for Europe as a whole. The situation in Spain is particularly delicate, given the determination of Mr. Rajoy to avoid an international bailout and conditions that would be set by creditors in return for emergency financing.Last week, Mr. Rehn also laid out his proposal for creating euro bonds — debt that would be jointly backed by all euro zone member countries and would be meant to reduce borrowing costs for members that cannot get affordable credit on their own. Although any such bonds would probably be issued by some kind of joint European debt agency, some responsibilities still could fall within the commission’s bailiwick.In coming months, Mr. Rehn also will be able to deploy his new powers to impose fines on euro zone countries of up to 0.2 percent of their gross domestic products. And he will be able to turn up pressure on noneuro area E.U. countries that flout rules on racking up high public debts and deficits under a half-dozen rules known as the Six-Pack, which took effect in December.Mr. Rehn, for example, already successfully punished Hungary in March for breaking the bloc’s budget rules. He said he would suspend payment of nearly €500 million, or $627 million at the current exchange rate, in development funds to Hungary next year unless Budapest made progress bringing down its deficit.Before the region’s economic crisis, such intervention in national finances was mostly off limits. Now, wielding that power will test the resolve of both the European Commission and the countries it will try to bend to its budgetary will.“There will be several battles ahead as the commission asserts itself over national capitals during the coming months and years,” said Jean Pisani-Ferry, the director of Bruegel, a research group in Brussels. “Olli Rehn needs to behave strategically — and I trust he is astute enough for that — in order to cement the commission’s new authority,” he said.The verdicts on Wednesday also will be an important milepost for the civil servants, the guardians of the Union’s treaties who have long struggled for greater relevance.For most of the crisis, the Eurocrats have watched in dismay as the most important decisions have been made by elected leaders in Berlin and Paris, and by protesters in the streets of Athens and Madrid. But the crisis now may be turning into the best chance in decades for officials in Brussels to expand their powers.The most tantalizing prospects for the officials would be that the currency union remains mostly intact, giving them new oversight powers. Someday, those powers might include running a federal system of bank oversight with Europe-wide deposit insurance.For now, the civil servants’ most important new tool is the Six-Pack. The previous budget rules were discredited during the last decade when Germany and France essentially ignored their deficit-cap provisions. Under the new rules, even the most powerful countries might have trouble skirting the rules — although some experts remain skeptical about how much clout the commission might have in practice.“Brussels certainly can hope that these surveillance powers give them back the initiative,” said Daniel Gros, the director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization in Brussels. “But my main concern is that well-behaved countries will continue to behave well, while others won’t allow themselves to be superseded by Brussels.”The more power Brussels accumulates, the more vulnerable it might be to criticism.Although the commission has no power to raise taxes, and its budget is relatively tiny — only around 1 percent of the Union’s total gross domestic product — it already is synonymous with bloat.And while the commission has long been able to impose big fines on companies for anti-competitive practices and to sue member states for breaking the rules in wide range of areas from free trade to pollution, any further expansion of its powers is fraught with concerns that it could become an antidemocratic European superstate.Neither the commission nor its president, José Manuel Barroso, is directly elected. As did the president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, Mr. Barroso went through a selection process that governments conducted partly behind closed doors. The European Parliament signs off on laws, but it cannot initiate legislation and it suffers from low voter turnout.And as the Union expands, the influence of members like France, Germany and the Netherlands becomes more diluted. The Union now includes 27 countries — including 10 from the former Soviet bloc that joined during the past decade — and each sends representatives to Brussels.Despite the challenges it faces, the commission probably will need to play a central role in the drive toward centralized economic governance, said Jean-Claude Piris, who was head of the legal service in Brussels that advises E.U. governments on European law until last year.“Most governments have realized that the commission is best placed to do the kinds of surveillance that are needed to persuade Germany to take bold steps like agreeing to mutualize debt,” said Mr. Piris, alluding to the debate over euro bonds. “But if there are moves to go much further toward centralizing governance of the euro area,” he said, “then that is likely to be a whole other discussion.”'"
"'12-05-28,'0','After a three-year delay, the Justice Department has finally issued mandatory rape prevention policies for federal prisons and state correctional institutions that receive federal dollars. The new rules, which were given the force of an executive order, are a clear improvement over a draft version. If monitored and enforced, they could help curb the assaults that are shamefully endemic to the corrections system.The new rules coincide with the release of a frightening study from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, which found that nearly 10 percent of former state prisoners said they had been sexually victimized during their most recent confinement. That is more than double the percentage found in a previous Bureau of Justice Statistics study released in 2010.The rules say that all facilities must adopt zero-tolerance policies. And they include detailed requirements for prisons to investigate and report all allegations of sexual attack and improve medical and mental health care for victims. They also require that each correctional facility’s rape prevention programs be reviewed once every three years by outside auditors certified by the Justice Department. And the rules bar correctional agencies from imposing a deadline for inmates to report an allegation. Victims are typically traumatized by an attack and may take days or even months to gather the courage to speak out.Unfortunately, the rules only discourage — but do not bar — the placement of youths in adult facilities, where they are at far greater risk of being sexually assaulted. Congress should end this practice once and for all. Until that happens, the new rules will better protect young people by requiring that they be housed separately from adults, prohibiting contact with adults in common areas and limiting the use of solitary confinement for young people, who are more vulnerable to suicide when left alone.A state whose governor does not fully comply with the rules could lose 5 percent of any Department of Justice grant funds for prisons. If humanity is not enough to get prison systems to change their policies, maybe that penalty will work. Rape must not be part of a prison sentence.1000 2012-05-28 “She wouldn’t rent a movie and then just leave,” her mother said a few days later. “She’s a very predictable, conscientious person. For her to just leave without telling anyone is totally out of character.”Ms. Sylvia called the police. Investigators called Mr. Rodriguez, the landlord, who was cooperative over the telephone from his home in Orange County, N.Y., but as the days dragged on, he himself disappeared. His family refused to allow officers onto his property, so the police searched with helicopters. They found nothing.The landlord sold the building, and the police hurried inside with cadaver-sniffing dogs, tearing up the floor but finding nothing. Mr. Rodriguez was later arrested on tax fraud charges and pleaded guilty to larceny after admitting he had used a dead man’s identity to commit fraud. He served nearly six years in prison and was paroled in 2004.There would be grim discoveries, the familiar mile-markers of missing-persons cases. A severed foot was found in the Hudson River; the police searched, finding nothing more. Ms. Sylvia gave blood in hopes of a DNA match to the foot, but none came.No one was ever charged in the couple’s disappearance.Ms. Sylvia is 70 now, and was cheerful on Monday when a reporter’s call interrupted her window-washing chores. She now lives in Centerville, Mass.“I think about this every day, of course,” she said. “Every time anybody disappears, I go, ‘Oh, one more person.’ ”She followed the news when the Patz case re-emerged last month, as federal agents dug up a cellar floor. “When they were digging down there, I was like, ‘Oh, I wonder if they’ll ever find anything.’ ”She saw an outcome that she was very familiar with: nothing.But the arrest last week of Pedro Hernandez, who the police said confessed to killing Etan, gave her hope, particularly because of the manner in which he came to their attention: a tipster had called the authorities.“Other people must know something about Camden and Michael,” she said.” I hope somehow they’ll find some sort of evidence. I think somebody could speak. How do you get rid of two people?”She has not spoken to the police, who have always said the case remained open, in a long time. “This is what they usually say: ‘We’re working on it, and we’ve got boxes of evidence, we’re looking at it,’ ” she said.“The other side of the coin is, do you really want to know what someone did to your loved ones?” she said. “To hear the gruesome details might not be something you want to do.”The apartment building on Pearl Street looks about the same, just as Etan’s building does, not very far away.1001 2012-05-28 To see how hard it is to judge choreography in musicals, you need only watch all four of this year’s Tony nominees. What criteria are involved? In ballet and modern dance, choreography is the shaping factor, the ingredient that brings music, subject matter and performance together into a whole; in a musical, that’s seldom so. But the great choreographers are great directors too: inventors of their own genres of theater.Paradoxically, some of the most eminent choreographers — from George Balanchine to Matthew Bourne — have also been happy to work with directors in musicals, and have learned new skills by doing so. Jerome Robbins is the most famous of those who worked on Broadway as a director-choreographer. There is no single method for choreography to succeed in a musical: It may be a source of isolated highlights or a unifying thread.Don’t many people go to musicals principally for their high energy? In that respect, none of the current crop deliver as well as the choreographer Christopher Gattelli does in “Newsies.” Energy is crucial to the story; the dances keep bursting with the explosive jumps performed by a large ensemble.Others look primarily for a certain inventive wit. Only in Kathleen Marshall’s dances for the Gershwin musical “Nice Work if You Can Get It” is wit even sporadically evident this year. The way a line of women pass Matthew Broderick along like a parcel is just one image that raises a smile; there are a few others.It’s also natural to look for stylistic originality. Here the prize surely goes to Steven Hoggett for “Once,” even though this production has less choreography than any other of this year’s Tony nominees. And the originality of Mr. Hoggett’s contribution lies not in his dances, but in the way group gestures occasionally take the show into an enlarged, surreal dimension. Really, the story of “Once” ought to appear corny: It’s the old “Will this provincial boy with a dream make it to the big lights of New York?” But the emphasis on the realities and impact of making music renders “Once” the freshest show of the group.A more potent aspect of choreography , though, can beam forth when dance and movement are indivisible from direction, and where they seem constantly to give a show further dimension. I find most of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s music and Tim Rice’s lyrics for “Evita” banal (why does Evita think Argentina might cry for her, anyway?). Yet Rob Ashford’s dances and the physical aspects of Michael Grandage’s direction make the whole show suspenseful, fleshing out aspects of society and politics beyond the words and music.1002 2012-05-28 BEIJING — The older brother of Chen Guangcheng, the persecuted rights advocate who left China for the United States this month, is back in the family’s home village after evading guards there to travel to Beijing to meet with a lawyer, an American legal scholar who is advising Mr. Chen said Sunday.The scholar, Jerome A. Cohen, a law professor at New York University, wrote in an e-mail that the brother, Chen Guangfu, was back at home as of Saturday night and “unguarded but under great pressure.” Like his younger brother, Mr. Chen is from the village of Dongshigu, in Shandong Province, a place infamous for the guards who were assigned by local officials to keep Chen Guangcheng and his family under severe house arrest and to bar any outsiders from seeing them.After Mr. Chen made a daring nighttime escape last month, police officers detained his older brother and his nephew, Chen Kegui, who was charged with intent to commit homicide when he slashed local officials with a kitchen knife, seriously injuring at least one, after the officials broke into the home of his father following his uncle’s escape.Chen Guangfu had left the village in the middle of the night last week to travel to Beijing to meet with a lawyer, Ding Xikui, who had agreed to advocate on behalf of his son. Family members insist the son was acting only in self-defense, since he did not know the men breaking into the home were officials. The son’s wife, Liu Fang, sent a letter to the local authorities late last week demanding that her husband be allowed to meet with lawyers.It is unclear whether the father had been forced to return to Dongshigu by security officers or went back on his own. Local officials in China often send police officers to Beijing to retrieve discontented citizens who travel to the Chinese capital to try to make their grievances known to central officials. Chen Guangcheng was himself seized in Beijing by such officers in September 2005.Mr. Chen has been given a fellowship to study at the New York University School of Law, where Mr. Cohen has long been a professor. Mr. Chen, his wife and their daughter now live near Washington Square Park in Lower Manhattan, but he has said he plans to return to China after a period of study.1003 2012-05-28 Combining content from two different magazines can make for interesting, sometimes awkward matchups. Consider the risk in joining a magazine that offers readers design tips like how to avoid tripping over a lamp's electric cord with a magazine tha...1004 2012-05-28 Mr. Ferrantino recounted a breakfast for his clients shortly after the offering in which the biggest topic of discussion was what the Facebook deal had revealed and the sense that “the deck is stacked against them.”Perhaps the best indicator of the broader movement away from stocks is an annual survey done by the Investment Company Institute, which has shown that the percentage of American households invested in domestic stocks, including directly or through any other vehicle whether through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, has fallen every year since the financial crisis to a low in 2011 of 46.4 percent, down from a high of 53 percent in 2001.Stocks remain favored by millions of Americans who invest big parts of their retirement savings in them, and investors who have held the course have benefited from the 29 percent rise in the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index since the beginning of 2009. This does not include the dividends that would have been earned.For decades, participation in the stock markets increased as 401(k) retirement plans grew in popularity and retail brokers created easier access for small traders. The Dow Jones industrial average rose an average of 8.4 percent each year from 1950 to 2000, with some extended periods of little to no growth.Since then, though, the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2001 followed by the financial crisis in 2008 have created a so-called lost decade in which broad stock indexes wound up not that far beyond where they started.Small investors are part of a bigger flight from American stocks. Institutional investors like high-frequency traders have been drawn to other assets like currencies, and pension funds have shifted more money into alternatives, like private equity investments. This has led to a steady decline in the volume of trading in the American stock market and a drop in revenue for New York financial firms. But it has also raised broader questions about the prospects of a market that has long been the central cog for American companies raising money to grow and create jobs.“If investors lose confidence then capital formation doesn’t function as well,” said David Weild, a former vice chairman of Nasdaq, and the founder of Capital Markets Advisory Partners.Among the ordinary investors who are helping drive this shift, the motivations are varied. Some are retiring and making a conservative move to less risky assets like bonds. Others are put off by the economic uncertainty as Europe fails to find solutions to its debt problems. But there has also been a growing din of complaints about the flaws in the structure of the markets — as displayed by the Facebook debut.Robert Diepersloot, a dairy farmer in Madera, Calif., said that watching the Facebook offering confirmed all the fears and suspicions that led him earlier this year to take out the savings, in the five figures, that he and his wife had invested in stocks and stock mutual funds and move it into real estate investments.“We just pulled out completely,” Mr. Diepersloot said. “We’ve lost trust in the whole scenario.”Mr. Diepersloot’s wife, Willemina, said that there was no one event that drove the family out of stocks, just a disappointment with recent returns and a slow erosion of faith in the reliability of the market.Finance industry professionals are wondering what might persuade Mr. Diepersloot and others like him to change their minds, given that the stock market’s rise over the last three years has not done the job. Many insiders say that may happen only if interest rates begin to rise, after years of falling, and drive down the value of bonds, which is where investors have shifted.Facebook’s stock offering appeared to be doing the job of drumming up interest before it went awry. At one discount broker, ShareBuilder, the number of new accounts opened was 20 times the average and trading activity was up about 50 percent on May 18 across all discount brokers, according to Richard Repetto, a Sandler O’Neill analyst who researches brokers.Fuad Ahmed, the chief executive of the discount broker Just2Trade, said that by the end of Friday about 80 percent of the customers who had bought Facebook dumped it.By Mr. Repetto’s analysis, trading activity at the retail brokers on the Monday after the I.P.O. was back where it had been before Facebook began trading.1005 2012-05-28 BAYLISS--William Heywang, died May 11, at age 88 in Chapel Hill, NC, after a fall.

During WW II he served in ...1006 2012-05-28 After the 1994 emergence of a deadly virus called Hendra in humans and horses in northeastern Australia, biologists found that it came from flying foxes. That led to widespread calls to cull bats or frighten them away from places where people lived.In 2008, however, Dr. Plowright made a crucial discovery. Stress appears to weaken the bats’ immune system, and that is when they are likely to shed the most virus.“It’s the idea that if you get rundown you get sick,” she said. “So trying to kill or move bats could make things worse by stressing them” and causing them to excrete more of the virus in their waste.The finding has quieted calls for large-scale bat removal, and Australia has committed several million dollars to a three-year project to understand viral ecology in bats.The interconnections between human and animal diseases have led to new efforts to understand these mechanisms, including the One Health Initiative, a program that unites medical and veterinary scientists in interdisciplinary approaches to disease and environmental degradation.Wild-animal immunity also provides a near-pristine system to study. “The wild is a null system, a system without interference,” said Peter J. Hudson, a biologist at Penn State and a founder of the infectious disease center there.“Research on wild systems,” he continued, “will help us answer the question of ‘Should we interfere, and how does interference affect the ecology and evolution of these bugs? Will the application of vaccines and antibiotics create more health problems?’ ”Some researchers believe, for example, that the rise in autoimmune disorders may be caused by a lack of stimulation of human immune systems by certain microbes. And while that idea would be hard to evaluate in human studies because our immune systems have been altered for decades with antibiotics and more sterile environments, Dr. Hudson said that “wildlife systems can give us that insight.”Much about the diseases that originate in wildlife is a mystery. In the case of bat viruses, experts believe they evolved for millions of years in intact bat ecosystems, with the animals passing it to one another over and over, causing low-grade infections and building their immune defenses.Jonathan H. Epstein, a veterinarian and a disease ecologist with EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit group in New York, has used experimental infections to understand Nipah virus, which is closely related to Hendra.“These bats don’t even break a sweat when they are raging with Nipah virus,” he said. “So they are really good at spreading it. But a naïve immune system” — like those of humans and horses with respect to Hendra — “goes crazy.”The new work on wild immune systems casts disease in a new light: as an environmental issue. One ecological driver of bat virus transmission is development in the flying foxes’ natural habitat. Instead of living in a wild forest, the bats swoop into the cities and suburbs that replaced it, feeding on nectar in gardens and trees and then passing viruses along to horses and humans.A common thread, disease ecologists say, is that clearing or altering a forest can be akin to opening a Pandora’s box. Keeping nature intact, or developing it in sustainable ways, protects against disease.“If you conserve an ecosystem you have a jolly good chance of conserving human health as well,” said Simon Anthony, a molecular virologist with EcoHealth who is studying the ecology of Nipah and other viruses.Richard S. Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., has been studying the causes of Lyme disease, which causes fatigue, achy joints, fever and chills and has been linked to neurological and heart disease.White-footed mice are a reservoir for the bacteria that creates Lyme, and Dr. Ostfeld says one reason they are so successful at it is that they reproduce very rapidly when the woods are developed and their predators disappear.“The fast dudes like mice are incredibly resilient in the face of human disturbance,” he said. And because they live only six months, they may put their energy into breeding at the expense of immune defense, and so magnify the prevalence of Lyme.Diseases might even be spread by things that are otherwise good for the environment. The notion of connecting fragmented habitats so wildlife have access to critical habitat has been gaining ground. But disease ecologists say it may also spread disease.Bighorn sheep, for example, are moved around the West by wildlife agencies to build populations — but with little thought to pneumonia, Dr. Plowright said.“When we alter the environment abruptly,” Dr. Plowright said, “we radically change the balance between diseases and the immune system, which can affect the entire web of life, including humans. We are just beginning to understand this.”1007 2012-05-29 A lawyer representing the estate of the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf said he was in talks to reach financial settlements with former partners....1008 2012-05-29 Fred Couples will oversee the American team and Nick Price the International squad for the 2013 Presidents Cup, which will be held at Muirfield Village Golf Club, site of this week's Memorial Tournament....1009 2012-05-29 Microsoft is still working to integrate the online calling service Skype, which at $8.5 billion was the biggest acquisition in Microsoft's history....1010 2012-05-29 Energy Secretary Steven Chu recently met with a hydrogen technical-advisory subcommittee, raising hopes among hydrogen advocates that the Energy Department would be more receptive to the technology....1011 2012-05-29 May 29, 2012 — Microsoft still working to integrate Skype.1012 2012-05-29 While attendance for the 2011-12 season was roughly the same as for the previous year, ticket sales were higher, topping $1.13 billion....1013 2012-05-29 The 13.9 million viewers on Monday night for the miniseries about the legendary family feud represent the second largest for a cable program that did not involve sports....1014 2012-05-29 The complaint filed by the former wife of Senator Mark Steven Kirk said he inappropriately reported payments to his then-girlfriend for her work during a 2010 Senate race, The Chicago Tribune reported....1015 2012-05-29 A surprising number of younger investors plan to pull money from the stock market soon.

While using Apple products publicly is not unheard-of among Microsoft executives, it is nevertheless considered a mild form of sacrilege at a company where everyone is expected to fly the Windows flag.“We’ve kept our identity and our autonomy,” Mr. Bates, 45, said.The distance has helped Skype stay true to its mission of allowing people to make calls from practically any device connected to the Internet, not just the ones powered by Microsoft software. In the last several months, Skype has cranked out versions of its calling software for Google Android smartphones, a Sony portable game console, Comcast set-top boxes and Apple mobile devices. Skype is the fourth most-downloaded free app of all time for both the iPhone and iPad.The level of attention to building software for other companies’ devices is remarkable at Microsoft, a company for which Windows and related software products account for a vast majority of profits. While most Skype calls still happen on Windows PCs, much of Skype’s growth is likely to come from new mobile devices, a category in which Microsoft is struggling to play a major role.When Microsoft announced plans to acquire Skype a year ago, some skeptics feared it would be just a matter of time before Microsoft began turning Skype into a communications network for its own products, treating all the smartphones, tablets and other non-Microsoft devices that Skype ran on as an afterthought. Apple, after all, had done something similar when it created FaceTime, a video calling service that works only on iPhones, iPads and Macintoshes.“We always want Skype to be first and best on Windows, but certainly a strategic part of the value in communications software is working on all platforms,” Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive, said recently in an interview. “We’re committed to that cross-platform support.”Beloved for its cheap and free Internet calls, Skype’s use has continued to grow briskly, jumping 40 percent to 100 billion minutes of calls in the first three months of this year from the same period last year.Still, Mr. Bates and other Microsoft executives cannot afford for Skype to be too independent. They want to avoid repeating what happened after Skype was acquired by the auction site eBay for $2.6 billion in 2005. The audience for Skype soared after that deal too. But when expected synergies with eBay did not materialize, eBay spun off Skype into a separate company with new investors.Microsoft plans to integrate Skype into Lync, a Microsoft communications product aimed at businesses. Another priority is making Skype video conferencing work on Microsoft’s Xbox 360 console, though that product is not likely to be released this year. In a sign of the investment Microsoft is making in its new acquisition, Skype has about 400 job openings, Mr. Bates said.One of Skype’s most recent efforts, a version of the calling software for smartphones that run Microsoft’s Windows Phone operating system, has received disappointing reviews. When users shut the Skype application down on their Windows Phones, they can no longer receive calls. In the same situation on iPhones and other devices, Skype users receive a notification of an incoming call.Brian O’Shaughnessy, a spokesman for Skype, said that shortcoming would be addressed in a future version of the software.Microsoft’s ownership of Skype has added a twist in the parent company’s efforts to get wireless carriers to sell Windows Phone devices.Stephen Elop, the chief executive of Nokia, a maker of Windows Phones, told an audience at a recent conference that “the feedback from operators is they don’t like Skype” because its cheap and free phone calls can steal revenue from traditional phone businesses. Nokia is talking to carriers about ways to bundle Nokia Windows Phones with Skype and lucrative high-speed data plans, Mr. Elop added.Mr. Ballmer said Skype has not been an impediment to Windows Phone. “I think any savvy operator understands that the future of communications doesn’t look like the present of communications,” he said.Mr. Ballmer keeps close tabs on Skype’s progress. He confers regularly with Mr. Bates using Skype software, Mr. Bates said. While Microsoft has a spotty record of successfully acquiring other companies, Mr. Ballmer has worked hard to bond with Skype’s employees.Shortly after announcing the acquisition, Mr. Ballmer flew to meet with Skype engineers in its offices in Tallinn, Estonia. He took part in an initiation ritual for new Skype employees there by drinking Millimallikas, a mixture of sambuca, tequila and Tabasco sauce.“I think it created an instant kinship,” Mr. Bates said.1030 2012-05-29 As the summer heat builds in Beijing, so does the tension leading up to June 4, the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Recent developments, including self-immolations in the Tibetan capital, have only added to the pressure....1031 2012-05-29 Manvinder Singh Bisla batted his way to victory for the Kolkata Knight Riders....1032 2012-05-29 The Spurs approach talk of their streak with that same focus and discipline, claiming that even privately they refuse to attach any historical significance to it. For the record, they are two victories away from matching the 2001 and 1989 Los Angeles Lakers for the most victories in a row to open the postseason.“When we are asked, we remember that we are on a great streak, but we really don’t care.,” Ginobili said Monday after practice. “We are close, seven games away from accomplishing something way bigger than a streak. If it’s happening, fine. But we always think about the next game and how tough it’s going to be.”With their Game 1 victory, the Spurs became the fifth team in N.B.A. history to win at least 19 games in a row. San Antonio is tied with the 2000 Lakers for the fourth longest streak, and if the Spurs win Game 2 here Tuesday night, they will join the 1971 Milwaukee Bucks with 20 consecutive victories. The 1971-72 Lakers hold the record with 33 victories in a row, followed by the 2008 Houston Rockets with 22.Eschewing talk of the streak might be akin to baseball players not speaking to a pitcher in the midst of a no-hitter.“Nobody’s going to say anything in the seventh inning,” point guard Gary Neal said with a laugh. “Right now, we’re in the seventh inning. We got seven more outs.”But the Spurs silence cuts to the core and comes from the top, descending through the ranks from Popovich and Tim Duncan.“In the scheme of things, what’s a streak when you’ve won four championships?” Neal said. “Everything here is always put in perspective. The leaders of our team, starting with Coach Pop, Tim Duncan, Manu, Tony, they always do a great job of that, just keeping everything in perspective.”Popovich shuns talk of the streak with dismissive glares and clipped answers. In his 16th season as the Spurs’ coach, he has been here before. The 1999 team won 12 in a row en route to the first of the championships.But Popovich will talk of the difference between that team, which had center David Robinson as its star, and the franchise stability maintained through Duncan, providing a window of sorts into what drives these current Spurs.“I’m very fortunate in that I didn’t have to deal with a star ego. I dealt with grown-ups who have character and a prioritization already set in their lives and values,” Popovich said. “When Timmy came along, David understood his talent, and made it very easy to start to become the go-to guy. As Timmy got older, he understood the value of Manu and Tony, and was able to share that spotlight with them.“I never had a talk, never had a discussion, a meeting or anything with any of those guys about that. We just did it, and the process kind of morphed along. It was because of their character that we were able to do it.”1033 2012-05-29 Because standard clothing must be densely woven or dark colored to offer advanced UV protection, these specially treated clothes are “good if you want something long-sleeved that is also lightweight,” Dr. Lawrence said.But as sun-protective clothing has made its way into the mainstream, seemingly obvious features like sleeves have occasionally been sacrificed, defeating part of the purpose. Lesser offenses include shorts and sleeveless shirts, while items like bikinis — which claim to offer the maximum degree of sun protection — might be a bit of a stretch.Consumers seem understandably puzzled by these UV-protective wares, perhaps buying them with fingers crossed. “I have used this product occasionally for several years with the hope that it works,” said one reviewer on Amazon.com for Sun Guard, a laundry treatment that says it puts “an invisible shield into clothing that helps block more than 96 percent of the sun’s harmful rays from reaching your skin.” The reviewer added, “Preferring white shirts for outdoor activities, I trust that this dye is blocking UV radiation, but I can’t say for sure.”To some critics, introducing chemicals to a naturally sun-protective category like clothing seems wasteful. “Our recommendation is that you stick to clothes with tighter weave and that will provide adequate UPF protection,” said David Andrews, a senior researcher with the Environmental Working Group, which compiles an annual guide to sunscreens. “Not to mention there’s no need to do a full load of wash with all your undergarments and everything to make them UPF protected.”The Food and Drug Administration briefly regulated sun-protective clothes in the early 1990s, classifying them as medical devices. While it no longer does that, the Federal Trade Commission does monitor marketing claims about garments and sun protection. A measurement called UPF, or ultraviolet protection factor, is the standard for UV-protective clothing. Developed in 2001 by ASTM International, a product-testing agency, a UPF ranges from 1 to 50, with 50 being the most UV light that is blocked by a garment.The F.D.A. does continue to regulate claims made by traditional sunscreens, which will soon undergo the first significant changes in decades. Manufacturers will have to show that their products protect against both UVB rays, which cause burns, and UVA rays, which are linked to skin cancers. Gone will be labels of “waterproof” or “sweatproof,” and lotions will have to indicate how often they need to be reapplied. Originally slated to go into effect in June, the new labeling requirements have been delayed until December to give manufacturers time to comply.Other products that are not traditionally associated with sun protection seem to be marketed to imply that they can do more than they can deliver. Sun-related claims are now common among hair products, like TRESemmé’s “Climate Control” shampoo and conditioner, which both use ingredients like olive oil, keratin and a UV-blocking chemical called avobenzone to prevent frizz and drying. Outside of those benefits, the products offer no actual UV protection, according to the company.But keeping your hair bouncy and protecting your scalp from the sun are different things, dermatologists say. “The UV-protection for your hair will obviously not prevent skin cancer,” said Dr. D’Anne M. Kleinsmith, a dermatologist in West Bloomfield, Mich., “but it will prevent hair color from fading and protect the hair so that it does not become dry and brittle from the sun.”One risk to the proliferation of sun-protective marketing language (Pink Ladybug Water Shoes with UPF 50, anyone?) is that consumers may be lulled into a false sense of security, said Dr. Lawrence of Cooper University Medical Center. For example, cosmetics companies now sell foundation with SPF protection. Neutrogena’s Healthy Skin Compact Makeup SPF 55, to use one example, includes avobenzone, the same chemical found in TRESemmé’s “Climate Control” line.While these products may reflect UV rays, Dr. Lawrence said, rarely do women wear enough foundation for the protective properties to kick in. “You have to put sunscreen on pretty thick,” she said. So, to wear enough foundation as sunscreen, “you’d look like you had it caked on.” Better to apply an actual sunscreen, then foundation, she said.While no one tracks sales of sun-protective products across categories, the market for them is clearly growing, said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst with the NPD Group, a research company.“Coming out of the recession, consumers are looking at products with a greater level of scrutiny and greater expectations,” he said. “They want their products to do more than just one thing, not just to look good, but to travel well and to match their lifestyle and to protect them from the environment.”Also fueling demand are new technologies that allow chemicals to be added to thinner fabrics. Dr. Heidi Waldorf, a dermatologist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, recalls wearing earlier, less stylish UV-protective clothing.“I looked like I escaped from a nuclear site,” she said of the head-to-toe attire she wore on a bike trip through the Canadian Rockies 10 years ago. “But I never got burned.”1034 2012-05-29 After a three-year delay, the Justice Department has finally issued mandatory rape prevention policies for federal prisons and state correctional institutions that receive federal dollars. The new rules, which were given the force of an executive order, are a clear improvement over a draft version. If monitored and enforced, they could help curb the assaults that are shamefully endemic to the corrections system.The new rules coincide with the release of a frightening study from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics, which found that nearly 10 percent of former state prisoners said they had been sexually victimized during their most recent confinement. That is more than double the percentage found in a previous Bureau of Justice Statistics study released in 2010.The rules say that all facilities must adopt zero-tolerance policies. And they include detailed requirements for prisons to investigate and report all allegations of sexual attack and improve medical and mental health care for victims. They also require that each correctional facility’s rape prevention programs be reviewed once every three years by outside auditors certified by the Justice Department. And the rules bar correctional agencies from imposing a deadline for inmates to report an allegation. Victims are typically traumatized by an attack and may take days or even months to gather the courage to speak out.Unfortunately, the rules only discourage — but do not bar — the placement of youths in adult facilities, where they are at far greater risk of being sexually assaulted. Congress should end this practice once and for all. Until that happens, the new rules will better protect young people by requiring that they be housed separately from adults, prohibiting contact with adults in common areas and limiting the use of solitary confinement for young people, who are more vulnerable to suicide when left alone.A state whose governor does not fully comply with the rules could lose 5 percent of any Department of Justice grant funds for prisons. If humanity is not enough to get prison systems to change their policies, maybe that penalty will work. Rape must not be part of a prison sentence.1035 2012-05-29 Mr. Ferrantino recounted a breakfast for his clients shortly after the offering in which the biggest topic of discussion was what the Facebook deal had revealed and the sense that “the deck is stacked against them.”Perhaps the best indicator of the broader movement away from stocks is an annual survey done by the Investment Company Institute, which has shown that the percentage of American households invested in domestic stocks, including directly or through any other vehicle whether through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds, has fallen every year since the financial crisis to a low in 2011 of 46.4 percent, down from a high of 53 percent in 2001.Stocks remain favored by millions of Americans who invest big parts of their retirement savings in them, and investors who have held the course have benefited from the 29 percent rise in the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index since the beginning of 2009. This does not include the dividends that would have been earned.For decades, participation in the stock markets increased as 401(k) retirement plans grew in popularity and retail brokers created easier access for small traders. The Dow Jones industrial average rose an average of 8.4 percent each year from 1950 to 2000, with some extended periods of little to no growth.Since then, though, the bursting of the Internet bubble in 2001 followed by the financial crisis in 2008 have created a so-called lost decade in which broad stock indexes wound up not that far beyond where they started.Small investors are part of a bigger flight from American stocks. Institutional investors like high-frequency traders have been drawn to other assets like currencies, and pension funds have shifted more money into alternatives, like private equity investments. This has led to a steady decline in the volume of trading in the American stock market and a drop in revenue for New York financial firms. But it has also raised broader questions about the prospects of a market that has long been the central cog for American companies raising money to grow and create jobs.“If investors lose confidence then capital formation doesn’t function as well,” said David Weild, a former vice chairman of Nasdaq, and the founder of Capital Markets Advisory Partners.Among the ordinary investors who are helping drive this shift, the motivations are varied. Some are retiring and making a conservative move to less risky assets like bonds. Others are put off by the economic uncertainty as Europe fails to find solutions to its debt problems. But there has also been a growing din of complaints about the flaws in the structure of the markets — as displayed by the Facebook debut.Robert Diepersloot, a dairy farmer in Madera, Calif., said that watching the Facebook offering confirmed all the fears and suspicions that led him earlier this year to take out the savings, in the five figures, that he and his wife had invested in stocks and stock mutual funds and move it into real estate investments.“We just pulled out completely,” Mr. Diepersloot said. “We’ve lost trust in the whole scenario.”Mr. Diepersloot’s wife, Willemina, said that there was no one event that drove the family out of stocks, just a disappointment with recent returns and a slow erosion of faith in the reliability of the market.Finance industry professionals are wondering what might persuade Mr. Diepersloot and others like him to change their minds, given that the stock market’s rise over the last three years has not done the job. Many insiders say that may happen only if interest rates begin to rise, after years of falling, and drive down the value of bonds, which is where investors have shifted.Facebook’s stock offering appeared to be doing the job of drumming up interest before it went awry. At one discount broker, ShareBuilder, the number of new accounts opened was 20 times the average and trading activity was up about 50 percent on May 18 across all discount brokers, according to Richard Repetto, a Sandler O’Neill analyst who researches brokers.Fuad Ahmed, the chief executive of the discount broker Just2Trade, said that by the end of Friday about 80 percent of the customers who had bought Facebook dumped it.By Mr. Repetto’s analysis, trading activity at the retail brokers on the Monday after the I.P.O. was back where it had been before Facebook began trading.1036 2012-05-29 “She wouldn’t rent a movie and then just leave,” her mother said a few days later. “She’s a very predictable, conscientious person. For her to just leave without telling anyone is totally out of character.”Ms. Sylvia called the police. Investigators called Mr. Rodriguez, the landlord, who was cooperative over the telephone from his home in Orange County, N.Y., but as the days dragged on, he himself disappeared. His family refused to allow officers onto his property, so the police searched with helicopters. They found nothing.The landlord sold the building, and the police hurried inside with cadaver-sniffing dogs, tearing up the floor but finding nothing. Mr. Rodriguez was later arrested on tax fraud charges and pleaded guilty to larceny after admitting he had used a dead man’s identity to commit fraud. He served nearly six years in prison and was paroled in 2004.There would be grim discoveries, the familiar mile-markers of missing-persons cases. A severed foot was found in the Hudson River; the police searched, finding nothing more. Ms. Sylvia gave blood in hopes of a DNA match to the foot, but none came.No one was ever charged in the couple’s disappearance.Ms. Sylvia is 70 now, and was cheerful on Monday when a reporter’s call interrupted her window-washing chores. She now lives in Centerville, Mass.“I think about this every day, of course,” she said. “Every time anybody disappears, I go, ‘Oh, one more person.’ ”She followed the news when the Patz case re-emerged last month, as federal agents dug up a cellar floor. “When they were digging down there, I was like, ‘Oh, I wonder if they’ll ever find anything.’ ”She saw an outcome that she was very familiar with: nothing.But the arrest last week of Pedro Hernandez, who the police said confessed to killing Etan, gave her hope, particularly because of the manner in which he came to their attention: a tipster had called the authorities.“Other people must know something about Camden and Michael,” she said.” I hope somehow they’ll find some sort of evidence. I think somebody could speak. How do you get rid of two people?”She has not spoken to the police, who have always said the case remained open, in a long time. “This is what they usually say: ‘We’re working on it, and we’ve got boxes of evidence, we’re looking at it,’ ” she said.“The other side of the coin is, do you really want to know what someone did to your loved ones?” she said. “To hear the gruesome details might not be something you want to do.”The apartment building on Pearl Street looks about the same, just as Etan’s building does, not very far away.1037 2012-05-29 After the 1994 emergence of a deadly virus called Hendra in humans and horses in northeastern Australia, biologists found that it came from flying foxes. That led to widespread calls to cull bats or frighten them away from places where people lived.In 2008, however, Dr. Plowright made a crucial discovery. Stress appears to weaken the bats’ immune system, and that is when they are likely to shed the most virus.“It’s the idea that if you get rundown you get sick,” she said. “So trying to kill or move bats could make things worse by stressing them” and causing them to excrete more of the virus in their waste.The finding has quieted calls for large-scale bat removal, and Australia has committed several million dollars to a three-year project to understand viral ecology in bats.The interconnections between human and animal diseases have led to new efforts to understand these mechanisms, including the One Health Initiative, a program that unites medical and veterinary scientists in interdisciplinary approaches to disease and environmental degradation.Wild-animal immunity also provides a near-pristine system to study. “The wild is a null system, a system without interference,” said Peter J. Hudson, a biologist at Penn State and a founder of the infectious disease center there.“Research on wild systems,” he continued, “will help us answer the question of ‘Should we interfere, and how does interference affect the ecology and evolution of these bugs? Will the application of vaccines and antibiotics create more health problems?’ ”Some researchers believe, for example, that the rise in autoimmune disorders may be caused by a lack of stimulation of human immune systems by certain microbes. And while that idea would be hard to evaluate in human studies because our immune systems have been altered for decades with antibiotics and more sterile environments, Dr. Hudson said that “wildlife systems can give us that insight.”Much about the diseases that originate in wildlife is a mystery. In the case of bat viruses, experts believe they evolved for millions of years in intact bat ecosystems, with the animals passing it to one another over and over, causing low-grade infections and building their immune defenses.Jonathan H. Epstein, a veterinarian and a disease ecologist with EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit group in New York, has used experimental infections to understand Nipah virus, which is closely related to Hendra.“These bats don’t even break a sweat when they are raging with Nipah virus,” he said. “So they are really good at spreading it. But a naïve immune system” — like those of humans and horses with respect to Hendra — “goes crazy.”The new work on wild immune systems casts disease in a new light: as an environmental issue. One ecological driver of bat virus transmission is development in the flying foxes’ natural habitat. Instead of living in a wild forest, the bats swoop into the cities and suburbs that replaced it, feeding on nectar in gardens and trees and then passing viruses along to horses and humans.A common thread, disease ecologists say, is that clearing or altering a forest can be akin to opening a Pandora’s box. Keeping nature intact, or developing it in sustainable ways, protects against disease.“If you conserve an ecosystem you have a jolly good chance of conserving human health as well,” said Simon Anthony, a molecular virologist with EcoHealth who is studying the ecology of Nipah and other viruses.Richard S. Ostfeld, a disease ecologist at the Cary Institute for Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y., has been studying the causes of Lyme disease, which causes fatigue, achy joints, fever and chills and has been linked to neurological and heart disease.White-footed mice are a reservoir for the bacteria that creates Lyme, and Dr. Ostfeld says one reason they are so successful at it is that they reproduce very rapidly when the woods are developed and their predators disappear.“The fast dudes like mice are incredibly resilient in the face of human disturbance,” he said. And because they live only six months, they may put their energy into breeding at the expense of immune defense, and so magnify the prevalence of Lyme.Diseases might even be spread by things that are otherwise good for the environment. The notion of connecting fragmented habitats so wildlife have access to critical habitat has been gaining ground. But disease ecologists say it may also spread disease.Bighorn sheep, for example, are moved around the West by wildlife agencies to build populations — but with little thought to pneumonia, Dr. Plowright said.“When we alter the environment abruptly,” Dr. Plowright said, “we radically change the balance between diseases and the immune system, which can affect the entire web of life, including humans. We are just beginning to understand this.”1038 2012-05-29 To see how hard it is to judge choreography in musicals, you need only watch all four of this year’s Tony nominees. What criteria are involved? In ballet and modern dance, choreography is the shaping factor, the ingredient that brings music, subject matter and performance together into a whole; in a musical, that’s seldom so. But the great choreographers are great directors too: inventors of their own genres of theater.Paradoxically, some of the most eminent choreographers — from George Balanchine to Matthew Bourne — have also been happy to work with directors in musicals, and have learned new skills by doing so. Jerome Robbins is the most famous of those who worked on Broadway as a director-choreographer. There is no single method for choreography to succeed in a musical: It may be a source of isolated highlights or a unifying thread.Don’t many people go to musicals principally for their high energy? In that respect, none of the current crop deliver as well as the choreographer Christopher Gattelli does in “Newsies.” Energy is crucial to the story; the dances keep bursting with the explosive jumps performed by a large ensemble.Others look primarily for a certain inventive wit. Only in Kathleen Marshall’s dances for the Gershwin musical “Nice Work if You Can Get It” is wit even sporadically evident this year. The way a line of women pass Matthew Broderick along like a parcel is just one image that raises a smile; there are a few others.It’s also natural to look for stylistic originality. Here the prize surely goes to Steven Hoggett for “Once,” even though this production has less choreography than any other of this year’s Tony nominees. And the originality of Mr. Hoggett’s contribution lies not in his dances, but in the way group gestures occasionally take the show into an enlarged, surreal dimension. Really, the story of “Once” ought to appear corny: It’s the old “Will this provincial boy with a dream make it to the big lights of New York?” But the emphasis on the realities and impact of making music renders “Once” the freshest show of the group.A more potent aspect of choreography , though, can beam forth when dance and movement are indivisible from direction, and where they seem constantly to give a show further dimension. I find most of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s music and Tim Rice’s lyrics for “Evita” banal (why does Evita think Argentina might cry for her, anyway?). Yet Rob Ashford’s dances and the physical aspects of Michael Grandage’s direction make the whole show suspenseful, fleshing out aspects of society and politics beyond the words and music.1039 2012-05-29 Falling behind, 0-5, in the second set might have made a major upset just about inevitable, even though the 32-year-old Brianti, ranked 105th, had shown no previous inclinations to create shock waves at major tournaments. But Azarenka, still tempestuous but no longer overwrought when confronted with her own tennis imperfections, proceeded to rear back and, suspect right shoulder and all, smack an ace on the line with her second serve.If the ball had bounced another inch or so to the left, she might have been booking a flight to Minsk or Monte Carlo instead of her next practice court in Paris. But she held serve and proceeded to win six straight games to even the match at one set apiece and ultimately prevail, 6-7 (6), 6-4, 6-2, despite making an unsightly 60 unforced errors and struggling to generate her customary speed and rhythm with her serve.“Sometimes, I felt it was not my day,” said Azarenka, who said the shoulder problem, which caused her to retire from her last tournament in Rome, was much improved. “Sometimes I thought: ‘Yeah, maybe I still fight. I still have a chance.’ Sometimes it was like: ‘You know what? Forget it. I don’t want to do it.’ But the important thing in that really miserable, if you can say, moment, is I stay strong, and I just went for my shots. I just went for what I had to do, and I didn’t do before.“That shows a little bit of not losing courage, I guess.”The French Open has become a home tournament of sorts for Azarenka. She is based in French-speaking Monaco after leaving her former training base in Arizona. She began working with the French coach Sam Sumyk in 2010, and her physical therapist Jean-Pierre Bruyère, her sparring partner Julien Jeanpierre and her new star recruit, Mauresmo, also are French. All this explains Azarenka’s crash course in the language, even if most members of the team have a global outlook and, in most cases, home addresses outside France.“That’s why we are smiling when we see or hear or read about the French connection,” Sumyk said. “Of course we are French, but we feel like citizens of the world a little bit. It’s weird to say that, but we feel like, I don’t know, this is not really a French team.”Sumyk, a modest club player in his youth in Brittany, left for Florida in his 20s and eventually began coaching Meilen Tu, the former tour player from the United States who is now his wife and Azarenka’s agent. He and Tu live in Calabasas, Calif., north of Los Angeles. Bruyère lives outside London. Mauresmo, like many present and former French tennis stars, resides officially in Switzerland.But Monte Carlo is now the hub in the spinning wheel of Azarenka’s peripatetic life. She and her team gather there or, more often than not, elsewhere. They spent Christmas in Dubai with her boyfriend, the tennis player Sergei Bubka Jr., and his father Sergei Bubka, the former world-champion pole-vaulter from Ukraine.“This lifestyle is really difficult, but it’s also really interesting,” Azarenka said in an interview Monday. “I don’t know on the part of being a coach, but as a player you can only appreciate those people who travel with you so much and they just kind of dedicate their life to you. So that’s really something that you cannot say thank you with words.”Sumyk, tan and tattooed, has also coached the tour players Elena Likhovtseva, Gisela Dulko, Ann Kremer and Vera Zvonareva. He was between jobs and spending a rare Christmas with his French family when Azarenka, who knew him through his wife, Meilen Tu, called and asked him to be her coach.Two and a half years into their professional relationship, Sumyk still has no formal contract with Azarenka, which they say suits them both.“I’m a very honest person,” Azarenka said. “We never have a problem with that. We have complete trust, which is perfect. We don’t need that. We are fair with each other. A lot of coaches sometimes wouldn’t say something that you are doing wrong just because they are afraid to lose their job. Sam will tell me right away. He’s not afraid to lose his job. He said, ‘Well I’m always going to be honest with you.’ And I appreciate that.”It has not been a trouble-free rise to the top. Azarenka dropped from No. 7 at the end of 2009 to No. 10 at the end of 2010. An intense personality with a perfectionist streak, Azarenka considered quitting the sport early in 2011, only to find renewed inspiration from her grandmother in Minsk, who urged her to press on and emphasize the positive. But her climb has been steady and convincing since then. Her fiery on-court behavior still resurfaces, — she dropped a racket and shrieked in dismay on Monday — but Azarenka credits Sumyk for helping her manage it better.“I don’t think he made me do it,” she said. “I feel he was guiding me, which is the smartest way, because when you push somebody to do something they don’t know or they have never experienced, they kind of put a block on it and reject it. It’s like a parents-kid relationship.”Sumyk was also open and confident enough to agree to add Mauresmo as a consultant in April after Azarenka had already won her first Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open this year and risen to No. 1. The idea was to avoid complacency and to bring on board a former champion who knew how to navigate the game’s biggest tournaments.“She was the same as me,” Azarenka said of Mauresmo’s approach to her career. “We built a team around us, and we are working toward the same goal. There might be better coaches, there might be better fitness trainers, there might be better physios in the world. But for me, it’s important to have people who really have my back and who really care about me and who really want to succeed with me.”It is interesting that Mauresmo’s first Grand Slam tournament with Azarenka is the French Open, a tournament Mauresmo never came close to winning — despite her clay-court prowess — because of the weight of expectations, both her own and the French public’s.Azarenka’s edgy, erratic performance Monday must have looked uncomfortably familiar to Mauresmo, who was sitting next to Sumyk in the players’ box, folding and unfolding her arms as the errors and shrieks piled up.“To be honest, I think it’s a new situation for her,” Mauresmo said on the British network ITV. “It’s the first time she is playing a Grand Slam tournament as the No. 1 player in the world. She was maybe not expecting this emotion to get to her, but it got to her today. So now I think my role and Sam’s role is to make sure it doesn’t happen again. Or at least if it happens that she react a little quicker than she did today.”It all worked out in the end this time, though, unless of course you were a Brianti fan, and now Azarenka can keep working on her French. A victory speech “en français” does not seem likely, however, unless she starts playing much better tennis.1040 2012-05-29 Xinhua identified the two protesters on Sunday as Dargye, from Aba County, the Chinese name for Ngaba, and Tobgye Tseten, from Xiahe County, or Labrang in Tibetan, the seat of the famous Labrang Monastery and a center of protests against Chinese rule.Both counties are in the region of eastern Tibet that is traditionally known as Amdo and where the worlds of the ethnic Tibetans and ethnic Hans have overlapped. The Han rule China, and many Tibetans resent Beijing’s policies in Tibet and the Han who migrate into Tibetan regions for work and business opportunities.Tobgye Tseten died in the fire he set, Xinhua said, but Dargye survived. He was seriously injured, the news agency said, but was in stable condition and able to talk.Harriet Beaumont, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Free Tibet, identified the man who died as Dorjee Tseten, 19, from Bhora in Labrang County. She said the two men shouted three times outside the temple before setting themselves on fire, but it was not immediately clear what they said. Afterward, she said, security officers began detaining Tibetans, especially those from Ngaba County.A man who answered the telephone at the Yarlung Tsangpo Hotel in Lhasa said security in the city had been tightened and additional security forces sent in. The man, who gave his name as Mr. Liu, said it was unclear whether the new forces were made up of regular police officers or were units of the People’s Armed Police, a paramilitary force that is usually called out to quell riots and maintain security in the restive ethnic regions of western China.Robert J. Barnett, a scholar of modern Tibet at Columbia University, said a Tibetan in Lhasa had told him the city was in a “boiling situation” after the self-immolations.“We’re now seeing self-immolations that seem to be political expressions that are in sympathy with the core incidents that happened earlier,” Mr. Barnett said.“The Chinese officials are really worried,” he said, because the latest protests seem to be “driven by an idea, a political goal.”By contrast, he said, the earlier self-immolations in Ngaba were largely in reaction to security clampdowns at the Kirti Monastery after the 2008 uprising.Ngaba has been the center of the self-immolations, but Tibetans have now set themselves on fire in areas across the vast Tibetan plateau. Most have been members of the clergy. Before the self-immolations in Lhasa, there had been just one such protest in the Tibet Autonomous Region, by a layman in the eastern area known as Chamdo.The self-immolations on Sunday were first reported by Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, which have contact with Tibetans in western China. Voice of America reported that the two men worked at a restaurant in Lhasa called Nyima Ling. Radio Free Asia said the two were monks who were taken away in security vehicles within 15 minutes of setting themselves on fire.In March, President Hu Jintao of China told the Tibet delegates to the National People’s Congress in Beijing that they must exert a “continuous effort in sustaining social harmony and stability.” Official news reports say Chen Quanguo, the current party chief of Tibet, repeated Mr. Hu’s words in public meetings and said officials would “persist in the thought that stability overrides all.”1041 2012-05-29 Dr. Shipman was careful to make these distinctions in her essay in American Scientist, and in an interview.First, she said, we know that modern humans and Neanderthals occupied at the same time, from about 45,000 to 25,000 years ago, and that the humans’ fortunes rose as the Neanderthals’ fell. Somehow modern humans outcompeted Neanderthals. And here we are now, with our computers, our research and our beloved dogs, which, scientists agree, evolved from wolves.Second, and this point is crucial, Dr. Shipman thinks dogs were very probably around during this time, although she recognizes that others disagree. She tells us about the research that convinced her: a 2009 report of three skulls, the oldest dating to 32,000 years ago, by Mietje Germonpré of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in The Journal of Archaeological Science.The skulls are clearly from canids, but those include wolves, jackals and foxes. Dr. Germonpré and her colleagues concluded the skulls belonged to dogs. That’s where things get sticky.The rest of Dr. Shipman’s essay is clear enough. If the humans had dogs, the dogs must have been helping somehow, in hunting or pulling travois. And they may have been so helpful that they gave modern humans an edge. If they helped in hunting, they might have watched human eyes for clues about what was going on, as they do now. Other researchers have suggested that the white of the human eye evolved to foster cooperation because we could more easily see where others were looking.If dogs were watching us too, that would have added survival value to having a partly white eye and thus played a role in our evolution. Fair enough, but the dogs had to be there at that time when humans and Neanderthals overlapped. I asked Dr. Larson about Dr. Shipman’s essay, and I confess I expected he might object to its speculative nature. Not so. “I love speculation,” he wrote back. “I do it all the time.” And, he said of Dr. Shipman’s essay, “it’s a lovely chain of reasoning.”But, he said, “it begins from the premise that the late Pleistocene canid remains are dogs. And they are not.”He wrote, “There is not a single piece of (credible) evidence to suggest that the domestication process was under way 30,000 years ago.” He cited an article in press in The Journal of Archaeological Science that is highly critical of the Germonpré paper. The article, by Susan J. Crockford at the University of Victoria and Yaroslav V. Kuzmin at the Siberian branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, suggests the skulls in question came from short-faced wolves and do not indicate domestication. Dr. Crockford, who had read Dr. Shipman’s paper, thought it “too speculative for science.” But she did not view the case of early domestication as closed.She said in an e-mail: “We simply need more work on these ancient wolves before we can determine if these canids are incipient dogs (in the process of becoming dogs, although not there yet) or if they simply reflect the normal variation in ancient wolves. At present, I am leaning strongly toward the latter.”Perhaps the way to judge the scientific value of speculation would be to see if it prompts more research, more collecting of fossils, more study. Until then, only proximate answers will exist to the question of where dogs came from.Mine came from a shelter. How about yours?1042 2012-05-29 The commercials for the Dirty Jobs line are being created internally at My Dirty Jobs. The Web ads are being handled by Ignite Media Solutions and the public relations duties by Trent & Company.The co-founders of My Dirty Jobs — Adam Lerner, president, and Christian Darby, executive vice president for product marketing — have experience in the realm of direct response sales for companies like Ronco.“Direct response is about advertising the brand and building awareness,” Mr. Lerner said, “and there’s the benefit of selling some product directly to consumers.”“We plan to touch the customer in every way the customer can be reached,” he added, citing examples like Facebook, where Walmart has 15.9 million likes and “Dirty Jobs” with Mr. Rowe has more than 2.2 million.Mr. Rowe said endorsing a line of cleaning products named after his series “wasn’t something I was affirmatively considering” before being approached by the executives behind My Dirty Jobs.Although “my honest feeling is that I don’t know how much permission I have to do this” from consumers, Mr. Rowe said, “somewhere in this weird nexus of social media, brand ubiquity and five minutes of fame, people are still looking for something that feels authentic.”From that came a concept for the Dirty Jobs products that “dirt is not the enemy,” Mr. Rowe said, but rather that “dirt is good.”That sentiment is expressed in the videos that play at the checkouts in Walmart stores, in which Mr. Rowe jokes about how “I can finally say I’ve gotten filthy in all 50 states.”Mr. Rowe extols the Dirty Jobs products as “not just for people who get dirty, but for people who have to clean up after the people who get dirty.”In a commercial with Ms. Nash, she refers to “Mr. ‘Dirty Jobs’ himself, Mike Rowe” in praising the Dirty Jobs stain remover.Ms. Nash said Dirty Jobs represents her first product endorsement. Before agreeing, “I had to really give it the smell test and use it,” she added, laughing, “and by that I mean force my children.”Ms. Nash called her endorsement “a good fit” because “I am a mom, I am hands-on.”As for whether she is interested in additional endorsements, Ms. Nash said it would depend on the product. After a reporter listed the other brands endorsed by Mr. Rowe like Ford, Lee and Caterpillar, she said: “I can drive. I can wear jeans. You lost me at the tractor.” The decision by Discovery Communications to license the “Dirty Jobs” name for the cleaning products is the first such license in that category, said Elizabeth Bakacs, vice president for licensing at Discovery Communications in Silver Spring, Md.It was important that Mr. Rowe be involved, she added, because “the best successes” in licensing “come when we partner with our talent.” She offered as an example “a ‘Cake Boss’ line of products with Buddy Valastro,” the dessert king in the series on the company’s TLC channel.The deal with My Dirty Jobs is multiyear, Ms. Bakacs said, and “a traditional licensing agreement, licensing our mark.” She declined to discuss additional terms, as did Mr. Rowe.Mr. Rowe said there was some initial discussion that the cleaning products would be sold under his name rather than the “Dirty Jobs” name. That did not proceed far because “part of me wanted to be a good scout and not do a big end-run” around Discovery, he said.“I don’t want to be that guy,” he added.Also, Mr. Rowe said, there is a value to the “Dirty Jobs” name. For one thing, “Discovery has probably spent $100 million in advertising and marketing support for the show,” he added, which should help generate awareness for the Dirty Jobs line.Indeed, he said, people have told him, they feel as if the products have “been on the shelf for 20 years.”1043 2012-05-29 GEISSLER--Stephen, 59, died on May 14th as the result of an auto accident.

Corona, was removed from office on Tuesday in a landmark conviction that could strengthen the president’s hand in cracking down on the endemic corruption that has long been a drag on the economy.Mr. Corona lost his job after it was disclosed in his impeachment trial that he had failed to declare $2.4 million in foreign currency deposits. Supporters of President Benigno S. Aquino III have said the chief justice needed to be removed because they feared he would be an obstacle to investigations of past corruption, especially those related to Mr. Corona’s patron, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.The prosecution of Mrs. Arroyo and her allies has been central to Mr. Aquino’s anticorruption campaign and comes as the economy is improving and the nation is attracting more foreign investment.This was the first time that a high-level Philippine official had been removed from office after impeachment and conviction. Officials here are often removed through street protests.The case has been politically delicate from the start and is tied up with a feud between the Aquinos and Mrs. Arroyo, who is a member of the House of Representatives but did not support the impeachment. Mr. Corona was Mrs. Arroyo’s chief of staff before she appointed him to the Supreme Court in 2002. She named him chief justice just days after Mr. Aquino won the presidency. Mr. Aquino and his supporters argue the move was meant to squelch efforts to build corruption cases against Mrs. Arroyo and those in her administration.“Our people followed this trial closely, and in this exercise we have demonstrated to them, and to the international community, that our country adheres and subscribes to the democratic framework,” said Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada, whose father, President Joseph Estrada, was forced out of office by popular protests after a failed impeachment trial on corruption charges.1046 2012-05-29 The musical theater actress Lindsay Mendez has landed one of the plum roles of this summer's Off Broadway season: Rose, a seemingly awkward waitress who proves to be more than meets the eye in ''Dogfight,'' a new musical adaptation of the 1991 ind...1047 2012-05-29 Gov.

Four federal courts have now declared the so-called Defense of Marriage Act indefensible under the Constitution, as the Justice Department did.The Supreme Court got interracial marriage wrong before it got it right in the best-named case ever, Loving v. Virginia (1967), and we do not know which case, if any, will get to the court when, or who the justices will be when one does.What we do know is what will maximize our chances of victory when we get there: Win more states — including measures on the ballot this November in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington — and continue winning over more support, growing and diversifying the national majority now confirmed in more than a dozen polls.That road map to victory, rather than speculation about Justice Anthony M. Kennedy or hand-wringing over timing, is the best way to help Freedom to Marry get the country on the right side of history and secure the freedom to marry for all loving and committed couples.The writer is founder and president of Freedom to Marry, the campaign to win marriage for same-sex couples nationwide.1049 2012-05-29 Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi may meet with Abhisit Vejjajiva, the former Thai prime minister. She may also visit an area outside Bangkok that is home to thousands of migrant workers from Myanmar. Or not.No one was available to confirm her schedule. The cellphone of U Nyan Win, the spokesman for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, was “power off” on Tuesday, according to an automated message.It is not uncommon for dignitaries to withhold information about their travel schedules from the public for security reasons. It is unusual, however, for a visiting dignitary not to contact the government of the country he or she is visiting.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s trip to Thailand appears to have been organized by U Khin Tha Myint, who is described as her head of security. He spent the past four days setting up meetings and events, according to Andy Hall, a researcher who helped organize the meeting with migrant workers. Mr. Khin Tha Myint could not be reached by telephone on Tuesday.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s style might be described as spontaneous.In the year and a half since her release from house arrest, those who have had dealings with her have generally been forgiving of the quirks of her operation: her staff is hard to reach and e-mails often go unanswered.Less forgiving was U Thein Sein, the president of Myanmar. He was scheduled to visit Thailand this week, but he canceled the trip soon after news reports appeared saying that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi would go.Mr. Thein Sein, who has led the changes in Myanmar since coming to power last year, had been confirmed to speak this week at a conference sponsored by the World Economic Forum, the same group that puts on the annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. Organizers of the forum announced last week that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi would also attend, and released a schedule giving her top billing, including a question-and-answer session titled “One-on-One Conversation With a Leader.”Fon Mathuros, a spokeswoman for the World Economic Forum, said Mr. Thein Sein canceled his appearance with “no further explanation.”U Nay Zin Latt, an adviser to Mr. Thein Sein, said the president could not make time to go.“He is extremely busy with his work, and taking great care of transitioning and transformation,” Mr. Nay Zin Latt said in an e-mail. Thai officials said the president’s visit had been rescheduled for next week.A meeting in August between Mr. Thein Sein and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi helped start the reforms now under way in Myanmar. In the months after that meeting, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi announced that she and her political party, the National League for Democracy, would rejoin the political system. In April, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi won a seat in Parliament.Among the crowd waiting at the Bangkok airport to catch a glimpse of her on Tuesday was a 24-year-old factory worker from Myanmar, Zin Oo Maung, who stitches jeans for 300 baht ($10) a day at a factory on the outskirts of the city. He turned down some overtime work so that he could greet Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi.“She is hope,” he said. “We hope our country’s economy gets better and we’ll be able to return.”Though she spent much of the time since 1988 under house arrest, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi could have left Myanmar, but probably would not have been able to return. She stayed, believing that her absence would have made it easier for the military to crush the democracy movement. Her willingness to travel abroad now is a vote of confidence in Myanmar’s moves toward democracy.Next month, she is scheduled to visit four European nations: Britain, where she will address the two houses of Parliament; Norway, where she will belatedly accept her 1991 Nobel Peace Prize; Switzerland, where she will deliver a speech to the International Labor Organization; and Ireland, where she will meet one of her keenest supporters, Bono, the lead singer of the rock band U2.1050 2012-05-29 IF learning how to cook is easy enough for a child to do (and it is), the continuing-education portion of it lasts a lifetime. I remember the first time I roasted a pepper, 44 years ago. It was a revelation. And I remember when I thought I had it down pat, 15 years ago, around the time I wrote my first Minimalist column.I didn’t have it mastered, of course. And the other day I was reminded just how fantastic good peppers are when roasted nicely, and just how easy they are. If, that is, you have a good fire going. Because roasted peppers are at their best when they’re charred peppers, and they’re best charred over wood, or at least real charcoal.They’re also at their best when they’re the right peppers. (We’re talking about sweet peppers here, not chiles, which are a whole other story.) Of this I was reminded about a week ago, when I had lunch at De la Riva, a fine Madrid restaurant with traditional daily menus, the kind of place where a gentleman (see the photo on its Web site) brings a variety of appetizers and then asks if you’d rather have meat, fish or both.On the day I visited with some friends, among those appetizers was a plate of gorgeous long, bright-red peppers, perfectly roasted and peeled, sprinkled with salt and drizzled with oil. They looked the way they should, with a few stubborn bits of blackened skin still clinging to the flesh.Two days later, wandering through the markets of a small town in Greece, I came across those same kinds of peppers, in both red and green. Their name doesn’t matter much: what matters is that they’re long, tapered and fairly regular, without a lot of wrinkles and twists. And what matters is that they’re not bell peppers, which are usually not only weaker in flavor but also more difficult to peel.I’m not a lifelong fan of green peppers, which are the unripe specimens of whatever color they’ll eventually become, but in recent years I’ve come to appreciate them as not inferior but different. I bought about a dozen of each.1051 2012-05-29 Babies delivered by Caesarean section may have an increased risk of obesity by age 3, a new study has found.

The products began appearing in rooms in 2007, and today include a shower gel available only there. Mr. James recommends that hotels prize “scarcity of the brand” when sourcing toiletries.Thanks to partnerships with the Mandarin Oriental and JW Marriott, Aromatherapy Associates, a London-based beauty company founded by Geraldine Howard in 1985, is a lot less scarce. Originally, the line was focused on overall well being, but Ms. Howard has worked with JW Marriott on a custom in-room line that includes lavender, rosemary and almond oil, which she believes enhances relaxation.“People lead such busy lives now,” said Ms. Howard, whose frequent-flier schedule includes shuttling between the company’s satellite offices in Hong Kong and Frisco, Tex. “Aromatherapy products are popular because they work psychologically.”Drew Dasent and Daniel Peddle, who together cast runway shows for Givenchy and Phillip Lim and chart more than 150,000 air miles each year, prefer hotels with organic skin care products. Mr. Dasent likes the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., because it uses Tammy Fender products, and Mr. Peddle is thrilled that the Chewton Glen in Hampshire, England, carries his favorite, REN.Some in the hospitality industry, like Soho House, have decided to go further than offering exclusive products by starting an in-house beauty line, which then can be sold elsewhere. Soho’s Cowshed, named for the old cattle quarters at the company’s Babington House location where spa treatments were first performed, has stand-alone spas and distributes to department stores like Harrods. Christina Russillo, the director of Cowshed, said there are plans for expansion, including a separate spa and cafe in New York City this year.Ms. Russillo said that Cowshed began partly to differentiate the Soho House (many hotels in the same category use the popular Molton Brown amenities) and partly for quality control. Many hotel lotions are made by different manufacturers, for quantity and distribution reasons, than the same brand you might find at a beauty counter.“Yes, quality is an issue,” Mr. James said. “Formulas often have to be changed because of the stability of the ingredients and cost. When we first started, we had a lot of ancillary products and that is where you have to make compromises.”Mr. James said this is why he now sticks to the basics: shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and hand soap. “It’s a decision the hotels make, if they want to water down the product,” he said. “If you’re talking about the $100 face cream, then yes, there are probably changes to the formula.”Still, because “travel is a massive marketing opportunity for beauty brands,” as Ms. Russillo said, some entrepreneurs are going beyond suds and lotions.In March 2011, Uslu Airlines, a cosmetics company that was founded in 2003, introduced a nail polish collaboration with Hôtel Costes in Paris. That was followed by another custom nail color for Ace Hotel’s New York location this February. The colors derive from corporate brand identity: oxblood red for the house hue at Costes and a greenish gunmetal gray to match the painted walls at Ace.Each polish is available through the hotel store or in-room minibar for $19 at Ace, 19 euros at Hôtel Costes.Next on the horizon: lipstick. Uslu is working on a tube for Costes, while Virgin Atlantic airlines recently introduced Upper Class Red, a cherry lip color collaboration with bareMinerals cosmetics sold at Virgin’s airport spas.Jan Mihm, a founder of Uslu, believes such products convey subtle but lasting messages. “You can, by wearing the Ace nail polish, even a year after you’ve been to New York City, say that you have actually been there,” he said. “It’s a more discreet, insider way of wearing the ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirt.”1053 2012-05-29 ISTANBUL — Calling abortion an act of murder and an insidious plan to reduce the Turkish population, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan called on Tuesday for legislation to restrict women’s access to the procedure.Since 1983, abortion has been legal in Turkey for up to 10 weeks after conception, with emergency abortions allowed for medical reasons after that. Mr. Erdogan proposed outlawing all abortions that are not medically necessary, and limiting medically necessary abortions to the first eight weeks after conception, according to NTV, a private television news network.“There is no difference in killing the fetus in a mother’s womb or killing a person after birth,” Mr. Erdogan said Tuesday, echoing comments he made Friday at the opening of a hospital in Istanbul and on Saturday to a group of female politicians in Ankara, the capital.The prime minister also called for limits on Caesarean births, saying they were “nothing more than a procedure to restrict and square a nation’s population” because, he said, women who give birth that way generally cannot have more than one more child.His remarks, which rekindled concerns about the intentions of the Islamic-rooted government, prompted reactions from various rights groups, including the Female Party Initiative, which organized a protest in Istanbul on Monday.1054 2012-05-29 Dewey & LeBoeuf, the law firm crippled by financial miscues and partner defections, filed for bankruptcy on Monday night, punctuating the largest law firm collapse in United States history.

Mr. Erdogan proposed outlawing all abortions that are not medically necessary, and limiting medically necessary abortions to the first eight weeks after conception, according to NTV, a private television news network.“There is no difference in killing the fetus in a mother’s womb or killing a person after birth,” Mr. Erdogan said Tuesday, echoing comments he made Friday at the opening of a hospital in Istanbul and on Saturday to a group of female politicians in Ankara, the capital.The prime minister also called for limits on Caesarean births, saying they were “nothing more than a procedure to restrict and square a nation’s population” because, he said, women who give birth that way generally cannot have more than one more child.His remarks, which rekindled concerns about the intentions of the Islamic-rooted government, prompted reactions from various rights groups, including the Female Party Initiative, which organized a protest in Istanbul on Monday.1076 2012-05-30 The commercials for the Dirty Jobs line are being created internally at My Dirty Jobs. The Web ads are being handled by Ignite Media Solutions and the public relations duties by Trent & Company.The co-founders of My Dirty Jobs — Adam Lerner, president, and Christian Darby, executive vice president for product marketing — have experience in the realm of direct response sales for companies like Ronco.“Direct response is about advertising the brand and building awareness,” Mr. Lerner said, “and there’s the benefit of selling some product directly to consumers.”“We plan to touch the customer in every way the customer can be reached,” he added, citing examples like Facebook, where Walmart has 15.9 million likes and “Dirty Jobs” with Mr. Rowe has more than 2.2 million.Mr. Rowe said endorsing a line of cleaning products named after his series “wasn’t something I was affirmatively considering” before being approached by the executives behind My Dirty Jobs.Although “my honest feeling is that I don’t know how much permission I have to do this” from consumers, Mr. Rowe said, “somewhere in this weird nexus of social media, brand ubiquity and five minutes of fame, people are still looking for something that feels authentic.”From that came a concept for the Dirty Jobs products that “dirt is not the enemy,” Mr. Rowe said, but rather that “dirt is good.”That sentiment is expressed in the videos that play at the checkouts in Walmart stores, in which Mr. Rowe jokes about how “I can finally say I’ve gotten filthy in all 50 states.”Mr. Rowe extols the Dirty Jobs products as “not just for people who get dirty, but for people who have to clean up after the people who get dirty.”In a commercial with Ms. Nash, she refers to “Mr. ‘Dirty Jobs’ himself, Mike Rowe” in praising the Dirty Jobs stain remover.Ms. Nash said Dirty Jobs represents her first product endorsement. Before agreeing, “I had to really give it the smell test and use it,” she added, laughing, “and by that I mean force my children.”Ms. Nash called her endorsement “a good fit” because “I am a mom, I am hands-on.”As for whether she is interested in additional endorsements, Ms. Nash said it would depend on the product. After a reporter listed the other brands endorsed by Mr. Rowe like Ford, Lee and Caterpillar, she said: “I can drive. I can wear jeans. You lost me at the tractor.” The decision by Discovery Communications to license the “Dirty Jobs” name for the cleaning products is the first such license in that category, said Elizabeth Bakacs, vice president for licensing at Discovery Communications in Silver Spring, Md.It was important that Mr. Rowe be involved, she added, because “the best successes” in licensing “come when we partner with our talent.” She offered as an example “a ‘Cake Boss’ line of products with Buddy Valastro,” the dessert king in the series on the company’s TLC channel.The deal with My Dirty Jobs is multiyear, Ms. Bakacs said, and “a traditional licensing agreement, licensing our mark.” She declined to discuss additional terms, as did Mr. Rowe.Mr. Rowe said there was some initial discussion that the cleaning products would be sold under his name rather than the “Dirty Jobs” name. That did not proceed far because “part of me wanted to be a good scout and not do a big end-run” around Discovery, he said.“I don’t want to be that guy,” he added.Also, Mr. Rowe said, there is a value to the “Dirty Jobs” name. For one thing, “Discovery has probably spent $100 million in advertising and marketing support for the show,” he added, which should help generate awareness for the Dirty Jobs line.Indeed, he said, people have told him, they feel as if the products have “been on the shelf for 20 years.”1077 2012-05-30 Gov. Lincoln Chafee appointed a commission on Tuesday to oversee the finances of Woonsocket. Officials in the struggling city, whose schools face a $10 million budget deficit, requested the commission this weekend, after a supplemental tax increase failed to pass. This is the third time Rhode Island has taken over the finances of a municipality; East Providence and Central Falls have fiscal overseers.1078 2012-05-30 A federal lawsuit filed against the N.F.L. Players Association by retirees was dismissed Tuesday by Judge Susan Richard Nelson, who said she was “empathetic to their concerns” but ruled they had no legal right to hundreds of millions of dollars in additional postcareer benefits they claimed they lost during lockout talks last year. The retirees’ lead lawyer said the group planned to appeal.Carl Eller, a Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive end, was the lead plaintiff in the complaint, which argued that current players and their lawyers had no right to bargain with N.F.L. owners about retiree benefits because they were not legally a union last summer; the union had decertified during the lockout.¶ HBO said the Miami Dolphins would appear on its “Hard Knocks” series this summer. The series, which documents N.F.L. training camps, will have episodes on five Tuesdays beginning Aug. 7. This season is the 40th anniversary of the Dolphins’ undefeated championship squad.1079 2012-05-30 Re “A Brief for Justice Kennedy,” by Bill Keller (column, May 28):The challenge to state marriage discrimination brought by the lawyers Ted Olson and David Boies is one case potentially heading to the Supreme Court, even as others, brought by GLAD, Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union, challenge federal marriage discrimination. Four federal courts have now declared the so-called Defense of Marriage Act indefensible under the Constitution, as the Justice Department did.The Supreme Court got interracial marriage wrong before it got it right in the best-named case ever, Loving v. Virginia (1967), and we do not know which case, if any, will get to the court when, or who the justices will be when one does.What we do know is what will maximize our chances of victory when we get there: Win more states — including measures on the ballot this November in Maine, Maryland, Minnesota and Washington — and continue winning over more support, growing and diversifying the national majority now confirmed in more than a dozen polls.That road map to victory, rather than speculation about Justice Anthony M. Kennedy or hand-wringing over timing, is the best way to help Freedom to Marry get the country on the right side of history and secure the freedom to marry for all loving and committed couples.The writer is founder and president of Freedom to Marry, the campaign to win marriage for same-sex couples nationwide.1080 2012-05-30 At the French Open, Tennis Isn’t the Only Attraction1081 2012-05-30 IF learning how to cook is easy enough for a child to do (and it is), the continuing-education portion of it lasts a lifetime. I remember the first time I roasted a pepper, 44 years ago. It was a revelation. And I remember when I thought I had it down pat, 15 years ago, around the time I wrote my first Minimalist column.I didn’t have it mastered, of course. And the other day I was reminded just how fantastic good peppers are when roasted nicely, and just how easy they are. If, that is, you have a good fire going. Because roasted peppers are at their best when they’re charred peppers, and they’re best charred over wood, or at least real charcoal.They’re also at their best when they’re the right peppers. (We’re talking about sweet peppers here, not chiles, which are a whole other story.) Of this I was reminded about a week ago, when I had lunch at De la Riva, a fine Madrid restaurant with traditional daily menus, the kind of place where a gentleman (see the photo on its Web site) brings a variety of appetizers and then asks if you’d rather have meat, fish or both.On the day I visited with some friends, among those appetizers was a plate of gorgeous long, bright-red peppers, perfectly roasted and peeled, sprinkled with salt and drizzled with oil. They looked the way they should, with a few stubborn bits of blackened skin still clinging to the flesh.Two days later, wandering through the markets of a small town in Greece, I came across those same kinds of peppers, in both red and green. Their name doesn’t matter much: what matters is that they’re long, tapered and fairly regular, without a lot of wrinkles and twists. And what matters is that they’re not bell peppers, which are usually not only weaker in flavor but also more difficult to peel.I’m not a lifelong fan of green peppers, which are the unripe specimens of whatever color they’ll eventually become, but in recent years I’ve come to appreciate them as not inferior but different. I bought about a dozen of each.1082 2012-05-30 Home prices rose in March from February in most major American cities surveyed, according to a private housing report on Tuesday, marking the first increase in prices in seven months.A separate economic report, however, showed that Americans' confidence in the economy in May had its biggest drop in eight months.The Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price indexes showed that prices increased in 12 of the 20 cities it tracks. The overall index was essentially unchanged from February, after falling 0.8 percent from January, and it was down 2.6 percent from March a year ago.Three of the weakest markets reported signs of improvement: prices increased in Tampa and Miami, while prices in Las Vegas were unchanged.The biggest month-over-month increases were in Phoenix, Seattle and Dallas. Prices dropped sharply in Detroit, Chicago and Atlanta.The increases partly reflect the beginning of the spring selling season. The month-to-month prices aren't adjusted for seasonal factors.1083 2012-05-30 MANILA — The chief justice of the Philippine Supreme Court, Renato C. Corona, was removed from office on Tuesday in a landmark conviction that could strengthen the president’s hand in cracking down on the endemic corruption that has long been a drag on the economy.Mr. Corona lost his job after it was disclosed in his impeachment trial that he had failed to declare $2.4 million in foreign currency deposits. Supporters of President Benigno S. Aquino III have said the chief justice needed to be removed because they feared he would be an obstacle to investigations of past corruption, especially those related to Mr. Corona’s patron, former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.The prosecution of Mrs. Arroyo and her allies has been central to Mr. Aquino’s anticorruption campaign and comes as the economy is improving and the nation is attracting more foreign investment.This was the first time that a high-level Philippine official had been removed from office after impeachment and conviction. Officials here are often removed through street protests.The case has been politically delicate from the start and is tied up with a feud between the Aquinos and Mrs. Arroyo, who is a member of the House of Representatives but did not support the impeachment. Mr. Corona was Mrs. Arroyo’s chief of staff before she appointed him to the Supreme Court in 2002. She named him chief justice just days after Mr. Aquino won the presidency. Mr. Aquino and his supporters argue the move was meant to squelch efforts to build corruption cases against Mrs. Arroyo and those in her administration.“Our people followed this trial closely, and in this exercise we have demonstrated to them, and to the international community, that our country adheres and subscribes to the democratic framework,” said Senator Jinggoy Ejercito Estrada, whose father, President Joseph Estrada, was forced out of office by popular protests after a failed impeachment trial on corruption charges.1084 2012-05-30 For the first time, the SAT exam will be offered outside the school year — but only to students enrolled in a $4,500 summer program for gifted students on the Amherst College campus. Elizabeth Stone, an independent college counselor in California, calls the Aug. 3 exam unfair and elitist, since other students, including hers, cannot take the SAT until October. Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, said students want the opportunity to take the SAT over the summer, free from the pressures of daily school work. The College Board said that exam is a pilot “to evaluate the feasibility” of summer tests.1085 2012-05-30 The most spectacular success of the summer season on television may have come before  summer has even started: the miniseries ''Hatfields & McCoys'' on the History Channel attracted a monster audience Monday night, 13.9 million viewers, the second...1086 2012-05-30 As Dewey & LeBoeuf began its bankruptcy proceedings on Tuesday, its advisers said their aim was to speed the failed law firm through Chapter 11.     Among the chief near-term goals of Dewey advisers is reaching an agreement to recover money from s...1087 2012-05-30 The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit in April after a lengthy investigation of the publishing industry, saying that the five publishers had colluded with Apple to limit price competition and caused consumers to pay tens of millions more for e-books than they would have otherwise.Five of the six major publishers in the industry moved from a wholesale pricing model to a system known as the agency model in 2010, a move that allowed publishers to begin setting their own e-book prices.The court filings this week laid out the initial defense of Penguin and Macmillan against the lawsuit, rebutting the government’s charges that publishers had conspired in e-mails, telephone conversations and over lavish dinners in Manhattan restaurants.In Macmillan’s 26-page response, it said, “Absent any direct evidence of conspiracy, the government’s complaint is necessarily based entirely on the little circumstantial evidence it was able to locate during its extensive investigation, on which it piles innuendo on top of innuendo, stretches facts and implies actions that did not occur and Macmillan denies unequivocally.”Macmillan adopted the agency pricing model on its own, the filing said, because the previous wholesale model “led to Amazon’s monopolization of e-book distribution.”Penguin, in its response, denied a conspiracy and repeatedly pointed to Amazon, saying that the publisher’s own executives were “concerned that Amazon’s below-cost pricing strategy for certain new release titles would be detrimental to the long term health of the book industry.”Penguin and Macmillan declined to comment on Wednesday.Apple filed its own response to the lawsuit last week, denying that it was part of a conspiracy. In its filing, Apple also referred to Amazon, saying that the government was siding with “monopoly, rather than competition.”The response from Macmillan addresses one of the more colorful charges by the government: that the publishers met privately over dinner in upscale restaurants to discuss their conspiracy.John Sargent, Macmillan’s chief executive, “dined once or at most twice with peers from certain other publishing houses, but these dinners were social in nature,” Macmillan said in its filing. “No conspiracy was hatched over any such dinner.”John Makinson, the chief executive of Penguin Group, had a “social dinner” on Jan. 28, 2009, Penguin’s filing said, but while “general book industry issues and trends were discussed at high-levels of generality, Makinson did so pursuant to antitrust legal advice and avoided competitively sensitive topics like terms of trade, prices or confidential competitive matters.”Addressing the charge that Macmillan conspired with other publishers in late 2009 and early 2010, the filing from Macmillan said that no telephone conversation between Mr. Sargent and other publishers had involved collusion. “Indeed, more than half of these telephone ‘conversations’ lasted no more than a few seconds and were nothing more than missed calls,” the filing said.1088 2012-05-30 A Tibetan mother of three died after setting fire to herself on Wednesday in the county of Ngaba, known in Chinese as Aba. The woman, in her mid-30s, was identified by Free Tibet, an advocacy group, as Rechok. She set fire to herself outside the Jonang Dzamthang monastery in the town of Barma, Free Tibet reported. The group added that Rechok had tended to the family’s animals in the last few days and then traveled to town to kill herself. Radio Free Asia identified the woman as Rikyo, 33.1089 2012-05-30 A tentative deal between the city of Providence and its workers and retirees will prevent the city from going into bankruptcy, Mayor Angel Taveras said Wednesday. Mr. Taveras announced that retirees, current safety officials and current municipal workers agreed to a 10-year suspension of cost-of-living increases for most pensions — and limitations thereafter — and the migration of their health care plans onto Medicare. He had said the city would run out of money in June if it did not lower its pension obligations and increase voluntary contributions from the city’s tax-exempt institutions; the city has since secured deals on increased payments with universities and hospitals.1090 2012-05-30 WASHINGTON — On May 28 of last year, President Obama stood next to Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland in Warsaw and declared he would support new rules to help more Poles get tourist visas to the United States. “If you’ve lived in Chicago and you haven’t become a little bit Polish,” Mr. Obama joked, “there’s something wrong with you.”A year later, the president made himself the target of a searing denunciation by Mr. Tusk after he referred on Tuesday to a “Polish death camp,” instead of a Nazi death camp in Poland, in bestowing a Presidential Medal of Freedom on Jan Karski, a hero of the Polish resistance to the Germans during World War II. Mr. Obama was guilty of “ignorance, lack of knowledge, bad intentions,” Mr. Tusk said.The White House expressed regret for what it described as a “misstatement.” But Mr. Tusk was not mollified, saying in a statement posted on his Web site that the United States needed to “end this with class.” Poland’s president, Bronislaw Komorowski, sent a more diplomatically worded letter to Mr. Obama asking him to correct the record.The contretemps offer a vivid illustration of the power of a president’s words, particularly when they touch on an issue of raw and lingering sensitivity, like the fact that Nazi Germany’s most notorious concentration camps were in Poland. The outcry over Mr. Obama’s remark all but overshadowed the fact that he was posthumously giving the nation’s highest civilian honor to Mr. Karski, who warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt about the horrors of the Holocaust and was later a Georgetown professor.The White House pointed out that Mr. Obama had visited a memorial to victims of Nazi persecution in the Warsaw Ghetto. He spoke in 2010 about the bravery of Poles during World War II, at a ceremony for the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and again last month at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.The White House seemed blindsided by the sulfurous reaction of Mr. Tusk, as well as that of Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who said in a Twitter message that the White House should “apologize for this outrageous error.” The United States has had a close relationship with Poland, though the Polish government was irked when Mr. Obama decided to scale back the Bush administration’s missile defense system in Eastern Europe.For many Poles, Mr. Obama’s statement was more than an innocent gaffe: it was a grave distortion of the darkest chapter in Polish history. “When someone says ‘Polish death camps,’ it’s as if there were no Nazis, no German responsibility, as if there was no Hitler,” Mr. Tusk said. “That is why our Polish sensitivity in these situations is so much more than just simply a feeling of national pride.”1091 2012-05-30 “I’m not going to say I was fresh as a daisy in the fifth,” Baker said. “I wasn’t.”And yet, while Baker’s tournament ended, his career restart has only begun. For years he said he wondered what was worse: not being good enough for the tour, or never finding out. Now, when the next rankings come out, he will have moved up to about 126th. There is talk he could receive a wild card into Wimbledon.In Paris, he displayed the kind of game — steady, varied, artful — that impressed an old rival, Novak Djokovic, the No. 1-ranked player. Baker beat Djokovic in juniors, and when Djokovic saw Baker on Tuesday, he said it was for the first time in seven or eight years.“He always had a smart game, a variety of shots,” said Djokovic, who defeated Blaz Kavcic, 6-0, 6-4, 6-4, on Wednesday to advance to the third round.Friends and family members packed Baker’s cheering section Wednesday, along for the ride, just as they were for all of the operations. His parents celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary this week, then celebrated his first victory in a Grand Slam event since 2005.Back at Belmont, the players watched their old coach on television, as Baker mania swept Nashville like an unlikely country music hit. Rick Byrd, the longtime basketball coach, followed Baker’s story as if addicted. He did not know Baker during the time they shared at Belmont, but he still watched the Simon match while on vacation in Wyoming.“Just got broken,” Byrd wrote in an e-mail during the third set. He followed that sentence with the electronic version of a sad face.Baker’s tale had that kind of impact throughout the tennis world. Justin Gimelstob, who played against Baker before retiring and before all of Baker’s injuries, ranked the comeback among the greatest in their sport. Patrick McEnroe, general manager of development for the United States Tennis Association, noted that Baker should inspire other players because he returned despite “no help” and “did it entirely on his own.”While Baker won his first Slam match since before President Obama came into office, Federer was at the opposite end of the spectrum. He set another record, which seems to happen every other week now. When he defeated Adrian Ungur of Romania, 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-3, Federer broke a tie with Jimmy Connors for most career wins at major tournaments in the Open era, which began in 1968.The numbers, as usual, are staggering. Federer has won 16 Grand Slam titles, and his record in major tournaments is 234-35, an 87 percent victory clip. And he is only 30 years old.Since Federer lost to Djokovic in the semifinals of the United States Open in September, he has won at a higher rate than any other men’s player. He went undefeated in tour play in 2011 after the Open loss, and this year, he won at Rotterdam; Dubai; Indian Wells, Calif.; and Madrid. He briefly held the No. 2 ranking.Now ranked third, Federer has played his way back into contention for the top overall slot held by Djokovic. This is more important than it seems, if only because Federer could tie Pete Sampras for the most weeks spent at No. 1 (286).The question that has lingered throughout the early parts of this season is whether Federer can win another major tournament, what with Djokovic and Rafael Nadal standing in his way. That question remains to be answered, here and at Wimbledon and this summer in New York.Along the way, Federer said, he hopes to practice with or play against Baker, to see this story up close. In their own way, both have proved this year that they belong — Baker in professional tennis, Federer with his sport’s elite even near the end of his career.“I’ll be able to look back and say I played on center court at the French Open,” Baker said. “I hope I don’t remember what happened in the fifth.”1092 2012-05-30 Still, how far do we want to go down this path? Is it right that prisoners in Santa Ana, Calif., can pay $90 per night for an upgrade to a cleaner, nicer jail cell? Should the really sell visas? A $500,000 investment will buy foreigners the right to immigrate. Should have gone ahead with a proposal to sell naming rights to its state parks? wondered in 2003 whether Walden Pond might become Pond. Should strapped towns accept virtually free police cars that come laden with advertising on the sides? Such a deal was negotiated and then ultimately collapsed, but at least one town does sell advertising on its police cars.“The marketization of everything means that people of affluence and people of modest means lead increasingly separate lives,” Sandel writes. “We live and work and shop and play in different places. Our children go to different schools. You might call it the skyboxification of American life. It’s not good for democracy, nor is it a satisfying way to live.”“Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?”This issue goes to the heart of fairness in our country. There has been much discussion recently about economic inequality, but almost no conversation about the way the spread of markets nurtures a broader, systemic inequality.We do, of course, place some boundaries on markets. I can’t buy the right to cut off your leg for my amusement. Americans can sell blood, but (perhaps mistakenly) we don’t allow markets for kidneys and other organs, even though that would probably save lives.Wealthy people can, in effect, buy access to the president at a $40,000-a-plate dinner, but they can’t purchase a Medal of Freedom. A major political donor can sometimes buy an ambassadorship, but not to an important country.Where to draw the lines limiting the role of markets isn’t clear to me, but I’m pretty sure that we’ve already gone too far. I’m offended when governments auction naming rights to public property or sell special access, even if only to fast lanes on a highway or better cells in a jail. It is one thing for to have first class and coach. It is quite another for government to offer first class and coach in the essential services that government provides.Where would this stop? Do we let people pay to get premium police and fire protection? Do we pursue an idea raised by Judge Richard Posner to auction off the right to adopt children?We already have tremendous inequality in our country: The richest 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, according to the . But we do still have a measure of equality before the law — equality in our basic dignity — and that should be priceless.“ fundamentalism,” to use the term popularized by George Soros, is gaining ground. It’s related to the glorification of wealth over the last couple of decades, to the celebration of opulence, and to the emergence of a new aristocracy. Market fundamentalists assume a measure of social Darwinism and accept that laissez-faire is always optimal.That’s the dogma that helped lead to bank deregulation and the current economic mess. And anyone who honestly believes that low taxes and unfettered free markets are always best should consider moving to ’s tribal areas. They are a triumph of limited government, negligible taxes, no “burdensome regulation” and free markets for everything from drugs to AK-47s.If you’re infatuated with unfettered free markets, just visit Waziristan.1093 2012-05-30 CAIRO — Prosecutors charged Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, the imprisoned sons of former President Hosni Mubarak, with insider stock trading on Wednesday, just three days before both men are expected to hear the verdict in a criminal trial charging them with corruption during their father’s three decades of rule.State television reported that the Mubarak brothers and seven other men, including the co-chief executives of Egypt’s most prominent investment bank, were charged with obtaining over $400 million through corrupt practices in relation to the 2007 sale of Al Watany Bank. Gamal and Alaa have been in prison since last spring.The new charges against Mr. Mubarak’s children, once untouchable jet-setters, are another episode in the former ruling family’s fall from grace. Gamal Mubarak, 48, was once widely expected to inherit the presidency after his father’s death. Alaa, 49, is a once-prominent businessman who kept a low public profile.The criminal trial against Gamal, Alaa and their father began in August 2011. The former president is charged with corruption and with ordering the death of about 900 protesters during the 18 days of street protests that ended his rule in February 2011. The sons are accused of accepting bribes in the form of real estate sold to them at a steep discount from market rates.The new charges come at a tense moment in Egypt’s fitful transition to democracy, which has been marred by violence and conducted under the watchful eye of a military junta. A presidential race has pitted energized Islamists against a stalwart of the former regime.1094 2012-05-30 “The Danger Downwind” (editorial, May 24) promotes an inappropriate solution for an issue already addressed. Safety and security are paramount issues for the chemical industry.That’s why the National Association of Chemical Distributors and its members responded to 9/11 immediately. We were the first chemical trade association to approve new security measures, as part of our mandatory management program, Responsible Distribution.The comprehensive Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards have made facilities throughout the country more secure. In fact, about 3,000 sites have reduced risk by voluntarily changing their ingredients or processes.Adding more government oversight through the Clean Air Act’s general duty clause will create more overlapping requirements, leading to confusion and bureaucracy, not better security.The focus should remain on making the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards law work effectively, not adding another agency and another regulation.1095 2012-05-30 Its family of Touch rivals, called the Galaxy Player series, arrived last winter, and now a second generation has already appeared, thinner and better. Last week, the best Galaxy Player yet landed: the Player 4.2 ($200, same price as the Touch).Now, the current iPod Touch has its charms. It has that Retina display — a screen so sharp and fine, you can’t see individual pixels. It’s the thinnest, best-looking player on the market.Maybe more important, it belongs to the Apple universe. It connects to the world’s biggest app store, an attractive and well-stocked music/movie/TV store. There’s a panoply of cases, accessories and docks for it. Its charging connector is such a standard that it mates with cars and hotel alarm clocks everywhere you go.In other words, a dark-horse alternative like Samsung’s needs a pretty convincing pitch.As it turns out, the pitch is fairly convincing. It’s as if the company were trying to say: “We are to the iPod Touch what phones are to the iPhone. That is, we’re much more open. We offer choice that Apple doesn’t — of screen size, of manufacturer. We don’t obsess over the suitability of every app in our app store. We don’t have Apple’s weird about removable components, like batteries and memory cards. When you get tired of Apple’s take-it-or-leave-it perfectionism, we’ll be here for you.”In many ways, the Player 4.2 is identical to the Touch. It has about the same advertised battery life (40 hours of music playback, five hours of video). You use it the same way: multitouch screen, on-screen keyboard, no voice commands. Like the Touch, it has both a back camera (no flash) and a low-resolution front camera for doing video chats. There’s built-in Bluetooth for playing music through your car or wireless headphones.The Player 4.2 is beautiful. Its plastic shell, with comfortably rounded edges, can’t hold a candle to the mirror-finish metal back of the Touch, but of course it doesn’t hold fingerprints, either.The Player is not as light or as thin (0.35 inches thick instead of 0.28), but the slight thickening makes possible a removable back panel. Inside are two things the Touch doesn’t offer: a removable battery and a memory-card slot.You’ll probably need to buy a memory card, in fact, since the Player comes with only about four gigabytes of free memory for your files. But the point is: the capacity of your Player is up to you. Choice is good, right?The Player offers a number of undeniable hardware features that trump the Touch. For example, it has stereo speakers instead of , cleverly positioned at opposite ends.True, you won’t detect much separation of right and left channels unless, you know, you balance the thing on your nose. But over all, the Player’s volume and clarity are much better than the Touch’s.The Player also has some goodies that are extra-cost options on the Touch, like a wall charger and earbuds with a microphone on the cord.Because this machine runs Android (the outdated version 2.3), it can run most of the 400,000 apps on the Android app store. All the essentials are there: the Android versions of Angry Space, DrawSomething and so on. In fact, the full, ad-free versions of Angry Birds, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and 2012 come installed.If you pair the Player with a non-smartphone over Bluetooth, you can make and receive actual phone calls right on the Player, even when you’re not in Wi-Fi.Samsung points out that this weird little feature is ideal for teenagers. Now parents can pay the cellphone company only for a basic, stripped-down, voice-only phone ($30 a month instead of $70, for example), yet their teenage offspring wind up with what amounts to a full-blown Android phone. The dumbphone adds the one thing the Player lacks: a cellular connection.The rest of the news isn’t quite as good. The screen is much better than the one on the 3.6-inch Galaxy Player ($150). And 4.2 inches is a fantastic size for a video player; it’s a much bigger canvas for pictures and movies than the Touch’s 3.5-inch screen.Even so, the screen quality doesn’t come within miles of the Touch’s Retina display, either in clarity or color.Samsung has figured out how to play a much wider array of video formats than the Touch can, but it stutters on hi-def videos — even the demo movie that comes on it.The two-megapixel camera is pretty awful. It does have a nice sweep-panorama mode, but the photos are still washed-out and soft.You also lose the sense of coherence Apple brings. There’s no single, smoothly integrated music/movie store — just the more chaotic Play store and a bare-bones Samsung store (movies only) called Media Hub. (A Samsung music store is coming soon.)So where does that leave the Samsung Player 4.2? For the same price as the iPod Touch, you get a more open, expandable machine with better sound, more included accessories and a bigger (but lower-resolution) screen.Embracing it requires abandoning the well-organized, well-stocked, well-integrated Apple universe, and settling for a mishmash of services and software that performs roughly the same functions.In the end, the Player should hold special appeal for a significant customer niche: rebels. The technologically sophisticated. People who would enjoy the freedom of removable cards and batteries. Parents who might like that peculiar business about making phone calls through a cheaper phone. People who own recent Samsung televisions (the Player doubles as a remote control). Anyone with a dominant anti-Apple gene.Otherwise, it’s not entirely clear who would benefit by this slightly thicker, slightly heavier, slightly less refined iPod Touch. Until that question is answered, it’s hard to imagine Samsung’s latest becoming a significant Player in the Galaxy.1096 2012-05-31 In “Pink Ribbons, Inc.” the director Léa Pool takes aim at the breast cancer movement and the corporations that benefit from its ubiquitous rosy symbol of awareness and action. Yet for all the stellar intentions; revelatory evidence; and thoughtful, wall-to-wall interviewees, this frustratingly overstuffed documentary indulges more in spraying buckshot than stalking a target.This is a pity, because the film highlights legitimate concerns that others, notably the medical sociologist Gayle Sulik, have been digging into for years, including the questionable commingling of marketing and philanthropy and the prioritization of pharmaceutical solutions over prevention. Casting a pink veil of positivity over a dark and dreadful disease, we are told, encourages the myth of progress and distracts from treatment options that remain limited to what Dr. Susan Love calls “slash, burn and poison” and mortality rates that have barely altered in six decades.Depressing statistics, however, don’t sell products. Arguing forcefully that corporate sponsorship of this so-called pink culture is more likely to fatten bottom lines — or rehabilitate a damaged image — than result in a cure, Ms. Pool wonders who is being served by a fuchsia Niagara Falls or a blushing bucket of KFC. But though poking indignantly at the close ties between nonprofit giants like Susan G. Komen for the Cure and, for example, large chemical companies whose goals are unlikely to include investing in explorations of suspected links between cancer and pollution, the film fails to offer substantive financial analyses. Where, exactly, do all these millions in charitable donations go? There may well be too many players to track, but Komen’s detailed financial statements, freely available on its Web site, might be a good place to begin.Bristling with valuable information but with no clear path to a point, “Pink Ribbons” (based on the 2008 book by Samantha King) is a head-reeling, hot-button mess. Only in one segment does the fog fully clear, as we meet a dignified group of women weathering metastatic disease. Through these faces of pain, fear and anger, and with the lucid guidance of Barbara Ehrenreich (drawing on her brilliant 2001 essay “Welcome to Cancerland”), we understand how the movement’s Mardi Gras atmosphere and “tyranny of cheerfulness” — walk, run, smile, be a warrior! — serve marketers more than the terminally ill.Though leaving us with many more questions than answers, this well-intentioned blur of accusations, advertising clips and pink-washed events nevertheless deserves to be seen. At the very least, the movement’s apparent drive to make breast cancer, in the words of Ms. Ehrenreich, “pretty and feminine and normal” should raise our hackles. “It’s not,” she insists. “It’s horrible. It must be stopped.” And maybe festooning ourselves in little-girl pastels is not the best way to achieve that goal.1097 2012-05-31 The evidence suggests that electing a president with a business background is actually a terrible idea....1098 2012-05-31 A pioneering climate researcher lays out concerns, in 1980....1099 2012-05-31 The miniseries about the legendary family feud reached a new audience high of 14.3 million viewers on Wednesday night.

I called for the puck. I don’t know if he heard me, but he chipped it right onto my tape.”Brodeur finished with 25 saves, while the Kings’ Jonathan Quick made 17. Brodeur said he expected Kopitar to shoot on his backhand.“That probably goes back a few years,” Kopitar said. “I beat him with a backhand in a shootout, so maybe that’s why he expected it. Tonight I just wanted to mix it up.”Kopitar’s goal gave him 16 points in the playoffs, 2 off the lead held by the Devils’ Ilya Kovalchuk. The Kings held Kovalchuk to one shot in almost 22 minutes of ice time.The Kings did not dominate play, but they definitely had the better of it. They attempted 54 shots that either went on goal, were blocked or missed the net. The Devils attempted 35.The game was a closely contested affair for 40 minutes, with the score tied, 1-1. The matchup came to life in the third, when the teams rediscovered their stickhandling skills and began to direct some snarl at each other.Just before the four-minute mark, the Devils appeared to take the lead when the puck crossed the goal line after a scramble in front of the Kings’ net. But referees disallowed the goal, ruling that Zach Parise had swept the puck in with his hand, and replays confirmed the call.The Devils pressed their newfound advantage and broke in on goal on an odd-man rush three and a half minutes later. But Marek Zidlicky, faced with a wide-open view of the net, chose not to shoot and passed the puck.Midway through the period the puck rebounded to Mark Fayne, who had a wide-open net, but he shot wide.It was the Kings’ turn in the 13th minute, but Brodeur made three terrific saves in rapid succession, denying Drew Doughty, Dustin Penner and Jeff Carter.It will take time for this series to develop the kind of intrigue fans would like to see. The Devils and the Kings had not met since Oct. 25. The Devils’ victories in both regular-season games have become meaningless at this point.The first period was tentative and mistake-prone, fitting, perhaps, given the Kings’ eight-day layoff after finishing off Phoenix in the Western Conference finals — the third-longest rest between the Stanley Cup semifinals and finals since 1968.But the Devils had no such excuse; they knocked off the Rangers on Friday after six grueling games. Moreover, their playoff success was marked by fast starts; they had outscored their opponents in the first period by 23-9.On Wednesday, they fell behind on a mistake. Halfway through the first period, Andy Greene had the puck behind his net and was being hounded by the rookie Jordan Nolan, the 22-year-old son of Ted Nolan, the former Islanders and Sabres coach.Greene fell, Nolan took the puck away and centered it in front to an open Colin Fraser, whose one-time shot beat Brodeur at 9:56, the Kings’ second shot of the game.It was the first career playoff assist for Nolan and the first career playoff goal for Fraser, who is in his fourth full season.The Devils stirred to life only when Dainius Zubrus stepped onto the ice. Zubrus, who leads the team in hits this spring, ran his 6-foot-5 frame into five Kings in the first half of the game — his first game in the Stanley Cup finals since he was a rookie with Philadelphia in 1997. He flattened Dustin Brown and Jeff Carter, among other Kings. He also elbowed Fraser in the middle of the second period, but the Devils killed off that penalty.With two minutes to go in the period, Zubrus stole the puck behind the Kings’ net and centered it to Parise, but his pass went into Parise’s feet and nothing came of it. Quick held Parise down and gave him a couple of noogies for invading his crease.Finally the Devils broke through, on their ninth shot of the game, by Anton Volchenkov. The puck actually caromed into the Los Angeles net off Kings defenseman Slava Voynov, who was covering Patrik Elias on the play. The goal was credited to Volchenkov at 18:48, his first tally of the postseason and first at all since March 11.Since the Stanley Cup finals became a best-of-seven affair in 1939, the team that won Game 1 has gone on to win 55 of 72 series.1113 2012-05-31 Four Missouri National Guard soldiers stole electronics from a Walmart in Joplin while helping with recovery efforts the day after the store was destroyed by a tornado last year, according to records released Tuesday. The Guard said three specialists and a sergeant who admitted taking video game devices, a camera and other items believed the merchandise was going to be discarded, The Joplin Globe reported. The men, who are not named in the records, were among 16 soldiers assigned to look for survivors and help with recovery after the tornado killed 161 people. The four admitted to the thefts and returned the items to their superiors, although the sergeant initially did not return the correct video game device “because he had given the new one to his son and was embarrassed to ask for it back,” the records state. An investigating officer recommended that the four be demoted, but the records do not indicate what type of discipline they eventually received.1114 2012-05-31 For the first time, the SAT exam will be offered outside the school year — but only to students enrolled in a $4,500 summer program for gifted students on the Amherst College campus. Elizabeth Stone, an independent college counselor in California, calls the Aug. 3 exam unfair and elitist, since other students, including hers, cannot take the SAT until October. Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, said students want the opportunity to take the SAT over the summer, free from the pressures of daily school work. The College Board said that exam is a pilot “to evaluate the feasibility” of summer tests.1115 2012-05-31 A tentative deal between the city of Providence and its workers and retirees will prevent the city from going into bankruptcy, Mayor Angel Taveras said Wednesday. Mr. Taveras announced that retirees, current safety officials and current municipal workers agreed to a 10-year suspension of cost-of-living increases for most pensions — and limitations thereafter — and the migration of their health care plans onto Medicare. He had said the city would run out of money in June if it did not lower its pension obligations and increase voluntary contributions from the city’s tax-exempt institutions; the city has since secured deals on increased payments with universities and hospitals.1116 2012-05-31 A Tibetan mother of three died after setting fire to herself on Wednesday in the county of Ngaba, known in Chinese as Aba. The woman, in her mid-30s, was identified by Free Tibet, an advocacy group, as Rechok. She set fire to herself outside the Jonang Dzamthang monastery in the town of Barma, Free Tibet reported. The group added that Rechok had tended to the family’s animals in the last few days and then traveled to town to kill herself. Radio Free Asia identified the woman as Rikyo, 33.1117 2012-05-31 The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit in April after a lengthy investigation of the publishing industry, saying that the five publishers had colluded with Apple to limit price competition and caused consumers to pay tens of millions more for e-books than they would have otherwise.Five of the six major publishers in the industry moved from a wholesale pricing model to a system known as the agency model in 2010, a move that allowed publishers to begin setting their own e-book prices.The court filings this week laid out the initial defense of Penguin and Macmillan against the lawsuit, rebutting the government’s charges that publishers had conspired in e-mails, telephone conversations and over lavish dinners in Manhattan restaurants.In Macmillan’s 26-page response, it said, “Absent any direct evidence of conspiracy, the government’s complaint is necessarily based entirely on the little circumstantial evidence it was able to locate during its extensive investigation, on which it piles innuendo on top of innuendo, stretches facts and implies actions that did not occur and Macmillan denies unequivocally.”Macmillan adopted the agency pricing model on its own, the filing said, because the previous wholesale model “led to Amazon’s monopolization of e-book distribution.”Penguin, in its response, denied a conspiracy and repeatedly pointed to Amazon, saying that the publisher’s own executives were “concerned that Amazon’s below-cost pricing strategy for certain new release titles would be detrimental to the long term health of the book industry.”Penguin and Macmillan declined to comment on Wednesday.Apple filed its own response to the lawsuit last week, denying that it was part of a conspiracy. In its filing, Apple also referred to Amazon, saying that the government was siding with “monopoly, rather than competition.”The response from Macmillan addresses one of the more colorful charges by the government: that the publishers met privately over dinner in upscale restaurants to discuss their conspiracy.John Sargent, Macmillan’s chief executive, “dined once or at most twice with peers from certain other publishing houses, but these dinners were social in nature,” Macmillan said in its filing. “No conspiracy was hatched over any such dinner.”John Makinson, the chief executive of Penguin Group, had a “social dinner” on Jan. 28, 2009, Penguin’s filing said, but while “general book industry issues and trends were discussed at high-levels of generality, Makinson did so pursuant to antitrust legal advice and avoided competitively sensitive topics like terms of trade, prices or confidential competitive matters.”Addressing the charge that Macmillan conspired with other publishers in late 2009 and early 2010, the filing from Macmillan said that no telephone conversation between Mr. Sargent and other publishers had involved collusion. “Indeed, more than half of these telephone ‘conversations’ lasted no more than a few seconds and were nothing more than missed calls,” the filing said.1118 2012-05-31 Still, how far do we want to go down this path? Is it right that prisoners in Santa Ana, Calif., can pay $90 per night for an upgrade to a cleaner, nicer jail cell? Should the really sell visas? A $500,000 investment will buy foreigners the right to immigrate. Should have gone ahead with a proposal to sell naming rights to its state parks? wondered in 2003 whether Walden Pond might become Pond. Should strapped towns accept virtually free police cars that come laden with advertising on the sides? Such a deal was negotiated and then ultimately collapsed, but at least one town does sell advertising on its police cars.“The marketization of everything means that people of affluence and people of modest means lead increasingly separate lives,” Sandel writes. “We live and work and shop and play in different places. Our children go to different schools. You might call it the skyboxification of American life. It’s not good for democracy, nor is it a satisfying way to live.”“Do we want a society where everything is up for sale? Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honor and money cannot buy?”This issue goes to the heart of fairness in our country. There has been much discussion recently about economic inequality, but almost no conversation about the way the spread of markets nurtures a broader, systemic inequality.We do, of course, place some boundaries on markets. I can’t buy the right to cut off your leg for my amusement. Americans can sell blood, but (perhaps mistakenly) we don’t allow markets for kidneys and other organs, even though that would probably save lives.Wealthy people can, in effect, buy access to the president at a $40,000-a-plate dinner, but they can’t purchase a Medal of Freedom. A major political donor can sometimes buy an ambassadorship, but not to an important country.Where to draw the lines limiting the role of markets isn’t clear to me, but I’m pretty sure that we’ve already gone too far. I’m offended when governments auction naming rights to public property or sell special access, even if only to fast lanes on a highway or better cells in a jail. It is one thing for to have first class and coach. It is quite another for government to offer first class and coach in the essential services that government provides.Where would this stop? Do we let people pay to get premium police and fire protection? Do we pursue an idea raised by Judge Richard Posner to auction off the right to adopt children?We already have tremendous inequality in our country: The richest 1 percent of Americans own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent, according to the . But we do still have a measure of equality before the law — equality in our basic dignity — and that should be priceless.“ fundamentalism,” to use the term popularized by George Soros, is gaining ground. It’s related to the glorification of wealth over the last couple of decades, to the celebration of opulence, and to the emergence of a new aristocracy. Market fundamentalists assume a measure of social Darwinism and accept that laissez-faire is always optimal.That’s the dogma that helped lead to bank deregulation and the current economic mess. And anyone who honestly believes that low taxes and unfettered free markets are always best should consider moving to ’s tribal areas. They are a triumph of limited government, negligible taxes, no “burdensome regulation” and free markets for everything from drugs to AK-47s.If you’re infatuated with unfettered free markets, just visit Waziristan.1119 2012-05-31 WASHINGTON — On May 28 of last year, President Obama stood next to Prime Minister Donald Tusk of Poland in Warsaw and declared he would support new rules to help more Poles get tourist visas to the United States. “If you’ve lived in Chicago and you haven’t become a little bit Polish,” Mr. Obama joked, “there’s something wrong with you.”A year later, the president made himself the target of a searing denunciation by Mr. Tusk after he referred on Tuesday to a “Polish death camp,” instead of a Nazi death camp in Poland, in bestowing a Presidential Medal of Freedom on Jan Karski, a hero of the Polish resistance to the Germans during World War II. Mr. Obama was guilty of “ignorance, lack of knowledge, bad intentions,” Mr. Tusk said.The White House expressed regret for what it described as a “misstatement.” But Mr. Tusk was not mollified, saying in a statement posted on his Web site that the United States needed to “end this with class.” Poland’s president, Bronislaw Komorowski, sent a more diplomatically worded letter to Mr. Obama asking him to correct the record.The contretemps offer a vivid illustration of the power of a president’s words, particularly when they touch on an issue of raw and lingering sensitivity, like the fact that Nazi Germany’s most notorious concentration camps were in Poland. The outcry over Mr. Obama’s remark all but overshadowed the fact that he was posthumously giving the nation’s highest civilian honor to Mr. Karski, who warned President Franklin D. Roosevelt about the horrors of the Holocaust and was later a Georgetown professor.The White House pointed out that Mr. Obama had visited a memorial to victims of Nazi persecution in the Warsaw Ghetto. He spoke in 2010 about the bravery of Poles during World War II, at a ceremony for the 65th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, and again last month at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.The White House seemed blindsided by the sulfurous reaction of Mr. Tusk, as well as that of Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski, who said in a Twitter message that the White House should “apologize for this outrageous error.” The United States has had a close relationship with Poland, though the Polish government was irked when Mr. Obama decided to scale back the Bush administration’s missile defense system in Eastern Europe.For many Poles, Mr. Obama’s statement was more than an innocent gaffe: it was a grave distortion of the darkest chapter in Polish history. “When someone says ‘Polish death camps,’ it’s as if there were no Nazis, no German responsibility, as if there was no Hitler,” Mr. Tusk said. “That is why our Polish sensitivity in these situations is so much more than just simply a feeling of national pride.”1120 2012-05-31 “The Danger Downwind” (editorial, May 24) promotes an inappropriate solution for an issue already addressed. Safety and security are paramount issues for the chemical industry.That’s why the National Association of Chemical Distributors and its members responded to 9/11 immediately. We were the first chemical trade association to approve new security measures, as part of our mandatory management program, Responsible Distribution.The comprehensive Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards have made facilities throughout the country more secure. In fact, about 3,000 sites have reduced risk by voluntarily changing their ingredients or processes.Adding more government oversight through the Clean Air Act’s general duty clause will create more overlapping requirements, leading to confusion and bureaucracy, not better security.The focus should remain on making the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards law work effectively, not adding another agency and another regulation.1121 2012-05-31 Credit: Elizabeth Lippman for The New York Times1122 2012-05-31 CAIRO — Prosecutors charged Gamal and Alaa Mubarak, the imprisoned sons of former President Hosni Mubarak, with insider stock trading on Wednesday, just three days before both men are expected to hear the verdict in a criminal trial charging them with corruption during their father’s three decades of rule.State television reported that the Mubarak brothers and seven other men, including the co-chief executives of Egypt’s most prominent investment bank, were charged with obtaining over $400 million through corrupt practices in relation to the 2007 sale of Al Watany Bank. Gamal and Alaa have been in prison since last spring.The new charges against Mr. Mubarak’s children, once untouchable jet-setters, are another episode in the former ruling family’s fall from grace. Gamal Mubarak, 48, was once widely expected to inherit the presidency after his father’s death. Alaa, 49, is a once-prominent businessman who kept a low public profile.The criminal trial against Gamal, Alaa and their father began in August 2011. The former president is charged with corruption and with ordering the death of about 900 protesters during the 18 days of street protests that ended his rule in February 2011. The sons are accused of accepting bribes in the form of real estate sold to them at a steep discount from market rates.The new charges come at a tense moment in Egypt’s fitful transition to democracy, which has been marred by violence and conducted under the watchful eye of a military junta. A presidential race has pitted energized Islamists against a stalwart of the former regime.1123 2012-05-31 Its family of Touch rivals, called the Galaxy Player series, arrived last winter, and now a second generation has already appeared, thinner and better. Last week, the best Galaxy Player yet landed: the Player 4.2 ($200, same price as the Touch).Now, the current iPod Touch has its charms. It has that Retina display — a screen so sharp and fine, you can’t see individual pixels. It’s the thinnest, best-looking player on the market.Maybe more important, it belongs to the Apple universe. It connects to the world’s biggest app store, an attractive and well-stocked music/movie/TV store. There’s a panoply of cases, accessories and docks for it. Its charging connector is such a standard that it mates with cars and hotel alarm clocks everywhere you go.In other words, a dark-horse alternative like Samsung’s needs a pretty convincing pitch.As it turns out, the pitch is fairly convincing. It’s as if the company were trying to say: “We are to the iPod Touch what phones are to the iPhone. That is, we’re much more open. We offer choice that Apple doesn’t — of screen size, of manufacturer. We don’t obsess over the suitability of every app in our app store. We don’t have Apple’s weird about removable components, like batteries and memory cards. When you get tired of Apple’s take-it-or-leave-it perfectionism, we’ll be here for you.”In many ways, the Player 4.2 is identical to the Touch. It has about the same advertised battery life (40 hours of music playback, five hours of video). You use it the same way: multitouch screen, on-screen keyboard, no voice commands. Like the Touch, it has both a back camera (no flash) and a low-resolution front camera for doing video chats. There’s built-in Bluetooth for playing music through your car or wireless headphones.The Player 4.2 is beautiful. Its plastic shell, with comfortably rounded edges, can’t hold a candle to the mirror-finish metal back of the Touch, but of course it doesn’t hold fingerprints, either.The Player is not as light or as thin (0.35 inches thick instead of 0.28), but the slight thickening makes possible a removable back panel. Inside are two things the Touch doesn’t offer: a removable battery and a memory-card slot.You’ll probably need to buy a memory card, in fact, since the Player comes with only about four gigabytes of free memory for your files. But the point is: the capacity of your Player is up to you. Choice is good, right?The Player offers a number of undeniable hardware features that trump the Touch. For example, it has stereo speakers instead of , cleverly positioned at opposite ends.True, you won’t detect much separation of right and left channels unless, you know, you balance the thing on your nose. But over all, the Player’s volume and clarity are much better than the Touch’s.The Player also has some goodies that are extra-cost options on the Touch, like a wall charger and earbuds with a microphone on the cord.Because this machine runs Android (the outdated version 2.3), it can run most of the 400,000 apps on the Android app store. All the essentials are there: the Android versions of Angry Space, DrawSomething and so on. In fact, the full, ad-free versions of Angry Birds, Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit and 2012 come installed.If you pair the Player with a non-smartphone over Bluetooth, you can make and receive actual phone calls right on the Player, even when you’re not in Wi-Fi.Samsung points out that this weird little feature is ideal for teenagers. Now parents can pay the cellphone company only for a basic, stripped-down, voice-only phone ($30 a month instead of $70, for example), yet their teenage offspring wind up with what amounts to a full-blown Android phone. The dumbphone adds the one thing the Player lacks: a cellular connection.The rest of the news isn’t quite as good. The screen is much better than the one on the 3.6-inch Galaxy Player ($150). And 4.2 inches is a fantastic size for a video player; it’s a much bigger canvas for pictures and movies than the Touch’s 3.5-inch screen.Even so, the screen quality doesn’t come within miles of the Touch’s Retina display, either in clarity or color.Samsung has figured out how to play a much wider array of video formats than the Touch can, but it stutters on hi-def videos — even the demo movie that comes on it.The two-megapixel camera is pretty awful. It does have a nice sweep-panorama mode, but the photos are still washed-out and soft.You also lose the sense of coherence Apple brings. There’s no single, smoothly integrated music/movie store — just the more chaotic Play store and a bare-bones Samsung store (movies only) called Media Hub. (A Samsung music store is coming soon.)So where does that leave the Samsung Player 4.2? For the same price as the iPod Touch, you get a more open, expandable machine with better sound, more included accessories and a bigger (but lower-resolution) screen.Embracing it requires abandoning the well-organized, well-stocked, well-integrated Apple universe, and settling for a mishmash of services and software that performs roughly the same functions.In the end, the Player should hold special appeal for a significant customer niche: rebels. The technologically sophisticated. People who would enjoy the freedom of removable cards and batteries. Parents who might like that peculiar business about making phone calls through a cheaper phone. People who own recent Samsung televisions (the Player doubles as a remote control). Anyone with a dominant anti-Apple gene.Otherwise, it’s not entirely clear who would benefit by this slightly thicker, slightly heavier, slightly less refined iPod Touch. Until that question is answered, it’s hard to imagine Samsung’s latest becoming a significant Player in the Galaxy.1124 2012-05-31 In the bond market, the Spanish government’s borrowing costs are approaching the symbolically dangerous level of 7 percent on 10-year bonds. The rise has stoked worries that Spain might need bailouts similar in scope — though many times larger — than those extended to Greece, Portugal and Ireland. Interest rates in that range had pushed them out of the debt markets that governments rely on to finance their operations.“At 7 percent, it will be very hard for Spain to obtain funding,” said Santiago Valverde, an economics professor at the University of Granada and a research consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank in Chicago. “It’s not just the government either, but big banks and companies, as well. The markets will close.”On Wednesday, Spain’s economy minister, Luis de Guindos, acknowledged as much when he said interest rates were “not sustainable in the long term.”The yield on Spain’s 10-year bond rose 0.21 percentage point Wednesday, to 6.61 percent. In Italy — a country whose debt burden of 120 percent of gross domestic product is much higher than Spain’s — the yield on 10-year bonds rose about 6 percent, hitting a 10-month high.Since the nationalization of Bankia on May 9 signaled the perilous state of Spain’s banking industry, and drew attention to the limited ability of the government to shore up the banks and prevent the flight of capital from the country, the prime minister, Mariano Rajoy, has insisted that Spain will not need a Greek-style bailout.No head of state would welcome such intervention, because as Athens and Dublin and Lisbon have found, those rescues come with demands for deeper budget cuts and fiscal rigor.But Mr. Rajoy’s administration has been floating the idea of engineering a bailout by other means. These include getting Europe’s rescue fund to provide money directly to the country’s banks or to buy Spanish government bonds on the open market, without Europe’s demanding new levels of scrutiny and tough payback conditions.Economists estimate that if Spain were forced out of the bond markets by its high borrowing costs and had to rely on funds from Europe and the International Monetary Fund to survive, the cost could reach 500 billion euros over several years.Europe’s new bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, will have about 700 billion euros when it goes into operation this summer. But it remains untested in its ability to work quickly.At the root of Spain’s crisis has been a drastic flight of foreign capital from the country — one that, paradoxically, has been accentuated by the European Central Bank’s program of providing low-cost three-year loans to European banks so that they might buy their governments’ bonds.When the central bank created that program late last year, and dispensed two rounds of loans within a few months, it was credited with having done much to ease Europe’s crisis.In the case of Spain, while the program bought time, it has made the country’s underlying problems worse. Spanish banks have by far been the most aggressive participants in the cheap-loan program, having borrowed more than 300 billion euros from the central bank. And much of that money was spent on Spanish government bonds.In the short term, those bond purchases helped the government by bringing down interest rates — by reducing Madrid’s cost of borrowing. But as a result, Spanish banks now own a larger share, about 67 percent, of their own government’s debt than the banks of any other country in the euro zone, according to research by BNP Paribas.Now the value of those bonds is declining — prices fall as yields rise — and further weakening Spanish banks.In recent months, some of the biggest sellers of those bonds back to Spain’s banks have been foreign banks and investors eager to take their money and run. In March, foreign bond investors owned only 26 percent of Spain’s bonds, according to a recent analysis by J. P. Morgan, down from about 40 percent a year earlier.Most analysts say they assume if that measure were made now, the foreign holdings would be even a smaller share of the total.“There has been a great retreat here, and you can see it in the reduced foreign ownership of Spanish government bonds,” said John Whittaker, an economist at Lancaster University in Britain who tracks capital flows within the euro zone.Burdened as they are by problem loans from the collapse of Spain’s real estate bubble, banks now have the additional onus of carrying large holdings of government bonds that are losing value by the day. Among the largest holders of Spanish bonds are the country’s international banking giants Santander and BBVA, which, through February, owned 60 billion euros and 49 billion euros.Given those big banks’ diverse overseas operations and stronger capital positions, these holdings do not represent an immediate threat. But for Spain’s many domestically focused banks, including the bailed-out Bankia, which had 29 billion euros worth of government bonds as of last year, such exposures are more problematic.It’s not just Spain, either.Italian banks have also been enthusiastic buyers of their government’s bonds, and they own 57 percent of bonds outstanding. As in the case of Spain, foreigners have been obliging sellers and have sold 242 billion euros worth of bonds to local banks, bringing their share in Italian bond holdings down to 35 percent as of this March compared with 51 percent late last year.Just before the restructuring of private-sector Greek debt in March, foreign investors owned 32 percent of the bonds outstanding, a higher proportion than what foreigners now own in Spain.If Spain does eventually need to seek a European bailout, it might have trouble meeting the various conditions — most prominent of which would be hitting budget deficit targets.And on that score the news is not good. Through the first four months of this year, Spain’s budget deficit was 26 percent higher than it was a year earlier, because of increased payouts to its debt-plagued regional governments, collapsing tax revenues and the soaring cost of unemployment benefits.The prospect of Spain’s bringing its deficit down from its current level of 8.5 percent, to the 5.3 percent target set for this year by Europe, now seems unlikely.“We are a highly leveraged nation,” said Mr. Valverde. “What we need is a Europe-wide solution.”1125 2012-05-31 “I’m not going to say I was fresh as a daisy in the fifth,” Baker said. “I wasn’t.”And yet, while Baker’s tournament ended, his career restart has only begun. For years he said he wondered what was worse: not being good enough for the tour, or never finding out. Now, when the next rankings come out, he will have moved up to about 126th. There is talk he could receive a wild card into Wimbledon.In Paris, he displayed the kind of game — steady, varied, artful — that impressed an old rival, Novak Djokovic, the No. 1-ranked player. Baker beat Djokovic in juniors, and when Djokovic saw Baker on Tuesday, he said it was for the first time in seven or eight years.“He always had a smart game, a variety of shots,” said Djokovic, who defeated Blaz Kavcic, 6-0, 6-4, 6-4, on Wednesday to advance to the third round.Friends and family members packed Baker’s cheering section Wednesday, along for the ride, just as they were for all of the operations. His parents celebrated their 40th wedding anniversary this week, then celebrated his first victory in a Grand Slam event since 2005.Back at Belmont, the players watched their old coach on television, as Baker mania swept Nashville like an unlikely country music hit. Rick Byrd, the longtime basketball coach, followed Baker’s story as if addicted. He did not know Baker during the time they shared at Belmont, but he still watched the Simon match while on vacation in Wyoming.“Just got broken,” Byrd wrote in an e-mail during the third set. He followed that sentence with the electronic version of a sad face.Baker’s tale had that kind of impact throughout the tennis world. Justin Gimelstob, who played against Baker before retiring and before all of Baker’s injuries, ranked the comeback among the greatest in their sport. Patrick McEnroe, general manager of development for the United States Tennis Association, noted that Baker should inspire other players because he returned despite “no help” and “did it entirely on his own.”While Baker won his first Slam match since before President Obama came into office, Federer was at the opposite end of the spectrum. He set another record, which seems to happen every other week now. When he defeated Adrian Ungur of Romania, 6-3, 6-2, 6-7 (6), 6-3, Federer broke a tie with Jimmy Connors for most career wins at major tournaments in the Open era, which began in 1968.The numbers, as usual, are staggering. Federer has won 16 Grand Slam titles, and his record in major tournaments is 234-35, an 87 percent victory clip. And he is only 30 years old.Since Federer lost to Djokovic in the semifinals of the United States Open in September, he has won at a higher rate than any other men’s player. He went undefeated in tour play in 2011 after the Open loss, and this year, he won at Rotterdam; Dubai; Indian Wells, Calif.; and Madrid. He briefly held the No. 2 ranking.Now ranked third, Federer has played his way back into contention for the top overall slot held by Djokovic. This is more important than it seems, if only because Federer could tie Pete Sampras for the most weeks spent at No. 1 (286).The question that has lingered throughout the early parts of this season is whether Federer can win another major tournament, what with Djokovic and Rafael Nadal standing in his way. That question remains to be answered, here and at Wimbledon and this summer in New York.Along the way, Federer said, he hopes to practice with or play against Baker, to see this story up close. In their own way, both have proved this year that they belong — Baker in professional tennis, Federer with his sport’s elite even near the end of his career.“I’ll be able to look back and say I played on center court at the French Open,” Baker said. “I hope I don’t remember what happened in the fifth.”1126 2012-05-31 At St. Regis, Mr. James has worked with Laboratoire Remède, a French skin care brand owned by Bliss that was first stocked in the hotel chain’s spas. The products began appearing in rooms in 2007, and today include a shower gel available only there. Mr. James recommends that hotels prize “scarcity of the brand” when sourcing toiletries.Thanks to partnerships with the Mandarin Oriental and JW Marriott, Aromatherapy Associates, a London-based beauty company founded by Geraldine Howard in 1985, is a lot less scarce. Originally, the line was focused on overall well being, but Ms. Howard has worked with JW Marriott on a custom in-room line that includes lavender, rosemary and almond oil, which she believes enhances relaxation.“People lead such busy lives now,” said Ms. Howard, whose frequent-flier schedule includes shuttling between the company’s satellite offices in Hong Kong and Frisco, Tex. “Aromatherapy products are popular because they work psychologically.”Drew Dasent and Daniel Peddle, who together cast runway shows for Givenchy and Phillip Lim and chart more than 150,000 air miles each year, prefer hotels with organic skin care products. Mr. Dasent likes the Breakers in Palm Beach, Fla., because it uses Tammy Fender products, and Mr. Peddle is thrilled that the Chewton Glen in Hampshire, England, carries his favorite, REN.Some in the hospitality industry, like Soho House, have decided to go further than offering exclusive products by starting an in-house beauty line, which then can be sold elsewhere. Soho’s Cowshed, named for the old cattle quarters at the company’s Babington House location where spa treatments were first performed, has stand-alone spas and distributes to department stores like Harrods. Christina Russillo, the director of Cowshed, said there are plans for expansion, including a separate spa and cafe in New York City this year.Ms. Russillo said that Cowshed began partly to differentiate the Soho House (many hotels in the same category use the popular Molton Brown amenities) and partly for quality control. Many hotel lotions are made by different manufacturers, for quantity and distribution reasons, than the same brand you might find at a beauty counter.“Yes, quality is an issue,” Mr. James said. “Formulas often have to be changed because of the stability of the ingredients and cost. When we first started, we had a lot of ancillary products and that is where you have to make compromises.”Mr. James said this is why he now sticks to the basics: shower gel, shampoo, conditioner and hand soap. “It’s a decision the hotels make, if they want to water down the product,” he said. “If you’re talking about the $100 face cream, then yes, there are probably changes to the formula.”Still, because “travel is a massive marketing opportunity for beauty brands,” as Ms. Russillo said, some entrepreneurs are going beyond suds and lotions.In March 2011, Uslu Airlines, a cosmetics company that was founded in 2003, introduced a nail polish collaboration with Hôtel Costes in Paris. That was followed by another custom nail color for Ace Hotel’s New York location this February. The colors derive from corporate brand identity: oxblood red for the house hue at Costes and a greenish gunmetal gray to match the painted walls at Ace.Each polish is available through the hotel store or in-room minibar for $19 at Ace, 19 euros at Hôtel Costes.Next on the horizon: lipstick. Uslu is working on a tube for Costes, while Virgin Atlantic airlines recently introduced Upper Class Red, a cherry lip color collaboration with bareMinerals cosmetics sold at Virgin’s airport spas.Jan Mihm, a founder of Uslu, believes such products convey subtle but lasting messages. “You can, by wearing the Ace nail polish, even a year after you’ve been to New York City, say that you have actually been there,” he said. “It’s a more discreet, insider way of wearing the ‘I Heart NY’ T-shirt.”1127 2012-05-31 Could exercise actually be bad for some healthy people?
