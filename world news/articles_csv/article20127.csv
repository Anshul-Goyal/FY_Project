"'12-07-01,'0','The possible return of the PRI shows the disenchantment many Mexicans feel toward the post-PRI leadership. The explosion of drug-related violence over the past few years is high on the list of concerns, of course, for Mexicans and American policy makers, who say they expect to work closely with the next president to strengthen justice institutions and reduce crime. But voters are equally or more focused on the economy.It has performed unevenly. Although the currency and debt crises of the 1980s and ’90s have given way to fiscal stability and steady growth, which reached almost 4 percent last year, many areas of Mexico — including working-class cities like this one — have yet to experience reliable prosperity.“There has been a deterioration in the quality of employment,” said Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at the Colegio de México. “We have a dynamic where we have a modern sector that is experiencing a bonanza and other sectors that are much less dynamic.”Mexico — after nearly 20 years of expanded free trade and minimal economic reform at home — has essentially become a country of the stuck-in-place glaring at the upwardly mobile. While a minority of educated, skilled workers benefit from the dynamics of global trade, many more Mexicans work long hours, often at several jobs, without progressing. Census figures show that 57 percent of the Mexican labor force earns less than $13.50 — not in an hour, but in a day.Not surprisingly, all three major candidates have made jobs the cornerstone of their campaigns even as they offer similar vague proposals for increasing growth by breaking up monopolies, and by making the oil sector and the tax system more efficient.Here in Ciudad Nezahualcóyotl, often called just Neza or Neza York, the sales pitch of the front-runner, Enrique Peña Nieto of the PRI, has been especially visible, and not just on Televisa, the network accused of gracing him with continuous favorable coverage. His billboards outnumber all others, with the largest featuring photos of middle-class families and the word “ganando,” which means “winning” but also “gaining” or “earning.” Other signs for his party, which had a mixed economic record in office, include the phrase “for a successful Mexico.”PRI officials say they are confident that the message will resonate, in part because of frustration with Mr. Fox and his successor, President Felipe Calderón, who campaigned in 2006 on a promise to be “the president of employment.”Indeed, even as Mr. Calderón boasted last week of having created 1.7 million jobs, people here in Neza and across Mexico said there was an obvious answer to the question of whether life is better now than 12 years ago: no.“Everything is worse,” said Esmeralda Armenta, 26, shaking her head with scorn on a quiet side street here. “Our business is worse, and security has gotten worse as well.”She said her family’s cart, which sells shoes from a nearby corner, is lucky to dispense with five pairs a week, down from 30 in the 1990s. Others in the informal economy — which accounts for a third or more of national employment — offered similar tales of a decline that accelerated with the 2009 recession, when Mexico’s economy contracted by 6.1 percent.These workers tend to be among Mexico’s most dogged and frustrated. They are people like Jorge Hernández, 35, who sells pastries downtown from a white 1986 Volkswagen van.On Wednesday, he was busy shooing away flies, while waiting for what has become a trickle of customers. He works sunup to sundown, and a good day a few years ago brought in around 600 pesos, or about $45. Now, he said, his take is down to about 400 pesos, or about $30, and his expenses are increasing. The price of sugar is up by nearly a third and gas prices are higher, too.Mr. Hernández has responded by taking on extra work on weekends and by delivering to maintain his customer base. But he said his income was hardly enough to support his family.He said he was hoping the next president would improve his fortunes. He was thinking of voting for Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the candidate of the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, who has played up his programs for the poor. But in what polls suggest may be a common trend, Mr. Hernández said he was also considering casting his lot with Mr. Peña Nieto and the PRI. “Everyone says that when they were in power, they were always stealing,” he said. “But there were also more opportunities.”Older voters here in Mexico State, where Mr. Peña Nieto served as governor until starting his presidential campaign, tend to be even more conflicted. Mr. García, 53, said he feared that if the PRI returned to power, it would mean more help for the rich and connected. He said that he and other small-business owners were already feeling squeezed.Part of the problem, he said, is that Mexico opened its markets to cheap imports — with the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals — without doing enough to help its own small businesses compete or innovate.The crime wave of the past few years has only exacerbated the problem, he added. Extortionists tend to prefer small businesses over large companies because family-run operations are more likely to pay. In Mr. García’s case, the demands for money began in 2010. Without enumerating the cost, he said he paid for a year. He was robbed four times. His family endured repeated threats. Then he retreated, closing his two retail stores in Neza and shrinking his business to just family members.“It affected us economically, mentally and physically,” he said. “It really damaged us.”Many other small-business owners have responded in the same way. Mr. García said he knew of 30 to 40 small businesses in Neza, mostly textile companies, that had closed or disappeared over the past two years. “We’re all afraid to do better because we are afraid of what comes with it,” he said.It would take a lot, he added, for whoever wins the presidency to turn that paralysis around. Mr. García was undecided about his own vote. He had ruled out the National Action Party’s candidate, Josefina Vázquez Mota, but also expressed concerns about the PRI (“Crime got worse when they were in power here”) and Mr. López Obrador of the Party of the Democratic Revolution (“He seems too radical”).Standing in his empty workroom, with slacks hanging on racks under flickering fluorescent lights, Mr. García said he missed the years when politics held more hope, when he had a dozen full-time employees buzzing around him. Now, he said, he lives on the second floor of his three-story business and rents out the third.“It’s just me, my wife and my sister-in-law who work here full time,” he said, looking toward his wife beside him. “It’s just us.”'"
"'12-07-01,'0','Immigrants are known as entrepreneurial people, for obvious reasons: those with the ambition and energy to uproot themselves and build new lives in a distant land are well equipped to build businesses and the economy, too. That is the common wisdom, anyway, which a new study from the Fiscal Policy Institute strikingly confirms. The study, based on census data, looks at owners of small businesses across the country and paints a broad and detailed picture of immigrant entrepreneurship.The study found that there were 900,000 immigrants among small-business owners in the United States, about 18 percent of the total. This percentage is higher than the immigrant share of the overall population, which is 13 percent, and the immigrant share of the labor force, at 16 percent. Small businesses in which half or more of the owners were immigrants employed 4.7 million people in 2007, the latest year for which data were available, generating $776 billion in receipts. They accounted for 30 percent of the growth in small businesses — those with fewer than 100 employees — between 1990 and 2010.Immigrant entrepreneurs are concentrated in professional and business services, retail, construction, educational and social services, and leisure and hospitality. They own restaurants, doctor’s offices, real-estate firms, groceries and truck-transportation services. More of them come from Mexico than any other country, followed by Indians, Koreans, Cubans, Chinese and Vietnamese. California has the highest percentage of immigrants among small-business owners at 33 percent, followed by New York (29 percent), New Jersey (28 percent), Florida (26 percent) and Hawaii (23 percent).The study did not look at immigrants’ legal status, but because it covered only incorporated firms, not off-the-books operations, it presumably included few, if any, business owners without papers.By rousingly affirming the centrality of immigration in the American economy, the study exposes a fault line running through the Republican Party, which mythologizes small-business owners while treating immigrants with hostility bordering on fury. There is no shortage of conservative business owners who celebrate the immigrant contribution to America — Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Rupert Murdoch are two — but Republican leaders, including the party standard-bearer, Mitt Romney, have allied themselves with extremist efforts to limit immigration and hound and harass millions of unauthorized immigrants out of the country.In G.O.P. strongholds like Arizona — and Alabama, home to sleepy small towns where Latino-owned bodegas and laundries are among the only signs of economic life downtown — anti-immigrant policies are threating to strangle economic growth. If Republicans started believing their own rhetoric about small-business owners, they would see immigration not as a sea of troubles but as a deep well of capitalist energy, waiting to be fully tapped.'"
"'12-07-01,'0','“IT is not our job,” Jr. wrote in Thursday’s health care ruling, “to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.” He might just as easily have written, “to protect politicians from the consequences of their political choices.” And now, with the parenthesis out of the way, we can get back to finding out exactly what those consequences will be.For , the consequences of health care may still be fatal to his re-election hopes. The choice to go all-in on reform was the most important call of the Obama presidency, and from a purely political perspective it has proved the most disastrous one. Thursday’s decision won’t change this reality: Victory at the Supreme Court was obviously preferable to defeat, but the chief justice’s grudging imprimatur is unlikely to make a deeply unpopular piece of legislation suddenly popular instead.Liberals have persuaded themselves that this unpopularity is largely the product of conservative misinformation and voter ignorance. But it’s really a result of the gulf that opened in 2009 between the public’s priorities and the president’s agenda. By turning from economic crisis management to sweeping social legislation before the crisis had actually abated, Obama made himself look more ideological than practical and more liberal than pragmatic. By continuing to push for the largest possible bill even after the public backlash had elected a Republican senator in , he made himself look wildly out of touch as well.This was not a mistake the icons of the liberal past made. Franklin Delano Roosevelt spent two years defining himself as a Depression-fighter before he set out to establish ; pushed through the Great Society amid an economic boom.Had Obama followed Roosevelt’s first-term example, the initial stimulus bill might have been broken up into smaller (and perhaps more popular) components, financial reform and perhaps reform would have preceded , and the kinds of jobs bills the White House demanded of a recalcitrant Republican Congress in 2011 might have been sought from a Democratic Congress in 2009 and 2010 instead. Even if this policy approach didn’t dramatically accelerate the recovery, it would have given independent voters more confidence that the president had their economic interests rather than his history-making ambitions uppermost in mind.But the Obama White House was convinced that it could fight the and rewrite the social compact all at once. And when the administration’s economic policies didn’t deliver as promised, it was almost inevitable that the focus on health care would cost Obama approval ratings, cost his party House seats — and perhaps help cost him a second term as well.'"
"'12-07-01,'0','Ms. Dunlop had an illegal abortion as a young woman in England, an experience that fueled her campaign to improve women’s reproductive choices, she said. She was also angry at the rise of the anti-abortion movement in the United States, which she perceived as “an organizing tool” for conservatives promoting their broader political agenda.“It’s about getting people onto the street,” she said in a 2004 oral history. “It’s getting political activism for a much broader purpose.”She often directly attacked the Vatican and conservative politicians, including President Ronald Reagan, on the abortion issue.“To give the unborn child — I don’t care what stage of gestation they are — preference over the woman in whom parents, teachers, society, culture has deeply invested, and say that investment has less value than a bunch of cells, is just to me an outrage,” she said in the oral history, created by Smith College.Joan Marie Banks was born in London on May 20, 1934, and grew up in a London suburb that she described as “Stockbroker Tudor.” Her father was deputy chairman of British Petroleum, her mother an American. On a visit to her American relatives when she was 12, she fell in love with America. Several years later, she applied to Vassar College and was accepted, but her parents refused to let her go, fearing they would never see her in England again.Remaining in Britain, she graduated from Queens Secretarial College in London. After working at the BBC and in other jobs, she went to the United States and became a secretary at a Manhattan advertising agency. Through family connections, she was hired by the Ford Foundation, where she worked on urban policy projects that became a blueprint for the Johnson administration’s War on Poverty.She went on to work in the New York City budget office under Mayor John V. Lindsay and the Fund for the City of New York foundation and as an adviser to John D. Rockefeller III on population issues, drawing on her Ford Foundation work. At her employment interview, she told Mr. Rockefeller about her own abortion.“He listened with great attentiveness,” she told The Times in 1998. “I sometimes wonder if that wasn’t what got me the job.”The job was with the Population Council, which Mr. Rockefeller founded in 1952 to provide governments with scientific research on population questions. Ms. Dunlop helped broaden its research to include gender roles and sexuality, and she introduced Mr. Rockefeller to feminist leaders, including Germaine Greer and Gloria Steinem.Ms. Dunlop was later vice president of public affairs for Planned Parenthood in New York and an assistant to Vartan Gregorian, president of the New York Public Library.Ms. Dunlop’s marriages to Peter Dunlop and Edward Deagle ended in divorce. She once said she was never “faintly interested” in having children. In addition to her sister, she is survived by her brother, Peter Banks.On her last day of work at the International Women’s Health Coalition in 1998, Ms. Dunlop was presented with a volume of letters from women around the world describing what she had done for them.“It’s almost better than an obituary,” Ms. Dunlop said on the occasion, “because you’re not dead.”'"
"'12-07-01,'0','Mr. Kaufman pointed out that a couple of major forces were roiling the global bond markets.“One is clearly Europe,” he said. As fears surrounding Europe’s debt crisis have grown, money has been racing out of the region and pouring into comparatively safe Treasuries, where yields on 10-year notes have sunk to just 1.65 percent from 2.38 percent in mid-March.“The other is oil,” Mr. Kaufman said. While falling energy prices are typically good for the economy, many market strategists see today’s rapidly slumping oil prices as a sign of how sluggish the global economy has become, raising questions about the safety of sovereign debt.Chris Vincent, head of the fixed-income group at the asset management firm William Blair, said it was likely that this volatility would persist for some time, as the world slowly worked its way through a classic debt deflation cycle.To be sure, not all parts of the fixed-income market appear as risky as Treasuries and foreign debt.Robert V. Gahagan, a senior portfolio manager for American Century Investments, said that a diversified core bond portfolio that tracks the Barclays aggregate bond index is likely to be split among Treasuries, mortgage-backed and government agency debt, and investment-grade corporate bonds. And he points out that high-grade corporate and government agency bonds have performed reasonably well recently while being relatively stable.According to Morningstar, for instance, mortgage and agency bond funds have a standard deviation — a gauge of volatility — of 2.3 over the last three years. By comparison, the average standard deviation is 3.7 for intermediate- and long-term corporate bond funds and 9.7 for Treasuries.“That’s the virtue of a multisector portfolio,” Mr. Gahagan said.Money managers and market strategists point to the relative health of the private sector — companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index are sitting on record amounts of cash and enjoying record profits — as a reason to overweight exposure to investment-grade and high-yield corporate bonds.Mr. Vincent, for example, currently keeps only around 9 percent of his William Blair Bond fund in Treasury securities, while around 40 percent is in investment-grade corporates and 10 percent in high-yield bonds.Kathy A. Jones, fixed-income strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, agreed that there’s a case to be made for keeping a small part of a diversified bond portfolio in high-yield debt. But she said individual investors should probably hold no more than 20 percent of their fixed-income stake in “aggressive” areas of the bond market, including high-yield and emerging-market debt.Besides diversifying into corporate debt, individuals can make a few other moves to reduce volatility in fixed-income portfolios, she said. For starters, “the easiest thing to do is to shorten your durations,” she said, referring to the maturities of securities. Shorter-dated securities are far less volatile than long-term bonds in periods when interest rates move sharply.For fixed-income investors who are making bets overseas, one idea is to use a hedged fund rather than an unhedged one. International bond funds have to sell dollars to buy foreign currencies to purchase overseas debt, but a hedged portfolio will simultaneously buy the same amount of dollars to even out the currency exposure.A 2011 study by the Vanguard Group showed that currency fluctuations, not market moves, account for a vast majority of the overall volatility in foreign bonds. This has become evident since last fall as the dollar has gained about 10 percent against a basket of global currencies.CONSIDER the recent performance of the Pimco Foreign Bond fund. The unhedged version of this fixed-income fund has a standard deviation of 9.4, which is more than twice as volatile as the hedged version. Thanks to the dollar’s strength, the hedged version has delivered total returns of 8.1 percent over the last 12 months, versus just 3.1 percent for the unhedged version.Of course, “the trade-off is that you’ll miss some of the pop when the dollar goes back down,” Ms. Jones said.But for an investor who is looking for stability in volatile times, that may be worth it.'"
"'12-07-01,'0','“I don’t think it’s a coincidence that players who play with tight skills, using the sole of their foot, play tiki-taka, all had futsal as their foundation, just like urban New York City basketball players, or hockey played on small ponds in Canada.”Several years ago, a Nike promotional campaign used footage of Ronaldinho, the Brazilian star, playing futsal as a youngster. It is easy to see where his technique and improvisational skills came from.In Guatemala City for qualifying games at the Domo Polideportivo, the United States team is in Group A, playing Panama on Monday, the host team on Tuesday and Canada on Wednesday. The two top teams in each of the two first-round groups advance to the semifinals, and all four semifinalists earn berths to play in Bangkok in November.“The only way to look at the tournament is to go in and win gold,” said Keith Tozer, who has taken the United States to three World Cups since becoming the team’s coach in 1996.He added: “In the ’80s and ’90s, indoor soccer was booming and the top Americans were playing indoors. We had 20 teams in the Major Indoor Soccer League, playing a 10-month season. We were considered the top of the world in the game. Now, there are professional leagues all over the world, and guys are playing all year long. We don’t have anything like that. The indoor league is smaller, and M.L.S. has all the top American players.“A year ago when I was in Madrid for a conference, the president of Spanish football said the reason they won the World Cup is because in Spain, futsal is part of the program. It’s also ingrained in Brazil. It has to be part of development here for us, too.”To many people, the notable strides the United States teams have made in soccer over the past 20 years — playing in every outdoor World Cup since 1990 — are somehow unsatisfying. For all the top American goalkeepers and defenders now playing in Europe, the United States has failed to produce highly skillful and technical players capable of taking on opponents one on one while playing the ball on the ground.Most of the indoor soccer American youngsters play uses a full-size ball that bounces off the walls. The game looks more like kickball.In futsal, balls that squirt over the sideline are put back into play with a kick-in. The game is about control.Teaneck Armory in northern New Jersey, among other spots around the country, is configured for futsal games. But changes are coming slowly.The youngest player on Tozer’s World Cup squad is Lucas Stauffer, 17, who grew up playing the game in Owensboro, Ky., in a building built and operated by his father, Ty, who played basketball and soccer at Kentucky Wesleyan.Lucas Stauffer basically made the team as a walk-on. He was looking at the U.S. Soccer Web site for information on the under-17 national team and came across news about an open tryout for the national futsal team. He impressed Tozer, was called back to camp and traveled with the team last September to Brazil, where “it was easily my best soccer experience so far; it was eye-opening.”“My dad wanted to find a different way to train younger kids to get comfortable on the ball,” said Stauffer, who recently completed his junior year at Shattuck-St. Mary’s School in Faribault, Minn. “I like the game, I like the shorter space, and it’s more of a quick, faster-paced game than outdoors. It forces you to be technically perfect and just forces you to use all your skills. Sometimes, you can get away with doing questionable things outdoors, but some guys who can play outdoors can’t play futsal. But guys who can play futsal can always play outdoors.”Though futsal will probably always be the poor relation to outdoor soccer in the United States, fans here will continue to ask where and when we will produce our Lionel Messi. How did the great players of today become great players? Probably by playing futsal.In a country with some of the best goalkeepers in the world (like Tim Howard), stalwart defenders (like Steve Cherundolo), hard-working midfielders (like Michael Bradley) and forwards who are getting better (like Jozy Altidore), how does the United States find a player who can create outside the box when tactics go out the window? Maybe he is out there now, playing the free-flowing game of futsal.'"
"'12-07-01,'0','By the summer of 2009, Speedo’s competitors had flooded the marketplace with suits bonded by polyurethane that made swimmers so buoyant, there was no drag in their run on the record books. The technology suits, as coaches called them, were outlawed in the beginning of 2010, but not before 43 world records had been broken in 40 events at the world championships in Rome.One of the record-setters in Italy was Ariana Kukors, who shattered the American mark and lowered the Australian Stephanie Rice’s year-old world record in the 200-meter individual medley. Kukors’s time, 2 minutes 06.15 seconds, was a four-second improvement over her personal best going into the meet and five seconds faster than her clocking Thursday, when she earned a berth to the London Games with a second-place finish at the trials.Only in the wake of the high-tech swimsuits’ era could someone swim five seconds slower than her best time and cry tears of joy over making her first Olympic team.Kukors, 23, acknowledged that the suits were “a huge advantage for me” before they were banned and said: “I really do think the suits helped my underwater swimming significantly. No matter how long I stay underwater now, I don’t think it’s the same.”So how does she view her world record? “I view it as a large goal,” Kukors said.In 2009, Eric Shanteau broke American records in the 100 and the 200 breaststroke. His record in the 100 is 58.96. He finished second to Brendan Hansen at these trials in 1:00.15, which he described as his “best time.” When pressed, he said, “It’s easier than saying my best time not in one of the high-tech suits.”Frank Busch, the national team director for USA Swimming, said: “The suits were a huge, huge advantage, and I think there were some athletes who depended on those suits to go fast. Depending on your body type, if you benefited from a buoyancy factor, that’s like being able to throw a fastball five miles faster. It’s like, ‘Wow, where did that velocity come from?’ ”He added, “But I think that’s now two years, three years removed, so I don’t think those are the athletes we’re dealing with right now.”The high-tech suits buoyed swimmers who did not even own them. The next generation is taking aim at the records posted by swimmers in that era but with none of the psychological baggage from wearing them.First-time Olympians like the teenagers Franklin and Rachel Bootsma and 23-year-old Conor Dwyer are focused on the records and not on the swimsuits that made those records possible. One reason coaches cited for the unusually large number of entrants — more than 1,800 — is the height of the qualifying bar set, in part, by the high-tech suits.“It became a bit of a guessing game what the influence of the technology suits was,” Busch said, “and we had a lot of kids rise to the challenge of making the standards.”They tend to sound a lot like the 17-year-old Franklin, who had a song in her voice when she said, “You never know when the best time is going to happen, so you have to give it your all, all the time.”Franklin, perhaps not surprisingly, was one of the three swimmers to break an American record in the first five days of the eight-day competition. Her winning time in the 100 backstroke, 58.85, was nine-hundredths of a second better than Natalie Coughlin’s four-year-old mark. The world record, set in 2009 by Britain’s Gemma Spofforth, is 58.12.The women’s 100-meter butterfly record, 56.05, is considered out of reach by, among others, Sarah Sjoestroem, who established it at the 2009 world championships. The best time by a swimmer not wearing a high-tech suit is Dana Vollmer’s American record, 56.42, in the semifinals here. (She made the Olympic team in the final with a 56.50.)“I’ve always wanted to get an individual world record,” Vollmer said. “I know I can go faster than anybody’s been.”That is music to the ears of coaches like Troy, who said: “The record flurry was fake. This is real.”He added: “I personally like the situation that everyone doesn’t break records all the time because it makes the ones you do break special, and they’re supposed to be special. That’s why they’re world records.”'"
"'12-07-01,'0','In addition to the state championship, three other New Jersey competitions will be sanctioned by the Kansas City Barbeque Society this year: Sam’s Club National B.B.Q. Tour, to be held at the Sam’s Club store in Pleasantville on Aug. 25; B.B.Q. and Blues in the Park, Sept. 8 and 9 in Mount Holly; and Que-by-the-Sea, Sept. 21 to 23 in Seaside Heights.At these events, which also include live music and an open-air market, various laws prevent all but a few competitors from selling their barbecue to the public, because “most cooks have not gone through the hoops — permits, sales tax license, et cetera,” according to Carolyn Wells, a co-founder and the executive director of the Kansas City Barbeque Society. The barbecue-hungry masses can, however, buy ribs and brisket from noncompeting vendors at the contests.Last year, 72,000 people attended the state championship in North Wildwood, according to Eric Shenkus, its chairman. Mr. Shenkus, 40, a criminal defense lawyer from Northfield, co-founded the event in 1999 as a way to raise money for the Anglesea Volunteer Fire Company, of which he is a member. (The event, which is free to the public, is run by the company, part of the North Wildwood Fire Department, in conjunction with the Anglesea Blues Festival.)“Our first year we probably had 500 people,” Mr. Shenkus said. Now the competition is so popular that organizers run a lottery to determine which teams will be allowed to enter. This year, 150 teams from throughout the East Coast applied to fill 68 spots, with 46 New Jersey teams making the cut. Winners — in categories including chicken, pulled pork, brisket and ribs, as well as Grand Champion — are decided based on taste, tenderness and appearance by 100 judges certified by the society. Cash prizes totaling $10,000 are awarded.The Grand Champion qualifies to compete in national championships like the American Royal World Series of Barbecue, to be held in Kansas City in October.Compared with the state championship, the Rock, Ribs and Ridges contest in Vernon, in which four teams competed — three from New Jersey and one from New York — was a low-key event. Ticketholders, many of whom were there mainly for the rock concerts by acts including Dickey Betts and Molly Hatchet, cast ballots to judge the barbecue competitors. Mr. Reid’s team came in third and took home $200, an admittedly disappointing outcome, he said.He entered the event mostly as practice for the state championship in North Wildwood, he said. Though he has not won a prize there in three previous tries, he is optimistic about his chances this year. “I have a game plan,” he said.Competitive barbecue teams — sometimes restaurateurs and caterers like Mr. Reid, sometimes backyard barbecue enthusiasts, sometimes old college buddies looking for an excuse to get together on the weekends, Mr. Shenkus said — liken their pastime to a sport.“The American Royal is the Super Bowl of competitive barbecue,” said Mr. Shenkus. The Jack Daniel’s World Championship Invitational Barbecue, held in October in Lynchburg, Tenn., and open to only those teams that have won a championship in certain categories, is “the Super Bowl, World Series and Stanley Cup all in one,” according to Marc Mangano, one of two pit masters for Three Men and a Baby Back, a Montvale-based team that formed in 2009. It will compete in the state championship for a second time this year and has already earned a spot at this year’s American Royal Invitational; that is the more exclusive of the two prongs of the American Royal contest in Kansas City, the other being the American Royal Open.Three Men and a Baby Back qualified for the American Royal Invitational after winning the Grand Champion title at last year’s Que-by-the-Sea event in Seaside Heights. Mr. Mangano, 39, of Hillsdale, who studied at the Culinary Institute of America but currently works as an insurance broker, said his team had its eye on a prize in North Wildwood this year.“We were maybe a little cocky our first time there — we were coming off a big win” at a 2009 competition in Rochester, N.Y., Mr. Mangano said. “Wildwood was our second contest ever.”What the three-year-old team learned, said Dana Reed, 39, of Montvale, the other pit master and a nurse practitioner, was that “we needed to fine-tune our recipes.”“There were some really exceptional teams; it was humbling.” Now, he said, “we expect to do well.”Experience may be half the battle, according to Doug Keiles, the pit master of Hillsborough-based Ribs Within.During his first competition in 2003, which happened to be the state championship — it was easier to get into then — “I stayed up all night with the other cooks, learning about pork and brisket,” he said. Instead of smoking his own pork and brisket that year, Mr. Keiles, 48, cooked only ribs and chicken. “Then I went home and bought another smoker and practiced all year.”By 2007, Mr. Keiles and his team were winning; they placed eighth that year in chicken and fifth in pork. He has since had top-10 showings in several individual categories, and last year won 10th overall. This year marks his team’s 10th consecutive year at the contest.Mr. Keiles runs Ribs Within as a catering business when he is not competing, and also has a day job making maps and tracking delivery data for newspapers.He concedes that New Jersey still flies slightly under the radar on the national barbecue circuit. “People will say, What do Northeasterners know about barbecue? They think we’re not truly steeped in the traditions,” he said. “But it’s just not the truth.”Every year, teams from the Northeast rank among the top in the country, he said, something Ms. Wells, of the Kansas City Barbecue Society, confirmed.Some of those same teams can be counted on to show up behind pits in North Wildwood.“I have to face these guys that are ridiculously strong,” Mr. Keiles said. “It’s nothing but pressure.”'"
"'12-07-01,'0','JUST as actors traditionally portray King Lear later in their careers, pianists usually wait to record Beethoven’s complete piano sonatas. Offering the 32 works at 24 is a bold move, but the Korean pianist H J Lim, who performed the complete cycle in Paris in 2010, felt ready. She demonstrates her mettle with a set of distinctive, passionate interpretations, which landed at No. 1 on Billboard’s classical chart shortly after EMI Classics released them on iTunes in May.A charismatic performer and engaging speaker, Ms. Lim, who wrote her own in-depth and intellectually probing liner notes, recently made her American debut at Le Poisson Rouge.She moved from South Korea to France alone at the age of 12 to study and received degrees from conservatories in Rouen and Paris. When recital videos of hers were posted to YouTube — including a 2009 performance in Basel, Switzerland, of Rachmaninoff’s complete Études-Tableaux and Chopin’s complete Études — she attracted over a million viewers.During a recent Skype interview from her home in Switzerland, Ms. Lim spoke with Vivien Schweitzer about her obsession with Beethoven and the importance of following one’s passion. These are excerpts from the conversation.Q. What would you say to those who believe you should have waited to record the complete sonatas?A. I don’t take life for granted, and I don’t know if I will be alive in five years. As far as I know no composer wrote on their score, “Forbidden to those under age 18.” When you feel so passionate about something, there is no point to wait. I don’t even know if I will be so obsessed by another composer again in my life. When I was 13 years old, I fell in love with the Liszt B minor sonata, but my teacher told me I was too young to study it. But I couldn’t live, couldn’t eat, couldn’t sleep without playing it. So I had a double life.Q. Do you think you might rerecord the Beethoven sonatas at some point?A. I would like to renew them in concert and recordings every 10 years, if I am lucky enough to live a long life. But I think the most important thing in art is not age but to know how far you are ready to jump into the universe of the composer and how much of your life you are ready to sacrifice.'"
"'12-07-01,'0','Rents for the three-bedrooms, which will be on the corners with views of Broadway, are expected to be $90 a square foot, Mr. Scaglion said, and one-bedrooms, which will average 700 square feet, could cost around $80 a square foot. That comes out to around $13,000 and $4,750 per month, respectively. (Twenty percent of the units will be offered below market rents for qualifying tenants.)The average rent in May for a one-bedroom on the Upper West Side was $3,471 a month, or about $60 a square foot, according to MNS, a real estate brokerage.To help justify these prices, and to compete with other buildings, the Larstrand developers are putting extra effort into the common areas. The 4,800-square-foot roof deck, for instance, will have an outdoor movie theater,  Mr. Scaglion said. The theater could be the scene of movie-night parties, he added.“The evolution of the high-end luxury building is that residents are now requiring special programming in these kinds of spaces,” said Mr. Scaglion, who also marketed and leased the Aire, at 200 West 67th Street.The L-shaped Larstrand site takes up the entire eastern side of Broadway between 77th and 78th Streets (the residential address is 227 West 77th Street). It will have 40,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor, as well as two lower levels. Also on the site are two other buildings, which will be preserved and renovated. So far, CVS has leased a 9,800-square-foot store, a company spokesman said. The two-story buildings that used to line the block were home to a diner, a pizza place and a taekwondo school, as well as the popular Asian restaurant Ruby Foo’s, which closed its location there in 2009.For Friedland, which did not respond to a request for an interview, No. 227 continues a recent push into residential development. The company, led by the brothers Lawrence and Melvin Friedland, owns more than 100 buildings on the East Coast, according to its Web site, including several in the area. But brokers said the firm had not built a major new one until the 22-story Melar went up at 250 West 93rd Street in 2007.The Melar has 143 units, ranging in size from studios to three-bedrooms, though rents, at an average of $70 a square foot, are below what No. 227 plans to charge, Mr. Scaglion said, because the Melar is north of Broadway’s liveliest shopping district.One factor working in the Larstrand’s favor is that it will come to market with little in the way of competition, since many development plans were deferred during the recession, said Andrew Barrocas, the chief executive of MNS. With limited inventory and strong demand, vacancy rates have fallen into the low single digits, so rental projects that open in the next two years are in a great position, he said. “I was blown away by what the rents ended up being for the Corner,” Mr. Barrocas said, “and I expect this building to do just as well.”'"
"'12-07-01,'0','So Keefe spent a week in Mexico City, speaking with academics who follow the drug trade and leafing through court documents. Eventually, he found a record of a 2006 trial in Arizona, at which Chapo’s right-hand man, Miguel Angel Martínez, had testified. He tracked down the court reporter, who sent him a copy of the transcript. Amazingly, it had been untouched by reporters. “People have been writing about Chapo for years and years and they’ve pored over his biography,” Keefe said. But here was a document that had never made it into the hands of a journalist or biographer. It included revelations like Chapo’s own use of cocaine and what Keefe called “trivial details,” like the fact that he had his own private zoo in Guadalajara that contained tigers and bears. “It was gobsmacking for me to get my hands on this transcript, which has been out in the world and available if you’d found it, since 2006. And to realize nobody had found it.”Bob Kerrey has my vote because his opposition is awful. But it is sad that the best my party can offer is a nearly 70-year-old man who has had nothing to do with the state since leaving office.Bob Kerrey wanders through life believing that he could have been a contendah if only the presidency were an appointed position or, perhaps, if candidates were simply required to leave their résumés on a table in the West Wing, next to the M&Ms with the presidential seal.Bob Kerrey’s view of the White House’s failures since 2008 is shared by many of Obama’s intraparty critics, and it’s the kind of thing we may hear more of from Democrats who need to get elected this year in Republican territory. More interesting (to me, at least) is the brand of populism that Matt Bai draws out in the article, which involves disdain for Washington and outrage about money-soaked partisan institutions, but not attacks on the wealthy or big business. Which makes him both a rather tamer figure than the prairie populists of yore and more of a rabble-rouser than many leading candidates in both parties in a 2012 cycle that has been surprisingly light on populist themes.Unfortunately, parents raising children of color don’t have the luxury of choosing not to address how the “horrors [of history] play out in everyday life, through a thousand subtle means, often unexpected.” For that reason, parents raising white children have a responsibility to address our racist past (and present) with our children in order to help them understand it as something we must actively work to end. This is hard work, but most of parenting is hard, and there are plenty of parents out there who are struggling to succeed.I have never understood the desire to suppress the language in “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.” Reading it as a child, I saw immediately that the language was abusive and the attitudes unfair. Clean it up, and your child will not get the full benefit of the lesson. Children are much wiser than you think. Let them have the experience and knowledge they need.SO YOU THINK YOU CAN BE A HAIR BRAIDER?From a worker’s-eye view, it continues to be the case that one of the best forms of security anyone can get against bad conditions at work is a credible right of exit. Even relatively modest licensing requirements make it very difficult to quit the job you have. After all, if you quit, you’ll have no income while you go about getting yourself licensed. But as long as you’re working, family responsibilities may make it impossible for you to go through the process.I think there are good arguments for requiring licensure in many professions. I have had to jump through bureaucratic hoops to get my license in social work, so I can see both sides of the argument. One of the big problems is interstate reciprocity. Each of our 50 states operates like its own little fief, and the licensing fees keep state-government coffers healthy. If a license in one state were recognized by the rest, those of us whose professions require a license would have a lot more freedom to move between states and change positions without having to go through the typically exhausting and expensive process every time.'"
"'12-07-01,'0','WHEN IS THE MATURING?Unlike individual homeowners, co-ops don’t usually try to pay off a mortgage, because that would mean current shareholders were paying for something that would benefit future shareholders. So a large mortgage isn’t necessarily a concern. But you should pay attention to the interest rate and maturation date.Arthur Weinstein, a real estate lawyer who serves as a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives and Condominiums, said a building’s mortgage should be evaluated in the context of economic conditions. “In a low-interest-rate economy like we’re in now,” he said, “you’d worry about a high-interest-rate mortgage that cannot be refinanced.”If a mortgage is maturing soon, there will be expenses like legal fees associated with refinancing, but monthly payments may decrease if the new mortgage has a lower interest rate.HOW MUCH IS IN THE RESERVE FUND?The one item that even number-averse shareholders tend to look at is the amount in the reserve fund, which is generally used to pay for capital expenses. The question is, how much is enough?“To analyze the adequacy of the reserve fund,” Mr. Weinstein said, “you have to do a little bit of due diligence with respect to the condition of the building.” If the building hasn’t upgraded its heating system to use a less polluting type of oil, as required by city law, that’s a major upcoming expense; so is doing facade work to comply with local regulations.Some buildings rely on a line of instead of a large reserve fund to cover unanticipated expenses, Mr. Weinstein said. Another variable, for buildings that have recently refinanced, is whether some of the proceeds were used to beef up the reserve account.“You cannot say that a building should have a reserve fund of $25,000 per unit,” he explained. “It’s a complex cross-analysis of each of these pieces of a large puzzle.”Real estate lawyers say one of the most important sections of a financial statement is the footnotes, which detail, for instance, any litigation involving the building. “Are they paying a lot of money to lawyers, and if so why?” said Eva Talel, a partner in the real estate group of the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan. “The footnotes would be helpful in giving some explanation about that.”The footnotes might also reveal whether the building had a tax abatement on the verge of expiring, which would mean the monthly maintenance fee was likely to increase, or whether the co-op leases rather than owns the land on which the building sits. This is also where you’ll find details about the mortgage and any approved assessments, as well as comments about major repairs that have been undertaken or might become necessary.HAVE THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BEEN AUDITED?Financial statements are typically prepared by independent accountants, who should note whether their audit meets “generally accepted accounting principles,” an industry standard known by the acronym GAAP. “If it’s not in accord with GAAP,” Ms. Talel said, “then it’s not an audited financial. It just means that different criteria have been applied by the auditors.”She says that smaller co-ops in often use unaudited financial statements because they cost less to prepare, but that doing so would be unusual for a larger building. One difference is that GAAP standards require cost estimates for anticipated major repairs. “That’s where audited financials give you more information, because they’re required by internal rules to do that,” Ms. Talel said.The co-op’s treasurer or the accountants usually attend the annual meeting, giving shareholders a chance to ask questions about what they’ve found in the financial statements. “If you’re finding stuff that you think is egregious,” Ms. Talel said, “it’s also your opportunity to say to your fellow shareholders, ‘We’d better get some people on the board who can run a tighter ship.’ ”'"
"'12-07-01,'0','Still, tighter lending standards precipitated by the mortgage crisis have made for an arduous application process.Andrew Latos, a real estate lawyer in Astoria, Queens, who has represented clients in transactions with big banks and who worked with a broker to service his own home loan, says he charges more for closings these days, because “a two-hour closing can quickly become a five- or six-hour closing.”Mortgage brokers, for their part, are reporting an increase in business from those looking to streamline the entire process.“We have direct contact with the banks, so we always know what’s going on with your file,” said Vanessa Thatcher, a senior loan officer with Atlantic Home Capital in Ronkonkoma, N.Y., explaining that a broker can keep track of the application as it “goes through so many hands” at a large financial institution. Ms. Thatcher charges a fee of 1 to 2 percent of the total loan amount.Brokers can also act as financial consultants. “A good percentage of the people who call me to refinance, I tell them not to,” said Mark Yecies, the president of SunQuest Funding in Cranford, N.J. He recalled a borrower who recently came to see him after being told he was a prime candidate for a refinance. Mr. Yecies ran the numbers and found that a refinance didn’t make sense, because the majority of the borrower’s payment was principal.Borrowers might also want to consider refinancing with a community bank. New York Community Bank, for example, does not service HARP-eligible borrowers and is able to respond faster to non-HARP refinance requests, said Stephen Trayte, a senior vice president and director of residential credit for the NYCB Mortgage Company, a subsidiary of New York Community Bank.But even his bank has been experiencing delays because of higher volume. He recommended that borrowers lock in a rate.“Normally, we do the whole transaction in less than 30 days,” said Mr. Trayte, estimating that the average time has reached 45 days. “There is about a 50 percent delay just because of the volume of activity, and that’s without having HARP transactions.”To handle increased demand, big banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase have been adding staff members and underwriting centers.Wells Fargo recorded a 31 percent jump in HARP volume after implementing HARP 2.0, said Vickee J. Adams, a spokeswoman. She estimates that it takes 90 days to complete a refinance.Borrowers will have a better chance of moving through the process in less time, she said, if they “follow the necessary steps to complete their applications and submit supporting documents in a timely fashion.”'"

"'12-07-02,'0','HONG KONG — A Chinese provincial court said on Monday that Apple had settled a lawsuit there by agreeing to pay $60 million for the legal rights to use the iPad trademark in China, according to Xie Xianghui, a lawyer for the Chinese company involved.“It was done last week and it was confirmed with a ruling by the higher court,” which was issued on Monday morning, said Mr. Xie, a lawyer at the Grandall Legal Group in Shenzhen, China, which represented Shenzhen Proview Technology.It should take only a week or two for China’s national trademark authority to transfer the iPad trademark for China to Apple, Mr. Xie added.Mr. Xie said that Proview Technology did not regard the settlement amount as especially large, “but it is O.K.”Apple had been in settlement negotiations this spring with the Chinese subsidiary of Proview Technology of Taiwan in the long-running trademark dispute. Apple did not immediately respond on Monday morning to requests for comment.According to testimony in the legal fight, Apple retained British lawyers several years ago to set up a company, IP Application Development, to buy up rights to the iPad name around the world. Apple paid only £35,000 to Proview Technology for the Taiwanese company’s iPad trademarks in various countries.But when Apple introduced the iPad with immediate success, Proview Technology said that the transaction had not included the trademark for China, which was held by Shenzhen Proview Technology, its mainland Chinese subsidiary. The Shenzhen subsidiary, located in Guangdong province in southeastern China, filed a trademark infringement case against Apple in the Guangdong provincial court'"
"'12-07-02,'0','The injunction was hailed by supporters of abortion rights.“Today’s decision reaffirms the fundamental constitutional rights of women in Mississippi and ensures the Jackson Women’s Health Organization can continue providing the critical reproductive health care that they have offered to women for the last 17 years,” said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, a New York group that helped file the suit on the clinic’s behalf.“The opponents of reproductive rights in the Mississippi Legislature have made no secret of their intent to make legal abortion virtually disappear in the state of Mississippi. Their hostility toward women, reproductive health care providers and the rights of both would unquestionably put the lives and health of countless women at risk of grave harm,” she said.Lawmakers argued that their concern was for the health of women, saying the law was designed to make sure they were properly cared for in the event of complications during abortions.But the lawsuit brought on behalf of the clinic notes that supporters of the new law have publicly stated the broader intention to limit abortions. It cites Lt. Gov. Tate Reeves’s Web site, which says that the law “not only protects the health of the mother but should close the only abortion clinic in Mississippi”Judge Jordan found the argument compelling, writing, “Plaintiffs have offered evidence — including quotes from significant legislative and executive officers — that the act’s purpose is to eliminate abortions in Mississippi. They likewise submitted evidence that no safety or health concerns motivated its passage. This evidence has not yet been rebutted.”There was no immediate response from state officials.Mississippi is one of several states where conservative lawmakers have passed legislation aimed at limiting abortion.In this case, the State Legislature approved a requirement that all physicians who perform abortions in the state must be OB-GYNs with privileges to admit patients to a local hospital.While the doctors employed by the clinic are OB-GYNs, they have not been able to secure admitting privileges with an area hospital, making the clinic in clear violation of the new law.The courts have intervened in the past when Mississippi lawmakers have tried to limit abortion rights. Most recently, in 2004, a district judge declared unconstitutional a law that would have banned virtually all abortions performed after the first trimester.If the clinic were forced to close, Mississippi would be the only state in the nation with no facility dedicated to providing abortions.There were 2,297 abortions performed in Mississippi in 2010, the last year for which data is listed on the Web site of the State Health Department.Nearly all of those were performed on state residents, and while the Web site does not specify where the abortions were performed, the clinic’s operators said most were performed at their center, which is just north of Jackson, the state capital.Physicians who perform fewer than 10 abortions a month are not subjected to the same regulations as clinics.But there is no record of how many of those physicians there are in the state. If the clinic were closed, women would likely have to drive about 200 miles to one of Mississippi’s neighboring states to get an abortion.When the suit challenging the law was filed last week, Mr. Bryant vowed to vigorously defend the measure, saying that “this basic requirement goes both to the heart of women’s health care and protecting the lives of unborn children.”'"

Instead, services like accounting, trading and legal support, and human resources and compliance are being shifted to places like , and , Fla.Garry Douyon enjoyed his job helping process trades and working with clients and traders at RBS in Stamford, Conn., earning nearly $100,000 a year, but when the firm decided last fall to move his team to Salt Lake City with a salary of $60,000, he said he really didn’t have much of a choice.“I didn’t even consider moving,” said Mr. Douyon, who founded a company, All-City Clean Energy, in with four partners. “I liked RBS but I have my roots here, I have a home, I have kids in school.” A few members of his team decided to go, he added, but most chose to stay in the New York area.The potential shift has profound implications for New York’s tax base and economy because of Wall Street’s outsize financial profile. Last year, the industry contributed 14 percent of ’s tax revenue.After peaking at 213,000 in August 2007, securities industry jobs in the state fell more than 15 percent in the wake of the financial crisis, according to the . Since then they have risen nearly 12,000, but at 191,200, employment is well below pre-crisis levels. By contrast, over the same period, gained 1,300 securities jobs while picked up 2,600.The federal government does not specifically track securities jobs in , North Carolina or , popular locations for near-shoring. But data from firms illustrates the trend.Since the end of 2009, ’s work force in the New York area has fallen to 6,900 from 7,400 even as its staff in Jacksonville rose to 1,000 from 600. ’s staff in the New York region has dropped by 500 in the past four years, but the firm has added 450 positions in North Carolina’s Research Triangle, in the area of , Cary, and . And last year, cut 350 jobs in New York City while hiring 150 people in Lake Mary, Fla.New York’s status as a financial capital is not likely to fade, and the state’s share of securities jobs in the United States has held steady at about 24 percent in recent years. “Even as the securities industry goes through a difficult time, New York remains the financial capital of the world and I don’t see that changing anytime soon,” said , the New York State .But regional offices perform more and more of the sophisticated work usually associated with Wall Street and nearby trading hubs like Jersey City and Stamford. This parallels a shift in some technology jobs away from Silicon Valley to , Ore., and cities in , said Michael Shires, a professor at the School of Public Policy at Pepperdine, who prepares an annual ranking of the best cities for employment.“I expect to see an acceleration,” he said, noting that while these middle-tier jobs may lack the salaries and glamour usually associated with Wall Street, “these are the support people that actually make the stuff work.” What’s more, there are many more positions in the middle of the jobs pyramid at Wall Street firms than at the top.Deutsche Bank’s office in Jacksonville started out in 2008 as a back-office service center, according to bank officials. Since then, technology workers, legal and compliance staff members, and trading support jobs have been added. More recently, some traders who deal directly with clients are being located there. Lower costs and taxes are behind the moves, the officials said.J. Keith Crisco, the North Carolina secretary of commerce, visits New York three to five times a year, meeting with executives from firms already in North Carolina, like Credit Suisse, while reaching out to prospects. Another trip is planned this month.North Carolina provided Credit Suisse with roughly $14 million in incentives to bring it to the state.Delaware, which announced in April it had lured up to 1,200 jobs to the state, is set to pay the giant bank $10.1 million in cash incentives. Alan Levin, director of the Delaware Economic Development Office, estimates the typical salary for those jobs at $78,000 a year.“These jobs will be here for a long time,” he said. “We want to create not just jobs but careers.”The erosion of middle-tier jobs in the financial sector is not limited to New York. In a presentation to analysts in late May, the president of Goldman Sachs, Gary Cohn, described what he called the firm’s “high-value location strategy.” By looking outside hubs like New York, London, and , he said, the firm could save 40 percent to 75 percent on job-related expenses.Over a third of Goldman hires in 2011 and 2012 have been in cities like in , Salt Lake City, and , Mr. Cohn said. Utah, with looser regulation and lower taxes than New York, has been a particular area of growth for Goldman.While Goldman’s work force in the New York area has been flat since the end of 2009 at just over 10,000, full-time employees in Salt Lake City have doubled to 1,400, making that office Goldman’s sixth-largest globally. In addition to its technology and operations staff, Goldman has expanded activities like research and investment management there.These days, Mr. Douyon is building a refinery at the Brooklyn Navy Yard that aims to make from waste products like vegetable oil and grease from restaurants. While he says it is a more flexible way of life and, he hopes, more lucrative, he still feels the tug of the trading floor.“To be honest, I miss working on Wall Street,” he said.'"

"'12-07-02,'0','More predictable revenue streams, especially at a time when so many investments feel risky, are creating a firmer economic argument for local farming that, in years past, was more of a political or lifestyle choice.“How you make it pay is to get closer to the customer,” said Michael Duffy, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, capsuling the advice he gives to new farmers in the Midwest.Labor, as it has been for generations in the United States, is still the big wrinkle for local growers. But in many cases, experts like Professor Duffy say, the local food system is increasingly going its own way, differentiated from the traditional labor pool of migrant workers that the United States’ mainstream produce system depends on. Many larger local farms hire Hispanic workers, but at more farm stands and markets, buying local also means, in subtle or not so subtle ways, buying native.“A byproduct of local food is that local hands are more likely to be producing, harvesting, packing and marketing it, especially for new farmers on small-scale farms,” said Dawn Thilmany McFadden, an agricultural economist at Colorado State University who is part of a leadership team for a training program for beginning farmers.In other instances, Hispanics who had worked as low-wage laborers are now becoming entrepreneurs. A three-year-old nonprofit group north of Seattle, Viva Farms, specifically aims to help Hispanic farmers get started, with assistance in language training and in understanding the vagaries of the marketplace.“We work harder now,” said Misael Morales, 35, describing the main difference between life as a farm laborer and as an entrepreneur.Mr. Morales came to the United States from Oaxaca, Mexico, as a teenager, and last year he and his brother, Salvador, 32, began farming a one-acre plot at Viva Farms. They mainly grow lettuce for markets and restaurants in Seattle.“Early or late, when something has to get done, you do it,” he said.Viva Farms’ director of business and organizational development, Ethan Schaffer, said former wage workers like the Morales brothers are often surprised when they realize the prices and profit margins that local organic produce can fetch — something, he said, that rarely penetrates down to the daily life of a migrant picker.“They get the ag part, and once they realize how the market works, they’re off and running,” Mr. Schaffer said.Other new farmers, like Christopher Brown, 26, a former Marine infantryman who worked his first day last month at Grow Washington, an organic farm north of Seattle, have more complex motives. Taking a break from the carrot-cleaning table, he says he dreams of building an organization to help bring other veterans into local farming.Other urban-focused farms, including one in Oregon City, Ore., called C’est Naturelle, are offering, starting this month, one-stop shopping services: community-supported agriculture subscriptions to supply a family a full diet of food from one place, from eggs and butter to beef and greens.Mr. Varma’s project near Portland, called Community by Design, was inspired, he said, by the Slow Money movement, which has emerged in recent years as a vehicle for financing local, organic food production through groups like Slow Money, a nonprofit group in Boulder, Colo., that connects investors, entrepreneurs and farmers. Of $18 million raised in the last two years by Slow Money, $4 million — the biggest chunk — landed here in the Pacific Northwest, said Woody Tasch, the group’s chairman.But the economic path for local food is still in many ways difficult.The federal farm bill, passed by the Senate last month, has provisions to support farmers’ markets. But in Washington State, a program aimed at helping growers build direct marketing relationships with grocers or restaurants died last year in a round of budget cuts.For Jenny and Alex Smith, both 25, a couple since they met in college — now first-year farmers on a tiny plot about an hour north of Seattle — the economic equation comes down to lowering costs and needs.They live in a recreational vehicle with no television or Internet service, and they hope to break even this year, earning perhaps $1,600 a month through farmers’ markets and subscriptions for weekly produce packages, so far mostly from friends and family. But they say a farming life still feels, to them, full of promise. They had boring office jobs in Seattle, they said, and now they have a farm dog named Banjo.'"
"'12-07-02,'0','CAIRO — Hundreds of armed protesters on Sunday attacked the offices of Libya’s election commission in two cities, Benghazi and Tobruk, in anger over the way seats in next week’s planned election for a constituent assembly were distributed among the country’s regions.The protesters carried computers, ballot boxes and ballots out of the offices, and shattered and burned them in the streets outside, according to witnesses, news agencies and photographs that circulated on the Internet. Some of the attackers carried signs calling the leader of Libya’s interim government a “traitor” to the eastern region of the country, known as Cyrenaica, which the protesters said got too few seats in the assembly. Others demanded the writing of a constitution before elections.Libyans hoped that the election of the assembly on July 7 would establish a government with more credibility than the weak Transitional National Council, one that could control the freewheeling local militias that have dominated the country since the overthrow of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi last year.But it was far from certain that the transitional government could provide enough security to hold a credible vote, or persuade the rival regions and tribes to set aside their grievances and respect the result. Whether the attacks on Sunday would derail the vote was unclear.There have been reports in recent weeks of low-level violence against diplomatic missions from the United States, Britain and Tunisia. In Benghazi, the main eastern city, a senior prosecutor was murdered, apparently in revenge for having detained a prominent rebel commander, Gen. Abdel Fattah Younes, who was assassinated while in custody during the rebellion against the Qaddafi regime.Fighting among rival tribes around Kufra in the south killed more than a dozen people earlier this month. And there were reports in the past week that easterners angry over the constitutional assembly had blocked the main coastal road connecting the country’s centuries-old rival provinces.'"

"'12-07-02,'0','Patrick Somerville has written two short-story collections, “Trouble” (2006) and “The Universe in Miniature in Miniature” (2010), and a deceptively slight-looking novel, “The Cradle” (2009). That novel is about an expectant father who is sent by his wife to retrieve a stolen cradle and bring it back in time for the birth of their baby. The father travels, and the book meanders. But “The Cradle” turned out to be a small miracle, a fable about even bigger yearnings than it could comfortably hold. So Mr. Somerville has gone in search of a format that suits him.But his new book, “This Bright River,” is more than twice as long as “The Cradle,” not nearly as well edited and so crammed with threads and coincidences that it is not easily summarized. As two main characters, Ben Hanson and Lauren Sheehan, ramble through this book, so does the reader, wondering what kind of story this means to be.If Mr. Somerville knows the answer, he isn’t telling. And “This Bright River” does enough shape shifting to suggest that he never knew for sure.“This Bright River” sustains so many attractive quirks that its lack of purposefulness is not a burning issue. For a while Mr. Somerville is able to coast on the suspense built into any nonchronological, sometimes foggy story.The book begins with a violent prologue in which an unknown narrator sustains some kind of head injury.  This initial act of abrupt violence seems like the generic starting point for a crime story. But “This Bright River” is nothing of the kind.  It revolves around the wary return of Ben Hanson, a onetime rich kid and stoner who at 32 is an ex-con, to the Wisconsin town where he grew up.  Lauren Sheehan, the book’s other protagonist, grew up there too.Ben has returned because of the death of his Uncle Denny. He’s there to clean up Denny’s house so it can be sold. And he is barely up to this job. “In truth, I just knew nothing,” Ben tells the reader. “At this moment in my life, my only real areas of expertise concerned ultra-obscure strains of genetically enhanced marijuana and backgammon strategy.” Ben’s best idea for what he’ll do next? Maybe travel around the world, “Like in ‘Eat, Pray, Love.’ ”'"
"'12-07-02,'0','Polls show that Americans under 30 are still inclined to support Mr. Obama by a wide margin. But the president may face a particular challenge among voters ages 18 to 24. In that group, his lead over — 12 points — is about half of what it is among 25- to 29-year-olds, according to an online survey this spring by the Harvard Institute of Politics.  And among whites in the younger group, Mr. Obama’s lead vanishes altogether.Among all 18- to 29-year-olds, the poll found a high level of undecided voters; 30 percent indicated that they had not yet made up their mind. And turnout among this group is expected to be significantly lower than for older voters.“The concern for Obama, and the opportunity for Romney, is in the 18- to 24-year-olds who don’t have the historical or direct connection to the campaign or the movement of four years ago,” said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics. “We’re also seeing that these younger members of this generation are beginning to show some more conservative traits. It doesn’t mean they are Republican. It means Republicans have an opportunity.”Experts say the impact of the recession and the slow recovery should not be underestimated. The newest potential voters — some 17 million people — have been shaped more by harsh economic times in their formative years than by anything else, and that force does not tend to be galvanizing in a positive way.For 18- and 19-year-olds, the unemployment rate as of May was 23.5 percent, according to the . For those ages 20 to 24, the rate falls to 12.9 percent, compared with the national unemployment rate of 8.2 percent for all ages. The impact of the recession on the young has created a disillusionment about politics in general, several experts suggested.“I think the lack of excitement right now is palpable enough to be a challenge to the re-election campaign” of Mr. Obama, said Peter Levine, director of the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at .The Romney campaign intends to seize the moment, with new online and campus-based initiatives rolling out in the next few weeks, said Joshua Baca, the campaign’s national coalition director. He said the message would be simple: Mr. Obama’s economic policies are not working for young people.The strategy? “Dorm room to dorm room” or “parent’s basement to parent’s basement, wherever they are because of the economy, that’s where we’ll be going,” Mr. Baca said. “The key to this is having a very strong volunteer base to knock on doors.”For its part, the Obama campaign has already started outreach efforts focusing on teenagers in high school. It has organized youth rallies in swing states over the last few months and plans to be a force on college campuses in the fall.“Young people know what’s at stake,” said Clo Ewing, an Obama campaign spokeswoman. “So just as they came out in huge numbers to organize and lead a movement in 2008, their energy and commitment will help build this campaign again in 2012.”In 2008, Mr. Obama was the first to recognize the full power of the youth vote as a game changer, and his timing coincided with a political awakening among young Americans after a tumultuous period that included the Sept. 11 attacks, the beginning of the and wars and the government failures during .But since then, the mood of the country has changed. Beyond that, Republicans in several states have recently passed more restrictive election laws, which they say will fight fraud; Democrats say they will make it harder for some of their main constituencies — youths, for instance — to vote.Mr. Tevlin, the student, said his exhaustive search for meaningful summer employment was so futile that he took a job cleaning toilets and septic tanks. “I think we’re in pretty deep trouble, and the future, as far as jobs, is not looking good at all,” he said.A political science major, Mr. Tevlin has become more cynical over recent years. “I see lies and I hear lies, nothing gets past partisanship, and I don’t believe anything,” he said. “I think the party system is stupid.”In the last three general elections, young voters have given Democrats a majority of their votes, according to exit polls.Today, specifically, the youngest potential voters are more likely than their older peers to think it is important to protect individual liberties from government, the Harvard data suggest, and less likely to think it is important to tackle things like , health care or .“I don’t think the government should force you to buy anything,” he said.Brandon Dennis is one voter who says he is open to someone new. Mr. Dennis, 20, comes from a black family of Obama supporters. But when he came of age to vote, he registered as an independent. He is listening to Mr. Romney’s appeals.“This time, it’s more about what you’re going to do for the economy,” said Mr. Dennis, a chemistry major at Clark Atlanta University.Vanessa Espinoza, 19, who lives in eastern , says she does care about this election but has been unable to commit to a political party. As a conservative Catholic, she sides with Republicans on issues like . As a full-time factory worker without , she favors the president’s health care law, which may have finally swayed her.Still, her endorsement is less than resounding.“I lean a little toward Obama,” she said. “I guess.”'"

"'12-07-03,'1','Prices and sales volume for Manhattan real estate continued to hold relatively steady in the second quarter of 2012, because of a continued decline in inventory, low interest rates and increased foreign investment.The median sale price for the second quarter was $840,000, up 2.4 percent from the same period in 2011, according to a report from StreetEasy.com that will be released on Tuesday.Reports from the city’s largest brokerage firms also indicated relatively flat pricing, with one showing the median dropping by 2.5 percent and the others showing an increase of 1 to 2 percent. Sales volume was higher than a year ago and had more than doubled since the number of sales dropped to fewer than 2,000 in the first quarter of 2009, according to a Corcoran Group report.“The stability of prices in the past few quarters has instilled confidence in a lot of people,” said James M. Gricar, general sales manager at Halstead Property. “Rates are quite low and the rental market is quite high. Conditions are good. That has led to a very stable, healthy — and for brokers, optimistic — market.”The new numbers come after evidence suggesting the national housing market is finally starting to recover. Still, Jonathan J.

"'12-07-03,'1','Former President Jimmy Carter is right that “America’s violation of international human rights abets our enemies and alienates our friends.” The United States must take seriously the international human rights norms and treaties it has professed to follow, even as it wages “war” on terrorism.Equally important, killing a broad range of suspected “enemies” around the world not only violates human rights norms but also escalates armed conflicts that we should not be engaged in. The United States can fight terrorism effectively without perpetuating a global war that only encourages attacks against us.It’s time for the United States to end indefinite detention without trial and secret killings of people who don’t directly threaten us. We can’t wait to “regain moral leadership” only after we’ve ended all terrorism and achieved world peace; these are things we must do now to further it.Bravo to Jimmy Carter for yet again stating the simple truth. I have been shocked and appalled by the dramatic change in the American conscience post-9/11. Even assassination, once an outright abrogation of human rights, has now become an achievement on which to run for re-election.When I’ve expressed my dismay to even some of my most progressive friends, the usual response is that they are not “bothered” by it.How can we preach the importance of human rights to governments around the world when we’ve become so accepting of violations by our own country?'"
"'12-07-03,'1','Update: After this editorial went to press, Barclays announced that its chief executive, Robert Diamond Jr. had resigned, effective immediately, and that Marcus Agius, who had resigned as chairman of Barclays on Monday, would become chairman again and lead the search for a new chief executive.Marcus Agius, the chairman of , resigned on Monday, saying “the buck stops with me.” His was the first departure since the British bank agreed last week to pay $450 million to settle findings that, from 2005 to 2009, it had tried to rig benchmark interest rates to benefit its own bottom line.Mr. Agius was right to go and the bank’s chief executive, Jr., should follow him out the door. But the investigations cannot stop there.The rates in question — the , or Libor, and the Euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor — are used to determine the borrowing rates for consumers and companies, including some $10 trillion in , and credit cards. The rates are also linked to an estimated $700 trillion market in derivatives, which banks buy and sell on a daily basis. If these rates are rigged, markets are rigged — against bank customers, like everyday borrowers, and against parties on the other side of a bank’s derivatives deals, like pension funds.Barclays is only one of more than a dozen big banks that provide information used to set the daily rate for Libor and Euribor. The settlement, struck with regulators in and and with the Department of Justice, indicates that the bank did not act alone. It shows that unnamed managers and traders of Barclays in London, New York and colluded with or prevailed upon bank employees who provide the benchmark data to make false reports. The aim was to bolster Barclays’s trading positions and to aid or counteract other banks’ attempts at manipulation.The evidence, cited by the Justice Department — which Barclays agreed is “true and accurate” — is damning. “Always happy to help,” one employee wrote in an e-mail after being asked to submit false information. “If you know how to keep a secret, I’ll bring you in on it,” wrote a Barclays trader to a trader at another bank, referring to an attempt to align their strategies for mutual gain.If that’s not conspiracy and price-fixing, what is?The Justice Department has left open the possibility of prosecuting officers or employees of Barclays. But it has agreed not to prosecute the bank itself, in part because Barclays was the first to cooperate in the investigation and has agreed to keep cooperating.

Undeterred, state lawmakers came up with another unconstitutional scheme to eliminate abortions by requiring doctors performing the procedure to be obstetrician-gynecologists who have privileges to admit patients to a hospital.Under the new law, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the state’s sole remaining abortion clinic, would have to close because its doctors have not been able to obtain privileges — an unsurprising predicament given the hostile political atmosphere.Fortunately, a Federal District Court judge on Sunday night granted the clinic a reprieve. Judge Daniel Jordan III temporarily blocked enforcement of the law, which was scheduled to go into effect Monday.The requirement is cast as a safety rule, but serious complications from legal abortions are exceedingly rare and area hospitals are already prepared to accept transfers by ambulance in emergencies. The measure’s supporters, including Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, make no secret of its true improper purpose, which is to effectively end all abortions in the state. Judge Jordan cited this evidence in issuing his ruling.Forcing women in Mississippi who want abortions to travel long distances to out-of-state clinics will impose heavy costs and could create serious health risks caused by delays. The fight will resume on July 11, when the judge has scheduled a hearing on the matter. He should extend the temporary injunction and then rule to permanently block the campaign to deny women in Mississippi reproductive freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution.'"
"'12-07-03,'1','That the shooting happened at City Park Jazz, a gathering that traverses race and money — from the young professionals of Lower Downtown and the Highlands neighborhood to generations of black families from Five Points — has made it more painful.“She was an absolutely delightful person. Very kind, generous in her spirit,” said Mayor Michael Hancock, who knew Ms. Hollis and whose wife, a jazz singer, had left the concert with their daughter shortly before the officer was killed. “This is our city, and we’re not going to surrender to any group who wants to take it away from us.”The police made an arrest nearby shortly after the shooting, taking into custody 21-year-old Rollin Oliver, who was armed with a gun. On Monday, he was charged with one count of first-degree murder with extreme indifference and was being held without bail.At a news conference last week, Robert White, the police chief, said it did not initially appear that Mr. Oliver had intentionally shot Ms. Hollis. But under Colorado law, intent is not always required for a charge of first-degree murder, and charging documents accused Mr. Oliver of firing multiple rounds into a crowded area, striking Ms. Hollis in the head.Mr. Oliver grew up blocks from the district where Ms. Hollis worked in Park Hill, a largely black neighborhood, miles from downtown’s lofts and restaurants.Among ramshackle garages and murals demanding an end to the violence, Terrance Roberts, a thick-muscled former Blood who works to keep young people in the city out of gangs, said Ms. Hollis was an officer the neighborhood could identify with.“She was everything we’ve advocated for in our community,” he said. “She was somebody our daughters could aspire to.”Mr. Roberts works through his group, the Prodigal Son Initiative, to curb gang involvement — getting young men to exchange colors for camouflage and helping transform a vacant lot where a shopping center was burned by gang members in 2008 into basketball courts and a community center.Shortly before Ms. Hollis was gunned down, Mr. Roberts said, a man was shot across from his office. Officers were called from the concert to respond, he said.Despite a reputation as a haven for well-heeled white, outdoorsy types, Denver has seen its share of violence.The number of killings between January and June 1 this year and last have inched up slightly compared with the previous two years, according to data from the police. In the first five months of 2012, there were six gang-related killings (not including Ms. Hollis’s), compared with five last year and three in 2010.Still, gang-related crimes have largely waned over the years, when compared to what became known as the Summer of Violence in 1993, which left 74 dead, according to news accounts.Mr. White said that despite progress, there was clearly considerable work to do.“I don’t want anyone to think we’re on top of the gang issue and that we have it completely under control, because that is absolutely not the case,” he said.Beyond the numbers, there is still a perception in places like Park Hill that too many in the city remain disconnected from the trouble here.“There aren’t a lot of skiers and snowboarders in northeast Denver,” Mr. Roberts said. “We’re talking about young men here who feel like they don’t have any choices.”While mourning Ms. Hollis’s death, some residents said that Mr. Oliver was no hardened gangster, that rival gang members had jumped him and a gun was fired in an awful mistake.“She was trying to save his life and lost her own,” Kenny Greenwood said outside a convenience store. “There’s a lot of struggle out here.”On Sunday night, a crowd gathered in City Park for a jazz tribute to Ms. Hollis, with many in purple, her favorite color. Several women, including State Representative Angela Williams, told of losing loved ones to gang violence. Police officers escorted Ms. Hollis’s family toward the bandstand. And then the music began.A mother pinned a purple ribbon to her son’s shirt, a police officer nodded his head in rhythm, a woman flung her dreadlocks from side to side as she danced.As the last bursts from a trumpet drifted over the Rockies, on this night, the city was at peace.'"
"'12-07-03,'1','Using the military’s acronym for the supply routes, known as ground lines of communication, Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Monday, “We’re continuing to talk about the GLOCs, and we will until we have resolution of the issue.”Senior Pakistani government and defense officials were scheduled to meet on Tuesday to discuss the issue, Reuters reported.Pakistan closed the supply routes in November after an American airstrike mistakenly killed 24 Pakistani soldiers at an outpost near the Afghan border.Since then, the two countries have struggled to resolve the impasse. When an American team of technical specialists left Pakistan about three weeks ago, many of the nuts-and-bolts issues seemed to have been worked out.Pakistan, stung by the suspension of American military assistance last year, at first demanded a fee of $5,000 for each truck that crossed its territory from the port in Karachi to Afghanistan. Before the November attack, NATO had paid $250. Pakistan later reduced that demand to about $3,000 a truck; the United States has offered $1,000 per vehicle, although some officials say the two sides have settled for about half of that.The United States has agreed to pay for repairs to the port of Karachi and road improvements near the border crossings, but rejected Pakistan’s request for indemnity waivers in case American cargo is damaged en route.But the major stumbling block has been Pakistan’s demand for a more formal American apology for the fatal airstrike in November. The Pentagon and the White House have adamantly opposed any additional apology beyond the several expressions of regret and condolences offered by many American officials.Some State Department officials, however, have held out hope that if artfully worded and delivered, an apology of sorts was not just possible but prudent to end the crisis. One former senior American official who has worked on South Asia issues said Monday that just such an apology was “being mulled over.”Other American officials, however, said it would take diplomatic gymnastics of extraordinary proportions to pull of such a feat at this point, with both countries seemingly dug in on whether or not to say sorry.'"
"'12-07-03,'1','“What women are hearing is, You may not be able to have an abortion soon,” she said. “If you’re pregnant and you don’t want to be, you’re thinking, ‘By God, I’ve got to get in there fast.’ ”In April, Mississippi became the 10th state to pass a law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have hospital privileges. The bill’s author, Representative Sam Mims, said there were two goals: reducing the number of abortions in Mississippi and assuring that abortions were performed by properly trained doctors who could take women to a hospital in an emergency.Abortion-rights groups say the law is motivated by politics, not science. The Center for Reproductive Rights, which has challenged Mississippi’s law in court, said federal law already required hospitals to admit patients in case of an emergency.In his order temporarily halting the law, Judge Daniel P. Jordan III of Federal District Court called the argument compelling. “Plaintiffs have offered evidence — including quotes from significant legislative and executive officers — that the act’s purpose is to eliminate abortions in Mississippi,"" he wrote. ""They likewise submitted evidence that no safety or health concerns motivated its passage. This evidence has not yet been rebutted.”Hospital privileges are difficult to obtain, said Elizabeth Nash, a public policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute. Hospitals often do not want to be affiliated with controversial procedures, like abortions, and also require doctors with privileges to admit a certain number of patients a year for surgery. “This requirement does nothing to help women’s health,” she said. “There isn’t much of a motive here except to put this abortion provider out of business.”Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, has said he would like to see his state be “abortion-free.”“If it closes that clinic,” he said during the bill-signing ceremony, “then so be it.”And the anti-abortion activists at the clinic agree. “We’ve made no secret about it: We want to protect women, but we also want to limit abortion,” said Roy McMillan, the executive director of the Christian Action Group who has protested in front of abortion clinics for 30 years.Mississippi has several other laws that also restrict abortions. It requires women under 18 to have parents’ permission for an abortion, and requires all women to wait 24 hours and be offered to see an ultrasound of the fetus before having the procedure.Until the judge rules, Ms. Derzis, the clinic owner, said she would continue “business as usual.”“It’s a huge responsibility to be the only clinic in the state,” she said. “This is all that stands between a woman having to leave the state for an abortion.”There were 2,297 abortions performed in Mississippi in 2010, according to the State Health Department. Doctors who perform fewer than 10 abortions a month are not subjected to the same regulations as clinics. But there is no record of how many of those physicians there are in the state.'"
"'12-07-03,'1','BERLIN — The head of Germany’s domestic intelligence agency resigned on Monday under a shower of criticism over his office’s handling of an investigation into a neo-Nazi terrorist cell that evaded the authorities for years, killing at least 10 people, most of them immigrant businessmen.The intelligence chief, Heinz Fromm, 63, was granted early retirement from his post as president of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Days before, it emerged that an official in his office had shredded documents containing potential evidence from paid informers about members of the cell, known as the National Socialist Underground.“This has led to grave loss of confidence in and seriously damaged the reputation of my office,” Mr. Fromm told Der Spiegel. He is to retire at the end of the month, after 12 years as the agency’s president.The neo-Nazi cell came to light in early November through a series of events that ended in a botched robbery that led the police to two suspected cell members. Within days, the police had cracked the country’s longest series of unsolved murders and had revealed the existence of a cell that they believe was responsible for the murders of nine immigrant small-business owners, eight Turkish and one Greek, from 2000 to 2007.The police have also linked the cell to the killing of a police officer and to bomb attacks that injured more than 20 people, mostly Turks, as well as to several bank robberies.The news of the existence of the cell, which had three members who all relied on a vast support network, raised questions about the ability of the country’s security services to combat far-right terrorism. In January, a parliamentary oversight committee was convened to examine how mistakes had arisen and how they could be avoided in the future.'"
"'12-07-03,'1','PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Philadelphia refinery, the oldest and largest refinery on the East Coast, will stay open as a result of a joint venture announced Monday by Sunoco and the global asset manager Carlyle Group.The Philadelphia refinery, which had struggled to make money as the price of imported crude oil rose, was scheduled to close in August. In April, Sunoco announced that it had entered into “exclusive discussions” with Carlyle about the plant, which has about 850 workers and produces 330,000 barrels a day.In a statement, the companies said the joint venture, Philadelphia Energy Solutions, would retain the current refining jobs and create up to 200 more as the refinery is updated and expanded. Financial terms were not disclosed.“This is the best possible outcome for everyone involved,” Brian P. MacDonald, Sunoco’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “Existing jobs will be saved, new jobs will be created and new business opportunities will be given the chance to develop.”Federal energy officials had warned that closing the refinery would lead to increases in gas prices in some parts of the Northeast. Labor unions pushed to keep the facility open, and many government officials became involved, including Gene Sperling, director of the president’s National Economic Council, and Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia.'"
"'12-07-03,'1','Premature birth may increase the risk for serious mental illness in adolescence and young adulthood, a recent study reports.Researchers reviewed birth and hospital admissions records of more than 1.3 million Swedes born from 1973 to 1985. They found that compared with those born at term, young adults born very premature — at less than 32 weeks’ gestation — were more than twice as likely to be hospitalized for schizophrenia or delusional disorders, almost three times as likely for major depression, and more than seven times as likely for bipolar illness.The lead author, Chiara Nosarti, a senior lecturer in neuroimaging at Kings College London, emphasized that while the increase in relative risk is substantial, the absolute increase in numbers of people with the illnesses is not.“Despite these findings,” she said, “the majority of people born preterm have no psychiatric problems, and the number of people hospitalized with psychiatric disease is very low.”Still, she added, “routine screening may help to detect early signs of illness.”The risk also increased for people born late preterm, or 32 to 36 weeks’ gestation, but not as sharply. They were 60 percent more likely to be admitted for schizophrenia or delusional disorders, 34 percent more likely for depressive disorder, and about twice as likely to be hospitalized for bipolar illness.'"

But my frequent flying really began when I started my online music marketing company, Sonicbids, about 11 years ago.I’m a citizen of Cyprus, and have lived in Boston for about 20 years. When I travel, I have to carry my green card and passport. I have a European Union passport, but I didn’t get that until recently, after Cyprus joined the European Union. Before then, I had to travel in and out of Cyprus with my army discharge papers.My green card is incredibly important. I was headed to London for some meetings and I was traveling with my wife. I showed my passport. No problem. Then, I was asked for my green card. The United States won’t let you back in the country unless you have papers for readmission.I realized my green card was back at home. The meetings I had to attend were very important and home was about a 20-minute cab ride away. The plane was set to leave in about an hour.My wife had an idea that she would check in and check our luggage. Then, when they called for boarding, she wouldn’t board, and with any luck they would hold the plane for us since we were upgraded to first class. Despite having the fastest cabdrivers in the world, I didn’t make it in time, and they held the plane for about 20 minutes. We boarded and I swear the looks we got could melt ice. We never did that again.'"
"'12-07-03,'1','Manufacturing activity in the United States declined in June, making it the first monthly contraction since 2009, partly because of a slowdown in orders from Asia and Europe, according to a national survey released on Monday.The Institute for Supply Management said its index registered 49.7 in June, the first time since July 2009 that it had fallen below 50, the level that separates a manufacturing expansion from a manufacturing contraction. The index was 53.5 in May. I.S.M. compiles the data from its survey of about 350 of the nation’s supply executives, representing 18 industries ranging from furniture makers to beverage producers.The I.S.M. report hit markets a day after Friday’s relief rally, which was prompted by an agreement among European leaders on a broad plan to tackle Europe’s banking crisis.Stocks in the United States initially fell after the report, but they recovered by the end of the day on Monday. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.07 percent, or 8.7 points, to 12,871.39 and the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index was up by 0.25 percent to 1,365.51. The Nasdaq was higher by 0.6 percent to 2,951.23.European indexes continued their gains from Friday. The Euro Stoxx 50 was up 1.2 percent while the CAC 40 in Paris rose 1.36 percent.Demand for safe-haven United States Treasuries rose as the I.S.M. report cast a shadow over expectations for the economic recovery.

"'12-07-04,'0','Sometimes it seems as though there’s nothing big banks won’t do to earn people’s mistrust.Susanne Craig and Jessica Silver-Greenberg reported in The Times on Tuesday that since the crash, several banks have built up their financial advisory businesses to cater to ordinary investors. The aim is to generate steadier returns than those on trading desks — in effect, turning to mom and pop to make up for lost boom-era profit.Unlike other banks, however, JPMorgan Chase has focused on selling mutual funds that it creates, in the process becoming the only bank among the nation’s 10 largest fund companies.Some current and former JPMorgan brokers told The Times that they felt pressured to recommend those proprietary products to customers, even when other options were better performing or less expensive. “It said financial adviser on my business card, but that’s not what JPMorgan actually let me be,” said one former broker. “I had to be a salesman, even if what I was selling wasn’t that great.”The result is more money for JPMorgan and less for the investor. The more assets there are in the funds, the more fees the bank collects for managing them. In one large proprietary portfolio, the bank levies an annual fee as high as 1.6 percent of assets, compared with 1 percent typically charged by independent financial planners.A JPMorgan spokeswoman said customers want access to proprietary funds and benefit from in-house expertise. She also said the bank always puts clients first.Be that as it may, what investors have to realize is that the nation’s securities laws still do not impose a fiduciary duty on brokers who give investment advice, which would require them to act in the best interest of their clients. Brokers have to recommend “suitable” investments, but that standard gives them leeway to pitch investments that boost their firm’s profits, exposing investors to misleading pitches and overly expensive products.'"
"'12-07-04,'0','Is the election of , the candidate, as president of the beginning of the end of the Camp David peace treaty between and Egypt? It doesn’t have to be. In fact, it could actually be the beginning of a real peace between the Israeli and the Egyptian peoples, instead of what we’ve had: a cold, formal peace between Israel and a single Egyptian pharaoh. But, for that to be the case, both sides will have to change some deeply ingrained behaviors, and fast.First, let’s dispense with some nonsense. There is a mantra you hear from ’s government in Israel and various right-wing analysts: “We told you so.” It’s the idea that somehow could have intervened to “save” President of Egypt and he was just too naïve to do so, and the inevitable result is that the Muslim Brotherhood has taken power. Sorry, naïveté is thinking that because it was so convenient for Israel to have peace with one dictator, Mubarak, rather than 80 million Egyptians, that this dictator — or some other general — would and could stay at the helm in Egypt forever. Talk about naïve.I truly appreciate the anxiety Israelis feel at seeing their neighborhood imploding. But it is also striking that a people for whom the Exodus story of liberation is so central — and who for so long argued that peace will happen only when the Arabs become democratic — failed to believe that the liberation narrative might one day resonate with the people of Egypt and now proclaim that the problem with the Arabs is that they are becoming democratic. This has roots.“In their relations with power, Jews in exile have always preferred vertical alliances to horizontal ones,” notes , the Jewish scholar and literary editor of The New Republic. “They always preferred to have a relationship with the king or the bishop so as not to have to engage with the general population, of which they were deeply distrustful — and they often had reason to be distrustful. Israel, as a sovereign state, reproduced the old Jewish tradition of the vertical alliance, only this time with the Arab states. They thought that if they had a relationship with Mubarak or the king of , they had all they needed. But the model of the vertical alliance only makes sense with authoritarian political systems. As soon as authoritarianism breaks down, and a process of democratization begins, the vertical model is over and you enter a period of horizontality in which the opinions of the people — in this instance, ordinary Arabs — will matter.” As a result, Israel will have to make the man on the street “not only fear it, but also understand it. This will not be easy, but it may not be impossible. Anyway, nostalgia for dictators is not a thoughtful policy.”I don’t know whether the current leadership can be a partner for a secure, two-state peace with Israel, but I do know this: Israel needs to be more creative in testing whether that is possible. Because the alternative is a one-state solution that will be the death of Israel as a Jewish democracy and deadly for peace with a democratic Egypt.'"
"'12-07-04,'0','“That tournament changed my life in one respect, but it would have changed my life entirely had I won it,” said Chuasiriporn, 34.She added: “It feels good looking back on that week and it feels good that I was able to compete against the best players in the world at the top of my game. It was definitely the highlight of my golf career.”But soon after the wave of interest swept over Chuasiriporn, a daughter of Thai immigrants, she faced another wave of doubt in herself as a golfer, as well as an increased interest in exploring life beyond the sport. Instead of fighting that, she went with it and never looked back.“She made an amazing leap in the golf world at that Open, but for Jenny, it’s never been all about golf,” said Candy Hannemann, a former college teammate at Duke. “The joy of playing golf was why Jenny was so good, and when you take that away, it wasn’t fun anymore.”That joy was evident in a famous photograph of Chuasiriporn, who had yet to begin her senior year at college, covering her mouth in amazement after she drained a 40-foot, twice-breaking putt for birdie on the 72nd hole to force the playoff at the Open.She was wearing a Duke golf shirt with her older brother, Joey, carrying her bag. Her parents and her younger brother, Jimmy, along with friends and teammates from both her college team and the United States Curtis Cup squad, were in the gallery.By contrast, Pak was a rookie phenom decked out in corporate logos. She had already won the L.P.G.A. Championship that year and had a multimillion-dollar endorsement deal with Samsung.“I had very little expectation going into it, nor did I ever dream of finishing where I did,” Chuasiriporn said. “But I think she had a lot of pressure to win that golf tournament and to beat an amateur.”Chuasiriporn birdied three of her first five holes in the Monday playoff, but her tee shot on the sixth hole found the deep rough, and she ended up with a triple-bogey 6 that brought her back in reach of Pak. They were even after 18 holes, forcing a sudden-death playoff that ended two holes later when Pak made a 15-foot birdie putt.Pak won the championship, but Chuasiriporn captured the imagination of golf fans.“I just remember the week after the Open, we were rooming together to play the Curtis Cup and there was all of this mail for Jenny shoved under our hotel room door,” said Beth Bauer Grace, a former L.P.G.A. Tour player who was a Duke teammate of Chuasiriporn’s. “Jenny never changed after that Open, but things in her life certainly did.”Chuasiriporn struggled at that Curtis Cup, and the attention followed her everywhere she went. It followed her to North Carolina when she returned to the Duke campus that fall. When she began to struggle on the golf course, the news media was there to document the errant shots.Even her own expectations rose in the wake of her Open performance, but the results did not come.“Looking back, I think the pressure had started getting to me by then,” Chuasiriporn said. “I felt a lot of eyes on me.”The Duke women’s golf coach, Dan Brooks, saw Chuasiriporn, the team’s leader, begin to doubt herself off the tee during her final season. He could see the pressure building.“Jenny is a person who likes to enjoy life and does her best when she’s having fun,” Brooks said. “The Open experience probably tightened the screws a bit.”After Chuasiriporn graduated, she turned professional, but playing on tour did not produce the same satisfaction she had experienced as an amateur.She also wrestled with the fact that her parents were financially supporting her.“I got to a point where I didn’t feel good about it because of how hard they had worked to make a living and what they had sacrificed to help me,” she said. “I felt like I was just wasting their money.”She sought out sponsors to help her play on the 1999 Futures Tour and to play in four tournaments on the L.P.G.A. Tour that she received exemptions to, but after several weeks of poor performances and missed cuts, she returned all of their money.Chuasiriporn bounced around on other pro tours for two years, but when her good friend, the Zimbabwean golfer Lewis Chitengwa, died of meningitis in 2001, she began to re-evaluate her goals.“I think that helped me realize how short life was and how I needed to do what I wanted to do to be happy,” she said. “I had lost the balance in my life. I loved golf, but I didn’t love it that much for every decision I made to revolve around golf or around me, me, me.”Chuasiriporn entered nursing school at the University of Maryland in 2005. While working as a registered nurse at Virginia Commonwealth University, she earned her master’s degree as a nurse practitioner in 2010. She also married Robert Betts, who will start his residency in family medicine this year.Her new job has taken her to the bedsides of patients in the intensive-care unit. She also works with people dealing with postsurgery problems, chronic disease and end-of-life care. None of her patients seem to know she once came a putt away from winning the United States Women’s Open.These days, Chuasiriporn said, she might play golf twice a year or hit balls on the range if the notion strikes her. It has been six years since she last competed. Memories of that magical week at Blackwolf Run resurface only when somebody brings it up.But 14 years later, Chuasiriporn says she is content. She loves her job. Her goal is to “make a difference in people’s lives” and to be known as something more than a golfer.“Sometimes I do wonder where my life would be now if I had won that Open,” she said. “But I actually think I would be right where I am. It just might have taken me longer to get here.”'"
"'12-07-04,'0','The traditional parade through the tiny downtown of Narrowsburg, N.Y., will still go on as planned on Wednesday. Residents of the hamlet, population just over 400, will feast on barbecued chicken, as they do every Independence Day. But the annual fireworks display, held on the Fourth of July for decades, has been canceled — a victim of a clash with another historical symbol of patriotism.The local volunteer Fire Department that was to sponsor the display announced last week that it was canceling the event after it was told by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service that it could face up to $200,000 in fines if the fireworks caused any harm to any of the bald eagles that live in the area.The welfare of the bird that is the official emblem of this nation is not taken lightly in the community — about 100 miles northwest of Manhattan — which is known as the Bald Eagle Capital of New York State.“The eagles have lived here, and the fireworks have been here, too, so they are obviously used to it,” said Bruce Gettel, a member of the Lava Volunteer Fire Department, which had planned to put on the fireworks. “It’s real ironic that we’re celebrating our independence, but you can’t be independent with our celebration.” He said more people in the community were likely to complain now than they had in the past.Questions were raised after last year’s celebration when an unidentified resident went to a local newspaper, The River Reporter, and said that the fireworks had startled an eagle. Word eventually reached the Fish and Wildlife Service, and federal officials met with local leaders last week to reiterate the rules and regulations for eagle preservation: no fireworks within a half-mile of a nest if it is in a wooded area; none within a mile of nests in open areas.'"
"'12-07-04,'0','For the second time in a week, a New York appeals court has overturned a conviction of a teenage boy who was arrested after the police found a concealed handgun during a stop-and-frisk encounter.In each case, a panel of five judges in the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court for the First Department ruled that the arresting officer did not have reasonable suspicion to stop and search the boy involved even though an illegal weapon was found.Both panels overturned convictions involving 14-year-old boys arrested in the Bronx in 2010. The court hears appeals of cases in Manhattan and the Bronx.In a 3-to-2 decision last week, the majority opinion said the judges saw ramifications that extended far beyond the case and referred to complaints about and legal challenges to the New York Police Department’s expansive use of stop-and-frisk tactics.In an unrelated reversal announced on Tuesday, a different panel of five judges also split 3 to 2.

"'12-07-04,'0','N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell on Tuesday upheld his decision to suspend Jonathan Vilma, Will Smith, Anthony Hargrove and Scott Fujita for their reported roles in the New Orleans Saints’ bounty scheme.The decision was expected; Goodell had imposed the original discipline. The players had called the league’s allegations that they were involved in a scheme that paid players for injuring opponents “specious,” claimed the N.F.L. had been on a “smear campaign” and dismissed the veracity of the league’s evidence. On June 18, Fujita emerged from an appeal hearing in front of Goodell and said, “I have yet to see anything that implicates me in some pay-to-injure scheme.”Goodell wrote in a letter to the players Tuesday, “none of you has offered any evidence that would warrant reconsideration of your suspensions.” But he noted that if they presented such evidence, their suspensions could still be reduced. Vilma is suspended for the season, Hargrove for eight games, Smith for four and Fujita for three.The players, as instructed by their outside counsel, did not comment during the appeal hearing, did not ask questions, call witnesses or offer counterevidence. They chose instead to question Goodell’s authority to hear the appeal — which had been upheld by two arbitrators — and to question the due process of the appeal.The outside counsel for the players’ union, Richard Smith, has said the league did not make enough of its evidence available, would not release the statements of everyone it had interviewed and did not permit him to cross-examine key witnesses, including the suspended coaches Sean Payton and Gregg Williams.“The commissioner took actions during this process that rendered it impossible for him to be an impartial arbitrator,” the union said in a statement Tuesday.The statement added: “Nothing the league has provided proves these players were participants in a pay-to-injure program. We will continue to pursue all options.”'"
"'12-07-04,'0','PARIS — The French police searched the home and office of former President Nicolas Sarkozy on Tuesday as part of what his lawyer confirmed was the longstanding investigation into allegations of illegal financing in his 2007 presidential campaign.Mr. Sarkozy was in Quebec, on vacation with his family, said the lawyer, Thierry Herzog.The financing inquiry is just one of several investigations Mr. Sarkozy is likely to face now that he has lost presidential immunity. Some of the accusations date from the 1990s, including allegations of kickbacks in a Pakistani submarine deal when he was a budget minister.On Tuesday, the police searched for evidence regarding allegations that staff members working for Liliane Bettencourt, 89, the heiress to the L’Oréal fortune, gave cash-stuffed envelopes to Mr. Sarkozy or his aides to finance his 2007 campaign for president. There are also charges that transfers from Swiss bank accounts used by the Bettencourt family may have gone to Mr. Sarkozy or his campaign. There are strict limits on political contributions from individuals, and they must be recorded.Éric Woerth, a former minister and treasurer of Mr. Sarkozy’s party, the Union for a Popular Movement, has been under investigation since February over allegations that he got illegal campaign financing from Ms. Bettencourt. Mr. Woerth has denied charges of illegal activity.Mr. Sarkozy has also denied all charges of illegal financing. He has said indignantly that he accepted no cash-stuffed envelopes from anyone in the Bettencourt household and that his campaign aides did not, either. Recently, Mr. Sarkozy handed over his diary from the period, when he was interior minister, to the investigating magistrates in an effort to rebut witness accounts that he had attended meetings in the Bettencourt house in the Paris suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he used to be mayor.'"
"'12-07-04,'0','PARIS — The European Commission has said that the proposed purchase of EMI Music by the Universal Music Group would significantly harm competition in the recording industry, indicating that Universal might have to make substantial concessions in order to win approval, according to several people briefed on the matter.The commission sent a so-called statement of objections, said to be close to 200 pages, to Universal last month, spelling out concerns over the market power of a combined Universal and EMI. Universal, already the biggest music company, has agreed to buy the recording arm of EMI, the smallest of the four major industry companies, for $1.9 billion.People who have seen the commission’s complaint, which has not been published, said it was built on concerns outlined in previous statements about the bid, focusing on the digital music marketplace. The commission is said to have disputed Universal’s reasoning in several areas, expressing concern that the combined companies would wield too much power over licensing music to would-be digital services.Universal has maintained that piracy and the growth of legitimate digital businesses like Apple iTunes have reduced the leverage of the record companies in negotiations with licensees. But the commission’s staff, which drew up the statement of objections, was said to have questioned this argument. The commission also reportedly raised issues with Universal’s calculations of market share.Universal is expected to respond to the statement of objections this week, and meetings between company executives and regulators are set to take place in Brussels next week.'"
"'12-07-04,'0','A sudden dip in gas prices in recent weeks spurred interest in larger vehicles, like pickup trucks. The price of a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.32 on Tuesday, compared with $3.59 a month ago, according to a daily survey published by the AAA.“The unseasonal drop in gas prices was a great help in better-than-expected sales in June,” said Jesse Toprak, the chief market analyst at the auto research Web site TrueCar.com.The underlying engine for the industry’s steady recovery continued to be the need by consumers to replace older vehicles. Many prospective car buyers who delayed buying new models during the recession are now flocking to dealer showrooms.“Nearly 11 million sales were lost during the recent recession years, of which there are at least four million new car buyers still waiting to come back to market,” said Lacey Plache, an economist with the Edmunds.com auto site.Detroit’s carmakers benefited from sales of their newest car models and a renewed interest in sport utility vehicles.General Motors, the nation’s largest automaker, said that its sales increased 15.5 percent in June, to 248,750 vehicles, which the company said was its best monthly performance in nearly four years.Chrysler reported a 20.3 percent increase over the previous year, its best June sales since 2007.Ford Motor said its sales for the month rose 7.1 percent, with sport utility vehicles and trucks leading the way.G.M. said all four of its main brands — Chevrolet, GMC, Cadillac and Buick — had double-digit increases during the month, which had 27 selling days versus 26 days in June of last year. The company said its biggest gains were in small cars, particularly sales of a new subcompact, the Chevrolet Sonic, and the Buick Verano sedan.“Across the board, June was a strong month for G.M.,” said Kurt McNeil, head of G.M.’s United States sales. “The combination of new products, available credit, lower fuel prices and modest economic growth was a stronger influence on consumer behavior than economic and political uncertainty.”G.M., he said, expects “moderate, gradual growth” in the auto market through the rest of the year.And the impact of lower gas prices was an unexpected but welcome stimulant for the industry. “It’s another positive sign in this sea of economic uncertainty,” he said.Chrysler said that its passenger car sales increased 42 percent during the month, and its truck and sport utility sales rose 12 percent. Sales of its flagship Chrysler 300 sedan were up 179 percent for the month.Ford’s hottest models were its new S.U.V.’s, which have been redesigned for better fuel efficiency. The company said sales of the small Escape sport utility improved 28 percent and the midsize Explorer increased 34 percent.Toyota and Honda were not alone among foreign automakers in having a successful June. Nissan said that its sales rose 28.2 percent during the month, while the German carmaker Volkswagen said its sales increased 32.1 percent.Edmunds.com said the manufacturers had maintained healthy sales without resorting to heavy discounts and other incentives.Automakers spent an average of $2,187 on incentives per vehicle during June, according to the research site. That represents about a 1.6 percent decline from May.The industry, in fact, is exhibiting unusual discipline by forgoing big summer discounts and incentives, even on models that are being replaced with newer versions in the fall.G.M. and Ford, in particular, have been far less willing to raise discounts and cut into their profit margins. Both companies are relying heavily on revenue and profits in the United States to offset increasingly worse results for their European operations.Last week, Ford said it expected its international losses to triple in the second quarter compared with the first quarter.Investors cheered the unexpectedly strong June sales; shares of G.M. closed up 5.62 percent and Ford was up 2.24 percent on Tuesday.'"
"'12-07-04,'0','Benchmark indexes in the United States and Europe on Tuesday rose to two-month highs and commodities rallied as American factory orders topped estimates and speculation grew that central banks would act to spur growth.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index advanced 0.62 percent to close at 1,374.02 while the Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 1 percent, with both above their highest closes since the first week of May. Corn climbed for a third day as 22 of 24 commodities tracked by the S.& P. GSCI Index advanced. The yen fell against 15 of its 16 major peers, while 10-year Treasury notes retreated.Stocks in the United States extended gains as government data showed factory orders rose in May for the first time in three months, easing concern that manufacturing was faltering.Orders rose 0.7 percent, which followed a revised 0.6 percent drop in April, the Commerce Department said Tuesday in Washington. The median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a rise of 0.1 percent.Bookings for durable goods — those meant to last at least three years — climbed 1.3 percent, also the first gain in three months. They make up just over half of total factory demand. Tuesday’s reading was more than the 1.1 percent gain estimated by the government on June 27. Demand for nondurable goods, including petroleum, increased 0.2 percent.'"
"'12-07-04,'0','The police operation — carried out under New Zealand’s extradition treaty with the United States — seemed designed to attract attention. It was accompanied by uncharacteristically detailed news releases describing the operation, including how officers had cut their way into a panic room to arrest Mr. Dotcom, who, they said, was found sitting near a shotgun.Mr. Dotcom — born Kim Schmitz and also known as Kimble and Kim Tim Jim Vestor — and three others connected with Megaupload were arrested in connection with U.S. indictments on charges involving copyright infringement and money laundering. At the time, the U.S. Department of Justice said that in all, seven people had been arrested around the world in connection with an investigation into online piracy of numerous copyrighted works, including music and films.The Justice Department said the individuals and two companies — Megaupload and Vestor — had been charged with “engaging in a racketeering conspiracy, conspiring to commit copyright infringement, conspiring to commit money laundering and two substantive counts of criminal copyright infringement.”This month, Mr. Dotcom’s U.S. lawyers are set to appear before a Virginia judge in a bid to have the criminal case against the company dismissed. According to a document on his lawyers’ Web site, they will argue, among other points, that the indictments are invalid because they must be submitted to a company’s U.S. office, which Megaupload has never had.Even if it is successful, the case against Mr. Dotcom and the other defendants would proceed.The four men arrested in New Zealand are still free on bail, awaiting an extradition hearing, which is scheduled to begin Aug. 6.Mr. Dotcom has had other brushes with the law. He was convicted of insider trading in Germany in 2002 in what was at the time the largest such case.Among the items seized by the police in the January raids were 18 luxury vehicles worth 6 million dollars — including a Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe and a 1959 pink Cadillac — computers and as much as 11 million dollars in cash.Mr. Dotcom said in an e-mail interview that he had been treated badly by the New Zealand police and the government, which he said he believed was simply kowtowing to U.S. requests.“Two helicopters and 76 heavily armed officers to arrest a man alleged of copyright crimes — think about that,” he wrote. “Hollywood is importing their movie scripts into the real world and sends armed forces to protect their outdated business model.”In February, the New Zealand police defended the operation, saying it had been in line with a risk assessment and there had been only “20 or 30” officers involved in the raid on the mansion.After a month of prison, Mr. Dotcom was eventually granted bail, despite prosecutors’ arguments that he was a serious flight risk. Over the following months his lawyers won a series of hearings to loosen the bail conditions and free up some of his confiscated cash to cover expenses.The biggest victory came last Thursday, when a High Court judge ruled the New Zealand police had used the wrong type of search warrant, so the entire raid had been illegal. Mr. Dotcom’s lawyers are due back in the Auckland High Court on Wednesday, seeking the return of seized assets and data.Gavin Ellis, a senior political studies lecturer at the University of Auckland, said that over time the public had become less supportive of the police operation.“Initially there was a sort of a ‘gee, whiz’ reaction. ‘Wow, look what the police have done, they’ve got this alleged master criminal,”’ Mr. Ellis said. “But then, as the media perception of him and the media portrayal of him changed, looking backward those things started to look heavy-handed.”While Mr. Dotcom’s lawyers were making steady progress in court, Mr. Dotcom was gaining the public’s favor. A headline on the news Web site Stuff.co.nz in May read, “Dotcom’s straight talk wins over Kiwis.”“There’s been a clear shift in the characterization of him, from this assumed criminality or alleged criminality, to a cult hero,” Mr. Ellis said.Mr. Dotcom gave his first television interview in March to the national current-affairs show “Campbell Live,” which dedicated its full half-hour program to the topic. He appeared affable and composed, speaking articulately in near-perfect English, with a German accent that was noticeable but not strong.During that interview he described the U.S. indictment against him as “nothing more than a press release filled with things out of context, designed to make me look as bad as possible.”Speaking by e-mail on Monday, Mr. Dotcom said he was a “larger than life character,” but he said he had not sought fame or notoriety.“The people of New Zealand have made my family and me feel very welcome,” he wrote. “They know that I have been treated unfairly. They know that the N.Z. leadership does anything to please the United States.”“I used to respect the United States and the American dream,” he said. “Now I consider the United States the biggest threat to Internet freedom and peace in the world.”Three months after his arrest, Mr. Dotcom gained more public approval when he waded into the political arena himself.He disclosed a donation of 50,000 dollars that he had made to a right-leaning member of Parliament, John Banks, during Mr. Banks’s failed 2010 campaign for mayor of Auckland. Mr. Dotcom said Mr. Banks had phoned to thank him for the contribution, despite the donation’s listing as anonymous.The political storm that followed dominated the news for several days and threatened to upset the country’s coalition government, of which Mr. Banks is a small but strategically important part.All of this worked in Mr. Dotcom’s favor as well, Dr. Ellis believed, because many people “love to hate” Mr. Banks and his party.Mr. Banks’s press secretary, Shelley Mackey, said he maintained that the donations had been anonymous, that he had adhered to the law, and that he was looking forward to the outcome of a police investigation into the matter.But Mr. Dotcom said by e-mail he had considered Mr. Banks a friend and he wished the political fracas had never happened.“In terms of changing the perception of Kim Dotcom, you couldn’t pick a better politician,” Dr. Ellis said. “It’s all fitted into the increasing legitimization of Kim Dotcom, or the acceptability of Kim Dotcom. It was almost as if the gods were smiling on him,” he added.Until recently, Mr. Dotcom was forbidden to use the Internet under his bail conditions.After the court granted him access he began using Twitter on June 19, amassing more than 46,000 followers in just two weeks. John Key, New Zealand’s prime minister, has about 52,000.Mr. Dotcom has become a prolific user of social media, posting photos of his family as well as mocking the police operation and the legal case against him.He has also used Twitter and his newly relaxed bail conditions to increase his public profile, posting photos of himself at a popular concert, at the screening of a television show and attending a protest march against the closure of a state-financed television channel.Asked why he had become so active online, Mr. Dotcom said he was using the most efficient way to respond to all the good-will messages he had received.The day after #swimatkims, Mr. Dotcom said in a Twitter post that the event would return for “everybody.”'"
"'12-07-04,'0','Ask around, and it’s rare that you’ll find a leading light in the culinary world who doesn’t have a semi-secret fondness for at least one of these supermarket stalwarts, whether Hellmann’s mayonnaise or Skippy peanut butter, Premium saltines or Oreos or Cheerios, American cheese or generic ice-cream sandwiches.“There is something to be said about all those things,” said Dan Kluger, the chef at ABC Kitchen, whose Web site proclaims that the New York restaurant is “passionately committed to offering the freshest organic and local ingredients possible.”A lot of grocery-store staples “may not be organic,” he added. “They may not be the best products in terms of our environment and G.M.O.’s and all those kinds of things, but we kind of grew up with them, and you can’t help but revert back to them in a pinch.”Besides, said Wylie Dufresne, the chef at WD-50 in New York: “It’s actually a fuller life to try all that stuff. I would rather not be pious about things.”He should know. While creating his playfully surreal reinterpretations of American cuisine, Mr. Dufresne powers himself through a day in the kitchen by dipping into a ready stockpile of American cheese slices.“I like all cheese, but my guiltiest pleasure is definitely American cheese,” he said. “We have it in the restaurant all the time. The guys know that they need to stock Land O’Lakes American, or Chef will not be pleased. I’ve got probably four five-pound blocks of it in my walk-in right now. I’m constantly snacking on it.”Years ago, while working for the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten at the Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas, he would fold a slice in half and spoon in a smear of steak tartare. “American cheese is the perfect soft taco,” Mr. Dufresne said.His habit might sound like one iconoclastic chef’s personal quirk. It turns out, though, that top chefs across the country — in Atlanta and Boston and even the high-minded precincts of Portlandia — are more than willing to own up to a particular corporate-food crush.Michael Chiarello is an organic vintner and a spirited advocate for the integrity of straight-from-the-soil California cooking, but if you were to poke around in his pantry in the Napa Valley, he said, you’d find, “behind the almond butter and the hazelnut butter and the organic peanut butter with two ounces of oil on the top you have to stir up every time you want a sammy,” an aqua-topped jar of Skippy.As an avid cyclist who often depends on peanut butter sandwiches for sustenance on long rides, Mr. Chiarello has a grievance with organic peanut butter. He equates it to “swallowing chalk.”“I about fell off my bike trying to eat an organic peanut butter and banana sandwich, because you’re just choking,” he said. “There’s not enough water in your water bottle to get it down. You’ve got to smack yourself in the back of the head.”Does Tony Maws conjure up his own aioli at Craigie on Main, his restaurant in Cambridge, Mass.? Of course he does. But the chef also calls himself “a complete sucker for Hellmann’s mayonnaise,” and can’t shake memories of dipping leaves of pressure-cooked artichokes into a cool jar of Hellmann’s when he was a kid.“No other mayonnaise was acceptable in my house,” Mr. Maws said. “I’m also a sucker for Fritos. If I get in a car and I’m driving somewhere, there’s a bag of Fritos. I don’t know why. At the restaurant I make my own chips.”Food & Wine magazine recently picked Jenn Louis to join its latest crop of Best New Chefs for her cooking at two restaurants, Lincoln and Sunshine Tavern, in Portland, Ore., a city so zealously fixated on food sourcing that it has become an easy target for parody. Ms. Louis herself tends to eat in the conscious, healthy way she ate while growing up in Southern California. But she, too, has a weak spot or two.“Occasionally if there’s an ice cream truck going by, I love the old-school ice cream sandwiches,” she said. “We have great local ice cream up here. They don’t taste like that. But it’s very nostalgic. I really like how you peel the wrapper and you kind of lick around that rectangular ice cream sticking out of the little chocolate cookies.”Tellingly, perhaps, Ms. Louis is 40. A lot of chefs making waves right now grew up in the 1970s and ’80s, which means that, even if they had nutritionally vigilant parents, they developed their palates during a golden age for the unquestioned dominance of mass-produced treats and condiments.Americans tend to ask a lot more questions now: Is this beef grass-fed? Are those heirloom tomatoes?Thinking locally, growing organically and cooking with a farm-to-fork philosophy have indisputably raised the level of gastronomic dialogue in this country, but at times they’ve also fostered a sense of polarization.Aaron Bobrow-Strain, the author of an exhaustive new social history called “White Bread,” recalls buying a loaf of Wonder Bread (for book research) at a grocery counter in Walla Walla, Wash., where he lives, and getting a glare from a fellow citizen.“He looked at me like I was buying meth,” Mr. Bobrow-Strain said. “That’s when it struck me that this is about more than taste or health.”The way he sees it, arguments about food too often degenerate into a false duality between “the virtuous people” and “the pitiful people in need of saving who just can’t make the right decisions.”Phil Lempert, an industry analyst who bills himself as the Supermarket Guru, sees some of the stringent focus on “only local, only organic” as unrealistic, and out of step with how most people actually eat. “Unfortunately, in our food world, we think in terms of extremes,” he said. “That if it’s on a supermarket shelf and commercial, it’s bad. If somebody’s making it in their basement, not adhering to any food-safety standards or whatever else, it’s got to be good. We’ve got to relax just a little bit. And understand that there’s something in between.”Whether it’s Dan Barber on the East Coast or David Kinch on the West, chefs have played a pivotal role in elevating the dialogue about agriculture in the United States. But for some elite cooks, virtue doesn’t automatically delight the tongue. Proudly “house-made” ketchup can be found in ramekins at hundreds of brunch spots these days, but many chefs don’t actually like it.“I don’t want your house-made ketchup,” said Erik Anderson, who, with his fellow chef Josh Habiger, runs the kitchen at the buzzed-about Catbird Seat in Nashville. “I’m sorry. I’m sure it’s delicious, but it’s not the taste I’m looking for with my eggs.”Gabrielle Hamilton, the chef and owner of Prune, in the East Village, pointed out that as noble as it may be, house-made ketchup never seems to replicate the taste and consistency that our palates often expect.“They put too much cinnamon stick in it, or cloves,” she said. “It tastes like pie filling. They want it to taste like Heinz, and they can’t figure it out.”Linton Hopkins has tried. At the Holeman & Finch Public House in Atlanta, a restaurant that’s famous for (among other things) its double cheeseburgers, and at the nearby Restaurant Eugene, the 45-year-old chef created a house-made mix after becoming obsessed with replicating the flavor and flow of Heinz.“We make our own ketchup, but I used Heinz as our model,” he said. “Heinz just nails the umami of ketchup better than anybody. I personally spent weeks on the project, testing batches and matching it up against Heinz.”He has experimented, too, with echoing the crunch of a Ritz cracker. “One goal of mine is the saltine,” he said. “We haven’t accomplished that yet, but I love the saltine cracker.”And sometimes he simply incorporates a brand-name product itself, instead of trying to hatch its small-batch clone. “I use Coke all the time in our cooking,” he said. “I use it in barbecue sauce. Coke has a lot of aromatics in it. We rub it on suckling pig.”To his thinking, category-killers like Coke and Heinz have earned a place, whether you like it or not, as a central part of the American culinary landscape. “There’s nothing wrong with that,” he said. “Part of it is the fun of celebrating Americana and not turning an elitist eye to everything we do in America.”On some menus, that dab of supermarket-sourced ingredients can give a dish an extra layer of depth, even a wink to the past. At ABV Wine Bar in Manhattan, the chef, Corey Cova, is serving a “foie gras fluffernutter” that summons up the sticky smush of that Generation X after-school snack, all the way down to a bed of Wonder Bread.At Prune, Ms. Hamilton has long relied on Pepperidge Farm white bread to make the restaurant’s shrimp toast. To do so was a “researched and curated” decision, she said; she ran scores of breads through the hot-oil gantlet to see which one worked best.“It’s the only one that stands up in the fryer,” she said. “It’s got excellent structure. Nothing else does it.”So what if it wasn’t baked by a squadron of bearded, monastic Brooklynites using a sacred strain of yeast that can be traced back to the Last Supper.“Some of these things are correct and delicious on their own terms,” Ms. Hamilton said. “They don’t need to be apologized for.”'"

"'12-07-05,'0','“The B.B.A. represents the interests of the big banks,” said Andrew Hilton, the director of the Center for the Study of Financial Innovation, a London-based research group that looks at financial issues. “It does not represent the interests of borrowers or the financial system at large.”Barclays did not make Mr. Agius, who is leading the executive committee until a new chief executive is appointed, available for comment.In the early days of Libor, starting in the late 1960s and into the 1980s, the fact that the rate banks used to borrow money was set and governed by a small group of like-minded bankers based in London was not seen as a problem. In fact, according to Minos A. Zombanakis, a former banker at Manufacturers Hanover who says he made the very first loan based on Libor by inventing the product on the fly, it was a sense of responsibility and trust between banks that underpinned the rate’s success.Mr. Zombanakis, who is 85 years old and retired in his home country of Greece, recalls that first Libor loan — $80 million extended by a group of banks to Iran — as if it were yesterday.“We had to fix a rate, so I called up all the banks and asked them to send to me by 11 a.m. their cost of money,” he said. “We got the rates, I made an average of them all and I named it the London interbank offer rate.”For more than 15 years, the banks set the rate more or less as Mr. Zombanakis described — by throwing out the highest and lowest rates and compiling an average of the remaining ones.Then, in 1986, the British Bankers’ Association was asked by its member banks to assist in the setting of the benchmark rate. It has overseen the process ever since, even as the club of gentlemen bankers making syndicated loans in the City of London evolved into the opaque and impersonal multitrillion-dollar interbank market.Regulators estimate that the Libor rate now supports more than $500 trillion worth of transactions ranging from simple mortgages to risky derivatives.According to the association’s Web site, the body within the trade group that has the “sole responsibility for all aspects of the functioning and development of bbalibor,” as the group refers to Libor, is called the foreign exchange and money markets committee. That committee is composed largely of bankers and financial professionals, according to association officials.The committee meets at least every other month. The meetings are open to regulators and central bankers from around the world, although they do not attend on a regular basis.In what would seem to be a conflict, the committee chairman is a representative from the panel of banks, which includes some of the world’s biggest institutions — like Barclays, Citigroup and UBS — that submits the rates that become the Libor average.In recent years, as questions have been raised about the accuracy of Libor, the bankers’ association has taken steps to create a Chinese wall of sorts to separate its core lobbying function from its crucial role as an independent setter of interest rates.According to Brian Mairs, a spokesman for the association, the Libor oversight committee is now deemed to be independent from the association and is overseen by a board distinct from the association’s board from which Mr. Agius resigned this week.And yet, the Libor committee’s ties to the trade association remain strong. Much of its work overseeing Libor is done by John Ewan, a senior association official who acts as secretary to the committee although he is not a member of it.While the chairman of the Libor board is Gordon Pell, a former top executive at the Royal Bank of Scotland, the board also includes four senior association officials, including its departing chief executive, Angela Knight, and Mr. Ewan.The association issued a statement last week saying it was “shocked” by the charges against Barclays and would begin discussions with the relevant authorities over how Libor should be supervised in the future.In its report on the rate-fixing scandal, Britain’s main banking regulator, the Financial Services Authority, did not place direct blame on the association. The report said that once it became clear in 2007 that some banks were putting in false rates, the British Bankers’ Association committee conducted an investigation to assess whether the controls it had in place were sufficient.Still, the group’s conclusion in 2008 that the contributing banks were “confident that their submissions reflect their perception of their true costs of borrowing,” stands in stark contrast to what regulators have discovered Barclays was doing at the time.British and American regulators are continuing to investigate. Other big banks that are said to be under scrutiny include UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland.Angus Armstrong, a former official at the British Treasury who is now director of research at National Institute of Economic and Social Research, a research organization, argues that the markets that use Libor have become too large and complex for the rate to be set and governed under the longstanding method. Central banks, he noted, use the rate as a benchmark when they intervene in the market, making it extremely important from a regulatory perspective.“It is perhaps an anomaly that the B.B.A., an organization representing the banking industry, is solely responsible for overseeing an interest rate process that is of such wide importance,” Mr. Armstrong said.With other banks soon to be implicated in the Libor scandal, it may be that the mutual trust that long underpinned the rate-setting process no longer holds. “I was surprised to see a bank like Barclays do this. In my time there was an ethic and you assumed that everyone was a gentleman,” Mr. Zombanakis, the Libor pioneer, said. “But I guess it was inevitable — as the market got bigger and bigger, things got out of control.”'"

"'12-07-05,'0','“Hailey may not be the only one who did that, but he was the first one to get caught,” said the United States attorney for Maryland, Rod J. Rosenstein.Congress created the fuel credit program in 2007 to help wean the nation off foreign oil and bolster the fledging biofuel industry by requiring oil producers to either blend their fuel with biodiesel or buy credits.Biodiesel producers registered with the E.P.A., and every gallon of fuel they produced generated a number known as an R.I.N. The numbers are bought and sold by traders, who broker deals with petroleum companies that need to fulfill their renewable fuel obligations.But Mr. Hailey and at least two other companies discovered that they could sell credits without making any fuel.Mr. Hailey registered his Baltimore-area company, Clean Green Fuel L.L.C., with the E.P.A. in 2009, claiming that he would produce 20 million gallons of biodiesel each year in the garage by recycling cooking oil purchased from thousands of area restaurants.He set up a convincing Web site and began making sales through traders, many of whom were young and eager to enter a fledgling market. Mr. Hailey sold more than 32 million credits’ worth, about $9 million, to companies like ConocoPhillips.He bluffed to buyers, bragging in a recorded call about his state-of-the-art technology and (fictitious) engineering background. E.P.A. inspectors visited his properties but found no sign of production. The United States attorney’s office filed charges late last year, and a unanimous jury took less than two hours to convict Mr. Hailey. Sentencing is in October.Mr. Hailey’s fraud had almost comic elements to it. There was the spasm of outlandish spending on diamond jewelry and charter jets to Hawaii and Florida. He snapped up real estate. He amassed a fleet of luxury cars, including a Rolls-Royce, three Ferraris, two Bentleys, a Lamborghini, a Maserati and more than a dozen others, and parked some of the cars in front of his house in a Baltimore suburb, according to prosecutors. He so upset his neighbors that they called the county police, who conferred with a federal financial crimes task force. As it turned out, the E.P.A. had been investigating Mr. Hailey for months.“There is no prize for being the least clever criminal on your block,” the prosecutor, Stefan D. Cassella, said in his closing arguments.The scheme, and others like it, has had serious repercussions for both the biofuel industry and for conventional petroleum manufacturers.Fraud like Mr. Hailey’s has sown distrust of all biodiesel producers, virtually freezing the market for credits, and putting many small producers in danger of shutting down.“This has been an absolutely devastating blow to our industry,” said Jennifer Case, chief executive officer of New Leaf Biofuel L.L.C. in San Diego, who testified in Mr. Hailey’s trial.The two other companies accused of issuing fake credits have not been charged.Charles T. Drevna, president of American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers, said the fraud had hurt the case for credits.“The question for the industry is, who do you trust?” he said. “We can’t trust some of the R.I.N. producers. We can’t trust the E.P.A. registry.”Petroleum producers were incensed to find out that the agency had been allowing Clean Green trades to continue even while investigating Mr. Hailey.Environmental officials declined to comment beyond a statement released after Mr. Hailey’s guilty verdict, which the agency called “a significant step forward in ensuring the integrity of the renewable fuels credit market.”Ben Evans, a spokesman for the National Biodiesel Board, a trade group, said the program was “working very well,” but he admitted that such cases had disrupted the industry and acknowledged there might still be undiscovered fraud.He pointed to new industry safeguards, such as a voluntary monitoring and auditing system for biodiesel producers.“Some bad actors came in and took advantage of an industry and a public program set up to do public good,” he said. “We’re going to crack down on it and move on.”'"
"'12-07-05,'0','VATICAN CITY (AP) — The Vatican got a report card Wednesday on its efforts to be more financially transparent — but it remains a secret for now.A committee of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, France, adopted a report by independent inspectors examining the Vatican’s efforts to comply with international standards to fight money laundering and the financing of terrorists.The evaluators made a preliminary report, and during a meeting on Wednesday of the panel, known as the Moneyval committee, it was amended by governments represented on the committee, as often occurs.But neither the Vatican nor the Council of Europe would disclose the results, saying that the committee’s procedures forbid it. The full report will be released in about a month.The Vatican submitted to the evaluation process in a bid to shed its image as a financially shady tax haven. Since then, it has written and rewritten a law criminalizing money laundering, created a financial watchdog agency and ratified three anti-crime United Nations treaties.The measures are intended to comply with recommendations of the financial action task force, which is based in Paris and helps develop measures to combat financial crimes.'"

As a result of the disease, 62 children have been admitted to hospitals, and 61 of them have died. The illnesses start with a high fever.

"'12-07-05,'0','Human Rights Watch said Wednesday that it had found serious human rights abuses in the mass trials of Bangladeshi paramilitary border guards accused of participating in a 2009 mutiny, including the deaths of at least 47 suspects from maltreatment in detention. The group said in a report that the violations included widespread beatings and electric shocks. About 3,000 border guards are currently on trial in the mutiny, in which 74 people, including 57 military commanders, died. The group’s Asia director, Brad Adams, called the trial process “fundamentally flawed” and said suspects had been interrogated in secret locations. M. Sohail, a spokesman for the Rapid Action Battalion, a paramilitary force said to be involved in many of the abuses, rejected the accusations and called the report baseless.'"
"'12-07-05,'0','TORONTO (AP) — Canada’s competition watchdog and Ontario’s securities regulator on Wednesday approved a 3.8 billion Canadian dollar ($3.75 billion) bid by a group of financial institutions to take over the operator of the Toronto Stock Exchange and merge it with two other exchanges.The Maple Group Acquisition Corporation, which made the bid, will be permitted to operate a combined exchange and clearing group involving the TMX Group, along with the alternative Alpha Trading Systems and the Canadian Depository for Securities.TMX and Alpha control about 85 percent of all stock trades in Canada, raising some concerns that the merger would give too much power to a single market and clearing operator controlled by Canada’s big financial institutions.Canada’s Competition Bureau said that despite its concerns, it would not challenge Maple Group Acquisition’s proposed takeover of the TMX Group. The Ontario Securities Commission also gave its approval. However, the proposed takeover and mergers remain under review by the British Columbia and Alberta securities commissions.The investors in Maple Group Acquisition include 13 of Canada’s largest financial heavyweights like the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, several banks and Manulife Financial.'"
"'12-07-05,'0','Experts know the percentage plays of numerous suit combinations. But occasionally the bidding suggests that the normal line will not work. Then some improvisation is required.Look at the spade suit in the diagramed deal. With no help from the auction, how should you play it for only one loser?This deal occurred last month during a duplicate at Honors Bridge Club in Manhattan. North and South were Arthur Loeb and Glenn Eisenstein.In the bidding Loeb gambled slightly, making a takeout double with only a doubleton club. Note that Eisenstein then jumped to two spades. That would normally promise 9 to 11 points, but since he was a passed hand, you subtract some two points from those numbers. Also, he had a good hand, with an expected double fit in the black suits if partner had four spades. North was happy to jump to game, having a hand replete with aces.West started the defense with his two top diamonds, South ruffing the second with his spade six.The textbooks will tell you that for one spade loser, cash the ace, then lead low to the queen. But as you can see, that would not have worked here. Since West was a favorite to hold the spade king, declarer had to decide if it was a doubleton or a tripleton.When South led a club to dummy’s ace at Trick 3, West played the nine. If West were short in clubs, he was more likely to have three spades than two. So declarer now led dummy’s spade four and covered East’s deuce with his five.'"
"'12-07-05,'0','Groups representing movie studios, publishers, record labels and other rights holders bemoaned the outcome, saying protesters had twisted the debate to make the treaty seem more menacing than it actually is. The vote, they added, would hurt efforts to reduce online copyright theft, potentially costing Europe jobs at a time when it desperately needs them.The Parliament “has given in to pressure from anti-copyright groups despite calls from thousands of companies and workers in manufacturing and creative sectors who have called for ACTA to be signed in order that their rights as creators be protected,” said Angela Mills Wade, executive director of the European Publishers Council.Publishers and other copyright owners, like the Motion Picture Association, the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry and the Business Software Alliance, were hoping that ACTA would provide them with a powerful tool to pursue rights violations, especially in developing countries, where enforcement can be lax.But opposition to ACTA spread online after word emerged several years ago that governments were negotiating the pact behind closed doors. Scare stories spread, with bloggers talking of alarming proposals to let border guards search airline passengers’ iPods for pirated music.The final agreement, signed by the U.S. government last autumn, includes no such measures.Still, opponents say it could provide a legitimate international framework for anti-piracy tactics they abhor, like the three-strikes system in France, under which repeat offenders face the suspension of their Internet access. The pact also calls for Internet service providers to take steps to enforce copyright, something they have generally resisted on the grounds that they are mere conduits for digital traffic.“That would require a major and unhealthy shift in how the Internet works,” said Monique Goyens, director general of BEUC, the European Consumers’ Organization, in Brussels. “It would establish a de facto and evidently unwilling Internet police.”The vote was not even close, with 478 members of Parliament opposing the treaty, only 39 supporting it and 146 abstaining, yet it leaves considerable uncertainty. Under E.U. law, the treaty cannot go into effect without the Parliament’s endorsement.“It’s a crushing victory,” said Jérémie Zimmermann, spokesman for La Quadrature du Net, a group in Paris that was active in the treaty protests. “It’s a political symbol on an enormous scale, in which citizens of the world, connected by the Internet, have managed to defeat these powerful, entrenched industries.”The European Commission, which represented the 27 member states of the European Union in the negotiations, had already suspended efforts to ratify the pact, amid the outpouring of public anger. Instead, it referred the agreement to the European Court of Justice to determine whether it was lawful.Karel De Gucht, the European trade commissioner, said the commission would wait for the court’s ruling, which could take several months, before consulting with trade partners on how to proceed.“It’s clear that the question of protecting intellectual property does need to be addressed on a global scale,” he said in a statement. “With the rejection of ACTA, the need to protect the backbone of Europe’s economy across the globe — our innovation, our creativity, our ideas, our intellectual property — does not disappear.”Carol J. Guthrie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. trade representative, said the other ACTA signatories could still put the agreement into effect, even without E.U. involvement.“In that case, ACTA’s membership may initially be more Pacific-oriented than would be true with E.U. participation,” she said. “It is unfortunate that there has been so much misrepresentation of ACTA, because its language explicitly preserves free expression and privacy while fighting commercial-scale intellectual property theft. There continues to be a need for international cooperation on these issues, and the ACTA can still serve as a valuable forum through which countries can coordinate to stop counterfeit trade and piracy.”'"
"'12-07-05,'0','Indeed, Peiper hurtles along each stage in a station wagon with his fellow director and team manager Jonathan Vaughters. Armed with information on pieces of paper taped to the dashboard and loaded on BlackBerry screens, the two relay tactical advice and motivation to riders.Another sport director, Bingen Fernandez, drives behind in a second wagon charged with handling emergencies, like the crash suffered by the team leader, Ryder Hesjedal, on Tuesday.Driving may be hazardous at times, particularly on twisting mountain roads, but it is a relatively easy part of the job. It is through meticulous behind-the-scenes preparation that sport directors earn their keep.Peiper, who competed in the Tour five times in the 1980s and ’90s, is known as a master of detail.When he was the sport director for the HTC-Highroad team, starting in 2008, Peiper’s planning helped pace the British sprinter Mark Cavendish to 20 Tour de France stage wins in four years.“He’s Mr. Logistics,” said Brian Holm, the Omega Pharma-Quick Step sport director, who worked alongside Peiper at HTC-Highroad.In advance of the Tour, Peiper creates a spreadsheet that includes vital information about each of the race’s 20 stages, from broader tactical notes to details like where the riders should pick up raincoats in the event of a wet mountain descent. The file is his bible during the race. Every morning, Peiper reviews the spreadsheet and runs over stage tactics, writing down roles for each of the nine Garmin-Sharp riders on a piece of paper. At the breakfast table, and later on the team bus, he spells out to each cyclist what he has planned.“I want to give them a general sense of their roles for the conditions so they can know up front what they need to do,” Peiper said. “People need clear direction.”This extends to the team’s support staff, too. Each evening after the racing ends, Peiper consults with mechanics, massage therapists and sport scientists. He also double-checks that the bus driver, Andrea Bisogno, has correct directions to the start of the next stage.On previous teams, Peiper has also been in charge of logistics like paying the hotel bill; this year, that task has been delegated to Fernandez.Fernandez, a 39-year-old Spaniard, joined Garmin-Sharp as a sport director in 2010 after retiring from a 14-year cycling career with Spanish and French teams.He has been lucky — in his first season as a director, he worked the Tour de France. Others have had to make their way to the top from small teams, where the organization is not always first-rate.In the late 1990s, Team Sky’s Sean Yates had his first directing job with a team sponsored by Linda McCartney’s line of prepared vegetarian foods. It was short-lived position, he said, that “went to pot” as a result of poor business management by the team owner, Julian Clark, who was later jailed for fraud.Yates, like Fernandez, Vaughters, Peiper and most sport directors, is a former professional cyclist, although some sport directors never raced professionally, like BMC Racing’s John Lelangue and the now-notorious Manolo Saiz of ONCE. As in most professional sports, it is the support riders, not the stars, who often become the best coaches.“There are plenty of top riders who could never be a successful director because they lack a bit of empathy or an understanding of the broader picture,” Vaughters said.Vaughters, a Colorado native who was once a teammate of Lance Armstrong’s, started his postracing career last decade as a director of under-23 riders. Working with young riders is about establishing proper habits: when to eat on the bike, how to get enough sleep.The professionals, he said, are already fully formed. “You’re just trying to make little tweaks, one degree this way, one degree that,” he said.In this age of increasing rider salaries and media attention, being a good manager of talent is essential.Peiper has earned respect this year by spending time helping his riders achieve goals. On the Monday before the Tour’s start, Peiper and the team’s top sprinter, Tyler Farrar — who both live in Belgium — rode their bikes to the Stage 2 finish in Tournai, Belgium, and reconnoitered the final kilometers.And last November, Peiper, Vaughters and Fernandez sat down with Hesjedal, a Canadian, to help him map out the training plan that led to his victory in the Giro d’Italia, the team’s first individual Grand Tour title, in May.“The hardest part was that I had to give up aspirations for early races,” said Hesjedal, who spent January and February away from competition, training at his home in Hawaii. “But that’s part of the process.”Not everyone in cycling is as attuned to riders’ needs as Peiper, though. Johan Bruyneel, the Radioshack-Nissan-Trek director, alienated his star riders Andy and Frank Schleck earlier this season when he publicly questioned their work ethic. Unhappy at his management style, the brothers, from Luxembourg, are thought to be seeking separation from Bruyneel, who was also recently charged by the United States Anti-Doping Agency with running a doping conspiracy during his time as director of Armstrong’s Tour de France teams.For Garmin-Sharp, Peiper’s attention to planning is a far cry from last season. In early 2011, Vaughters fired the head sport director, Matt White, and was unable to find a replacement.Last July, Vaughters played the role of both head sport director and team manager, a position that consists of, among other responsibilities, brokering sponsor deals and signing riders.“You’re looking at a map, you’re looking at a contract and then you’re like, oh, wait, I’m driving a car,” he said. “It’s not sustainable.”For many of professional cycling’s elder statesmen, like the Team BMC Racing manager Jim Ochowicz, this was life on the Tour a few decades ago. Ochowicz, who ran the American squads 7-Eleven and Motorola, first went to the race in the mid-1980s as both manager and sport director.As cycling has become richer, he said, the managerial roles have become “more specialized.” The advent of technology, including digital navigation, race radios and plush buses, has changed sport directors’ jobs, too.“Back then we didn’t have buses, we would stop in a cafe before the race,” Ochowicz said. “Riders would get out of the cars and change clothes and we would sit in the cafe and look at maps.”Despite the new luxuries, the stress of working nonstop for three weeks is still the same.Though riders have five hours a day to hammer out their frustrations on the pedals, sport directors have little time for personal needs. Peiper combats the deluge by rising at dawn for a jog. When he can sneak away in the mornings, Team Sky’s Yates gets on his bike for a one-and-a-half-hour ride.“There aren’t many guys who do that,” he said. “It’s a release for me.”Finding time to eat and drink is a challenge, too. Standing outside his team’s bus on Sunday in Liège, Belgium, the Team BMC director John Lelangue chugged a mini-can of Coca-Cola Light, the European version of Diet Coke. Nearby, Ochowicz snacked on a peach while talking with reporters.Peiper, not one to leave anything to chance, has masseurs prepare sandwiches for directors to take in the cars each stage. A vegetarian since his racing days in the early 1980s, he swears off the cured meats that are ubiquitous in France.Things can, and do, go wrong in the face of careful preparation, however. In the days leading up to the race, Team Europcar’s Jean-René Bernaudeau found himself unexpectedly spending extra time with the news media, defending his team from a report that the team used corticosteroids during last year’s race.Holm, the sport director of Omega Pharma-Quick Step, has had a devastating beginning to the Tour.One of his team’s top riders, the German Tony Martin, fractured his left wrist at the outset of the first stage Sunday; later that day, Jerome Pineau of France bruised his arm running into a photo-snapping spectator who had wandered onto the course. To make matters worse, the team’s two hopes for the general classification, the American Levi Leipheimer and Peter Velits of Slovakia, lost valuable time that day to contenders like Bradley Wiggins.How is Holm coping with all the early disaster? Not well.“I’m getting less sleep, more worries,” he said.Peiper, like Holm, knows that this is just part of working the Tour. It is cycling’s marquee event — a three-week test that brings unexpected challenges.The key to success, he said, is experience and foresight.“You don’t learn to be a D.S. overnight; there are a lot of things to take into consideration,” Peiper said, referring to the French term directeur sportif. “You have to try and look a stage or two ahead, and you have to try to keep your cool.”ROUEN, France (AP) —Andre Greipel of Germany led a bunch sprint to win the fourth stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday, after several riders — including the world champion Mark Cavendish of Britain — were involved in a late crash.The Swiss rider Fabian Cancellara avoided the trouble and retained the overall lead for a fifth day after the 133-mile race along the English Channel from Abbeville to Rouen.With less than two miles left, Cavendish went down in a crash — scraping up his rainbow-colored jersey of world champion. He got back on his bicycle and rode gingerly to finish the stage.With Cavendish out of the picture, Greipel burst out of the depleted group of sprinters and sped to the straightaway finish, a split second ahead of Alessandro Petacchi of Italy and the Dutch rider Tom Veelers.“This is what we wanted; it’s a good victory,” Greipel said after his 14th victory in all competitions this year. He said he did not pay much attention to the late crash.“I heard something behind me, but 60 kilometers per hour, you don’t worry about what happened behind,” Greipel, a Lotto-Belisol rider, said in an interview with France-2 television.According to the Tour rule book, riders who get delayed by a crash in the last three kilometers of the race are awarded the same time as the stage winner.Cancellara won the opening-day prologue Saturday and has worn the yellow jersey ever since. Over all he leads Bradley Wiggins of Britain by seven seconds.The defending champion Cadel Evans of Australia was 17 seconds off the pace in seventh place.Thursday’s fifth stage promises another bunch sprint, after a mostly flat 122-mile course from Rouen to Saint-Quentin north of Paris.'"
"'12-07-05,'0','LONDON — A private investigator who has been a central player in Britain’s phone hacking scandal lost a bid at the Supreme Court on Wednesday to remain silent about who commissioned him to intercept voice mail messages on behalf of The News of the World, Rupert Murdoch’s now-defunct tabloid.The ruling, by five Supreme Court judges, could open the way to further disclosures about the names and stature of the people who supervised the investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, and possibly show the extent to which the scandal reached into the News of the World management.Mr. Mulcaire had argued that he had a right to remain silent about who commissioned him to avoid self-incrimination.The judges issued their ruling in the case of Nicola Phillips, the personal assistant to a well-known publicist, Max Clifford, who has said her voice mail was intercepted. The judges ruled that Mr. Mulcaire was not protected by the right to remain silent and had three weeks to tell Ms. Phillips who had asked him to hack her voice mail.The scandal has seared a broad path through the British press, police and political elite and forced Mr. Murdoch into key business decisions, including the closure of the 168-year-old News of the World last summer and the abandonment of a $12 billion bid to assume full control of Britain’s biggest satellite broadcaster.Around 60 people have been arrested, and on Wednesday police officials said three more people had been detained in a related investigation into the corruption of public officials. Most of those arrested have not been charged and all were granted bail.'"

He got back on his bicycle and rode gingerly to finish the stage.With Cavendish out of the picture, Greipel burst out of the depleted group of sprinters and sped to the straightaway finish, a split second ahead of Alessandro Petacchi of Italy and the Dutch rider Tom Veelers.“This is what we wanted; it’s a good victory,” Greipel said after his 14th victory in all competitions this year. He said he did not pay much attention to the late crash.“I heard something behind me, but 60 kilometers per hour, you don’t worry about what happened behind,” Greipel, a Lotto-Belisol rider, said in an interview with France-2 television.According to the Tour rule book, riders who get delayed by a crash in the last three kilometers of the race are awarded the same time as the stage winner.Cancellara won the opening-day prologue Saturday and has worn the yellow jersey ever since. Over all he leads Bradley Wiggins of Britain by seven seconds.The defending champion Cadel Evans of Australia was 17 seconds off the pace in seventh place.Thursday’s fifth stage promises another bunch sprint, after a mostly flat 122-mile course from Rouen to Saint-Quentin north of Paris.'"

"'12-07-06,'0','Jorge Rafael Videla, who led the military during much of Argentina’s dictatorship, was convicted Thursday of executing a systematic plan to steal babies from prisoners who were kidnapped, tortured and killed during the military junta’s war on leftist dissenters three decades ago. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison.The baby thefts set Argentina’s 1976-1983 military junta apart from all the others that ruled in Latin America at the time. Mr. Videla and the rest of the junta were determined to remove any trace of the armed leftist guerrilla movement they believed threatened the country’s future.The “dirty war” eventually claimed 13,000 victims, according to official records. Many of them were pregnant women who gave birth in clandestine maternity wards.Argentina’s last military dictator, Reynaldo Bignone, was also convicted. He received a 15-year sentence.Nine others, mostly former military and police officials, were also accused in the trial, which focused on 34 of the baby thefts. Seven were convicted and two were found not guilty.'"
"'12-07-06,'0','For starters, even though he is quickly running out of money to pay his troops, raising the prospects of a military mutiny, Mr. Bashir has fashioned a devious Plan B to hang on, said Andrew S. Natsios, a former American special envoy to Sudan and the author of a recent book on the country. According to Mr. Natsios, Mr. Bashir has built a force of as many as 30,000 special security troops, drawing significantly from his own Arab tribe, with underground barracks and hidden arsenals, who are ready to “defend the regime street by street” as a last line of defense.Mr. Natsios thinks there is a strong chance that Mr. Bashir’s forces, if really tested, would try to make Sudan ungovernable and that militant Islamists could then take over.“I am not optimistic on where Northern Sudan is headed right now — whether the N.C.P. falls or not,” he said, referring to Mr. Bashir’s National Congress Party.E. J. Hogendoorn, the Horn of Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based organization that studies conflict, said that while the new round of protests felt different and revolutionary pressure was definitely building, a few crucial pieces were still missing.“Unlike in Egypt, as of yet, the Sudanese lack an organized and disciplined party, like the Muslim Brotherhood, that can form the core of the protest movement,” he said.John O. Voll, a professor of Islamic history at Georgetown University and longtime Sudan specialist, said the Sudanese military had so far refused to side openly with the protesters, which was the decisive factor in regime change in 1964 and 1985.The protesters are not giving up, though they are the first ones to admit their movement is rather ad hoc. “The protests are not organized,” said a young woman named Mona, who did not want to be identified fully out of concern of arrest. “These are the people of Sudan who got fed up with the system.”She added: “I’m a Sudanese girl and I’m proud of my nationality. I know how rich my country is in terms of natural resources. I deserve a good life.”Last year, students in Khartoum used Facebook and other social media to catalyze relatively small protests, which were promptly crushed. But a few weeks ago, students at the University of Khartoum rose up again, and this time the unrest spread deep into middle-class neighborhoods where people blocked roads with burning tires. Next came what the protesters called Sandstorm Friday on June 22 and then Licking the Elbow Friday on June 29, Friday being the day of prayer, the easiest time to mobilize people to hit the streets.Sudan’s nose-diving economy is the ostensible fuse. In mid-June, the government announced it could no longer afford to subsidize gas. As a result, fuel prices shot up 60 percent, making everything drastically more expensive, from taxis to tomatoes.Sudan’s economy has been in a free fall since the start of the year, when the newly independent nation of South Sudan, which split off a year ago, completely shut down oil production. Most of the oil in the Sudans lies in the south, but the pipeline runs through the north. The two sides have yet to agree on a formula to share oil profits and are now locked in a very dangerous game of brinkmanship.Economic woes are rapidly building up on both sides of the border, but the governments of Sudan and South Sudan are desperately trying to hold on until the other collapses first. In the past week or so, Mr. Bashir’s government did two things to appease outside critics, evidence of his wily survivor skills.First, the government announced on June 27 that humanitarian aid would be allowed into the Nuba Mountains, a rebel-held area fighting for autonomy that has been sealed off for more than a year, pushing thousands of people to the brink of starvation. Aid groups are skeptical about the government’s sudden about-face and say Mr. Bashir intentionally made the announcement just when the rains started and the roads were nearly impassable, meaning little aid can actually get through.Then, on Tuesday, a Sudanese court dropped all charges against a woman who had been accused of adultery and was initially sentenced to death by stoning. That case had spawned international outrage.Moyasser, a 24-year-old protester, said Mr. Bashir, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court on genocide charges for the massacres in Sudan’s western Darfur region, does not have a “clear vision to run the country.” Moyasser, who also did not want his full name used out of fear of government reprisals, said he had been marching in the streets because “we lack freedoms.”But marching may not be enough. Mr. Voll said that unlike protesters in Egypt, Libya or Bahrain, the Sudanese have not been able to occupy anything, not even a single public square.“When I see tents and a successful control of significant space, an Occupy movement even for just a day or two,” he said, “I will be more willing to think about regime change in the near term.”Maybe that will happen soon. Maybe it will not. But one thing is clear: Come this Friday, and possibly many Fridays after it, Sudanese protesters will be back on the streets continuing in their struggle to lick their elbows.'"
"'12-07-06,'0','After The New York Times published an article in May about the frequency of sexual assaults among Alaska Natives and the pending closing of the shelter, the center received dozens of personal checks and donations via a PayPal account, the shelter said.In addition to money, donors have sent bulk shipments of diapers, baby formula and nonperishable food. The money has allowed the facility to reopen and resume providing 24-hour services, said Lenora Hootch, the shelter’s former director and now executive director of the Yupik Women’s Coalition, a nonprofit organization. The center is the only shelter for abused women located in an Alaska Native village.“People have been so kind, so generous, so understanding,” Mrs. Hootch said. “We had to lay off staff but we’ve been able to rehire them, and we hope this money will help us pull through until we receive funding.”Another boost for the shelter came last week, when Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, announced that she had secured $50,000 in federal funds for the center from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Senator Murkowski’s office, which learned about the possible shuttering of the shelter from the newspaper article, sent a letter on June 11 to the Bureau of Indian Affairs asking for help for the center, including funding and grant-writing assistance.“I am extremely concerned that due to financial difficulties and limited resources the Emmonak shelter may be forced to close its doors as early as mid-June,” the letter stated. “If the Emmonak shelter is forced to close its doors it could potentially leave many women and children in the Emmonak area without respite from domestic abuse and that is not a situation we should allow to happen.”About two weeks later, on June 29, Donald E. Laverdure, acting assistant secretary for Indian Affairs, announced that the bureau had agreed to provide $50,000 in emergency money to the center, calling the protection of Native American women against violence a priority and saying in a statement that it was “important that the Emmonak Women’s Shelter be able to continue offering help to those who need it.”The money will be used to pay for the center’s electrical, food and fuel bills and will allow it to operate until it receives a Justice Department grant expected to arrive in September or October, according to the shelter.'"
"'12-07-06,'0','This political reality is not lost on the Obama and Romney campaigns, which have sparred over the state of the economy to the near exclusion of every other issue.Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, has centered his campaign on the notion that President Obama’s incompetence as an economic steward has made recovery weaker than it need have been — with unemployment too high and job growth too slow.Mr. Obama has countered that Mr. Romney’s business record at Bain Capital epitomizes the profits-at any-cost philosophy that has cut middle-class jobs. As for his own record, he argues that pushing the 2009 stimulus program through Congress has helped the economy rebound and that without it, the nation would be in worse economic straits.“Throughout history, it has typically taken countries up to 10 years to recover from financial crises of this magnitude,” Mr. Obama said recently, noting the sustained recessions in Europe. He added, “Our economy started growing again six months after I took office, and it has continued to grow for the last three years.”The question now is which economic messages will sink in among the pool of voters — roughly one in 10 — who tell pollsters they are undecided.Steve Schmidt, the 2008 campaign manager for Senator John McCain’s presidential bid, said voter attitudes about the economy had solidified already and would not be much affected by new jobs numbers on Friday or the rest of the year.“The shape of the playing field is largely set,” Mr. Schmidt said. “They believe it’s a very bad economy. They’re pessimistic and they’re anxious. The campaign that wins is the campaign best able to address the anxiety. It’s a comfort argument.”So far, he added, polls show Mr. Obama making headway in swing states with his attacks on Mr. Romney’s priorities, his finances and his record at Bain. But Mr. Romney will have ample opportunity to sell his ideas for economic growth this fall.“The arguments that campaigns put out in July and August are largely unheard by the people who will decide the election,” Mr. Schmidt said. “Both sides are putting down markers for the arguments they’ll make in the fall.”Moreover, the arguments likeliest to prove decisive will come not from candidates directly, but from peers and acquaintances of those undecided voters — whom campaign strategists consider the most persuasive messengers. “Both campaigns will have extraordinarily sophisticated outreach and targeting operations,” Mr. Schmidt said. “If you’re an undecided teacher, you’ll get phone calls from other teachers,” as well as messages from Facebook friends and Twitter followers.Analysts say voters give more heed to where the economy is headed than to its current state. That means a president overseeing a high but falling unemployment rate might have a better shot than a president overseeing a lower but increasing one.To make the point, Mr. Gelman used the presidencies of Jimmy Carter, who did not win re-election, and Ronald Reagan, who did. “Under Carter, the economy did well and then got worse,” he said. “Under Reagan, it got worse and then got better. If you average over four years, the economy was better under Carter than Reagan. But that is not how voters think.”The theory stands up, with some caveats, in recent elections. President George Bush lost his 1992 bid for re-election with joblessness just starting to recede after the early 1990s recession; the trend did not start early enough for voters to give him credit. An earlier upturn helped the man who defeated him, Bill Clinton, win a second term in 1996.Studies also show that voters make their decisions based less on their personal experiences than a general sentiment — meaning news articles about the national economy this summer might be more influential than each voter’s experience, or a neighbor’s business, or a cousin’s or child’s trouble getting a job.“If I’m the voter, I’m not paying attention to statistics,” said John Sides, an associate professor of political science at George Washington University. “I’m not going to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site to look at the jobs report. I’m paying attention to news reports. And the trend in unemployment is often driving the news coverage.”Some pollsters reject the idea that summer economic measures will settle the choices of undecided voters, who tend to make up their minds very late.“Personally, I think it borders on the ridiculous,” said Mark Mellman, a prominent Democratic pollster. “No one can say for sure that anything is truly locked in at any point.” But others said that polls and studies demonstrated the outsize influence of second- and third-quarter economic data. “It’s more that economic changes take several months to be felt by voters,” said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster.In a worrisome trend for the Obama campaign, much of the economic strength of the winter has dissipated. Forecasters expect the jobs and growth reports in the next few months to be uninspiring. Bright spots in the recovery — like exports and the manufacturing sector — seem to be stalling out.“Events that occur between now and the election do matter, and communications changes obviously speed everything up,” said Mr. Ayres. “But voters have to see a lot more jobs in their communities between now and then, and time is running out on that.”'"
"'12-07-06,'0','Chinese automakers said they were preparing for further expansion in exports to developing countries.“They’re easy for us to operate in,” said Steven Wang, the deputy general manager for exports at Great Wall Motors Company. “In Europe, they have lots of laws for new entrants, and in Europe and the United States, customers like to keep familiar brands.”The Chinese companies pose a potential challenge for the overseas divisions of companies like General Motors, Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen and Fiat, all of which are looking to emerging markets for growth and watching the Chinese contenders with varying levels of concern.Annual auto sales in developing countries other than China have risen by 45 percent since 2005, to 21.3 million cars and light trucks last year, according to LMC Automotive, a global data company. Including China, emerging markets passed industrialized countries in 2010 for the first time in the number of cars and light trucks sold.Since 2005, auto sales in industrialized countries have fallen 17.4 percent, to 36.2 million cars and light trucks last year.The market in industrialized countries was still worth more than emerging markets, however, because sticker prices tend to be considerably higher. But with so much growth in developing countries, “you have to be incredibly aware of the domestic brands” emerging in China, said Michael Manley, the head of Chrysler’s international operations.Western automakers have been buying a wide range of Chinese cars and then having engineers dismantle them to study the quality and likely cost of major components.“We have a very thorough benchmarking process” to assess Chinese competitors, said Kumar Galhotra, Ford’s vice president for product development in Asia, the Pacific region and Africa.So far, the quality of the best Chinese cars has been well short of their Western counterparts, leaving even many Chinese customers dissatisfied.When J. D. Power & Associates, the consulting company, surveyed new-car buyers in China last year, it found that they reported 232 quality problems for every 100 Chinese-brand cars purchased. For cars carrying international brands, 131 defects were reported for every 100 cars.Jacob N. George, the managing director of J. D. Power’s China division, said that Chinese automakers had been steadily closing the gap with their overseas rivals since his company began doing annual surveys in 2000. If trends continue, he predicted Chinese manufacturers would catch up in quality by 2018.The shortcomings of Chinese cars tend to lie in basic designs. Chinese automakers spend an unusually low share of revenue on design, focusing on ruthless cost-cutting instead.J. D. Power also surveys buyers in China on how appealing they find their cars after three months of use. Chinese brands consistently score worse than international ones, particularly in categories like engine noise, driving dynamics and seating comfort, Mr. George said.In the area of safety, Western consumers increasingly demand top ratings that Chinese automakers have had scant success in producing so far. But safety is less important to buyers in emerging markets.Ford’s market research found that as recently as 2006, safety ranked last among the nine most important attributes for Chinese car buyers. Although safety has moved up to sixth, the exterior appearance of a car was the top priority for buyers then and now.Chinese regulators are putting pressure on Chinese automakers to strengthen their designs. They have begun issuing star ratings for safety to cars sold in China, after copying the test methods from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States.But the fact remains that consumers in China and other emerging markets generally focus more on price. And Chinese automakers are low-price leaders around the globe, selling new cars for as little as half the price of Western rivals. Emerging markets tend to have relatively few late-model used cars competing with new subcompact cars, unlike in the West, making cheap Chinese cars even more salable.Chile, though it is a small market, offers a window into the potential of Chinese brands. While Chinese companies barely registered there six years ago, today they claim 10 percent of all passenger vehicle sales and 19 percent of all commercial truck sales. This unparalleled growth was bolstered by a lack of local manufacturers and a near absence of trade barriers, said Francisco Errandonea, head of equity research at Santander GBM in Santiago.“Because of this openness, many brands see Chile as a test market for the region and a gateway to Latin America,” Mr. Errandonea said.In Brazil, the rapid growth in Chinese car sales led the government to announce in September that it was raising import tariffs on cars by 30 percentage points, to as much as 55 percent, to protect local subsidiaries of multinationals. Brazil went from being one of the top three export markets for Chinese cars last year to not ranking in the top 10 so far this year.Over all, China exported 850,000 vehicles last year. That was dwarfed by Japan, which exported 4.4 million cars and trucks last year, and South Korea, which exported 3.2 million. But China is starting to catch up, with exports up 50 percent from 2010.Despite the extensive presence of Western brands and factories in China, top executives at multinationals said they had no plans to export significant numbers of their Chinese-made cars.“I’m not saying we could not export, but there is no need to export,” said Carlos Ghosn, the chairman and chief executive of Nissan and its corporate sibling, Renault.For now, multinationals are fighting for greater market share in China, the world’s largest auto market with 18 million cars and light trucks sold last year.Indeed, as Chinese buyers become more prosperous and demanding, Chinese brands are finding that their own country is one of their most challenging markets. Chinese automakers held 28.7 percent of their home market for passenger cars in the first five months of this year, down from 32 percent of the market during the same period last year.A few of China’s biggest cities, including Beijing in December 2010 and Guangzhou last weekend, have imposed stringent limits on the registration of new cars, cutting local sales in half almost overnight. Buyers who can obtain scarce license plates are more likely to put them on higher-priced cars, and these tend to be made by multinationals, not Chinese automakers.Chinese auto executives said that while they were intensely interested in other emerging markets, their top priority was the emerging market in their own backyard.“If we want to be No. 1,” Mr. Wang of Great Wall said, “we should be No. 1 in China first.”'"

"'12-07-07,'0','Two more Roman Catholic priests from the Archdiocese of Philadelphia have been found unsuitable for ministry in an inquiry into the alleged sexual abuse of minors, the archdiocese said Friday.

"'12-07-07,'0','Still, some experts might argue that even after a fiduciary rule is passed there will still be reasons to take extra care when working with a broker (in fact, some brokers are already subject to the fiduciary rules because they collect a fee or have discretionary control over their customers’ accounts). That’s not to say there aren’t many capable advisers who work at banks and brokerage firms — they just might be limited in the type of advice they can provide because they’re working within the confines of their firm’s longtime business model, one with a deep-rooted sales culture that can’t entirely change its spots.Indeed, several former brokers quoted in my colleagues’ article echoed a point that I’ve also heard from former brokers in recent years: As much as their firms would like to recast brokers’ images as trusted advisers, it is still hard for them to fully shed the sales mentality.“A fiduciary duty will help at the margins, raising the amount of due diligence brokers will have to do before recommending a security, but a fiduciary standard will not rewrite the history and culture of the brokerage services industry that has existed since before the Great Depression,” said Arthur Laby, a professor at Rutgers School of Law-Camden, and a former assistant general counsel at the S.E.C.Brokers, for instance, aren’t typically paid for advice — that is, they aren’t paid for creating a financial plan, and they rarely charge by the hour (though there also aren’t enough independent advisers that operate this way). Instead, they make money after they sell you something. “The more they sell, the more they make,” said Alois Pirker, research director at the Aite Group, a financial research firm. He says that brokers might take a 45 percent cut of the commission they collect, or, if they collect an annual fee, they will be paid a portion of that (and typically the more business they bring in, the higher the percentage they will collect).The average fee that brokerage firms charge customers for a managed account — or an account that includes a mix of investments like mutual funds — is 2.02 percent, according to Cerulli Associates, an asset management research firm. That includes a 1.1 percent management fee, while the remainder is for the underlying investments. Accounts with cheaper underlying investments like exchange-traded funds will cost slightly less, though that data wasn’t available. (The proprietary JPMorgan portfolio charged an annual fee of as much as 1.6 percent, plus the cost of the investments.)Independent financial planners typically include an annual charge of 0.85 percent to 1.15 percent of your money, according to Cerulli, plus the investment costs. Alternatively, you can seek out a planner who will charge either a flat fee or by the hour. But the biggest difference between a broker and a financial planner is that the planner’s fee, more often than not, will include a holistic financial checkup — a detailed analysis of where your money goes, how to approach paying down debts, how much life insurance to buy and how to set up a saving and investment plan to reach your goals, whether that includes saving for a down payment on a house, college or your retirement. They’ll also go over your estate plan, among other things.Brokers, on the other hand, may work for firms that encourage the kind of training that would allow them to offer similar advice, but you have to ask yourself if they will be willing to spend the time with you if they get paid only after they make a sale, particularly if that portfolio isn’t worth millions of dollars. On top of that, many brokers’ training is quite limited. (Only about 17 percent of the advisers at brokerage firms are certified financial planners, according to Cerulli.) “ ‘How much do I need to have to retire?’ is the sole focus of the majority of these investment planners,” said Scott Smith, an associate director at Cerulli, though he added that many larger firms had professionals on hand with broader experience if you requested that kind of help.Then, there’s the matter of investment costs. If you believe that you are better served investing in a diversified mix of low-cost index funds that are free of hidden charges, then you can look beyond a bank or brokerage firm’s offerings. Indeed, a diversified mix of three Vanguard index funds appropriate for retirees, for instance, costs only about 0.21 percent of your assets, or less than 0.10 if you want to invest in the exchange-traded fund shares, according to the firm. “If you were to call up Merrill, can you get them to sell you and put you into a no-load Vanguard fund?” said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor of securities law at Columbia Law School. “My guess is you cannot. But that is where I would tell my mother to put a good portion of her money, and whether it is Vanguard or Fidelity or someone else, I don’t care.”Still, the biggest danger right now, experts say, goes back to the fact that most consumers don’t know who they are dealing with when they sit down with a broker. “The greatest risk the average investor runs is the risk of being misled into thinking that the broker is acting in the best interest of the client, as opposed to acting in the firm’s interest,” Professor Laby said.Imposing a higher standard will go a long way to solving a large part of the problem, experts said, but it won’t necessarily eradicate it. “I do not believe a fiduciary standard would be a panacea by any means,” Professor Laby added. “It would, however, raise the industry standard, requiring the larger firms with good compliance programs to think very carefully about whether their brokers’ recommendations could be defended in court, or before the S.E.C., as consistent with a fiduciary standard.”Mercer E. Bullard, an associate professor at the University of Mississippi School of Law who served on the commission’s Investor Advisory Committee, said that a fiduciary duty wouldn’t necessarily ensure that investors would always be told about the myriad ways the brokerage firm makes money, including revenue sharing, where mutual fund managers may share a portion of their revenue with the brokerage firm (which may cause the funds to land on its list of preferred funds). Some brokerage firms disclose this information on their Web site now, or at the point of sale, but good luck deciphering all of it.Regardless of what the law says now or how it may change, you can always ask any adviser you are working with who is paying them. And then, ask the adviser to sign a fiduciary pledge, something you can find in a blog post I wrote in 2010, which is attached to the online version of this column.Because with or without a stronger law, the burden will always be on the investor to find a conflict-free “financial planner,” in the purest sense of the title.'"
"'12-07-07,'0','Here in the early stages of the Libor scandal — and, yes, this thing is far from over — there are two big surprises.The first is that the bankers, traders, executives and others involved would so openly and, in some cases, gleefully collude to manipulate this key interest rate for their own benefit. With all the seedy bank behavior that has been exposed since the financial crisis, it’s stunning that there’s still dirty laundry left to be aired. We’ve had predatory subprime lending, fraudulent ratings, excessive risk-taking and even clients being taken advantage of in order to unload toxic .Yet even with these precedents, the Libor scandal still manages to shock. Libor — that’s the London interbank offered rate — represents a series of interest rates at which banks make unsecured to each other. More important, it is a benchmark that many financial instruments are pegged to. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which doggedly pursued the wrongdoing and brought the scandal to light, estimates that some $350 trillion worth of derivatives and $10 trillion worth of loans are based on Libor.With so much depending on this one critical interest rate, there shouldn’t ever be a question about its reliability. Yet beginning in 2005, according to the C.F.T.C. and the Justice Department, derivative traders at , the too-big-to-fail British bank, with the active involvement of traders at other yet-unnamed banks, persuaded their fellow bank employees to submit Libor numbers that were shaded in ways that would help ensure their trades were profitable. Even Jr., the former Barclays chief executive who lost his job over the scandal, said that reading the traders’ e-mails made him “physically ill.”In 2007, as the financial crisis was gathering steam, banks also began submitting false Libor rates for a different reason. Libor, you may recall, was a measure that gave the outside world a sense of how much trouble the banks were in; the higher the rate required to borrow, the worse shape they were assumed to be in. So Barclays — with what appears to be the complicity of British bank regulators — started submitting rates that were lower than the reality. Its executives said the purpose was to keep Barclays from “sticking its head above the parapet.”'"
"'12-07-07,'0','Veteran boaters and boating safety experts immediately pointed to the number of passengers as the likely cause of the capsizing. But the Nassau police said they were still trying to figure out what went wrong.Officer James Imperiale of the Nassau police said the investigation could result in criminal charges.A spokesman for the county district attorney’s office would say only that prosecutors were monitoring the investigation and working with the police and the Coast Guard.Brian Griffin, a criminal defense lawyer in Garden City and a former Nassau County prosecutor, said the police appeared to be “taking a hard look” at the case. But he added that to file a charge of criminally negligent homicide, prosecutors would have to show that the boat’s operator did not recognize the risk he was taking and did something to exacerbate it, like driving the boat at a dangerous speed.“In the state of New York, what you need is not just a failure to perceive the risks, which arguably is there by loading a boat like that, but some seriously blameworthy conduct on the part of the operator,” Mr. Griffin said.Mr. Mercante, who was hired by Mr. Treanor’s insurance company, said no member of the family had hired a criminal lawyer. There are no federal regulations on capacity for a boat like the one that sank, a 34-foot Silverton named the Kandi Won. (The Coast Guard had identified the boat as the Candy 1 on Thursday. But Russell Brown, the father of a previous owner, said it was named after his daughter-in-law, whose nickname is Kandi.)Mr. Brown, who owned the same model boat, said he would never have put more than eight passengers on it, but added that the Silverton, like most private boats over 26 feet, did not have a plate that stated its maximum capacity. Only smaller craft and commercial passengers boats are required to display those numbers, the Coast Guard said.Boating-safety organizations like the United States Power Squadrons have a rule of thumb for figuring out how many passengers a boat less than 20 feet long can handle: multiply the boat’s length by its width and divide by 15. While the Kandi Won was longer, the calculation would yield a capacity of 27.Mr. Treanor’s lawyer said there was no simple equation for determining how many passengers were too many.“You can get two 34-foot boats and one could be bottom-heavy, one boat could be top-heavy,” he said. “One could have one engine, one could have two engines. It’s very difficult to say a 34-foot boat, you can only have this amount of people on, because of the different designs of boats.”'"
"'12-07-07,'0','WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Friday stepped up pressure on a dissident Iranian group to complete a move from its longtime base in Iraq, suggesting that the group’s conduct will influence a decision on whether to continue its official designation as a terrorist organization.Daniel Benjamin, the State Department’s coordinator for counterterrorism, suggested that the group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People’s Mujahedeen, known as the M.E.K., could remain on the department’s list of terrorist organizations if it does not completely vacate Camp Ashraf, its location since 1986.“It is past time for the M.E.K. to recognize that Ashraf is not going to remain an M.E.K. base,” Mr. Benjamin said, speaking in a telephone briefing for reporters along with Daniel Fried, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s special adviser on Camp Ashraf.“This is the M.E.K.’s moment to show that it has taken on a fundamentally different character,” Mr. Benjamin said. Under a court ruling, Mrs. Clinton must decide by October whether to drop or renew the terrorist designation for the group.Almost 2,000 members of the group have moved in recent months to a new site near the Baghdad airport, but at least 1,200 remain at Ashraf, he said. The last convoy moved on May 5, but since then M.E.K. officials have delayed completing the relocation, complaining about poor conditions in the new location and other issues.The Iraqi government has set July 20 as a deadline to close Camp Ashraf, which was given to the M.E.K. by Saddam Hussein. Iraqi officials now are deeply hostile to the group, and at least twice Iraqi security forces have clashed with M.E.K. members at Ashraf, resulting in several dozen deaths.'"

"'12-07-07,'0','Her 66 was two shots better than any player fired when the Women’s Open was held here in 1998 and when the course played approximately 500 yards shorter. Laura Davies, Hollis Stacy and Kim Williams had rounds of 68.“My goal coming in was to keep in contention,” Wie said.A balky putter has been the bane of Wie’s 2012 season, but on Friday it was her best friend. She averaged a paltry 1.28 putts, including 13 one-putts, while averaging 270 yards off the tee — a solid formula for scoring on the challenging 6,900-yard layout.Wie, who graduated from Stanford in June, recently switched from a belly putter to a more conventional style, but she credited a renewed confidence for her putting resurgence. She has been working with the former player Meg Mallon on the mental aspect of her short game.“I’ve just been working on my confidence, really,” Wie said. “Just I know my stroke is good when I look at it on the cameras or any time I put a number on it. It’s perfect. So I have to trust it and know I am a good putter.“That’s what I talked to Meg about a lot,” Wie said. “I have to trust myself. I know I’m a good putter. I’ve been a good putter and I can be.”Nobody would question that as Wie grinded her way to a seven-birdie round. She rolled in a 35-footer for birdie on the 200-yard No. 6 (her 15th hole), but her other six birdies were all from 15 feet or less.“It was pretty similar to yesterday actually, but I had a couple more shots get in there closer,” said Wie, who shot a two-over par 74 on Thursday. “Yesterday I felt like I was lagging on my putts because I was outside 30 feet most of the day. So being closer to the hole definitely helps.”The scores have been much lower this week than they were in 1998, when Se Ri Pak and Jenny Chuasiriporn qualified for an 18-hole playoff with their six-over 290 scores. But even Wie had no expectations that she could fashion a 66.“Honestly, I thought even par would be good for the day, would be really good,” she said. “But for starters, it wasn’t quite as hot, which is nice, and the pins are a little bit more in the center of the greens than yesterday. But over all it’s still a U.S. Open golf course.”Wie admitted Blackwolf Run’s brutish reputation from 1998 had her a bit worried as she approached the week.“I think going into this week, hearing that it was the highest score to win the U.S. Open, you get scared,” she said. “But this is a good golf course. I think it’s a golf course where you get rewarded if you hit good shots. If you don’t, you get kind of screwed.”Wie’s closest friends on the Tour would say that she is truly deserving of the good fortune that came her way on Friday. Once billed as the Female Tiger Woods, she has been scrutinized and sometimes criticized for every decision she has made, from playing in several men’s PGA events to putting her L.P.G.A. career on hold while attending Stanford.“She’s a great player; Michelle is awfully talented and has a lot of game,” said Pettersen of Norway, who shot a four-under-par 68, putting her at 139 for the tournament. “I think you should give her a break. She just graduated from college in four years. That’s pretty impressive to do that on the sideline of trying to compete out here.”Wie was able to shrug off criticism and concentrate on her game.“I don’t really think about it too much,” Wie said when asked about the scrutiny. “I’m grateful for all the opportunities I have had and all the accomplishments I did when I was younger. But I really can’t live in the past.“Nope, no regrets. I’m a tough person,” Wie said when asked if she had any regrets on the way she has handled her career. “I’ve made some mistakes along the way, but they’ve made me who I am today.”'"
"'12-07-07,'0','“He had the nerve to shake my hand before we parted ways,” Eric said.When the robbers were out of sight, Eric ducked into the Transit District 12 building and reported the crime. Officers put him in a police car and they drove around. Eric spotted the boys, but they spotted the police car, too, and the older boy ran away. The police picked up the younger suspect, but as he had played little part in the robbery, officers chose not to charge him, waiting instead to catch the older suspect.It turned out they were brothers, with enough of a history in the precinct that even the commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Kevin Nicholson, knew them.His memories of interactions with the boys sounded more like Mayberry than Morris Park Avenue.“I had arrested them personally for shooting off a BB gun,” he said. He knew where they lived. The boys’ grandmother answered their door one day soon after to face — again — the inspector in his white shirt.“Do you remember me?” he asked. She said yes. Eric, afraid the boys were part of a gang and fearing retaliation, had said he did not want them arrested. The grandmother, fed up with them, shipped them to relatives upstate, in Orange County, Inspector Nicholson said.This good news was lost on Eric. He does not inflate what happened, and he knows that much worse things happen to people all the time, and that being relieved of cash and electronics is practically a rite of passage in some neighborhoods. But the psychological aftermath of the robbery had a deep impact.“Mentally, everything was different,” he said. “I’d turn around to check my back every couple of steps. I went from knowing everybody to having a bull’s-eye on my back.”He all but stopped walking outdoors alone. He said he would sleep late on purpose, so that his mother had to drive him to the subway. He missed the Explorers classes and church nights. Finally, a supervisor with the Explorers promised to drive him home from class.“I felt like I was 10 years old all over again, just crossing the street on my own,” he said.He was more or less snapped out of his funk by a call from Joseph A. Thompson, president of the precinct’s community council. He had been toying with a Safe Haven program in the precinct since the July 2011 disappearance and murder of Leiby Kletzky, an 8-year-old boy abducted in Brooklyn while walking home from school alone for the first time. Businesses can put a Safe Haven sign in a window for children in trouble. Would Eric say a few words at the next meeting?Eric stood up and told his story while his mother, Yasmin Khan, 35, cried beside him. A supermarket and a Realtor were the first to post signs. Now there are about 95 in the neighborhood.“This needs to be a village again,” Ms. Khan said.Eric turned 17 on Saturday. He is soft-spoken, polite, and larger than he was that September day. His confidence is back. He said he wanted to be a police officer.'"
"'12-07-07,'0','It will be an expensive decision.Under the terms of the backloaded deal, Lin will make $5 million next season, $5.2 million in the second season and $9.3 million in each of the final two. The fourth year is a team option, so the true commitment is $19.5 million for three years.The question can be asked about most signings, but Lin, 23, is a special case: an undrafted, unknown, twice-waived player from Harvard who turned into a star, saved the Knicks’ season and then injured his knee after just seven weeks in the spotlight.The résumé is incomplete, though certainly spectacular in parts. And Lin’s value goes far beyond the court — he is thought to be worth millions in sponsorships, sales and ratings.But billboards do not win basketball games, and the Knicks are much more desperate for playmaking skills than they are for dollars. Their decision will be about basketball first (albeit with the luxury of James L. Dolan’s billions providing a hedge against any mistake).Here is what the Knicks know about Lin: He is a savvy passer, skilled in the pick-and-roll, quick enough to get in the lane, strong enough to take contact in traffic. His jump shot is fair but improving. His defense is questionable. He is young, diligent and dedicated to his craft.In Lin’s 26 games as an everyday player, he averaged 18.5 points and 7.6 assists — which would have ranked him among the top 10 point guards in both categories, if sustained over a full season. That is, of course, a very significant “if.”Lin was dazzling in his first 10 games as the primary point guard, averaging 24.6 points and 9.2 assists while shooting 49.7 percent from the field (though he made 5.6 turnovers a game). The Knicks went 8-2.Lin remained solid for the next seven games, averaging 16 points and 7.7 assists (and 3.9 turnovers), although his field-goal percentage slipped to 41.3. He bottomed out in a Feb. 23 loss in Miami, going 1 for 11 from the field against a Heat defense that was determined to shut him down.Over his final nine games, Lin averaged a modest 13.6 points and 5.9 assists while shooting 39.1 percent. He had one 10-assist game in that span, and no 20-point games. By then, Lin was dealing with a partial tear in his left meniscus — an injury that was not publicly known at the time and eventually required surgery.So were Lin’s late-March struggles a result of fatigue and injury? Or an indication that his February heroics were some sort of mirage?The Knicks have examined Lin more closely than anyone, and they are still uncertain how to process the data. Lin is probably not a top-10 point guard, but could he be in the top 15? Top 20? Or in the bottom 10? Even the true believers are not sure.Many rival scouts and executives (perhaps even most) remain skeptical, believing that Lin is destined for a bench role.Daryl Morey, Houston’s general manager, is a notable exception. The Rockets briefly had Lin in December before waiving him for payroll reasons, and Morey remains convinced of his value. The offer sheet reflects that.Still, this is far from the bidding war that some predicted when Lin was at his peak. No other team with salary-cap room made a hard push for Lin, or tried to create the sort of poison-pill deal that the Rockets offered.Under the N.B.A.’s byzantine rules, any rival team could have offered Lin a contract with a third-year salary of $15 million, and more in Year 4. The Rockets stopped at $9.3 million, hoping that would be enough to dissuade the Knicks from matching while not overcommitting themselves.If the Rockets get Lin, they are allowed to use his average salary, $7.2 million, for cap purposes, a workable figure for those three years. But if the Knicks keep Lin, his $9.3 million salary in 2014-15 will cost them many millions more in luxury-tax payments.The Knicks had little choice but to let Lin set his own market value. The N.B.A.’s cap rules are again the culprit. While Houston could include those balloon payments, the most the Knicks were allowed to offer was about $23.6 million over four years. So for Lin to get full value, he needed another team to make an offer, and to force the Knicks to make a decision.The Knicks will almost certainly match the offer. It is up to Lin to justify the investment.'"

"'12-07-07,'0','Pressure is now on euro zone finance ministers, who plan to meet Monday in Brussels, to drill into the details of Spain’s request for a bank bailout of up to 100 billion, or $123 billion. The terms still need to be itemized in a formal agreement. A much smaller bailout for Cyprus’s banks is also likely to be discussed.And while the agenda will also include the next steps to the deal that was hashed out in principle at last week’s E.U. summit meeting, with such much fine print left unresolved, analysts already fear that Monday’s gathering will be a letdown.“We have been through this so many times,” said Kenneth Wattret, chief euro zone economist at BNP Paribas in London. “As soon as there is an improvement in market conditions, there is a tendency towards complacency at the policy-making level.”Significantly, Spanish bond yields, which had fallen during the enthusiasm over the E.U. summit meeting, have been rising steadily this past week. On Friday, they ticked back above 6.9 percent — a measure of the Spanish government’s borrowing costs that is close to levels considered unsustainably high.Even the economic stimulus measures that the European Central Bank, the Bank of England and China’s central bank announced on Thursday seem to have done little to calm markets. In the case of the E.C.B.’s decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point to an all-time low of 0.75 percent, Mr. Wattret said, investors seemed disappointed that the bank does not seem willing to consider more drastic “unconventional measures.”Much remains unresolved at the political level as well.At last week’s summit meeting, following a concession by Germany, European leaders agreed to let the euro zone’s bailout funds lend directly to struggling banks, rather than through governments. That new approach would avoid increasing the burden on governments like Spain that are already struggling to reduce their deficit and debt levels.But that move is conditional on the creation of a pan-European supervisory structure for the region’s banks. And it is an issue over which divisions within the euro zone are already emerging.Finland’s government, for example, has indicated its disagreement with some of the summit meeting’s outcome. And this week Jyrki Katainen, its prime minister, said he would oppose the use of euro zone bailout funds to purchase weaker nations’ government bonds.The increasingly gloomy global outlook can only increase pressure on euro zone finance ministers, whose Monday gathering is the last one scheduled before the summer break. But Guy Schuller, the spokesman for Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the euro zone finance ministers, said Thursday that the group would remain “on standby” for additional talks, if necessary.Mr. Wattret of BNP Paribas argued that there may be a silver lining to the mounting market anxiety because it might force reluctant European politicians to bury their differences.“A lot of the easy things have been done and, in the euro area, you need a certain amount of market pressure,” he said. “It may be that the more the pressure in the markets, the better the outcome.”'"

"'12-07-08,'0','Choi’s 65 broke the course Open record for a round set Friday by Michelle Wie, who declared herself “back” after she shot a 66. Choi’s score Saturday also tied her for lowest third-round score in any United States Women’s Open; she matched the scores of Judy Clark at Baltusrol in 1985 and Karrie Webb at Pumpkin Ridge in 1997.“I thought today would be very difficult with the wind blowing a lot, but I birdied the first and second holes and I got a very good vibe from that,” said Choi, who had just 26 putts. “I felt confident to the last hole and had good patience, and that’s why I had a good round today.”Choi, who had eight birdies in the round, hit 15 greens in regulation and made her birdies in clusters. She had a bogey-free 32 on the front nine, birdieing Nos. 1, 2, 7 and 8. On the 554-yard par five seventh, she sank her longest putt of the round, a 20-footer.She made short putts for birdies on 10, 11 and 12. After a blip at the 166-yard 13th, where she three-putted from 50 feet for a bogey, she got back to eight under for the tournament with a 15-foot birdie putt at 17.“It was a lot different,” she said of the playing conditions. “Almost there was no wind the last two days, but it was 15 to 20 miles, and it made the course a little bit drier and hard to play.“I had some good shots to the greens. I had good chances. Thankfully, my striking was good, and it’s great.”The same could not be said for the second-round leaders — Suzann Pettersen of Norway and Wie — who each shot a third-round 78.Pettersen, who entered the round at five under par and a stroke ahead of Wie, heads into Sunday’s final round nine strokes off Choi’s lead.Pettersen knew it was not her day when she four-putted the third hole for her first of two double bogeys.“It was hard to get a rhythm to start off; it took forever to play,” Pettersen said. “There were a lot of holdups. I just lost a little bit there at the back nine.“It feels bad to give away that many shots in that few holes. But it’s a U.S. Open and hopefully, well, I have a round tomorrow to make up for it. Today wasn’t easy.”Wie, who opened her day with three bogeys in her first six holes, never got settled.“I mean it was tough out there,” said Wie, who added that Choi’s score “was pretty crazy, that 65 today. Good for her. But I think tomorrow we’ll see what happens.”Choi and Yang have more in common than their South Korean heritage. Both credit Se Ri Pak, and her victory in the 1998 Open at this course, with starting their golf careers.“I was watching 14 years ago when Se Ri took off her shoes and socks to win at Blackwolf Run,” Choi said. “I was 9 or 10, but I remember when she won here. I was just starting in golf, but that changed my dreams. First, my dream was to win on the Korean Tour, but after that I wanted to win on L.P.G.A. Tour.”Choi will have the opportunity to win one of the biggest prizes in women’s golf on Sunday, and with a huge head start on the field.“I’m pretty sure I’ll be nervous tomorrow, but I have confidence and this is a good opportunity to win the U.S. Open,” she said. “I know what I have to do and what I can control. I can’t control winning or my score. I can just do my best.”'"
"'12-07-08,'0','The review found that corporate donations — many of them previously unreported — went to groups large and small, dedicated to shaping public policy on the state and national levels. From a redistricting fight in to the sprawling battleground of the 2012 presidential and Congressional elections, corporations are opening their wallets and altering the political world.Some of the biggest recipients of corporate money are organized under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, the federal designation for “social welfare” groups dedicated to advancing broad community interests. Because they are not technically political organizations, they do not have to register with or disclose their donors to the , potentially shielding corporate contributors from shareholders or others unhappy with their political positions.“Companies want to be able to quietly push for their political agendas without being held accountable for it by their customers,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which has filed complaints against issue groups. “I think the 501(c)(4)’s are likely to outweigh super PAC spending, because so many donors want to remain anonymous.”Because social welfare groups are prohibited from devoting themselves primarily to political activity, many spend the bulk of their money on issue advertisements that purport to be educational, not political, in nature. In May, for example, Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, a group co-founded by the Republican strategist , began a $25 million advertising campaign, carefully shaped with focus groups of undecided voters, that attacks Mr. Obama for increasing the federal deficit and urges him to cut spending.The has no clear test for determining what constitutes excessive political activity by a social welfare group. And tax-exempt groups are permitted to begin raising and spending money even before the I.R.S. formally recognizes them. Two years after helping Republicans win control of the House with millions of dollars in issue advertising, Crossroads GPS’s application for tax-exempt status is still pending.During the 2010 midterm elections, tax-exempt groups outspent super PACs by a 3-to-2 margin, according to a recent study by the Center for Responsive Politics and the Center for Public Integrity, with most of that money devoted to attacking Democrats or defending Republicans. And such groups have accounted for two-thirds of the political advertising bought by the biggest outside spenders so far in the 2012 election cycle, according to Kantar Media’s Campaign Media Analysis Group, with close to $100 million in issue ads.The growing role of issue groups has prompted a rash of complaints and lawsuits from watchdog organizations accusing groups like the American Action Network, Crossroads and the pro-Obama Priorities USA of operating as sham charities whose primary purpose is not the promotion of social welfare, but winning elections. Efforts in Congress to force more disclosure for politically active nonprofit organizations have been repeatedly stymied by Republicans, who have described the push as an assault on free speech.“These groups are being used as a conduit to hide from voters the identity of people and corporations who are bankrolling these television ads, which are designed to influence the outcome of elections,” said Representative Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of .But Jonathan Collegio, a spokesman for Crossroads, said, “Individuals and organizations have a First Amendment right to promote their beliefs through advertising, be that advertising against the war, against or, in the case of Crossroads, advocating for free markets and limited government.”Labor unions — themselves among the beneficiaries of Citizens United — have also donated millions of dollars to national super PACs and state-level nonprofit groups involved in battles over government spending, collective bargaining and health care.Donations from corporations and unions alike must be disclosed if they go to expressly political groups like super PACs.In April, for example, the air traffic controllers’ union contributed $1 million to a pro-Obama super PAC. But other contributions are harder to trace. Last year, the gave $100,000 to Advancing , a tax-exempt group that supported labor’s fight with Republicans in that state; the donation was reported nowhere in Wisconsin, but it emerged in an annual financial report that unions must file with the .Among the largest beneficiaries of corporate donations in recent years have been trade organizations like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which largely backs Republican candidates. As a nonprofit “business league” under the tax code, the chamber does not have to disclose its supporters, who helped finance its $33 million in political ads in the 2010 midterm elections.But voluntary disclosures by corporations — usually at the prodding of shareholder advocacy groups — shed some light on the use of trade groups for lobbying or as pass-throughs for political spending. A search of voluntary disclosures, some collected by the Center for Political Accountability, which advocates for transparency in corporate political spending, found more than $6 million in chamber donations by 10 companies last year.Two of the largest came from Prudential Financial and Dow Chemical, which each gave $1.6 million, while , and Merck each gave at least $500,000. Some of the donations were directed to the chamber’s Institute for Legal Reform, which lobbies for limits on liability suits.Some contributions are disclosed by accident. Aetna’s check to the American Action Network, along with a $4.5 million contribution last year to the chamber, was mistakenly included in a filing with regulators. The disclosure was first reported by SNL Financial, a trade publication. Even where companies pledge voluntary disclosure of political contributions, they often make an exception for donations to tax-exempt groups.In 2007, Aetna signed an agreement with the Mercy Investment Program, a shareholders group, to disclose trade associations to which it made large contributions. On regulatory filings, the company initially described its $3 million contribution to the Chamber of Commerce as a lobbying expense, but the company now says it was intended to finance “educational activities.”An Aetna spokesman would not say whether the chamber donation would appear on the company’s 2011 voluntary disclosure. Sister Valerie Heinonen, the director of shareholder advocacy for Mercy Investment Services, said that a failure to do so would violate the company’s pledge.Beyond the contributions to large, established nonprofits like the chamber and American Action Network, corporate money is also quietly shaping the political discourse through more obscure groups, none of which are required to disclose their donors.In Minnesota last year, , a major drug benefit manager, gave $10,000 to a Republican-linked group, Minnesotans for a Fair Redistricting, involved in a partisan fight over redrawing legislative boundaries. Express Scripts made the donation, previously unreported, because the “electoral maps in Minnesota were in doubt and we supported efforts to bring certainty to Minnesota voters,” said Brian Henry, a spokesman for the company, which is based in . He added that the firm has a facility in Bloomington, Minn.The reasons behind American Electric Power’s $1 million contribution to the little-known Founding Fund are less clear. The company characterized it as “lobbying” in a corporate governance disclosure last year, but the fund says it does no lobbying. The fund, whose address is a mail drop in , Va., would not make any of its directors available for an interview.The fund’s treasurer, Frank Sadler, is a lobbyist who previously worked for Koch Industries advising nonprofit groups that support free market causes, although he said the Kochs, major Republican donors, were not involved in the group. In its public filings, the fund said it expected to raise about $10 million this election cycle, primarily from corporations, and use it to promote free markets and “the narrowing of the scope and reach of the federal government.”A spokesman for American Electric Power, Pat D. Hemlepp, said the company supports organizations “with positions on issues that align with AEP’s positions” and strives to be transparent on political giving. “We also respect the positions of others, including some of the organizations that receive funding from AEP, to not publicly disclose funding or activities. That’s their right under the law.”'"
"'12-07-08,'0','America’s corporations and their executives are in grave danger, warns Mitch McConnell, the Senate Republican leader. According to Mr. McConnell, if President Obama were to find out who was giving hundreds of millions to secretive groups running political attack ads, he would “punish and intimidate” them with all the governmental tools at his disposal.This is not one of those laughable Internet conspiracy theories. The senator actually wrote this in an op-ed essay in USA Today on Thursday as his explanation of why the Disclose Act, which would end the practice of secret political donations, is “un-American” and an attempt to limit free speech.The vast majority of the secret money going into “social welfare” organizations like Crossroads GPS, founded by Karl Rove, is being spent on behalf of Mitt Romney and other Republican candidates, and the Disclose Act is coming up for another vote in a few weeks. So Mr. McConnell needs a new excuse for filibustering it again. But his suggestion that President Obama and Democrats want disclosure in order to compile a list of “enemies” is repugnant.Corporations love the secrecy provided by Mr. Rove’s group because it protects them from scrutiny by nosy shareholders and consumers. They want a big influence on elections, but without leaving any tracks. People who give directly to political campaigns or super PACs know their donations will be public, and know that disclosure is part of participation.In a related speech last month, Mr. McConnell said disclosure was an enormous price. Bloggers and cable television hosts have said terrible things about the president’s critics, he said, as if revealing a crime. The Koch brothers, who have pledged $60 million to defeat President Obama, have received some obscene messages, and have even been criticized directly by the president. The obscenity was unfortunate, but did the Kochs really believe they could use their money to dominate the political system and not receive some push-back?Mr. McConnell’s charge that the president has loosed the Internal Revenue Service on his enemies is breathtaking. After several years of indifference, the I.R.S. is finally examining whether these “social welfare” groups are abusing their tax-exempt status by spending anonymous donations on political attack ads. The senator compares them to the N.A.A.C.P., but Crossroads GPS and the like exist for no other purpose than to run political ads.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','In this election year in the United States, there’ll be bitter debates about what should be cut from budgets, and one thing Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that foreign aid is bloated. Polls indicate that 6 out of 10 Americans favor cutting foreign aid.A World Public Opinion poll in 2010 found that Americans believed that foreign aid consumed one-quarter of federal spending. They said it should be slashed to only 10 percent.In fact, all foreign aid accounts for about 1 percent of federal spending — and that includes military assistance and a huge, politically driven check made out to Israel, a wealthy country that is the largest recipient of American aid. True humanitarian aid constitutes roughly half of 1 percent of the federal budget — and sometimes gets remarkable results, as is happening with AIDS.My trips to southern Africa used to be heartbreaking. Funerals were constant, schools were emptied of teachers, and hospitals lost their doctors to the virus. In the countryside, children starved because adults were too sick to farm. In Swaziland in 2006, I came across a 12-year-old orphan girl who had become head of her household after AIDS had wiped out the adults.Yet now the picture is starkly different. On my annual win-a-trip journey with a university student — this year it’s Jordan Schermerhorn of Rice University — we’ve been seeing how assistance changed the course of the AIDS epidemic in Lesotho and Malawi. Global AIDS deaths are decreasing steadily from the peak in 2004. New infections are down. About half a million mothers with H.I.V., which causes AIDS, used to infect their babies in childbirth each year, but now a simple treatment regimen aims to eliminate that by 2015.The progress is the result in large part of Pepfar, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (which the United States supports). To his great credit, President George W. Bush started Pepfar in 2003; it’s the best thing he did.With the help of Pepfar and the Global Fund, antiretrovirals, which are powerful AIDS drugs, are now available free in needy countries. AIDS will still kill millions of people, and there are already shortages of medications, but the tide is turning.“As a bottom line, millions would not be alive without Pepfar, while, at the same time, millions more in their families have been saved from poverty because mothers and fathers are productive again,” notes Dr. Peter Piot, the former executive director of the United Nations program against AIDS and the author of a sparkling new memoir, “No Time to Lose.”“If we have reached a turning point in the global AIDS response, it is also largely due to Pepfar,” Dr. Piot added. “There are probably very few examples in international aid that can demonstrate such dramatic, direct impact.”In Bobete, in rural Lesotho, we visited a clinic run by Partners in Health, the aid group founded by Dr. Paul Farmer of Harvard. The clinic tests virtually all pregnant women in the area for H.I.V., and those with the virus are given treatment so that they will not pass it along to their babies.Those who need them get free antiretrovirals and treatment for tuberculosis (which often accompanies AIDS). With treatment, patients are able to continue to work and support their families.It’s true that AIDS treatment has worked better than Pepfar’s prevention strategies, such as promoting condoms and discouraging multiple partners. Prevention by supporting male circumcision in hard-hit countries seems more promising (circumcision greatly reduces the rates of H.I.V. transmission through heterosexual sex). Lesotho is hoping to circumcise 80 percent of sexually active males within five years, up from less than 20 percent now.In the Malawi village of Makaluka, a woman named Gladys Daniel told us that everyone knows how AIDS is spread, but that about half the villagers still sleep around, usually without condoms. “Our husbands can have multiple partners and put us in danger,” she said.It turns out that her concern was not theoretical. “I know my husband has a partner,” she said, adding that her husband steals money from her to pay his girlfriend for sex. With risky behavior like this, some 2.7 million new infections still occur annually around the world. So although the progress is immense, there’s still a long war to be fought against AIDS — and if funds are slashed, the world will slip backward.AIDS programs are just one of many foreign aid successes. Here in Lesotho, the United States used the carrot of Millennium Challenge grants to nudge the government to end a ban on letting women purchase property or borrow money from banks by themselves. Child mortality rates are plummeting because of money spent on clean water, vaccines and hospitals.Granted, aid is often misspent, just as it is by the military and everybody else. Yes, the war on AIDS took many wrong turns (as documented in the recent book “Tinderbox”).But when you hear candidates in this campaign season in the United States declare that money for foreign aid should be slashed, remember that modest sums have saved lives on an unprecedented scale. When there’s a depression in the coffin-making industry, that’s a tribute to foreign aid that Americans can take pride in — and should support.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','And now, against all odds, his cancer is in remission and has been since last fall.While no one can say that Dr. Wartman is cured, after facing certain death last fall, he is alive and doing well. Dr. Wartman is a pioneer in a new approach to stopping cancer. What is important, medical researchers say, is the genes that drive a cancer, not the tissue or organ — liver or brain, bone marrow, blood or colon — where the cancer originates.One woman’s may have different genetic drivers from another woman’s and, in fact, may have more in common with in a man or another patient’s lung cancer.Under this new approach, researchers expect that treatment will be tailored to an individual ’s mutations, with drugs, eventually, that hit several key aberrant genes at once. The cocktails of medicines would be analogous to treatment, which uses several different drugs at once to strike the virus in a number of critical areas.Researchers differ about how soon the method, known as whole genome sequencing, will be generally available and paid for by — estimates range from a few years to a decade or so. But they believe that it has enormous promise, though it has not yet cured anyone.With a steep drop in the costs of sequencing and an explosion of research on genes, medical experts expect that genetic analyses of cancers will become routine. Just as pathologists do blood cultures to decide which will stop a patient’s bacterial infection, so will genome sequencing determine which drugs might stop a cancer.“Until you know what is driving a patient’s cancer, you really don’t have any chance of getting it right,” Dr. Ley said. “For the past 40 years, we have been sending generals into battle without a map of the battlefield. What we are doing now is building the map.”Large drug companies and small biotechs are jumping in, starting to test drugs that attack a gene rather than a tumor type.Leading cancer researchers are starting companies to find genes that might be causing an individual’s cancer to grow, to analyze genetic data and to find and test new drugs directed against these genetic targets. Leading venture capital firms are involved.For now, whole genome sequencing is in its infancy and dauntingly complex. The gene sequences are only the start — they come in billions of small pieces, like a huge jigsaw puzzle. The arduous job is to figure out which mutations are important, a task that requires skill, experience and instincts.So far, most who have chosen this path are wealthy and well connected. When had exhausted other options to combat , he consulted doctors who coordinated his genetic sequencing and analysis. It cost him $100,000, according to his biographer. The writer went to the head of the , Dr. , who advised him on where to get a genetic analysis of his .Harvard Medical School expects eventually to offer whole genome sequencing to help cancer patients identify treatments, said Heidi L. Rehm, who heads the molecular medicine laboratory at ’s Partners Healthcare Center for Personalized Genetic Medicine. But later this year, Partners will take a more modest step, offering whole genome sequencing to patients with a suspected hereditary disorder in hopes of identifying mutations that might be causing the disease.Whole genome sequencing of the type that Dr. Wartman had, Dr. Rehm added, “is a whole other level of complexity.”Dr. Wartman was included by his colleagues in a research study, and his genetic analysis was paid for by the university and research grants. Such opportunities are not available to most patients, but Dr. Ley noted that the group had done such an analysis for another patient the year before and that no patients were being neglected because of the urgent work to figure out Dr. Wartman’s cancer.“The precedent for moving quickly on a sample to make a key decision was already established,” Dr. Ley said.Ethicists ask whether those with money and connections should have options far out of reach for most patients before such treatments become a normal part of medicine. And will people of more limited means be tempted to bankrupt their families in pursuit of a cure at the far edges?“If we say we need research because this is a new idea, then why is it that rich people can even access it?” asked Wylie Burke, professor and chairwoman of the department of bioethics at the . The saving grace, she said, is that the method will become available to all if it works.It was pure happenstance that landed Dr. Wartman in a university at the forefront of cancer research. He grew up in small-town , aspiring to be a veterinarian like his grandfather. But in college, he worked summers in hospitals and became fascinated by cancer. He enrolled in medical school at Washington University in St. Louis, where he was drawn to research on genetic changes that occur in cancers of the blood. Dr. Wartman knew then what he wanted to do — become a physician researcher.Those plans fell apart in the winter of 2002, his last year of medical school, when he went to to be interviewed for a residency program at Stanford. On the morning of his visit, he was nearly paralyzed by an overwhelming fatigue.“I could not get out of bed for an interview that was the most important of my life,” Dr. Wartman recalled. Somehow, he forced himself to drive to Palo Alto in a drenching rain. He rallied enough to get through the day.When he returned to St. Louis, he gave up running, too exhausted for the sport he loved. He started having night sweats.“I thought it might be ,” he said. “And I thought I would ride it out.”But then the long bones in his legs began to hurt. He was having fevers.He was so young then — only 25 — and had always been so healthy that his only doctor was a pediatrician. So he went to an urgent care center in February 2003. The doctor there thought his symptoms might come from depression, but noticed that his red and white blood cell counts were low. And Lukas Wartman, who had been fascinated by the biology of leukemia, began to suspect he had it.“I was definitely scared,” he said. “It was so unreal.”The next day, Mr. Wartman, who was about to graduate from Washington University’s medical school, went back there for more tests. A doctor slid a long needle into his hip bone and drew out marrow for analysis.“We looked at the slide together,” Dr. Wartman said, recalling that terrible time. “It was packed with leukemia cells. I was in a state of shock.”Dr. Wartman remained at the university for his residency and treatment: nine months of intensive , followed by 15 months of maintenance chemotherapy. Five years passed when the cancer seemed to be gone. But then it came back. Next came the most risky remedy — intensive chemotherapy to put the cancer into remission followed by a bone-marrow transplant from his younger brother.Seven months after the transplant, feeling much stronger, he went to a major cancer meeting and sat in on a session on his type of leukemia. The speaker, a renowned researcher, reported that only 4 or 5 percent of those who relapsed survived.“My stomach turned,” Dr. Wartman said. “I will never forget the shock of hearing that number.”But his personal gauge of recovery — how far he could run — was encouraging.By last spring, three years after his transplant, Dr. Wartman was running six to seven miles every other day and feeling good. “I thought maybe I would run a half marathon in the fall.”Then the cancer came back. He remembered that number, 4 or 5 percent, for patients with one relapse. He had relapsed a second time.This time, he said, “There is no number.”His doctors put him on a clinical trial to try to beat the cancer with chemotherapy and hormones. It did not work.They infused him with his brother’s healthy marrow cells, to no avail.Dr. Wartman’s doctors realized then that their last best hope for saving him was to use all the genetic know-how and technology at their disposal.After their month of frantic work to beat cancer’s relentless clock, the group, led by and Elaine Mardis, directors of the university’s genome institute, had the data. It was Aug. 31.The cancer’s DNA had, as expected, many mutations, but there was nothing to be done about them. There were no drugs to attack them.But the other analysis, of the cancer’s RNA, was different. There was something there, something unexpected.The RNA sequencing showed that a normal gene, FLT3, was wildly active in the leukemia cells. Its normal role is to make cells grow and proliferate. An overactive FLT3 gene might be making Dr. Wartman’s cancer cells multiply so quickly.Even better, there was a drug, sunitinib or Sutent, approved for treating advanced kidney cancer, that inhibits FLT3.But it costs $330 a day, and Dr. Wartman’s insurance company would not pay for it. He appealed twice to his insurer and lost both times.He also pleaded with the drug’s maker, , to give him the drug under its compassionate use program, explaining that his entire salary was only enough to pay for 7 ½ months of Sutent. But Pfizer turned him down too.As September went by, Dr. Wartman was getting panicky.“Every day is a roller coaster,” he said at the time, “and everything is up in the air.”Desperate to try the drug, he scraped up the money to buy a week’s worth and began taking it on Sept. 16. Within days, his blood counts were looking more normal.But over dinner at a trendy St. Louis restaurant, he picked at his chicken and said he was afraid to hope.“Obviously it’s exciting,” he said. “But Sutent could have unanticipated effects on my bone marrow.” Maybe his rising red blood cell counts were just a side effect of the drug. Or maybe they were just a coincidence.“It’s hard to say if I feel any different,” Dr. Wartman said.And the cost of the drug nagged at him. If it worked, how long could he afford to keep taking it?The next day, a nurse at the hospital pharmacy called with what seemed miraculous news: a month’s supply of Sutent was waiting for Dr. Wartman. He did not know at the time, but the doctors in his division had pitched in to buy the drug.Two weeks later, his bone marrow, which had been full of leukemia cells, was clean, a showed.Still, he was nervous. The test involved taking out just a small amount of marrow. Cancer cells could be lurking unseen.The next test was flow cytometry, which used to label cancer cells. Again, there were no cancer cells.But even flow cytometry could be misleading, Dr. Wartman told himself.Finally, a yet more sensitive test, called FISH, was done. It labels cancer cells with fluorescent pieces of DNA to identify leukemia cells. Once again, there were none.“I can’t believe it,” his awe-struck physician, Dr. John DiPersio, told him.Dr. Wartman, alone in his apartment, waited for his partner, Damon Berardi, to come home from work. That evening, Mr. Berardi, a 31-year-old store manager, opened the door with no idea of Dr. Wartman’s momentous news. To his surprise, Dr. Wartman was home early, waiting in the kitchen with champagne and two flutes he had given Mr. Berardi for Christmas. He told Mr. Berardi he should sit down.“My leukemia is in remission,” he said. The men embraced exultantly, and Dr. Wartman popped open the champagne.“I felt an overwhelming sense of relief and a renewed vision of our future together,” Mr. Berardi said. “There were no tears at that moment. We had both had cried plenty. This was a moment of hope.”Dr. Wartman and his doctors had fateful decisions to make, with nothing but hunches to guide them. Should he keep taking Sutent or have another bone-marrow transplant now that he was in remission again?In the end, Dr. DiPersio decided Dr. Wartman should have the transplant because without it the cancer might mutate and escape the Sutent.Meanwhile, Pfizer had decided to give him the drug. Dr. Wartman has no idea why. Perhaps the company was swayed by an impassioned plea from his , Stephanie Bauer.Dr. Wartman’s cancer is still gone, for now, but he has struggled with a common complication of bone-marrow transplants, in which the white blood cells of the transplanted marrow attack his cells as though they were foreign. He has had and felt ill. But these complications are gradually lessening, and he is back at work in Dr. Ley’s lab.His colleagues want to look for the same mutation in the cancer cells of other patients with his cancer. And they would like to start a clinical trial testing Sutent to discover whether the drug can help others with leukemia, or whether the solution they found was unique to Lukas Wartman.Dr. Wartman himself is left with nagging uncertainties. He knows how lucky he is, but what does the future hold? Can he plan a life? Is he cured?“It’s a hard feeling to describe,” he said. “I am in uncharted waters.”'"
"'12-07-08,'0','MY career has not been a straight path, which I attribute to my family’s penchant for experimenting. My mother was a Girl Scout leader who later worked on political campaigns and then became president of the Ohio Genealogical Society. My father was a civil engineer with an interest in the arts. My sister moved from a business career to the arts. Although I majored in theater at Miami University in Ohio, I chose a business career.I have skills and experiences from several different jobs and industries. After graduating from college in 1981, I completed a management training program at a department store in Ohio, then worked as a buyer for Snyder’s department store in Louisville, Ky.I learned business basics in that job. A buyer supervises a small business. You’re in charge of a department, you have a budget and you have to buy the right items and set the right price.In 1989, in line with my divergent interests, I left and enrolled in DePaul University College of Law in Chicago. The Watergate proceedings of the 1970s had prompted my interest in policy, and that interest surfaced again. I served on the law review board at DePaul and as editor of the Law Journal. It was an intense experience to pull together and update the journal while attending law school full time — a good lesson in assembling a team and achieving a goal.After getting my law degree, I clerked for a federal judge for a year, then worked for a law firm and practiced antitrust law for eight years. In 1997, Illinois passed legislation deregulating the electric industry; in 1998 I was recruited by Commonwealth Edison to help in the transition. We’re a division of Exelon. We don’t generate power; we own the wires and poles that deliver the energy from the power plant to customers. Our service territory is northern Illinois.The move to ComEd was a great opportunity to work in the last fully regulated industry, to get in on the ground floor of a monumental shift in the Illinois economy. I started as senior counsel in the legal department and became associate general counsel two years later.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','Bill Gross, manager of the huge Pimco Total Return bond fund, says it’s becoming “harder and harder” to generate inflation-beating returns in a low-rate world, without exposing the fund to sharp price declines if rates rise.“It’s a delicate walk, like Mr. Wallenda on the wire over Niagara Falls,” he said, referring to Nik Wallenda, who walked over the Niagara Gorge last month. “You have to be very careful and keep your eyes on the wire.”Despite the drop in yields, Mr. Gross says the fund is keeping about 35 percent of the portfolio invested in Treasuries — in line with the benchmark Barclays aggregate bond index. The fund abandoned Treasuries for a while last year, but performance suffered. “They are insurance,” he said. “That insurance has become more expensive now, but on a day when you need that insurance you’re glad to have it.”Other fund managers aren’t so sold on Treasuries. The Dodge & Cox Income fund is investing only 3 percent of assets in them, said Dana Emery, a manager of the fund. “We may underperform if Treasury yields fall even further, but given our long-term perspective, we just don’t like the risk-reward,” she said.The Loomis Sayles Bond fund is designed to be a swashbuckler, less concerned about what might work in the short term and with a mandate that permits it to invest in just about any segment of the bond market. Currently the fund does not own Treasuries.“We have positioned the portfolio to capture yield today and benefit from rising rates,” said Kathleen Gaffney, co-manager of the fund. It doesn’t see Treasuries as delivering on either score.FOR the most part, managers seem to agree that it is best to limit a fund’s duration, or sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The longer the duration, the more yield you get today, but with the trade-off of a bigger price decline if rates rise.The Barclays aggregate bond index has an average effective duration of about five years. If rates were to rise one percentage point in a year, the price of the underlying bonds in the index would decline by 5 percent.The Fidelity Total Bond fund has a duration of 4.5 years, but Ford O’Neil, its lead manager, says its Treasury stake is invested in longer-term issues maturing in more than 10 years, to wring out more yield. “That’s where the value is” he says. That long-maturity Treasury stake — about 30 percent of the portfolio — is offset by short-term mortgage-backed securities, which comprise about 20 percent of the fund. The fund’s yield as of June 30 was 2.5 percent.For some fund managers, mortgage-backed securities have become the sector du jour. Those backed by federal agencies, including Fannie Mae, currently have yields 1.5 percentage points or so higher than Treasuries.Mortgage-backed securities account for more than half of assets for Pimco Total Return, helping it register a 3 percent yield as of June 30. If the Federal Reserve were to step in with a third round of quantitative easing that focused on buying mortgage securities — which would push prices up — Mr. Gross says that would “be the cherry on the sundae.”High-yield corporate bonds, or junk bonds, have been a favorite yield generator, but some managers are cooling on the sector. Mr. O’Neil said Fidelity Total Bond had 12 percent invested in this bond segment, versus 18 percent three years ago.The average yield of 7.4 percent for these issues is enticing, but if economic growth stalls, junk bonds could falter. Mr. Gross says he is waiting until we “get an all-clear” that another recession isn’t lurking before he would move heavily into them.Bob Persons, co-manager of the MFS Bond fund, says a sweet spot in corporate bonds are those that are rated one rung below investment grade but could soon be upgraded. Investment-grade bonds — those rated AAA, AA, A and BBB — typically yield 3 percent to 3.5 percent these days. Mr. Persons’s favored segment, which comprises about 20 percent or so of the MFS fund, yields 5 percent to 5.5 percent.“When the bond rating agencies catch up to us and upgrade a BB to investment grade,” he says, “it suddenly becomes the highest yielder in that universe, and funds that only buy investment-grade bonds get interested.” He says that this typically drives prices higher, adding 1.5 to 2 percentage points of return.Ms. Emery says the investment team at Dodge & Cox is finding compelling bond investments in the debt of money center banks like Bank of America and Citigroup. Before the financial crisis, the banking bond sector typically yielded 70 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, more than Treasuries. The sector now yields about 300 basis points more.“Many companies are in much better financial shape but their bond spreads are still wide,” she says. She notes that the higher yields also provide a fatter income cushion to mitigate price declines when rates begin to rise.Ms. Gaffney, at the Loomis Sayles Bond fund, says European sovereign debt is “getting pretty close” to looking enticing. Meanwhile, her fund is investing in European utilities and telecommunications debt.“There are companies we believe will be able to retain their investment-grade rating through the crisis, but right now they are trading at yields that are comparable to high-yield issues,” she says. “We see the risk-off environment as a buying opportunity.”'"
"'12-07-08,'0','Until quite recently, selling Apple often led to remorse. “Every sale has been a bad sale,” Mr. Jacob lamented. “Up until a couple of months ago,” he added, referring to Apple’s decline from an April high. Today, fund managers must weigh Apple’s distinct performance and potential against some equally distinct risks.On the positive side, Apple is a sales juggernaut seemingly immune to the slowing growth that often afflicts giant enterprises. In its fiscal year ended Sept. 24, revenue grew by a remarkable 66 percent, to $108 billion. Sales in the quarter ended March 31 soared again — by nearly 59 percent from the year-ago period. Apple shipped more than 35 million iPhones during the quarter, accounting for 58 percent of revenue. And Apple has consistently vaulted expectations.“Over the last 30 quarters, Apple earnings have exceeded analyst estimates in all but one of the quarters,” marveled Scott Callahan, manager of the Icon Information Technology fund.FURTHERMORE, Apple never has been about the numbers only. As the leading purveyor of techno-chic, Apple has a branding history that would please Don Draper.Early on, Apple pitched itself as the anti-establishment alternative to I.B.M. Now it is pouring ad dollars into convincing a gadget-loving public that it’s cool to chat with Siri, the iPhone cyber-assistant. Among those delivering its pitch is the actor John Malkovich.But Siri does have doubters. A new report issued by a Piper Jaffray analyst said that in many hundreds of inquiries delivered on a noisy street, Siri could accurately answer just 62 percent, and that even in a quiet room, it could accurately handle just 68 percent.Apple has backed up its slick branding with striking design, technical innovation and strategic ingenuity — and the company’s creativity seems to make its customers feel creative, too. It was once said that nobody was fired for buying I.B.M. Today it can be said that nobody ever lost self-esteem by buying Apple.But the company’s success has produced a gaping vulnerability for investors. Stellar sales performance has lifted its share price and market capitalization, swelling its weighting in indexes like the S.& P. 500 and the Nasdaq 100. In late June, it represented a remarkable 18.9 percent of that Nasdaq benchmark.Why is this important? It matters because a host of index funds and exchange-traded funds mimic such benchmarks. As investors plow more money into these funds, the E.T.F.’s have had to add Apple shares — pushing share prices still higher, and in turn prompting even more buying.This circularity works great in a rising market. But what if Apple stock — or even the broad market — were to suffer a sharp decline?Index funds recently held 9.6 percent of Apple’s outstanding shares, according to FactSet. Five of Apple’s seven top shareholders were E.T.F.’s or index-style funds. One of these, the PowerShares QQQ Trust, had almost 19 percent of its portfolio in Apple shares.This kind of situation poses two threats. A sharp decline in Apple’s share price would lead to reduced index weighting, setting off E.T.F. and index fund sales of the company’s shares. A broad market decline could also spur redemptions, requiring funds to raise cash. With their heavy weighting, Apple shares would have to be unloaded.Just as Apple’s rise was accelerated by its growing weighting in market indexes, its decline would be amplified by that weighting.“You can get a cyclical thing that feeds on itself,” said Kevin Landis, manager of the Firsthand Technology Opportunities fund, where Apple is the leading stock holding.Even companies enjoying outstanding growth can see their stock tumble when profit margins erode. Apple is not immune to margin pressure, reasons Edward Zabitsky, chief executive of ACI Research in Toronto. Though many analysts see Apple continuing its ascent, Mr. Zabitsky is far less sanguine. “It can go to about $460” within the next six months, he said of Apple shares, which ended the second quarter at $584. He has a longer-term target of $270.What could force out all of that air? “Commoditization,” Mr. Zabitsky replied. Smartphone rivals are now in position to lower prices, whittling away at Apple’s margins, he explained.Samsung, he said, has inherent cost advantages as a vertically integrated producer of key phone components like the processors and displays. “Their costs are much lower,” Mr. Zabitsky said. “There’s room to lower price.”But commoditization will not happen overnight. Apple and Samsung have been sparring on multiple legal fronts, and Apple has won some early rounds. On June 29, a federal district judge granted an injunction barring Samsung from selling its Galaxy Nexus smartphone in the United States, and Samsung has appealed.At Firsthand, Mr. Landis uses the Nasdaq 100 as a benchmark. Though Apple in mid-June represented roughly 9 percent of his portfolio, that still lagged the 19 percent it represented in the Nasdaq 100. “As long as I’m still at a smaller weighting than the Nasdaq 100, I don’t feel that pressure to lighten up on Apple,” Mr. Landis said.“They still have lots of room to grow,” he added. “They can continue to take market share.”CHRISTOPHER McHUGH, lead portfolio manager at the Turner All Cap Growth Investor fund, has recently added shares, putting Apple at 8.5 percent of holdings in mid-June.Even at its high price, Mr. McHugh sees value in Apple shares.  The company can earn $55 a share in 2013, he says, and can increase earnings at 15 percent a year in coming years. Given the bright earnings outlook, a P/E multiple of under 11 seems low, according to Mr. McHugh.  ""You’re trading at a pretty steep discount to growth rate,"" he said.He sees opportunities for more growth internationally as Apple bolsters distribution through overseas telecommunications companies.Mr. Callahan at Icon likes the long-term outlook, predicting that Apple can continue to expand earnings per share at around 15 percent over the next 7 to 10 years.That will be a difficult feat, but if Apple pulls it off, investors — along with customers — will retain their self-esteem.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','That inactivity was not the expectation when the court first tackled the case, known as Janus Capital Group v. First Derivative Traders. Back then, most fund industry scholars assumed that the fund adviser, a subsidiary of the Janus Capital Group called Janus Capital Management, would be held responsible for the information in the prospectuses issued by Janus funds.After all — as noted in briefs filed by major public pension funds, state securities regulators, legal experts and the Securities and Exchange Commission — a mutual fund is little more than a paper shell containing its investors’ money.“I can’t see how anyone can seriously hold the view that fund structure today breeds the resources to do the job that the court’s statement assumes could be done,” said David Silver, a former president of the Investment Company Institute, the fund industry trade organization, and an industry veteran whose career dates back to the 1970s.Although federal laws require that each mutual fund be set up on paper as a separate corporate entity with its own board, that arrangement has never reflected practical reality, according to Mr. Silver. Fund directors generally have no staff apart from that supplied by the adviser; they may be a check on the adviser’s unfettered discretion, but they cannot independently verify the information the adviser supplies. Funds are created, marketed, managed and administered by their advisers. So why should funds be held liable for any possible lies or misrepresentations in the public filings their advisers draft for them to issue?They shouldn’t, according to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which issued an opinion in the Janus case in May 2009.The case was one of a number of lawsuits that arose in the wake of the so-called market-timing scandal that erupted in the fund industry in 2003. Market timers, which were largely hedge funds, would exploit stale late-day share prices for mutual funds, knowing that they could reap a quick profit when the prices were updated overnight. The practice, permitted at a handful of large fund complexes but largely hidden from retail customers, shortchanged long-term investors, raised transaction costs and sometimes had negative tax consequences.In prospectuses drafted largely by Janus Capital Management, several Janus funds claimed to have policies to discourage market timing. In reality, the adviser permitted market-timing trades in those funds, as Janus ultimately acknowledged when it settled regulatory charges in the case.The Fourth Circuit, in its 2009 ruling, wrestled over whether this behavior harmed the actual plaintiffs in the case, people who owned stock in the Janus Capital Group, the adviser’s publicly traded parent. But the appellate court readily concluded that the fund adviser was largely responsible for that misleading language in the prospectuses by virtue of its dominant role in running the funds.After all, under the heading “Management of the Fund” in the prospectus, the only entity listed was Janus Capital Management, the court noted. Advisers “typically dominate the funds they advise,” the court added, quoting the S.E.C.That inference was “further strengthened” by the fact that the adviser, its parent and the funds all “held themselves out to the investing public as a single entity: ‘Janus,’ ” the court said.But the Supreme Court saw things differently. In its view, the misleading statements were made by the fund, a separate corporate entity under the law, and not by the fund adviser. Hence, the fund adviser could not be held liable for any misrepresentation when those statements were made.THIS ruling posed a host of significant questions for the mutual fund industry. In one extensive analysis, a law firm ticked off the issues:Is “the fund” synonymous with “the fund directors”? If not, who is ultimately responsible for what a fund does? Can fund directors negotiate contracts that require their advisers to take responsibility, despite the Janus ruling? If the prospectuses simply attribute statements to the adviser, would that get the directors off the hook? Should directors demand to be indemnified by the adviser for the new liability the Supreme Court has settled on them? How can investors hold a fund responsible for misleading information if the fund’s only asset is the investors’ money?But as significant as these issues may be, fund directors so far have not actually arrived at any answers, according to Jay G. Baris, a co-author of that analysis and a specialist in investment management law.“I sit in boardrooms. Day to day, there is little perceptible impact” from the Janus decision, Mr. Baris said. He is not aware of any contract between a fund and its adviser being renegotiated to reflect the post-Janus world. “It’s being discussed,” he added. “But, of course, there will be pushback from the advisers.”At most, he said, the ruling has “encouraged fund directors to step back and take a new look” at their relationship with their advisers. “Not much has changed yet — except the awareness.”Indeed, the Investment Company Institute, the primary lobbying organization for the fund industry, has not taken a public stand on the Janus ruling and its consequences and did not even file an amicus brief before the case was decided. Ianthe Zabel, a spokeswoman for the group, attributed that silence to “competing policy demands and finite resources.”ODDLY, the case is having a much more visible effect in the wider world of securities law than in the fund industry where it arose — and, of course, those consequences could ultimately affect litigation in the fund arena as well. Specifically, some corporate executives facing fraud allegations in private lawsuits and regulatory cases are invoking the Janus ruling to argue that they are merely hired hands at their companies — like the management company hired by a mutual fund. Thus, they contend, they are not liable for any fraudulent information in filings or sales material issued by their corporate employers.Steven R. Paradise, a securities lawyer at Vinson & Elkins in New York, noted that there is already a split developing in the federal courts in Manhattan — Wall Street’s local courthouse — over how to apply the Janus ruling in securities fraud cases.Federal district judges in Manhattan have come down on opposite sides of the question of whether the Janus decision applies at all in regulatory cases filed by the S.E.C., Mr. Paradise said.Judges Robert W. Sweet and Jed S. Rakoff of Federal District Court have ruled that the case did not apply to S.E.C. enforcement cases. But Judge Colleen McMahon decided last September that it applied both to private lawsuits and S.E.C. cases. Appeals have already been filed in several of those cases.As defense lawyers test the usefulness of the Janus ruling as a shield against fraud liability, the outcome will affect mutual fund litigation along with other securities cases.But in the meantime, the mutual fund industry seems content to live with the murky consequences of the Janus decision — leaving investors with an even more uncertain world, one where a majority of the Supreme Court believes that fund advisers are not responsible for the funds they sponsor.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','The dispute has huge practical implications. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that 23 million uninsured people will gain coverage through exchanges and that all but five million of them will qualify for subsidies, averaging more than $6,000 a year per person. Subsidies, in the form of tax credits, will be available to people with incomes from the poverty level up to four times that amount ($23,050 to $92,200 for a family of four).Some supporters of the law say Congress may have made a mistake in drafting this section. But, they add, the intent of Congress is clear: subsidies should be available in federal as well as state exchanges.The law says that subsidies will be provided to residents of a state to help defray the cost of health plans offered “through an exchange established by the state.”A rule issued by the Obama administration allows tax credits for insurance bought in either a state or a federal exchange.Political brawling over health care will continue this week on Capitol Hill. The House plans to vote on a Republican measure to repeal the 2010 health care law, Mr. Obama’s most significant legislative achievement. Democrats, who control the Senate, say repeal efforts have no chance of success there.Representative Phil Roe, Republican of Tennessee, said the rule on premium subsidies “contradicts the explicit statutory language” of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Mr. Roe and another Tennessee Republican, Scott DesJarlais, have introduced a bill to nullify the rule, issued by the Internal Revenue Service.Douglas H. Shulman, the I.R.S. commissioner, defended the rule as consistent with the intent of Congress. “The statute,” he said, “includes language that indicates that individuals are eligible for tax credits whether they are enrolled through a state-based exchange or a federally facilitated exchange.”However, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Obama administration was usurping the role of Congress and rewriting the law to provide tax credits through federal exchanges.White House officials have repeatedly underestimated opposition to the health care law. They predicted that public support for the law would grow as people learned more about it. They minimized lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the requirement for most Americans to carry health insurance. They predicted that states would embrace the opportunity to insure more of their residents by expanding Medicaid and creating insurance exchanges, but a number of states have balked.James F. Blumstein, a professor of constitutional and health law at Vanderbilt University, said the dispute over subsidies involved a serious legal issue.“The language of the statute is explicit,” Mr. Blumstein said. “Subsidies accrue to people who obtain coverage through state-run exchanges. The I.R.S. tries to get around that by providing subsidies for all insurance exchanges. That interpretation will almost certainly be challenged by someone.”The most likely challenger, Mr. Blumstein said, is an employer penalized because one or more of its employees receive subsidies through a federal exchange. Employers may be subject to financial penalties if they offer no coverage or inadequate coverage and at least one of their full-time employees receives subsidies.Michael F. Cannon, director of health policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the link between subsidies and penalties was a crucial part of the law.“Those tax credits trigger the penalties against employers,” Mr. Cannon said. If workers cannot receive subsidies in states with a federal exchange, their employers cannot be penalized, he said. That, in turn, would hobble federal efforts to get employers to offer coverage in those states, Mr. Cannon said.Prof. Timothy S. Jost, an expert on health law at Washington and Lee University, said Congress had made “a drafting error” that should be obvious to anyone who understands the new health care law.“There is no coherent policy reason why Congress would have refused premium tax credits to the citizens of states that end up with a federal exchange,” said Mr. Jost, who supports the law.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','At the center of this intragovernmental warfare are two familiar antagonists, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with their fundamentally different approaches to terrorism, epitomized by their reactions to 9/11. “The F.B.I., looking at the smoldering ruins in New York . . . reflexively asked: What happened?” the authors write. “The C.I.A. was far better at looking past the disaster that had occurred and asking the defining question of the period: What next?”As turf wars go, it wasn’t much of a fight. In the wake of 9/11, when the need to prevent another attack was pretty much all that mattered, the C.I.A. instantly became America’s pre-eminent antiterror agency, and the F.B.I., with its years of hard-earned knowledge of radical Islam, was shunted aside. In the case of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed the result was especially tragic, according to Terry McDermott and Josh Meyer, both former journalists with The Los Angeles Times; it meant that Francis J. Pellegrino, an F.B.I. agent who had been obsessively tracking Mohammed since the World Trade Center bombing in 1993, was essentially cut out of the loop.When Mohammed was betrayed to the C.I.A. by an old friend and chased down to a safe house in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in early 2003, Pellegrino was asked to provide a list of questions to his interrogators, private C.I.A. contractors with no particular expertise in Al Qaeda. He declined. (“I don’t write questions,” he said. “I ask questions.”) The rest of the story should have been easy to predict: Mohammed provided his interrogators with a lot of bad information in order to get them to stop torturing him.The two authors of “The Hunt for KSM” have reconstructed an almost decade-long clandestine manhunt in exacting detail, an undeniably impressive feat of sleuthing. Narrative velocity is not a problem either; from beginning to end, “The Hunt for KSM” moves along at the brisk pace of a good crime novel. Where the book falls short is in the depth and intimacy of its portraiture. McDermott and Meyer present a tantalizing cast of characters — most notably Pellegrino, a former accountant, and Mohammed, a modern-day Carlos the Jackal — but never quite bring us close to any of them.The subtlety and imagination of the writing don’t always live up to the doggedness of the reporting, which can drain the emotional power from otherwise dramatic moments, as when Pellegrino finally finds himself sitting opposite his nemesis in an interrogation room at Guantánamo Bay. “Pellegrino thought K.S.M. might be the kind of guy you could sit down and have a beer with, if he hadn’t been one of the worst mass murderers in American history,” the authors write.Seth G. Jones’s “Hunting in the Shadows” provides a wider-angle view of the war on terror. Rather than zeroing in on the hunt for a single bad guy, Jones, a former senior adviser at United States Special Operations Command, seems determined not to leave any out. The result is exhausting, a seemingly endless rogues’ gallery of terrorists and their American pursuers since 9/11.But if “Hunting in the Shadows” can at times make for slow reading, it is an important book, though less for the individual stories it tells than for the broader analysis Jones uses to frame them. As he sees it, the history of Al Qaeda’s war against the Western world can be best understood as a series of “waves.” The first started with the embassy bombings in East Africa in 1998, crested on 9/11 and ended with allied forces striking back against Al Qaeda’s leaders in Afghanistan, Pakistan and elsewhere. The second began in 2003, after the American invasion of Iraq, and ended when a growing number of tribal sheiks in Iraq turned on Al Qaeda. The third rose between 2009 and 2011, driven by the emergence of the radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, and concluded with the killing of Osama bin Laden and several other Qaeda leaders last year.Studying these waves, and the counterwaves that repelled them, can tell us a lot about what works and what doesn’t when it comes to fighting terrorism. Most fundamentally, we have learned the hard way that the war on terror isn’t really a war — that if we attempt to defeat Al ­Qaeda by deploying large numbers of conventional soldiers to foreign countries we are only likely to create a backlash of ­radicalization.Instead, Jones explains, we should rely on “a light-footprint approach” that favors special operations and intelligence-­gathering. We should help local governments to establish basic law and order in unstable areas where Al Qaeda is threatening to grow roots. And we should wage our own propaganda battle against Al Qaeda, one that emphasizes the organization’s indiscriminate murder of civilians. The war on terror, Jones writes, “is a war in which the side that kills the most civilians loses.”President Obama recently declared that victory over Al Qaeda was “within our reach,” and that the time had come to refocus the nation’s energy and resources on domestic affairs. Let’s hope he’s right. But if he’s not, and a fourth wave is still to come, he and his successors in the White House would do well to keep these lessons in mind.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','I have bipolar disorder and recently recovered from a yearlong mania and depression that required five lengthy hospitalizations (both voluntary and involuntary). When I am sick, I can mount strong and convincing arguments as to why my personal freedom should not be restricted by involuntary commitment. But when I am well, I am relieved that my family and doctors did not, like me, regard the crazy choices of my illness as “personal freedom.”As a person living with bipolar disorder, I have dramatically different experiences from those of the author, Jeneen Interlandi. Forced treatment in the behavioral- health services of state and private hospitals has not helped me. It drove me away in fear of the level of force, dishonesty, coercion, incarceration without trial, seclusion and restraint. Meanwhile, I earned various college degrees, raised two splendid children on my own, put both into good colleges and generally defied the dismal predictions of the professionals who worked on my “case.” There are many things family members can do to support voluntary services, and they can act to oppose job and housing discrimination. In these things, our relatives can turn out to be our allies rather than our persecutors.My family is faced with a similar tragedy — my brother was given a diagnosis of schizophrenia after many years of slipping through the cracks in the system. While it seems as if it is taking away someone’s free will to initiate treatment involuntarily, the truth is that the illness took away that person’s free will long before the system ever could.The most terrible day in my life was the day I stood by as my brother was taken in handcuffs to the hospital, but I stand by that decision, as I saw my brother stabilize and return to us for the first time in years.Holley Mangold is what is lacking in the whole “obesity debate” — someone who doesn’t fit the mold of the body-mass-index chart, who is strong as heck, athletic as heck, healthy as heck and above all else a solid role model.

"'12-07-08,'0','Nearly 2.1 million couples were married in 2010, the latest year for which data were available from the Centers for Disease Control, which tracks this information. The median age for a first marriage has been steadily rising for both men and women, to 26 for a woman and 28 for a man, from 20 and 23 in the 1950s, according to census data, while almost a quarter of adults 50 and older have been married at least twice. This increases the likelihood that one or both newly married spouses may already own a home.“It’s way more complicated for a second marriage,” said Ms. Price, noting that both partners may also have other family needs to consider. Several of the couples she has counseled, she said, have chosen to keep their finances separate.This approach may be especially worthwhile in the event of a short sale, when a property is sold for less than the balance of the mortgage, or a foreclosure. Both transactions remain on a credit report for seven years.Some lenders allow a new borrower to be added to a loan; others do not, because they no longer own the loan or because the loan has a provision that prohibits it, said Edward Ades, a partner in Universal Mortgage in Brooklyn. The surest way to bring both borrowers together on the home loan is to refinance, especially now with very low rates, he added.Before couples double up on the mortgage, they may want to consider whether they expect to move into a bigger home in the near future or whether the mortgage is more than halfway paid off (in which case the principal is being paid down more rapidly), Mr. Diamond said. They could place the second person on the deed and title to the property, he said, or they could put together an agreement giving the person whose name is not on the mortgage a percentage of the home’s market value in the event of death or divorce.Lenders sometimes require the second person to be on the deed for six months before they can be added to the mortgage, often via refinancing, said Erin Lantz, the director of Zillow Mortgage Marketplace.“If your partner has good credit, it may be helpful,” she said, adding that a partner with poor credit could hinder refinancing or another house purchase.Couples who want to buy a home together should discuss their credit scores and what they want in a home, Mrs. Lantz said. Then they need a plan for the down payment, which is typically 20 percent of the purchase price.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','In sharp contrast to that approach stands New York’s latest “it” building — One57, the 90-story structure at 157 West 57th Street — whose cloak of secrecy has started to make the Extell Development Company, its developer, seem almost like the Kremlin.In the more than six months since Extell began selling what will — for a while, at least — be the city’s tallest residential structure, barely a drop has fallen from the information faucet.Other than one buyer — Richard Kringstein, the co-owner of Herman Kay Company, which makes women’s and men’s outerwear — not one name has surfaced as a confirmed future resident of One57. Mr. Kringstein bought a 3,228-square-foot apartment with three bedrooms and park views for an undisclosed price. The least expensive apartments have sold for about $3,000 a square foot, said Gary Barnett, Extell’s president.Earlier this week there was a flash of excitement when The New York Post reported that a sheik from had agreed to buy the duplex penthouse on the 89th and 90th floors. Mr. Barnett called the report “totally not true” when I contacted him. In fact the Qatari, Sheik Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber al-Thani, who is the country’s prime minister, has not bought anything in the building, a person familiar with the matter said Thursday.The penthouse buyer remains a mystery, although Mr. Barnett said that it was “not a Russian and not a Middle Easterner.” The sheik, who had been looking in the building, was still “welcome” to buy there, Mr. Barnett said.Another apartment at One57, the Winter Garden, a 13,554-square-foot duplex with a private solarium that was listed at $115 million (the city’s most expensive apartment listing), has gone into contract for an undisclosed sum, the person familiar with the matter said, confirming a story first reported by The .Big sales are clearly happening. Mr. Lorber told me one Chinese company with offices in New York, which Elliman represented, agreed several months ago to pay $150 million to buy four apartments at One57 — two full floors and two half-floors. Extell officials declined to comment.Back in May, when I first reported that the penthouse had gone into contract for $90 million to $100 million, which would be a record sale in the city, Mr. Barnett sounded like a beaming papa when describing his success in keeping buyers’ names secret.“I am very proud of this,” he said. “There has not been one disclosure of anybody who has bought in the building. We have sold well over 40 units and not one disclosure.”Fewer than a handful of people associated with Extell know who the actual buyers are, said Jeff Dvorett, One57’s project manager. Some members of Extell’s own sales team aren’t in the circle of trust. Neither is Rubenstein Associates, Extell’s outside public relations firm, said Tamar Rothenberg, Extell’s vice president for marketing.Mr. Barnett said Extell had sold more than half of its 92 condominiums in the building since One57 opened for sales in December. He insists that Americans have bought about half of those condos, even though many prominent people in the industry, including Mr. Lorber, are skeptical.“To date, I would be surprised if that were the case,” Mr. Lorber said of the 50-50 claims. “At the end of the day, my guess is it would be 75 percent foreign and maybe 25 percent locals.” (He based that prediction on the flow of sales his brokers have made in the building, which have been predominantly to foreigners, he said.)Mr. Lorber says the stark difference in how the 15 Central Park West and One57 sales stories are playing out reflects different moments in the global economy. In 2012 more and more superwealthy foreigners, many of them billionaires looking for places to park their cash in the , are demanding that brokers sign confidentiality agreements, and it is no longer chic on Wall Street to brag about big property purchases, he said.Extell doesn’t see it that way. “We don’t think this high-end market has changed,” Ms. Rothenberg said. “We just choose to handle that information differently, in a more confidential manner. We truly feel that this buyer, this high-net-worth individual, greatly appreciates remaining confidential.”, who knows a thing or two about hype, said One57 probably didn’t need celebrity buzz or clever marketing strategies to sell.“I have always felt the most important element is the marketplace, and then it is location and building quality,” Mr. Trump said. “But the marketplace supersedes everything, and the market right now in New York is very good.”Still, I wondered, given the success of 15 Central Park West, could the supersecret strategy at One57 backfire? How will the most prominent of potential buyers know this is a club they want to join?“If anything, you can see by the pace of sales and our success so far, we really do not think that this strategy is going to backfire.” Ms. Rothenberg said. “It is exactly working in our favor.”Some brokers murmur around town that Mr. Barnett may be trying to avoid revealing the number of foreign buyers at the building, because that might scare off other potential domestic buyers who, like many co-op boards, don’t want to deal with the private security issues that some foreigners bring.For now, we’ll all just have to take the tiny group at Extell that’s in the know at its word. Closings don’t begin until the summer of 2013, with contracts on the higher-floor residences (like the penthouse) not expected to wrap up until after March 2014, Mr. Dvorett said.Mr. Kringstein, for one, says he doesn’t understand what all the fuss is about. He has told friends and family he is moving into One57 with his wife. Confidentiality — aside from the exact price he paid for his apartment — “is not such a big deal,” he said.“It is a little surprising,” Mr. Kringstein said, upon being informed that he was the first confirmed buyer in the building. Other than one friend, another American who has also bought in the building, he hasn’t a clue whom else he’ll see there.But then again, he said, “When you move into a building do you ever really know the names of the people living there?”'"
"'12-07-08,'0','He suggested lunch. We shared childhood antics over Goan curry. Then, tearing off a corner of a three-minute-old naan, he asked me if I had ever been in love.I gathered my fingertips toward my thumb and told him I had not.He said that he wanted to be in love always. That love alone allowed you to feel the whole range of human emotions. That emotional experiences were the best.Next I remember feeling lightheaded. My heart was pounding so fast, I worried others could hear. I thought my knees might give in. I concluded that all this love talk had gone to my head. I went to see a play. A nightcap followed.Later that evening, something still felt amiss. This was more than a few butterflies in my stomach. I called a friend to relay my symptoms. Bombay fever was his diagnosis. “Rest up,” he said, promising I would be fine in a day or two.Beached on the couch, drifting in and out of a fevered state, I got to know my host.First he offered unsolicited advice: “Don’t think money will bring you happiness.”“I know that already,” I said in that uncompromising tone reserved for your early years.He told me about proposing to his high school girlfriend with a plastic ring. And then, “You remind me of my first girlfriend.”This became our routine. We felt as if we had only to tell each other everything. We had been up talking well into the night when he told me that he found me beautiful. I was the perfect girl. What a shame I was just passing through.In return, I told him he was the closest to being my dream man, and I meant it.The following morning, in an e-mail to a friend back home, I described what transpired the night before as a “two (wine) bottle situation.”A Hindi expression I learned (it translates as: “love opened its arms”) best describes what happened next. I felt as if I needed him for air, pollution notwithstanding. Even the weight of groceries felt good in my hands.I felt drunk on Mumbai and drunk on the allure of this much older man. Even the fact that he had been bankrupt twice seemed daring and darling. Despite his many years, he still had a childlike wonder for the world, a trait I value over all else.Instead of focusing on the yawning gulf that separated our lives (along generational, geographical and racial lines — I’m Korean), I chose to focus on his salt-and-pepper stubble, sandpaper hands and broad shoulders.Because, hey, here was a man who stole kisses behind rickshaw drivers. And here was a man who would slice up mangoes and leave the best parts for me. And here was a man who made me feel bigger than I was. And what else was there?Before I left, a friend had, in jest, given me a copy of Elizabeth Gilbert’s “Eat Pray Love.” Being of the liberal feminist persuasion, we had found the myth of the leading man to be antiquated and apocryphal. To the “love conquers all” mantra, my last words had been (as G-chat records show), “I am not going to fall in love okay!”When I told my father the news, he recapped our conversation in his typically professorial patois: “So what you are telling me is you want to move halfway across the world for a man nearly twice your age whom you met seven days ago. Did I get that right?”The carefree sex of my arrogant years now seemed vacuous and sad. I no longer saw the point in yielding my body to men who subscribed to the 20-something aesthetic of irony and irreverence. In the world I had left behind, it was a sin to have heart. After years of tenure in that world, I was finally through.Mumbai helped me contextualize my desires, and I realized how much I wanted things to matter. I had been sleepwalking through life, and now I wanted to experience the overwhelming sensation of falling in love.AND then came an insight as apt as it was inconvenient. As I was daydreaming of trading in my life back home for a new one in the wild west of Mumbai, I realized I did not have enough of myself to give up. I was not a real person yet, and I possessed nothing of worth to sacrifice.Giving up a life I did not yet lead would not be a gesture of love. It would be one of misplaced brio. Instead of charting my own path to happiness, I would be taking a shortcut by electing to be with a man who had already lived his life to the hilt. Tried and failed. Fallen in and out of love.One of the last times I saw him, we were sitting by the water, facing each other. To my right lay the Arabian Sea, to my left, that impossible patch of idiosyncratic wonder, Mumbai. In between, a man I could have loved.When it came time to say goodbye, both of us held our hands behind our backs, wary of what a single touch might undo.Next came a moment of saving grace. I gave him a high-five, a reference to an earlier conversation about how I had never mastered the art of saying goodbye. Both of us burst out laughing. How absurd we must have looked to passers-by. Thinking about our parting still brings a smile to my face.On my flight to Istanbul, I realized I was much sadder than the gesture of high-fiving would have led people to believe. I knew this because I started ugly crying in the middle of “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.” I felt fatigued and raw.Miraculously, I did not die of grief. My heart did not collapse inside my chest. It only felt as if it had.Meandering through the cobblestone streets of Istanbul, I asked myself the same question that the city’s resident man of letters Orhan Pamuk had once asked: Is love without hope simply hopeless?To sit shiva, I read Barthes. I burrowed into his depressing but illuminating meditation on love.Sure I loved him there that night, and for many nights that followed. But was it love? Or was it an episode resembling love? Did I fall in love with the man? Or did I fall in love with how the man had made me feel, like the holder of some great promise?A few weeks ago, I came back from a bar with beer on my breath and hair smelling of cigarettes. I rummaged through my iTunes in search of music that would lull me to sleep and came across an album unplayed. My heart skipped a beat when I realized that it was the soundtrack of a film my Mumbai love had made years ago.I put it on, crawled into bed, rolled myself into a blanket burrito and fell asleep.Was he just the willing receptacle for all the affection I felt for Mumbai, for India? Or was it love? I still don’t know.What I do know is that sometimes I dream of Mumbai. I dream of night trains, fruit-market mangoes and the shimmering waters of the Arabian Sea. Occasionally, I dream of love.'"
"'12-07-08,'0','It wasn’t long before Hollywood got the message. “In a wild cyclical way I started to attract these other things,” Mr. McConaughey said. The turning point was last year’s well-received thriller “The Lincoln Lawyer,” his first film after a two-year absence from movie screens. The part of a glib, swaggering lawyer was not a huge stretch, but he attacked it with relish, and it must have signaled a readiness for new challenges. In quick succession the directors — veterans and indie up-and-comers alike — came calling.A midcareer swerve like Mr. McConaughey’s is hardly unprecedented: Tom Cruise mixed things up with left-field parts in “Magnolia” and “Tropic Thunder” (which also featured Mr. McConaughey), and John Travolta famously rebooted with “Pulp Fiction.” But few have pulled off so complete and sustained an overhaul.“I’m having a lot of fun,” Mr. McConaughey said, noting that it has been a big year by any measure: he has five movies coming out, walked the Cannes red carpet twice in May, and married his longtime girlfriend, Camila Alves, last month. (They have two children and are expecting a third.) In conversation Mr. McConaughey was expansive and affable, even “mannerly,” a word he used several times. Generous with eye contact and back pats, he spoke in winding monologues and colorful analogies and was especially animated on the subject of his newfound freedom as an actor.“There are zero shackles,” he said, noting what his recent characters have in common. “They definitely make up their own rules.” Much like Paul Newman’s antihero in “Hud,” a favorite of his, these are men who “walk in a straight line all the way to the end of the picture — no placation, no pandering,” he said.Mr. McConaughey, 42, takes evident delight in tarnishing his golden-boy halo. “The hero, the white knight — he’s usually on the right side of morality,” he said. “But these guys I’ve been playing are more amoral.” There is no clearer example of this than the perverse “Killer Joe,” based on an early work by the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Tracy Letts. Mr. McConaughey admitted he was put off on a first read, but a discussion with Mr. Friedkin helped him see the pitch-black humor.Mr. Friedkin said he was drawn to the Texas-born Mr. McConaughey in part for his familiarity with the East Texas region where the film is set. “He understood the geography in a way that contributes to the DNA of the character,” Mr. Friedkin said.Mr. McConaughey said, “I know what that part of the country smells like.” He had a middle-class upbringing — his father ran an oil-pipe-supply business, his mother was a teacher — but he remembers the comportment of Texas tough guys, the collectors who worked for his father. They were “very stealth, quiet, soft-spoken,” he said, adding that some of those mannerisms might have seeped into his portrayal of the unnervingly composed Joe.The new, improved Mr. McConaughey does not exactly come out of nowhere. He showed a knack for macabre material in Bill Paxton’s psychological drama “Frailty” (2001), which Mr. Friedkin said convinced him that this actor was right for “Killer Joe.” And Mr. McConaughey’s first significant role — as a skirt-chasing slacker in “Dazed and Confused” — remains the best encapsulation of everything distinctive about him: his lothario charm and showboat flair, the lazy drawl and sneaky dead-on timing, the sly capacity for both self-infatuation and self-parody.Most of those qualities are on view in “Magic Mike,” in which Mr. McConaughey plays the utterly absurd Dallas with an impressively straight face. “He’s this poet-capitalist-warlord-messiah of the male revue world,” Mr. McConaughey said. “None of that’s funny until you say ‘of the male revue world.’ ” For a scene at a gym he encouraged the wardrobe department to pile on the indignities: he ended up in a cutoff T-shirt, skintight shorts and ballet shoes, a look he described as “Baryshnikov meets Richard Simmons.”Mr. McConaughey said that it had already been suggested to him that playing a stripper is something of a joke at his own expense, given his reputation for baring his chest on screen and off. “I’m not a daily reader of Page, whatever, Six,” he said. “Hell, I didn’t know until two years after it started that there was a phenomenon about me being shirtless.” But it was his suggestion that Dallas play bongos in one of the “Magic Mike” routines, an apparent nod to his arrest for marijuana possession in 1999, when police barged in on him thumping bongos in the nude.What Mr. McConaughey loved most about Dallas was his gift of gab. “I’m the M.C., I’m the rapper, I’m the poet, I’m the silver-tongued devil,” he said.Not for nothing has Mr. McConaughey, a former law student, played lawyers in at least five films, including “A Time to Kill,” the 1996 John Grisham adaptation that marked his arrival on the Hollywood A-list.On “The Paperboy,” Mr. Daniels, who likes to cast against type, said he tried to “make Matthew as physically unattractive as I could, which is kind of hard.” He added: “And I would tell him, no talky talky, just show me your eyes.” For at least one viewer it was a successful attempt to efface all traces of the movie star. “My mother was very disturbed,” Mr. Daniels said. “She loves Matthew McConaughey, and she said, ‘What have you done to my Matthew McConaughey?’ ”Mr. Friedkin said that careful role selection is all the more important for someone of Mr. McConaughey’s looks and stature. “I know how little they value the acting of a great-looking guy in Hollywood,” Mr. Friedkin said. “They don’t want you to act, they just want you to show up and convincingly make love to the leading lady. A guy like Matthew has to take charge of his own career, because the studios will cast him in the same part every time out.”Mr. McConaughey is well aware that there is a perception that he was coasting in those interchangeable romcoms; he maintains it was harder work than people think. “I’ve done romantic comedies that were more difficult than ‘Killer Joe,’ ” he said. “The work is to keep them buoyant. If you dig deep, you try to go to the reality and to the humanity, it’s a 12-minute movie.”To listen to Mr. McConaughey reflect on the dissatisfactions of studio filmmaking is to hear how some common viewer frustrations — the stitched-together feel of the films, their blatant reliance on formulas — are experienced by those in front of the camera. He acted out a typical direction on one of his studio movies: “You just told her, ‘No, I don’t love you anymore,’ you turn from her and we’re going to track in and we’re going to get that moment and, cue, now. That’s nerve-racking.” It was a relief to go from that kind of assembly-line production to a world of filmmakers — from Mr. Friedkin to Mr. Soderbergh to Mr. Daniels — who valued spontaneity and were more interested in “the flow of the scene,” he said.The collaborations with auteurs have quickly brought the spotlight of prestigious film festivals. “Killer Joe” was shown at Venice last year, and at Cannes for the first time Mr. McConaughey reveled in the ceremonial pomp and the famously vocal audiences (although “The Paperboy” divided the critics). “My highlight was that immediate reaction,” he said. “The closest thing I’ve ever done to stage work was working on ‘Magic Mike.’ ”With the renewed focus on his acting career Mr. McConaughey has wound down the activities of his record label and production company (whose last effort was the barely seen stoner comedy “Surfer, Dude”). He and his family now split their time between Malibu and Austin, where “I have a very healthy relationship with time,” he said. “It’s a very unimpressed town because it has an identity.”Mr. McConaughey said he was determined to keep his slate of films interesting, though that doesn’t mean indies only. He next stars with Woody Harrelson in “True Detective,” a new HBO series, and has what sounds like an award-baiting lead role in “The Dallas Buyers’ Club,” based on the true story of an H.I.V.-positive man in the 1980s who turned to underground pharmacies.Mr. McConaughey looked down at his notes and picked out something from a diary entry a few years ago: “I found this bit where I was saying: Hey, let’s not go do one for me, one for them. Let’s go do one for me, two for me, three for me, four for me, five for me, and hope like hell it could be one for them.”'"

"'12-07-09,'0','WASHINGTON — Two American agents with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration shot and killed a man suspected of drug smuggling in Honduras last week, an official disclosed on Sunday. The shooting, the second in a month, was the latest demonstration of the growing American involvement in counternarcotics operations in the country.The shooting took place shortly after midnight on July 3, after a small plane suspected of smuggling drugs from South America crashed south of Catacamas in eastern Honduras. Several helicopters carrying Honduran police officers and members of a commando-style squad of D.E.A. agents converged on the site.The security forces found two pilots. One, who was injured in the crash, was arrested. The other appeared at the doorway of the plane and “ignored orders to surrender and was shot after making a threatening gesture,” said Dawn N. Dearden, a D.E.A. spokeswoman.The Honduran police recovered about 900 kilograms of cocaine from the plane, she said. Both pilots were given medical treatment and taken elsewhere, but the man who was shot later died. “The pilot who resisted arrest died of his injuries,” she said. “Two D.E.A. agents were involved in the shooting.”Honduran authorities had briefly described a version of the events to reporters last week, saying that one of the two pilots had died. But they did not disclose that the pilot had been shot by American agents.In a similar operation early on June 23, a D.E.A. agent shot a suspected trafficker near the village of Brus Laguna.'"
"'12-07-09,'0','Col. Todd S. Desgrosseilliers, the commander of the Basic School, which oversees the course, said he had no special concerns as the course prepares to accept women. “Nothing more so with women than with men,” he said.“We expect them to be fit enough to go through the course when they get here, just like the men are.”The 86-day course, which meets four times a year, is called the corps’ most grueling school by its instructors and is intended to screen and train potential infantry officers. Its students are volunteers selected from lieutenants who have completed Officer Candidates School and the six-month Basic Officer Course, which trains all Marine lieutenants to lead provisional infantry platoons and in leadership, tactics, fitness and weapons. That school has been coed for decades.The experiment at I.O.C. could take a year or more; to obtain a statistically meaningful sample, the corps hopes to observe 92 female lieutenants in coming iterations and then, with information gathered from other studies and surveys, make recommendations about women’s service in so-called combat arms.The Marine Corps does not expect a flood of women to volunteer for the course, though more than one has for the next round. Women make up only 6 percent of the Marine ranks, and the school’s nature deters many Marines, no matter their gender.The current course begins with the Combat Endurance Test, which was added in the 1990s.Last week’s test began in a classroom after midnight. A captain addressed 96 students, each sitting beside a mock M-16A2 rifle (real rifles are not issued until after the first test) and a backpack loaded with food and equipment.From this moment on, the captain said, for an amount of time unknown to the students, they would be continuously evaluated. Students who failed would be assigned a noninfantry job.After a lieutenant completed each leg of the test, the captain said, there would be another instructor who would explain the next task. The test was timed, but the lieutenants would not know how much time was allowed for many events, or over all. This uncertainty was intended to force every student to go as fast as he could, never knowing how much energy and food to conserve.No one was to help anyone else, the captain said. Speaking was forbidden, except when addressing instructors, with one exception. “If you are injured at any time, it is the only time you will talk to another Marine,” he said. “Legitimately injured,” he added, “As in, ‘I have a bone sticking out of my leg.’ ”Students are asked not to share details of this test and other exercises at the course outside the Marine infantry officer ranks. The officers who supervise the course allowed this reporter to move alongside the lieutenants and observe the test in its entirety on the condition that the test not be described in full, and that specific standards, durations and distances and the chronology not be disclosed.Maj. Scott A. Cuomo, the course director, also requested that one portion not be photographed, as, he said, photographs would unveil an essential surprise. (This was one of the most mentally disorienting and physical sequences, during which three students quit.)Throughout the course, the students carried rifles and packs, which visibly took a toll on them, stage after stage. Colonel Desgrosseilliers said their exhaustion was by design.“We’re primarily a foot-mobile organization,” he added. “So you have to be able to carry the equipment you need in the fight. And you have to be able to fight when you get there, and, if you are an officer, you have to be able to think and make decisions in that fight that will influence it in a way that you will win.”Throughout the course, students were stopped and given written or practical exams, testing their knowledge of fire support, land navigation, weaponry, tactics, communications equipment and more.Outside, Major Cuomo walked the trails in the heat, watching the lieutenants and occasionally offering encouragement. He explained what the course’s role meant to him: providing enlisted infantry Marines, who bear the brunt of war’s risks and privations, with officers they deserve.He pointed at a lieutenant ahead, his uniform blackened by sweat and dirt, headed uphill. He appeared to have entered a slow-motion mental zone. He was weaving on shaky legs, but progressing.“There could come a time when the Marines in a platoon will look at that man, and say, ‘I don’t know where he came from, and I don’t know what he knows, but we are in a big mess and he is going to do the right thing right now and make this right,’ ” the major said. “That man needs to be up to that task.”At one point, the students arrived at a swimming pool. They were ordered into the deep end with equipment, and told to swim a certain number of lengths and then to tread water for a certain amount of time.Already exhausted, the officers swam slowly, trying to complete the laps.At another station, each student encountered a pile of intermingled weapons’ parts — a jumble of bolts, springs, barrels, firing pins, stocks, hand-guards and other components. The lieutenants were told that the pile contained disassembled American and foreign infantry arms and that they were expected to reassemble them all and perform function checks. There was a time limit, which the students were not told.At another point, the lieutenants found themselves at an obstacle course, which they had to complete multiple times. One officer lagged, staggering. He stopped, continued, stopped. It did not look as if he would climb the last lap’s last rope. But he did. He shuffled past Major Cuomo, fell to a knee and vomited repeatedly. At one point he dropped to all fours. Medical staff watched him. It looked as if he might pass out, but a few minutes later he was standing. A captain pointed to another card.Major Cuomo was expressionless until the man had found his stride and headed into the woods toward the next task.“There are not a lot of places in the military where you can push a guy to that point, and not help him, and let a guy dig down and find himself,” the major said. “Fortunately this is one of the places where you can.”Shortly after the test ended, Major Cuomo shared the results. Of 96 officers who had started the endurance test, 76 passed, 7 quit, 7 were injured and 6 failed.Those who had succeeded were back in the classroom. A few applied dressings to bloody feet. Permitted now to talk, several admitted that they were not sure the test was over, and expected a captain to appear with more cards.More than 80 days remained. Soon after that, a new class would begin, coed.'"
"'12-07-09,'0','PepsiCo, under its chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi, has been working to decrease its reliance on sugary carbonated beverages and snacks by developing new products and retooling old ones to increase their nutritional quality while remaining true to the company’s more playful roots.Ms. Nooyi calls this the “fun for you, better for you, good for you” strategy, and it has led to innovations that have reduced sodium in Lays potato chips and other snack chips and new sweeteners to reduce calories in juice products like Trop 50 and sodas like Pepsi Next.The goal with Müller by Quaker is to add fun to yogurt, which Americans have regarded as a dutiful but not delicious snack. “It’s been an ‘I gotta have it because it’s good for me’ kind of a product,” said Dr. Mehmood Khan, who oversees PepsiCo’s global research and development. “The ‘wanna have it’ was missing.”Or as Stefan Müller, the great-grandson of Müller’s founder, said: “Here in America, yogurt is so boring.”He noted that Americans on average consumed 12 pounds of yogurt a year, or half as much as Canadians and a third the amount of Europeans. “We look at the products and it’s no wonder it’s so low,” he said.Müller by Quaker will try to change that with what Mr. Lteif calls “mainstream premium” products that fill a gap between mass brands like Dannon and Yoplait and niche Greek yogurts like Fage and Chobani.Sales of yogurt have been strong in Kroger stores across the country for the last several years, said Alan Faust, director of dairy perishable and frozen foods at the Kroger Company. “It has a healthier image and is tied to a healthier lifestyle,” Mr. Faust said. “Some Greek is even being used as a meal replacement.”He has tasted the new Müller by Quaker products and says they represent an entirely new variety of yogurt, falling somewhere between Greek and conventional yogurts. “It’s a really high quality, flavorful product with good body texture,” he said.Two varieties of the Müller by Quaker yogurts, one conventional and one Greek, come in square rather than traditional round packages with one corner filled with an ingredient that the consumer can add to the yogurt by folding the corner or using a spoon. Besides traditional fruit flavors like strawberry and blueberry, these supplements include caramelized almonds, tiny chocolate-covered crunch balls and granola.A third variety is called Fruit Up because the fruit comes in a mousse that sits on top of the yogurt for the consumer to stir in. That allows the consumer to smell the peaches or raspberries as soon as the foil cover is removed.Müller by Quaker also seeks to address one of the biggest consumer complaints about yogurt: its texture. Consumers find Greek yogurts dry and chalky, while conventional yogurt is seen as watery and tasteless.“You have five senses, and we’re aiming to hit at least four of them with these products,” Mr. Lteif said.Yogurt is one of the hottest categories of the food market, stoked by the success of Greek yogurts, which are thicker and higher in protein. Yogurt sales in the United States this year will add up to roughly $7 billion, according to the consumer research firm Mintel, an increase of 9 percent over last year — when sales increased by 7.5 percent.“In the food business, growth of 1 to 2 percent is considered very good, particularly for a mature product like yogurt,” said John Frank, category manager for consumer packaged goods reports at Mintel. “This kind of growth is remarkable.”In the United States, Dannon and Yoplait, in which General Mills has a 51 percent stake, are by far the dominant players. Dannon has 25.5 percent of the sales in supermarkets, drugstores and mass merchandise stores other than Walmart, and Yoplait is at 26.2 percent, according to the SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm.But the inroads of brands like Fage and Chobani in driving new sales of yogurt gave PepsiCo confidence that there was room for another brand.One of the biggest challenges for companies trying to break into the yogurt market is getting shelf space in the dairy cases of grocery stores. PepsiCo, with its vaunted distribution system, already sells its Tropicana juices there and has additional clout with retailers through its Frito-Lay and beverage businesses.Analysts have long said that PepsiCo failed to exploit the Quaker brand, which it acquired in 2000 as part of its shift to more nutritional foods.“Pepsi has so far mostly refocused unhealthy products to become healthy as opposed to leveraging and expanding the Quaker brand,” said Ali Dibadj, a beverage analyst at Sanford Bernstein. “They’ve missed an opportunity with Quaker in nuts and other healthy products.”Dr. Khan’s research team has been working largely out of Quaker’s old headquarters in Chicago, and its innovations are just beginning to arrive in the market. Many of them are built around dairy, which is becoming a larger piece of PepsiCo’s business.In 2009, it created a joint venture with Almarai, a big Saudi Arabian dairy company, and last year, it completed its purchase of Wimm-Bill-Dann, a large Russian dairy company. The Russian acquisition increased sales of its healthier portfolio of products to about $13 billion annually, and PepsiCo expects that wedge of its pie to grow to $30 billion, driven largely by yogurt and dairy, by 2020.Last year, for example, a protein the team extracted from milk was added to Gatorade Recovery, which perhaps explains Coca-Cola’s recent agreement to distribute a small dairy-based sports drink, Core Power, which is owned by a dairy cooperative.Quaker this year introduced Real Medleys, a line of instant multigrain oatmeal with fruits and nuts that can be eaten right out of the container, and Dr. Khan said the company could not meet demand for the product.Such changes have led at least one Wall Street analyst to voice what had been regarded as heresy and spoken only in whispers. “The cola wars have abated,” said John Faucher, the beverage analyst at JPMorgan Chase. “Pepsi is now focused on growing all the beverages it sells — teas, juices, Gatorade — and not just selling more carbonated soda than Coke at the expense of profit margins.” Let the yogurt wars begin.'"
"'12-07-09,'0','Choi has an easy swing that makes her game look effortless, yet it was anything but on the 564-yard 10th hole. She had a triple-bogey 8 that cut her lead over Yang to two strokes.Choi’s trouble on the hole began when she pulled her drive into a steep drop-off a few yards off the fairway. After taking a one-stroke penalty and hitting again from the tee, she was in the rough for three shots, finally reaching the green in 6. She then missed a 12-foot putt.“I wasn’t nervous at all on the front nine,” said Choi, who acknowledged that the tension level rose on the 10th hole. “I had one missed shot on 10, and there I got a triple bogey. At that moment, I thought maybe I was going to screw up today. But I needed to fix it. I can do it. I talked to my caddie at that point, talking about the airplane tomorrow or vacation. Anything but golf.”Yang knew her window of opportunity was small when Choi slipped at 10.“I knew she was going to play well,” Yang said. “She is a very consistent player.”Choi wasted no time refocusing. She birdied No. 11, a 375-yard par 4, converting a 4-foot birdie attempt and expanding her lead to three shots.At No. 12, she rolled in a 20-footer for par after she appeared headed for a big number. Her approach shot had climbed a steep bluff beyond the green, leaving her with what appeared to be an unplayable lie.After turning down her caddie’s suggestion that she take an unplayable-lie penalty, she hacked the ball onto the green. That shot out of the deep rough may have saved the tournament for her.“I almost felt like taking an unplayable lie there, but if I do, I might get bad lie again,” she said. “My caddie told me to hit it hard and get it on the green. I didn’t expect the ball to finish on the green.”Choi also made a scrambling par at the par-3 13th, receiving a break when her tee shot appeared headed for a water hazard but bounced off two landscaping rocks to bound back into play.“All winners of this tournament have a little bit of luck,” Choi said. “I thought that was my luck, why I win today.”Choi built on her lead when Yang bogeyed the 14th hole and fell four shots back. Choi was never pressed again as she birdied Nos. 15 and 16.She dethroned another South Korean, So Yeon Ryu, who shot a 74 on Sunday to finish tied for 14th.“This week is pretty tough for me — a lot of tension for me,” Ryu said. “Sometimes, I couldn’t control myself, but I think I learn a lot of things.”Michelle Wie, who set the course record for this event with a six-under 66 on Friday, only for Choi to break her record by a stroke on Saturday, finished with an 80, putting her 10 over for the tournament.“I’m going to take all of it and learn from it,” Wie said of her up-and-down weekend, which included a 78 on Saturday. “Obviously, there were a lot of positives this week that I will take on. There are some things I need to work on.”Pace of play was an issue all week, and the United States Golf Association responded Sunday by making tee times 20 minutes earlier.

"'12-07-09,'0','THE European Union was conceived in hope: hope that peaceful, law-based integration would exorcise the demons of the Continent’s past and embed democratic norms and institutions in its political culture. That hope has come closer to realization than anyone could reasonably have expected when the process started 60 years ago. The centuries-old struggle for mastery between France and Germany has come to an end. The fascist regimes that once ruled Portugal, Spain and Greece have disappeared, as have the Soviet puppet regimes that once ruled 10 nations in central and Eastern Europe.But these achievements are now in danger. Thanks to the euro zone crisis — and the mixture of political sclerosis and financial turbulence that have accompanied it — we can no longer take for granted that the democratization of Europe is a done deed. In Portugal, Greece, Spain, Italy and Ireland voters have discovered that the bond markets have more power over their destinies than they have themselves. In Europe’s troubled periphery Abraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address has been amended: government may be of the people, but it is for the credit ratings agencies.Behind this brute reality looms the perennial question of how compatible democracy and capitalism are — and how to resolve the inescapable tension between the two. These aren’t new questions, but they are more neuralgic in Europe today than at any time since 1945.The impotence of sovereign governments in the face of global market power has led to apathy and extremism. Turnout in European Parliament elections has fallen from 65 percent in 1979 to just 43 percent in 2009. In Poland’s last parliamentary elections less than half the electorate bothered to vote; in Hungary, only 46 percent did.In the first round of the French election last April the far right and extreme left won a combined 29 percent of the total popular vote — more than the defeated President Nicolas Sarkozy or the eventual victor, François Hollande. In Greece’s June 17 election, the far-left Syriza party won 27 percent of the vote and neo-Nazis from the Golden Dawn Party took 7 percent. Italy’s Northern League, the Dutch Freedom Party, Poland’s Law and Justice Party, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Jobbik party in Hungary are all variations on the same far-right theme. Apathy is like a slow, wasting disease; populist extremism is more like an aggressive cancer. Together, they pose a profound threat to European democracy.'"
"'12-07-09,'0','The spot, by Cactus in Denver, will be shown statewide on July 17. Partners in the effort are the Colorado Office of Suicide Prevention and the Carson J. Spencer Foundation, a suicide-prevention organization, with financing from the Anschutz Family Foundation.In addition to billboards, the campaign also is using restroom posters and drink coasters promoting ManTherapy.org to try to reach men drowning their sorrows in bars.“The stigma around mental health for men is even greater than it is for the general population,” said Joseph Conrad, the chief executive of Cactus. “We thought humor would really crack that stigma and draw men in.”Jarrod T. Hindman, director of the Colorado Office of Suicide Prevention, said funny ads for products like erectile dysfunction drugs demonstrated that humor suited difficult topics.“Sexual dysfunction is an affront to men’s manhood, and I think mental illness and having depression also are seen as a sign of weakness that conflicts with being manly in the social ecology,” said Mr. Hindman.Jeffrey Boal, the founder of the Plowshare Group, which develops distribution strategies for public service announcements, reviewed the campaign and said its humor would serve it well when it comes to getting airtime donated.“There’s no question it will get played by P.S.A. directors,” he said. “Humor is a great tool in the P.S.A. space primarily because it’s used so sparingly, since we tend to cover serious topics.”As for whether the approach will actually be effective for men who are struggling, Mr. Boal said the tone might be problematic.“It’s not like dental hygiene or foot fungus — it’s something highly personal and very sensitive,” Mr. Boal said of suicide risks. “This is a very risky campaign, and that’s part of its beauty, but I’d really want to make sure I knew how it impacted the target population.”The initial concept for the campaign drew some skepticism from both suicide survivors and mental health professionals who have played an advisory role in the effort, Mr. Hindman said, but they all are “fully on board” now.“Some thought we would be making fun of therapy, but there are therapists out there that use humor, and Rich Mahogany is a guy you could have a beer with and who could also steer you in the right direction,” he said.Colorado is tied with New Mexico in having the sixth-highest suicide rate in the country, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. High suicide rates tend to correlate with states that are both sparsely populated and have high rates of gun ownership, according to data from the Harvard School of Public Health. Montana tops the list, followed by Alaska and Wisconsin.Even though three times as many women than men attempt suicide, the rate for suicide attempts resulting in a fatality is almost four times higher for men, or 79 percent to 21 percent. That disparity may stem from men’s higher rate of gun ownership, with suicides attempted with firearms having the highest fatality rate (85 percent), followed by hanging and other types of suffocation (69 percent) and jumping (31 percent), according to the Harvard data.Responding to the rising number of suicides among active duty soldiers — a number that as of June 1 outpaced the number of troops killed in Afghanistan this year — the Pentagon recently established a Defense Suicide Prevention Office.On ManTherapy.org, Dr. Mahogany is a constant presence, greeting visitors seated in a leather chair when they first open the site and delivering various messages when prompted. Clicking a prominent red rotary phone reveals the number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.A questionnaire on the site gauges respondents’ mental state, with Dr. Mahogany in one of three videos declaring the results good, about average, or troublesome.“Your results have me worried,” he says gravely in the video for the most troubling results, the only time he steps out of character. “And needless to say, if a pretend doctor like me is concerned about you, you probably should get some help.”'"

"'12-07-09,'0','The prime minister called for “historic change” and promised incentives for those who serve and sanctions against those who do not.The move came hours after a protest in Tel Aviv on Saturday that drew about 20,000 people demanding a broader military draft and the resignation of several politicians. It also followed a week of political turmoil in which several important members of Mr. Netanyahu’s coalition threatened to quit over the issue, including the Yisrael Beiteinu Party of Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman; ultra-Orthodox factions; and the large Kadima bloc whose surprise move to join the coalition two months ago gave the prime minister a 94-seat majority in the 120-member Parliament.For now, the political crisis seems to have been contained: Mr. Lieberman was silent on Sunday, Kadima appeared to have been appeased and the ultra-Orthodox parties were expected to oppose the legislation but remain in the coalition.But the details yet to be worked out could be tricky, including how many yeshiva students and Arabs will be expected to join up, and how quickly; what will the financial sanctions be against those who refuse; and how will the needs of the ultra-Orthodox in matters like segregation of the sexes be handled.“There could still be bumps on the way,” said one senior Kadima official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly. “Kadima has its red lines, and if the new law will not be in coordination with these lines, then I don’t think it’s going to pass. But for the moment we can be a bit more optimistic.”About 17 percent of ultra-Orthodox men now serve in the military or perform civilian national service work; 75 percent of other Jewish men serve in the military. Over all, about 60,000 yeshiva students are exempt from the draft under the law the Supreme Court struck down, a huge expansion of the 400 waivers granted at Israel’s founding to ensure the future of Torah study. Several thousand of the top students are expected to remain exempt.Arabs generally do not serve in the Israeli military, but the number performing national service has increased tenfold in recent years, and some polls have shown that a majority of Israeli Arabs support requiring such service as a way to better integrate into Israel’s work force.“After 64 years in which this issue has not been properly dealt with, we are facing a historic move, a dramatic increase in the participation of the ultra-Orthodox and Arab publics in bearing the burden,” Mr. Netanyahu said in his statement. “Such an increase has started, it is welcome, it is important — but it is not enough.”'"

"'12-07-09,'0','“Most newspapers are in a place right now that they are going to have to make big cuts somewhere, and big seams are bound to show up at some point,” said Rick Edmonds, a media business analyst at the Poynter Institute.Some of the bigger cracks can’t be papered over by financial engineering. Hedge funds, which thought they had bought in at the bottom, are scrambling for exits that don’t exist. Many newspaper companies are hugely overburdened with debt from ill-timed purchases. And though it is far less discussed, newspapers are being clobbered by paltry returns on underfunded pension plans.Two highly placed newspaper executives told me last week that while the industry had already experienced a number of strategic bankruptcies, more will most likely take place to deal with pension obligations.As Mike Simonton of Fitch Ratings pointed out to me, very few bond investors are even willing to lend to papers. He said the pension obligations “represent a call on capital at a time when newspapers desperately need to deploy capital toward evolving their business models and adapting to the digital world.”The global pension plan at Gannett, which owns 82 daily papers, is underfunded by $942 million, and McClatchy, which owns 30 dailies, is short $383 million, according to Mr. Simonton, even though both companies have been pouring tens of millions in precious cash into the plans to shore them up. Many United States companies have onerous pension obligations, but the decline in revenue gives newspapers a tougher hill to climb.The employees who earn those pensions are quick to point out that management in many of the companies still found money for ill-advised stock buybacks, along with lucrative dividends and executive compensation, neither of which was supported by results.Journalists who are constantly being asked to do more with less wonder why the owners didn’t invest to meet the coming threat and to add the funds to honor commitments to employees back when they were making great gobs of money.People take heart that Warren Buffett has been buying newspapers, but it is worth noting that when he bought Media General newspapers, he left the pension liabilities with Media General’s parent company.Those of us who work inside the racket like to think of our business as unique, but with underfunded pension plans, unserviceable debt and legacy manufacturing processes and union agreements, the newspaper industry looks a lot like, well, steel, autos and textiles.The bread and butter for most of the industry is local information. But it has become seemingly impossible to make money creating daily compendiums and throwing it on people’s doorsteps. Journatic, the content provider, proceeds from the bold premise that generating community news can function on a call-center model, where a staff unrelated by geography or affiliation will serve customer needs. The company allowed employees to gin up fake bylines to give the appearance of a connection.And it’s not just newspapers. AOL’s ambitious local news effort, called Patch, is losing $150 million a year, by some estimates, and is no closer to cracking the code.Given that context, it’s not hard to see why Advance Publications is making huge moves in some of the 25 cities where it publishes newspapers, most notably in New Orleans, where it is spending the summer reducing the staff.Advance’s regional Web sites have generated traffic and have active forums, but they are a miserable place to consume news. Balky and ugly, with a digital revenue base below much of the rest of the industry, they seem like a shaky platform on which to build a business. Some recent traffic trends are not encouraging. According to Nielsen, The Times-Picayune’s site, Nola.com, had 639,000 unique visitors in May, compared with over a million in that month a year ago.Once upon a time, the Newhouse family kept unions at bay by promising lifetime employment, but now the company wants to shed people, and legacy costs, as quickly as it can. The plan is built on accounting, not strategy, which is why some of the newspaper’s heavy hitters have declined offers from the newly reconfigured enterprise.David Hammer, who played a large role in The Times-Picayune’s coverage of the rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, took a job with the New Orleans CBS affiliate, WWL-TV, doing investigative work; he will be joined by Brendan McCarthy, one of the newspaper’s young stars.Stephanie Grace, a former statewide columnist, declined a job as a reporter, and Bill Barrow, a longtime reporter who covered health care, is going to work for The Associated Press. Bob Marshall, a Pulitzer Prize winner and the newspaper’s outdoors editor, took a pass as well.They are the kind of people that separate The Times-Picayune from, well, Journatic. “When you look at it, they were asking us to take a job where the revenues are still very dependent on the print product,” Mr. Barrow said. “But that newspaper is no longer a priority and no one knows what it is going to look like or what it will have in the way of news when it comes out. There are too many unknowns.”The diminution of The Times-Picayune is a profound loss and a bet on some very wobbly assets. Still, who is to say that the Newhouse family is any more misguided than the rest of an industry that is scrambling for safe ground? After all, the math is daunting, and there is a shortage of magic bullets.But as they proceed, the Newhouses should remember that cutting corners ignores a fundamental fact: great journalism, on any platform, is the one sure hedge against irrelevancy.'"
"'12-07-09,'0','Asked about that, Mr. Conner, 57, who joined Boeing as a mechanic in 1977 and who has spent much of his career in leading sales and marketing positions at the company, said, “I wish them luck.”“At the end of the day, you compete with the best products, with the best value, the best performance and the best relationships,” he said. “If Airbus can bring a better value proposition to the game, then the U.S. airlines will take that into account.”Among the American carriers represented at Airbus’s announcement ceremony in Mobile last week were JetBlue Airways and American Airlines. Last year, American split an order for 460 single-aisle planes, more than $38 billion, between Airbus and Boeing. That order, which Airbus considered a major coup, broke a longstanding monopoly that Boeing had with the airline, which is based in Fort Worth.Competition between the two companies is fierce in the United States, where many carriers are eager to replace older aircraft with more fuel-efficient models. The average age of single-aisle jets in the United States is 13 years.Boeing said in April that it was in exclusive negotiations with United Continental Holdings for an order of around 200 of its 737 jets. The list value of that order would be around $17 billion.Mr. Conner said he was skeptical that assembling the A320 in Alabama, where wages were likely to be lower than at Airbus’s factories in Germany and France, would enable the European company to achieve significant unit-cost savings or to undercut Boeing significantly on the pricing of its planes.“Final assembly represents a pretty small part of the value” of an aircraft, he said.Analysts estimate that final assembly represents only about 5 percent of the value of an aircraft, but can represent about 15 percent of a manufacturer’s in-house costs. The bulk of production costs — about 70 percent of a jet’s value — are typically borne by suppliers.Boeing predicted last week that 68 percent of the 34,000 new planes it expects to be sold worldwide over the next 20 years would be in the single-aisle category, worth around $2 trillion. Single-aisle demand in the United States and Canada would probably reach 5,000 planes over the same time, the company said.'"
"'12-07-09,'0','X-rays confirmed that Sánchez broke his hand but could not reveal the full extent of his shoulder injury. Sánchez will head back to Spain on Monday for a scan, a spokesman for the Euskaltel-Euskadi team, Jesus Aizkorbe, told The Associated Press.“The most important thing is my health,” Sánchez said. “I want to know how serious is my injury in order to start a recovery program as soon as possible. Today I cried on the road because it’s hard to leave the Tour so early, before the two time trials, the Alps and the Pyrenees.”Alejandro Valverde of Spain, one of the two riders who fell on Sánchez, cut his shin in the crash, Pommerie said. Sánchez had started the day in 12th, 2 minutes 2 seconds behind Wiggins.“The guys are really nervous the first week,” said Rein Taaramae, an Estonian who wears the white jersey as the highest-placed rider under 25. He said the crashes had made the riders feel “like soldiers in a war.”The Tour veteran Stuart O’Grady, who crashed out of the 2007 race with five broken ribs, had another view.“There are a lot of young kids out there, and they don’t know how to ride their bikes,” O’Grady told Cycle Sport magazine. “There’s a lot of inexperience, a lot of desperation, a lot of nerves. I think everyone needs to chill.”The 98-mile ride on Sunday from Belfort to the Swiss town of Porrentruy featured seven climbs. Pinot broke away from the pack during a steep, final climb. The youngest rider in the main pack at 22, Pinot held on during a frenzied chase in the last six miles, a mostly flat stretch.“I will remember this day my entire life,” Pinot said as teammates embraced him. “I can’t yet get my mind around it.”Over all, Wiggins led the defending champion Cadel Evans of Australia by 10 seconds. Vincenzo Nibali of Italy was third, 16 seconds off the pace.Evans finished second in the stage, 26 seconds behind, but did not gain any time on Wiggins, who was fourth in a small group that included most of the remaining prerace favorites.“It was good fun coming in at the end there,” Wiggins said. “It was a bit like being in a junior race again. Everyone attacking in ones and twos. It’s good. It’s what it’s all about.”Wiggins, who is aiming to be Britain’s first Tour winner, responded with anger and profanities when asked about doping in cycling.Wiggins’ Sky Team has controlled the Tour in a style reminiscent of Lance Armstrong’s former United States Postal team. Wiggins lost his composure when asked by a reporter to comment on comparisons between the teams and on the “cynics who believe that you have to be doped up to win the Tour.”Wiggins, angered by chatter on social media, answered with an expletive-filled outburst.“I cannot be dealing with people like that,” he said. “It justifies their own bone-idleness because they can’t ever imagine applying themselves to anything in their lives. And it’s easy for them to sit under a pseudonym on Twitter and write that.”Last month, the United States Anti-Doping Agency filed charges against Armstrong, a seven-time Tour champion, accusing him of using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong denies any wrongdoing.'"
"'12-07-09,'0','Scant accurate data is available on the extent of the decline in real estate prices. Brokers say prices have fallen 20 percent or more in the last year. A monthly government survey of older neighborhoods where few transactions take place shows a much smaller decline, however, while a separate survey of real estate developers shows that few acknowledge the steep discounting described by brokers.Broader price gauges are starting to show signs of deflation, as the supply of goods overwhelms weak demand. The Chinese government announced on Monday morning that producer prices fell 2.1 percent in June from a year earlier. Consumer prices were only up 2.2 percent in June from a year ago, and actually dropped 0.6 percent from May.The Chinese central bank announced on Thursday that it was cutting the country’s regulated bank lending and deposit rates for the second time in four weeks, an uncharacteristically brisk pace. The cuts have started to rekindle the Chinese public’s enthusiasm for real estate investments, with the number of transactions starting to quicken in recent weeks.But the central bank warned banks on Thursday to keep a tight rein on mortgage lending, and Mr. Wen said on Saturday that the government’s policy of improving the affordability of real estate had not wavered. “To further implement the regulation,” Xinhua said, “Wen urged unswerving efforts to ensure prices return to reasonable levels, and block a price rebound that would undermine the effects of previous efforts.”Informal tallies suggest that about a third of China’s 100 largest cities have loosened the ban on real estate speculation in recent weeks to revive local markets. Mr. Wen warned that these loosening moves must be halted and reversed, and even threatened punishment for officials who tried to “cheat” on the restrictions.Sales of land leases are a critical source of revenue for local governments, so the downturn in real estate markets has hurt their finances. Many of these governments are deeply in debt after spending lavishly in 2009 and 2010 on infrastructure projects like airports, highways and high-speed rail to offset the effects of the global economic slowdown.The Chinese government has already adopted policies to support the rest of the economy. In addition to the interest rate cuts, the government has freed banks to lend a larger share of their deposits, subsidized the sale of energy-saving home appliances and accelerated the approval of large construction projects.During his inspection tour over the weekend, Mr. Wen hinted at further measures, including tax credits for companies that invest in research and development. He urged Chinese businesses to pursue export opportunities in Southeast Asia, Central Asia and South Asia as alternatives to industrialized countries where protectionist pressures might build.Despite these efforts in recent weeks, economic data for June and for the second quarter, scheduled to be released this week, is expected to show further weakness. April and May data showed unusually slow growth in retail sales, investment, electricity consumption and other barometers of economic growth.As electricity demand has slowed, so much unneeded coal has accumulated that storage areas at major Chinese ports are at record levels and arriving ships full of coal must wait many days to unload. Piles of mined coal fill empty lots and line roadsides in some mining areas in northern China, as mine owners maintain production while hoping prices will recover.'"

The rate is set by the British Bankers’ Association (B.B.A.), an industry group in London.Each weekday, leading banks around the world each submit a figure to the B.B.A. based on the rate at which they estimate they could borrow funds from other banks.The Libor is often used to price financial instruments like swaps transactions and futures contracts. At least an estimated $350 trillion in derivatives and other financial products are tied to it.Later, during the height of the financial crisis, Barclays submitted artificially low rates to give the impression that the bank could borrow money more cheaply and was healthier than it was.To calculate interest rates, some lenders use the Libor as a base and add additional interest based on the borrower. When the Libor goes up, rates and payments on loans tied to it can rise as well.'"

Just 80,000 jobs were added in June, capping the worst quarter since the summer of 2010 for job creation.Mr. Obama sought a quick change of subject on Monday with his call for an extension of middle-class tax cuts, saying that the fate of similar cuts for the wealthy would be resolved by voters in November’s election.“My opponent will fight to keep them in place,” he said. “I will fight to end them.”Meanwhile, the president’s advisers and allies are intensifying their focus on Mr. Romney’s financial holdings, seizing on reports by the news media that some of the Republican’s personal money is kept in overseas bank and investment accounts. The reports added new details about the status of Mr. Romney’s finances.The existence of a Swiss bank account was first disclosed in January, when Mr. Romney released his 2010 tax returns. Advisers have said the account was closed that year.But an article in Vanity Fair magazine published last week added new details about other holdings in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, which served as complex investment holdings for partnership income that Mr. Romney continued to receive for years after leaving Bain Capital, the private equity firm he founded two decades ago.The article said Mr. Romney has financial interests of at least $30 million in 12 funds in the Cayman Islands.Kevin Madden, a spokesman for Mr. Romney’s campaign, said on Fox News Sunday that the Republican candidate “hasn’t paid a penny less in taxes by virtue of where these funds are domiciled.” He added, “His liability is exactly the same as if he held the fund investments directly in the U.S.”But that answer has not stopped Democrats and Mr. Obama’s campaign from attacking. The Democratic National Committee created a video on Sunday highlighting reports of bank accounts in offshore institutions.Appearing on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program on Monday, Robert Gibbs, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama’s campaign, bluntly accused the Republican candidate of not giving voters the information they need to make a decision about his wealth.“Release the tax returns,” Mr. Gibbs said. “Put all this to rest. If Mitt Romney is not hiding something in Bermuda and Switzerland and the Caymans, it will be in the tax returns.”Dan Senor, an adviser to Mr. Romney, on the same “Morning Joe” episode, said that Mr. Gibbs was being “stunningly dishonest” in his attacks. “The reason we know about these accounts, as Robert knows, is because they are in the tax returns that Mitt Romney released,” Mr. Senor said.The Obama campaign is walking a fine line — trying to make Mr. Romney seem out of touch while not appearing to question the value of being a wealthy businessman. That kind of message could backfire, especially with moderate voters in battleground states.“It’s not about wealth,” Mr. LaBolt wrote in an e-mail. “There have been other wealthy candidates, nobody is out to demonize wealth.”So far, Mr. Obama’s campaign has focused more directly on Mr. Romney’s role as a business executive, suggesting that his career was a boon to the wealthy and that he did not have the interests of workers at heart.Now, Democrats are hoping to contrast Mr. Obama’s refusal to extend tax cuts for the wealthy and Mr. Romney’s desire to cut taxes for people like him.Mr. Romney’s advisers believe that the effort will misfire. They argue that voters want the candidates to talk about how they will turn around the economy.Polling suggests they may be right. A Washington Post/ABC News poll in April found that 71 percent of those surveyed did not consider Mr. Romney’s wealth to be a major reason to support or oppose him. Among those who said it was a major factor in the decision, his wealth was more likely to be a negative.For the most part, Mr. Romney’s advisers intend to ignore the attacks on his personal wealth. On Monday, they focused on Mr. Obama’s renewed call to let the tax cuts for the wealthy expire.“Americans are struggling in a ‘zombie economy,’ and President Obama’s only answer is to pass one of the largest tax hikes in history,” Ms. Henneberg said.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','A deadly form of a common childhood illness has been linked to many of the mysterious child deaths that have occurred in Cambodia, health officials said Monday. Lab tests have confirmed that a virulent strain of hand, foot and mouth disease known as EV-71 is to blame for some of the 59 cases reviewed since April, including 52 deaths, according to a joint statement from the World Health Organization and the Cambodian Health Ministry. The numbers were lowered from the initial report of 62 cases. EV-71 is a virus that can result in paralysis, brain swelling and death. Most of the Cambodian cases involved children younger than 3.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','“There’s an agreement on both sides that there should be some period of time when everyone steps back and reassesses,” said Michael O’Leary, a senior executive vice president for the Motion Picture Association of America.The Sun Valley conference, known as “summer camp for moguls,” is off limits to reporters (though dozens still turn out) and famously private. In between bike rides, hikes and cocktail parties, the executives will hold meetings, listen to a variety of speakers and attend panel discussions with luminaries from sports to politics.A preliminary list of attendees at this year’s conference includes Rupert Murdoch and Chase Carey, the chief executive and chief operating officer of News Corporation; Philippe Dauman, chief of Viacom; Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief of Time Warner; and Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook. Tim Cook, chief of Apple, and Google’s co-founder Sergey Brin are also expected to attend.In the months since the SOPA debates, media executives have discussed piracy with obvious shell shock.“I think we didn’t help ourselves down in Southern California by trying to jam something in Congress; we screwed that up,” Ari Emanuel, co-chief executive of the William Morris Endeavor talent agency, said at the All Things D conference in May. He added: “When SOPA died, a lot of conversations died. But they’ll start up again.”In the aftermath, Hollywood has increased its efforts to get online payment companies, cloud services and Internet service providers to voluntarily help curtail pirated movies, TV and music, particularly from foreign Web sites.Months before the debates erupted in January, American Express, Discover, MasterCard, PayPal and Visa agreed on a set of best practices to reduce the sale of counterfeited pirated goods. In 2010, Yahoo, PayPal, GoDaddy, Google and others formed a nonprofit intended to combat the sale of illegal pharmaceuticals online, one issue SOPA and PIPA were initially meant to address.The Sun Valley conference could provide a tranquil backdrop for the continued construction of a fence between media and technology.“We thought about what’s in the long-term interest of the Internet ecosystem. And that’s a set of best practices that people feel comfortable with,” said Cary Sherman, chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America.In January, Mr. Sherman said it was hard to negotiate with Google when the company is “attempting to undermine your very existence.” In June, he spoke at the Personal Democracy Forum in New York, an annual gathering of technology devotees that included speeches by industry leaders, a “hackathon,” and a scholarship award sponsored by Google. A moderator said Mr. Sherman had stepped into the “lion’s den” by speaking at the conference.“The legislative route is no longer appealing or practical,” Mr. Sherman said in an interview.Even with legislation off the table for now, tensions remain. In April, a federal appeals court reversed a lower court’s decision to throw out a $1 billion lawsuit that Viacom had filed against Google’s YouTube for using unauthorized video clips from shows like Comedy Central’s “The Colbert Report” and “The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.”Mr. Emanuel of William Morris pressed Google and others at the May conference to help the entertainment industry combat piracy. “One day they’re going to figure out that they’re just big pipes and they need premium content,” he said.Through a spokeswoman, Google released a statement saying the company is “in constant conversations with content creators about how to help them reach new audiences online and protect against piracy. Last year alone we took down five million infringing Web pages and invested more than $60 million in the fight against bad ads.”Susan Wojcicki, Google’s senior vice president for advertising, said in response to Mr. Emanuel’s comments that “we do not want to be building a business based on piracy.”During the firestorm on SOPA and PIPA, consumers took the Web’s side, emboldened by a fear that legislation would hinder Internet freedom, but also buoyed by the belief that if content were more readily available online at reasonable prices, consumers would not turn to pirated versions.In June, Emily White, an intern at National Public Radio, wrote in the blog All Things Considered that, though she had more than 11,000 songs in her iTunes music library, she had paid for only 15 compact discs. The admission sparked a wave of response from musicians.“Fairly compensating musicians is not a problem that is up to governments and large corporations to solve,” the songwriter and guitarist David Lowery wrote in response to Ms. White’s blog post. “It’s not up to them to make it ‘convenient’ so you don’t behave unethically.”A civilized debate between consumers and artists was a “nice silver lining” in the antipiracy debates that raged last winter, said Sandra Aistars, executive director of the Washington-based nonprofit Copyright Alliance.She added: “It shows you can have a rational dialogue on this issue and talk in a way that isn’t so politically charged.”'"
"'12-07-10,'0','Alcoa, the big aluminum manufacturer, opened the second-quarter earnings season on Monday by posting a $2 million loss, although its results were slightly ahead of analysts’ expectations. The company’s revenue dropped 9 percent mainly because of weak prices in the slowing global economy.Alcoa posted break-even earnings per share. That compared with 28 cents a share and net income of $322 million a year ago.The results included one-time items of $63 million. Excluding those, Alcoa earned $61 million, or 6 cents a share.Analysts surveyed by FactSet had expected Alcoa to earn 5 cents a share, excluding one-time items, on revenue of $5.83 billion. They had lowered their expectations for Alcoa in recent weeks because of weaker prices for aluminum, rising inventories and the sluggish economies of the United States, Europe and China.Alcoa said that it was hit by an 18 percent decline in aluminum prices from the second quarter of 2011, but that it saw pockets of stronger demand in some industries, and overall shipments were up from a year ago.“Although aluminum prices are down, the fundamentals of the aluminum market remain sound with strong demand and tight supply, and Alcoa is successfully capitalizing on accelerating demand in high-growth end markets such as aerospace and automotive,” Klaus Kleinfeld, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.The company stuck with its forecast for a 7 percent increase in global demand this year and predicted that there would be a global aluminum supply deficit this year.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','New York City’s Taxi and Limousine Commission is poised to vote Thursday on a taxi fare increase that would introduce particular strain to those inclined to take longer rides.The measure, unveiled in detail on Monday during a public hearing at the commission’s offices in Lower Manhattan, would raise fares by an average of 17 percent per ride, the commission said. That increase would be accomplished by raising the charge for each fifth of a mile traveled, or each 60 seconds in stopped or slow traffic, to 50 cents from 40 cents, putting the extra burden on longer rides. The base fee charged before a ride begins, known as the drop, will not change under the proposal.“I expect it’ll be adopted,” David S. Yassky, the commission’s chairman, said of the plan. Among the other provisions is a $7 increase in fares between Kennedy International Airport and Manhattan, to $52 plus tolls. The surcharge on rides to Newark Liberty International Airport would also rise, to $17.50 from $15.If adopted, the new fares could go into effect as soon as September. The most recent across-the-board increase in taxi fares was in 2004, when fares rose by 26 percent. In 2006, the city raised the price added for each minute that a cab was stopped or moving slowly; in 2009, a 50-cent surcharge, which still applies, was added to help support the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.Few attendees at Monday’s hearing argued against raising the fare. But drivers and fleet owners clashed over whether the increase should be accompanied by a significant increase in the so-called lease cap figure — the amount that a fleet or taxi owner can charge drivers for the use of a cab or a medallion.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','Bilateral animals, or bilaterians — so called because unlike, say, jellyfish, they have left, right, back and front sides — are probably the first animals that could move on their own. Until now, the oldest fossil evidence for bilaterians dated back 555 million years.However, scientists have found fossil burrows of a segmented slug that are about 30 million years older.The burrows, found in northeastern Uruguay, have fine details that offer hints about the appearance and behavior of the animals that made them. The slugs were less than four-tenths of an inch long, and apparently moved in search of food, grazing on various kinds of organic material found on the sea bottom in shallow water. They had primitive “feet” that they could extend into the mud to help them slide along.The researchers dated the fossils by measuring the ratio of uranium to its decay product lead, which allows them to estimate their age quite accurately, geologically speaking: within six million years.And yet there may still be undiscovered bilaterians that are older. “These fossils represent some behaviors that have already evolved,” said the senior author, Murray K. Gingras, a professor of paleontology at the University of Alberta, who reported the findings in Science. “So these probably aren’t the oldest trace fossils — there must be something a little older out there still. That gives paleontologists something to do.”'"
"'12-07-10,'0','The lawsuit claimed that the antidoping agency violated Armstrong’s constitutional rights to due process and asked the court to stop the agency from moving forward with its case against him. The suit said the antidoping agency and Tygart were out to prosecute a “big fish” so the agency could justify its existence.“Defendants have presented Mr. Armstrong with an impossible and unlawful choice: either accept a lifetime ban and the loss of his competitive achievements, or endure a rigged process where he would be certain to lose and suffer the same outcome,” the filing said.Armstrong, who lives in Austin and retired from cycling last year, was charged last month with doping violations and with playing a key role in a doping conspiracy while on the United States Postal Service and Discovery Channel teams. He faces a lifetime ban from Olympic sports, the loss of his Tour titles and the forfeiture of the money and awards he won.He has until Saturday afternoon to either accept or reject a sanction from the agency that his court filing said runs a “kangaroo court.”If he rejects the penalty, his case will proceed to an independent three-person arbitration panel, which his lawsuit called “an arbitration regime” that the antidoping agency “has populated with arbitrators who predictably find in Usada’s favor.”That hearing is mandated by the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, which includes a due process checklist that delineates athletes’ procedural rights. Any appeals of the arbitrators’ decision would be heard by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, the sport’s highest authority, and that decision would be final.Tygart said Monday that he was not surprised by Armstrong’s aggressive move, considering that other athletes “who attempted to have their own rules” have challenged the antidoping agency before, and failed.“Just like the other lawsuits that have been filed attempting to circumvent the process, the courts will review it and find similarly, that the process provides full constitutional due process to an accused,” Tygart said. “We look forward to that process ensuing.”Armstrong’s lawsuit said that the antidoping agency’s arbitration hearing was set up to handle the case of an athlete who had failed a drug test, not one of an athlete like him who had been charged with doping in the absence of a positive test.The suit also said the International Cycling Union should have jurisdiction over the case as cycling’s international governing body. The United States Anti-Doping Agency brought charges only after Armstrong’s former teammate Floyd Landis, who was stripped of the 2006 Tour title for doping, sent an e-mail to USA Cycling in the spring of 2010 about a doping conspiracy on the United States Postal Service squad.Armstrong’s lawyers also argue that the antidoping agency — which calls itself a quasi-governmental agency — is acting on behalf of the government in dealing with Armstrong’s case, which means it should avail Armstrong of greater constitutional procedural protections.The lawyers said the agency should be deemed a state actor because it receives a bulk of its funding from the government, is responsible for compliance of an international antidoping treaty and worked “entirely in concert” with federal investigators in an investigation of Armstrong that was dropped in February.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','The federal appeals court in Boston on May 31 struck down the part of the marriage law that concerns federal benefits, saying there was no good reason to treat some married couples differently from others.On June 29, Paul D. Clement, who had learned the day before that he had largely lost the health care case, was back at the Supreme Court. He asked the justices to hear an appeal from the Boston decision and uphold the marriage law.Four days later, Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., who had successfully defended the health care law, agreed that the new case warranted review. But he said the justices should strike down the marriage law.The appeals court ruling in Boston was largely based on equal protection principles. But there was a dash of federalism in it, too, one reminiscent of arguments in the health care case.Marriages have traditionally been governed by state law, Judge Michael Boudin wrote for a unanimous three-judge panel of the appeals court, raising federalism concerns that warranted a close look at whether the marriage law was justified.The trial judge, Joseph L. Tauro, had gone further, saying the marriage law overstepped Congress’s power to attach conditions to federal grants to states. For instance, Judge Tauro wrote, the Department of Veterans Affairs had threatened to take back some $19 million from Massachusetts if it allowed the burial of a veteran’s same-sex spouse in a cemetery that had been built and maintained with federal money.Most people did not take that part of Judge Tauro’s opinion very seriously, and the appeals court rejected it. But that was a month before the Supreme Court limited the health care law’s Medicaid expansion along similar lines.The important point about federalism, said Mr. Dellinger, the former Clinton administration lawyer, is that two interests that are sometimes at odds in cases about same-sex marriage line up here. “Gay rights and states’ rights are on the same side of the case,” he said.Mr. Verrilli, for his part, finds himself in an awkward position. It is ordinarily the job of the executive branch to defend laws enacted by Congress, and the Justice Department did defend the marriage law early in the Obama administration. Last year, though, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. announced an about-face, saying he and President Obama had concluded that the law was unconstitutional.The administration would continue to enforce the law, Mr. Holder said, but would no longer defend it in court.After the administration’s move, House Republicans intervened in the case to defend the law. They turned to Mr. Clement, who sometimes seems to be handling every important case on the Supreme Court docket.In his Supreme Court petition, Mr. Clement wrote that the justices should hear the case because legislators were not equipped to litigate. “The House has been forced into the position of defending numerous lawsuits challenging DOMA across the nation,” he said. “That is a role for which the Justice Department — not the House — is institutionally designed.”The seven same-sex couples and three surviving spouses actually challenging the law have yet to be heard from, and they will presumably urge the Supreme Court to deny review. But there is every reason to think the court will agree to hear the case, or a similar one from California, shortly after the justices return from their summer break, with arguments around January and a decision by June.Both sides will be looking for support in the principles that animated the health care decision. In his petition, Mr. Clement quoted an observation from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., one of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.’s touchstones, that “judging the constitutionality of an act of Congress is the gravest and most delicate duty that this court is called on to perform.”Mr. Verrilli went his adversary one better, actually citing the five-day-old health care decision, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, in what was probably its first appearance in a Supreme Court brief. In the health care case, Mr. Verrilli reminded the justices, they appointed lawyers to argue positions that neither party had embraced. In the marriage case, where both the plaintiffs and the Justice Department now agree that the law is unconstitutional, Mr. Verrilli said, it would similarly be sensible to allow Mr. Clement to have his say.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','For its part, the European Commission had proposed that Madrid’s deficit target this year be relaxed to 6.3 percent of gross domestic product, from 5.3 percent earlier. Madrid also would get an additional year — until 2014 — to bring the deficit below 3 percent of G.D.P., which is the target for all euro zone countries.That proposal — which the Eurogroup accepted and all 27 European Union finance ministers were to expected to endorse later Tuesday — plays into the debate over terms for the loan to bail out Spanish banks.The Eurogroup agreed last month to make up to 100 billion euros available to the banking sector with only limited new conditions — on the understanding that Madrid would continue to meet the budget targets set by the commission.Euro zone officials said the new conditions would include “bank-by-bank stress tests,” to be conducted by external consultants, and overall strengthening of regulation and supervision. Banks determined to be in need of direct aid will first have to segregate their failing assets and transfer them to an external agency, officials said.The “political agreement” on the so-called memorandum of understanding now needs to be ratified in some countries by parliaments, meaning another Eurogroup meeting would need to be called afterward to complete it. The Spanish economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said he expected the definitive agreement on July 20.As an immediate follow-up to the summit deal, the European Central Bank signed an agreement with the existing bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to allow it to act as agent for buying government bonds on the secondary market on the fund’s behalf. To avoid adding to the pile of shaky government debt already on the bank’s books, “all financial risks and benefits” from any new purchases would be transferred to the facility’s balance sheet.Amid evidence of falling tax revenues, Cristóbal Montoro, the Spanish budget minister, indicated for the first time on Monday that his government was likely to bow to European pressure and raise the rate of the value-added tax, a form of sales tax.At a conference outside Madrid, Mr. Montoro also outlined plans to extend working hours for civil servants. He did not give a timetable for the measures but Mariano Rajoy, the prime minister, is due to address Parliament on Wednesday.Ahead of the Eurogroup meeting, European officials sought to dispel doubts about a deal struck last month to break the “vicious circle” between shaky banks and weak governments. And the European Central Bank reaffirmed that it stood ready to do more to stem the crisis — within the limits of its mandate — while urging euro zone governments to press ahead with closer integration.“We look with interest to all ideas,” the central bank’s president, Mario Draghi, told a committee of the European Parliament. But “effective crisis resolution,” he added, “also needs bold actions by other policy actors, notably governments.”Pressed to relieve some of the mounting market pressure on Spain and Italy, another weak economy that also has one of the highest debt loads in Europe, European leaders agreed at a summit meeting last month on a number of short-term measures, including using the bailout funds to directly recapitalize shaky banks and to buy government debt to help bring down borrowing costs.The possibility of direct injections of capital was meant most immediately to help Spain, which is under pressure because of concerns that, by borrowing from the bailout funds to recapitalize its struggling banks, it would simply swell its public debt burden.The interest rate, or yield, on Spanish 10-year sovereign bonds spiked above 7 percent again Monday, after dropping to near 6 percent in the days after the summit meeting on June 29.Suggestions last week that national governments would have to assume ultimate liability for banks that are rescued with euro zone bailout funds had taken some of the luster off the summit deal. That prompted the European Commission on Monday to “clarify” that “there will be no need for a sovereign guarantee for banks being directly recapitalized” by the soon-to-be-established permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism.“Direct bank recapitalization will enable us to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereign risk,” Mr. Rehn said.He and other officials stressed, however, that the summit agreement mandated that a new, “single supervisory mechanism” for euro zone banks had to be put in place before direct bank recapitalizations could be made.Mr. Draghi, whose institution will play a leading role in the new supervisory system, underscored in his testimony Monday the amount of work that still remained to secure a detailed agreement on a banking union.He said that there were three views about how many institutions need to fall under European supervision. One would include just systemically important banks that operate across borders, another would also include large banks that operate only in one country, and a third would encompass all banks.“But all banks, that is about 6,000 or more,” he said. “I think in answering these questions, we should never forget we will rely on national supervisors. We won’t start from scratch.”Officials said the European Commission would present a proposal by early September, and the whole process will most likely take until the end of this year.“Everyone knows that setting up European bank supervision isn’t a small thing, it’s a huge task,” the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, said.Mr. Draghi said, however, that the time frame “is not a big problem” because any bailout money delivered to governments now to recapitalize banks could be transferred later off the government’s books.“It would be temporary, a temporary blip in public debt,” he said.Other countries, like Ireland and Greece, hope to benefit eventually as well. Allowing the stability mechanism to directly recapitalize Greek banks would knock some 50 billion euros, or $62 billion, off the country’s sovereign debt, which stands at around 330 billion euros.Spain is not the only country facing rising borrowing costs. Italian 10-year bonds topped 6 percent on Monday, after dropping to around 5.5 percent last week. German 10-year bunds, the European standard for safety, were at 1.3 percent, down from 1.5 percent last week.Also on Monday, the euro zone finance ministers agreed to appoint Yves Mersch, the head of Luxembourg’s central bank, to the European Central Bank’s six-member executive board. The seat has been empty since May 31, with the expiration of the term of José Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo, a Spaniard. Spain had pushed to hold on to the seat.Mr. Juncker, who had said he would step down as Eurogroup president after his third term expires this month, was appointed to another term, following resistance in Paris to Berlin’s preferred replacement, Mr. Schäuble. But Mr. Juncker said he did not intend to serve the full 2 1/2-year term, and would step down by early next year at the latest.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','The rally was held by the Defense of Pakistan Council, an umbrella organization for militant groups and religious parties that Mr. Saeed leads. It has become the lightning rod for anti-American sentiment in Pakistan this year. The council was formed last November in reaction to a border clash in which American warplanes killed 24 Pakistani soldiers along the border, prompting the immediate closing of the NATO supply routes.But the eight-month blockade was lifted last week after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton finally met Pakistani demands for an apology over the episode, inciting a furious reaction from the vocal anti-American lobby in Pakistan.The Defense of Pakistan Council rally started in the eastern city of Lahore on Sunday and wound its way along the Grand Trunk Road, a storied colonial-era thoroughfare that traverses Pakistan’s version of the American Bible Belt: a district of deep-rooted conservatism with strong military ties and, increasingly, a source of religious intolerance.Many marchers supported the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. “We are supporting them because America is the world’s No. 1 terrorist,” said Saqlain Aslam, a 30-year-old from Lahore who is studying software technology. “We will give our lives to stop the NATO supply lines.”Though the procession and rally were reported to have remained peaceful, a troubling antigovernment attack coincided with the protesters’ progress on the road to Islamabad overnight: unidentified gunmen traveling by motorcycle opened fire on a military encampment about 100 miles from Islamabad early Monday, killing six soldiers and a police officer, officials said.The soldiers had set up the camp to search for the body of a military helicopter pilot who crashed on May 23; many were caught by surprise as they prepared for morning prayers, the army said. Another five soldiers were wounded and taken to a nearby hospital.The attack was unusual — most such violence occurs in the northwest, along the Afghan border — and coincided with the Defense of Pakistan Council rally, whose supporters had stopped in Gujrat, 10 miles to the north.Here in Islamabad, Mr. Saeed denied any connection to the attack. Instead, he said, it had been carried out by “another Raymond Davis” — a reference to the C.I.A. contractor who killed two Pakistanis in Lahore last year, and whose name has become a byword for conspiracy theories about dark American meddling.Also present on the march was Maulana Sami ul-Haq, a religious leader whose madrasa, or Islamic school, helped incubate the Afghan Taliban movement; Hamid Gul, a retired head of the Inter-Services Intelligence directorate; and Sheik Rashid Ahmed, a former minister under President Pervez Musharraf who issued a rabble-rousing speech that supported the idea of overthrowing the elected government.“People are praying to have this government undemocratically removed, I am sorry to say,” he shouted, pointing to Parliament.The rally highlighted the worrisome place that extremists have carved out in Pakistani public life. After Mr. Saeed ended his speech, he was whisked away in a convoy of bulletproof jeeps. Local news media reported that another jihadi group, Al-Badr Mujahedeen, was fund-raising and recruiting on Sunday in Rawalpindi, near Islamabad.But the Islamabad rally also highlighted the limits of extremist influence. The crowd was small by the standards of political rallies; the organizers were forced to hold the rally close to midnight, which excluded them from prime-time television coverage.The rally broke up peacefully after the speeches ended; organizers said they would resume protests later this month, closer to the border.'"
"'12-07-10,'0','Producer prices, measured at the factory gate, were down 2.1 percent in June from a year earlier, and down 0.7 percent in June from May. Those prices had started to weaken late last summer, about six months before consumer prices began eroding.Sun Junwei, a China economist at HSBC, noted that the month-to-month price data was not seasonally adjusted and that June had historically been a month of lower prices. Adjusting for that pattern, he said, could mean that consumer prices were flat in June compared with May.But consumer and producer prices are clearly slowing even faster than expected, many economists said, adding that the trend strengthened the case for further economic stimulus in China. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Monday in Paris that the Chinese and Indian economies were both entering more marked economic slowdowns.Some company managers complained of having to cut prices for their wares even as labor costs continued climbing.“Business is slower and more challenging this year compared to the same period last year — I would say prices are down over all by 5 percent this year,” said Elaine Yan, the manager of the import and export department at Wuxi Zontai International, a trading company in Wuxi, China, that sells leather gloves, handbags, scissors and embroidery.Sopheia Wang, the sales manager at Kunshan Tianyuan Precision Industry, a manufacturer of coffee pots and mugs based near Shanghai, said that her company had resisted cutting prices so far because the local minimum wage had risen 21 percent last month.“With the global economy not doing well, we are looking into developing the domestic market for our products, rather than actively adjusting downward our pricing,” she said.Companies are saving money on raw materials, however, because the global boom in commodity prices swung into reverse in March.Chinese economic policy makers did little to respond to the country’s slowing economy from mid-March to mid-May. That period happened to coincide with a factional struggle, as a prominent member of the Communist Party, Bo Xilai, was removed as party secretary of Chongqing in March and suspended from the Politburo in April.The country’s leadership now seems to be reacting with policies aimed at offsetting the economic slowdown. Mr. Wen took an inspection tour of east central China over the weekend and called for more aggressive fiscal and monetary policies. The Chinese central bank cut interest rates twice over the last month.But Mr. Wen also reaffirmed over the weekend the central government’s commitment to improving the affordability of housing, through policies designed to discourage real estate speculation. Banks have been discouraged from issuing mortgages for second and third homes, for example.China is expected to release a long list of economic indicators Thursday or Friday, but many economists are suspicious that Chinese statisticians “smooth” the data, by underreporting economic growth in good times and overreporting it during periods of slowdown.Some analysts have looked at electricity production and consumption data as a more reliable gauge, but the bank Standard Chartered issued a research report on Monday saying that even electricity figures were showing signs of inaccuracy.A few economists are starting to ask whether China could face deflation, a sometimes intractable condition of falling prices that can become self-reinforcing, as Japan has found over the last two decades.“Today’s inflation data show that deflation could become a larger concern for China than inflation,” said Ren Xianfeng, a China economist at IHS, a global consulting company.But most economists are still skeptical that China faces a significant risk of sustained deflation. Regulated bank lending rates are at 6 percent, leaving a long way for them to be cut. While local government agencies are heavily indebted, the central government is not. And while one of the dangers of deflation is that banks cut back on lending, the Chinese government still heavily controls the country’s banking sector and dictates when to raise or lower the flow of loans.Michael Pettis, a finance professor at the Guanghua School of Management at Peking University, said that falling prices could even be good for China.The disappearance of inflation, and even falling prices, would help erase a huge annual transfer of wealth away from households and would help to rebalance the economy toward consumers, Mr. Pettis said.'"

"'12-07-11,'0','A Tibetan man in his 20s set himself on fire in a village near Lhasa, the Tibetan capital, according to reports by Radio Free Asia and Free Tibet, an advocacy group. The self-immolation took place on Saturday and was the 43rd self-immolation since 2009 in protest of Chinese rule in a Tibetan area, the Radio Free Asia report said. The condition of the man was unclear. Free Tibet said he was Tsewang Dorjee, 22, a nomad. Radio Free Asia, citing a person from Lhasa, said the self-immolation took place in an area that Tibetans call Damshung, and the Chinese call Dangxiong. The Chinese government has denounced the self-immolations as the work of separatists. In May, two men self-immolated in Lhasa in front of the Jokhang, the holiest temple of Tibetan Buddhism. The Chinese government generally does not allow foreigners, including foreign journalists, to travel independently to Lhasa or other parts of central Tibet. Many areas in eastern Tibet, the region where most of the self-immolations have taken place, are now also closed to foreigners.'"
"'12-07-11,'0','The league lifted its moratorium on signings and trades, and a flurry of activity was expected to follow, as teams and players moved to consummate the deals negotiated during the first 10 days of July.Steve Nash will be migrating from Phoenix to Los Angeles, Jason Kidd from Dallas to New York and Ray Allen from Boston to Miami.The Celtics are losing Allen but gaining Jason Terry and Jeff Green. The Knicks are adding Kidd and Marcus Camby, bolstering their bench, their defense and their locker-room I.Q.Joe Johnson will soon be traded from Atlanta to Brooklyn, where he will join Deron Williams to form one of the league’s most dynamic backcourts. If Howard were to join them, the Nets would become instant contenders in the Eastern Conference.That was looking less likely on Tuesday, however, as HoopsWorld and ESPN.com reported that the Rockets and the Lakers had engaged the Magic in a three-team proposal that would send Howard to Los Angeles and Andrew Bynum — the Lakers’ enigmatic young center — to Houston. The Magic would receive a combination of draft picks and salary-cap relief, allowing them to rebuild for the post-Howard era.The Rockets have been stockpiling first-round picks and creating cap room in the hope of landing Howard directly. Among their cache of draft picks will be a first-rounder, coming from Toronto, that is virtually guaranteed to be in the lottery in one of the next few years. Houston will be receiving that pick in exchange for point guard Kyle Lowry, in a trade that was agreed to last week.Although Howard has said he would re-sign only with the Nets, the Rockets are undaunted and are willing to gamble that he would eventually be persuaded to stay in Texas. Howard is set to become a free agent next summer. The Nets will not have the cap room to sign him.Howard could have become a free agent this summer, but he mysteriously chose in February to opt in for the 2012-13 season. By doing so, he made it nearly impossible to get to Brooklyn, his preferred destination.The Nets had enough cap room to sign both Williams and Howard outright this month, but with Howard off the market — and no assurances about acquiring him in a trade — they moved aggressively to shore up the roster, striking a deal to acquire Johnson from the Atlanta Hawks. That move helped persuade Williams, who was leaning toward signing with the Mavericks, to stay with the Nets.Williams was set to sign his contract — for five years and $98.77 million — shortly after 9 p.m. Pacific in Las Vegas, where he is training with the United States national team in preparation for the London Olympics. King traveled to Las Vegas on Tuesday to personally present the contract.“It means I’m officially a Brooklyn Net,” Williams, smiling, said earlier in the day.It would be a semi-historic moment for the Nets: the first free agent to sign with the team in the Brooklyn era.The Nets, who have been one of the most active teams this summer, also have deals in place to bring back Gerald Wallace, and to acquire Reggie Evans and Mirza Teletovic. It now looks likely that they will re-sign Lopez and forward Kris Humphries.Lopez and Humphries have been stuck in limbo, because the Nets have hoped to use their contracts as part of a multiteam trade for Howard. That can be done only if they are signed and traded simultaneously. With the moratorium now over, the pressure to simply re-sign them will increase.With or without Howard, “the roster that we have is a pretty good roster,” Williams said. “If we stick together for a couple of years, there’s no telling how high our ceiling could be.”The Knicks may have made the biggest improvement so far, making deals to add Camby and Kidd while striking deals to bring back their own free agents, J. R. Smith and Steve Novak. They are also expected to match Houston’s four-year, $28.8 million offer sheet to Jeremy Lin.“Hopefully, we’ll get the Jeremy Lin thing done,” said the Knicks’ Carmelo Anthony, who is also part of the Olympic team. He added, “I feel good about the strides we made this off-season.”Several free-agent deals were expected to be signed just after midnight Eastern or sometime on Wednesday. Trades that were agreed to during the moratorium — including the Johnson deal, the sign-and-trade sending Nash to the Lakers and the sign-and-trade deal sending Camby to the Knicks — could take longer, because the league must first review and approve them.Before the moratorium was lifted, the N.B.A. announced a salary cap of $58.04 million and a luxury-tax threshold of $70.31 million — both figures unchanged from last season.'"
"'12-07-11,'0','The troubles of Scranton, a city of 76,000, are a combination of long-term structural decline, a mayor and City Council at loggerheads and, since June, an inability to borrow. A majority on the Council turned Scranton into a financial pariah this spring by refusing to honor a guarantee that the city had placed on the revenue bonds issued by its parking authority. The municipal bond market took its refusal as a sign that the city might also default on its own bonds, and cut off credit.The only bank still willing to help Scranton raise money pulled out of a $16 million short-term financing deal, leading to a cash crunch. The Council later said it would honor the guarantee after all, but the city remains unable to borrow.Unions representing city workers won a court injunction last week ordering the mayor not to cut their pay. But the city issued the smaller checks anyway last Friday, and the union went back to court on Tuesday, asking a judge to hold the mayor and the city in contempt of court. It also challenged the city for not paying overtime and for cutting disability payments.“They are running out of laws to violate,” said the lawyer representing the unions, Thomas W. Jennings, who said the workers were caught in the middle of the battle between the mayor and the City Council. “We are literally caught in the cross hairs between the Hatfields and the McCoys.”Mr. Doherty, who did not return calls seeking comment, told The Times-Tribune of Scranton last week that the city could not afford to make its payroll. “What am I going to pay them with?” he asked.Gary Lewis, a financial consultant living in Scranton who follows the developments closely, said that last Thursday, July 5, the city had only $5,000 on hand. By Monday, he said, the total was up to $133,000 — but still nowhere near enough to pay its unpaid bills.Richard A. Ciccarone, a managing director at McDonnell Investment Management, an investment advisory firm, said Scranton’s problems were rare.“The fact that they have only $100,000 cash, that’s really next to nothing,” said Mr. Ciccarone, who tracks how much cash cities have on hand. He said that last year less than 2 percent of American cities found themselves without enough cash to cover more than 30 days of expenses; the typical city had enough to last 246 days. Scranton, he said, appeared to have only enough for a day.Mr. Judge, the president of the firefighters’ union, said that his last paycheck was about a third of what he usually gets, and that some colleagues were already worried that they would not be able to pay their bills, or that their credit would be ruined. “When you’re a firefighter or police officer, all your tension has to be focused on the job ahead — it’s an emergency situation, it’s dangerous,” he said. “And now they’ve got all this on their minds.”'"
"'12-07-11,'0','Paying forthrightly has long been a matter of civic pride for most American politicians, a demonstration of honesty and of a willingness to share in society’s burdens. Since the Watergate era, presidential candidates have released several years of tax returns, allowing voters to peer at their financial choices and discern their entanglements.has upended that tradition this year. He has released only one complete tax return, for 2010, along with an unfinished estimate of his 2011 taxes. What information he did release provides a fuzzy glimpse at a concerted effort to park much of his wealth in overseas tax shelters, suggesting a widespread pattern of tax avoidance unlike that of any previous candidate.Mr. Romney has resisted all demands for more disclosure, leading to growing criticism from Democrats that he is trying to hide his fortune and his tax schemes from the public. Given the troubling suspicions about his finances, he needs to release many more returns and quickly open his books to full scrutiny.The 2010 tax return showed that the blind trust held by his wife, , included a $3 million Swiss bank account that had not been properly reported on previous financial disclosure statements. (The account was closed by the trust manager in 2010 who feared it might become embarrassing for the campaign. He was right.) It also showed that Mr. Romney had used a complex offshore tax shelter, known as a blocker corporation, to shield the investments in his I.R.A. from paying an obscure business tax.The use of that technique by wealthy taxpayers and institutions, long been blasted by Congressional tax experts as abusive, costs the treasury $1 billion a decade.'"
"'12-07-11,'0','Commissioner Bud Selig should be lauded, to a point, for proceeding carefully with technology and wanting to preserve the traditional rhythms and pacing of the game. But Selig also seemed out of touch Tuesday when he insisted that nobody really wanted expanded replay, anyway.“We’ve added some more, we’re going to continue to do that,” Selig said. “But I can tell you very candidly, the appetite for more instant replay in the sport is very low. Everyone. There are some people who think we’ve maybe gone too far already.”It is hard to accept that, though, when viewers at home clearly see Todd Helton being awarded a putout while standing three feet off first base, or Dewayne Wise getting credit for a catch he never made.The recent missed call with the most historical impact, of course, was the one that cost Detroit pitcher Armando Galarraga a perfect game in 2010. The first-base umpire who blew that call, Jim Joyce, worked the same spot at the All-Star Game on Tuesday.For the moment, safe-or-out calls on the bases are not a priority. More realistic, Selig said, was making fair-or-foul calls reviewable for balls down the line. This was the kind of play that preserved a no-hitter in June for the Mets’ Johan Santana. Balls trapped by a fielder could also soon be reviewed.“We’re in the process of reviewing the most efficient ways to gather the camera angles we need for calls down the line,” said Rob Manfred, the executive vice president for labor relations and human resources. “Obviously with trap plays, the issues associated with that are different, placing runners and things like that. The technology issue really relates to down the line.”The issue of placing runners after an overturned call is no small matter. If an umpire called a ball foul, or ruled that a trap was actually a catch, the runners would not advance. But if those calls were overturned, there would need to be some mechanism for where the runners should go.“All those rules would have to be laid out, to try and see every kind of play that can happen, so there’s no discussion: this is what happens, this guy goes back, this guy scores,” said Paul Konerko, the Chicago White Sox first baseman. “You’ll have to know all those answers.“What if there’s a guy at second with two outs and a guy hits the ball to left-center field, and the guy dives and they call it a catch — and then they review it and it’s a trap? Does that guy just go from second to third? Everybody in the ballpark knows he’s going to score on that ball, because with two outs he’s running.“It doesn’t bother me, just as a general statement, to say, ‘More replay.’ We’re here all day. It doesn’t matter to me if the game takes another 10 minutes, cumulative or whatever it is, to get calls right. That doesn’t bother me as a concept. But it’s going to be hard to figure all that out.”True enough, but there would seem to be an easy solution: why not have an extra umpire — in the press box or centralized at, say, the MLB Network studios — with access to camera angles that could instantly determine if the call on the field is wrong?Joe Torre, who oversees umpires for Selig, said that concept was under consideration. But Torre does not seem to have much enthusiasm for it, and he sounds willing to accept more Denkinger and Joyce moments as part of baseball’s charm, no matter what the cameras say.“The game isn’t perfect,” Torre said. “For all of us that want everything to be right all the time, it’s not going to the case no matter how much replay we do. I don’t know why we want everything to be perfect, because it’s just not a perfect game, it really isn’t. Life isn’t perfect. I think this is a game of life.”'"
"'12-07-11,'0','For the most part, the countdown has gone smoothly. Jacques Rogge, the Belgian doctor who is president of the International Olympic Committee, has congratulated British Olympic officials on having all the sites ready on time and within the official government budget of about $15 billion. There has been no mad-dash construction crisis as in Athens, and none of the human rights demonstrations that occurred before the Beijing Games.But there are anxieties, including concern about the weather after the wettest spring in Britain since record-keeping began in 1910. Torrential rains, floods and gusting winds have disrupted many events in a season of celebration that many had hoped would dispel the gloom of the country’s persistent recession.Last weekend the national weather service issued what amounted to a jeremiad about the weather likely to face the 200 national squads and millions of spectators. “A protracted spell of hot, sunny weather looks very unlikely,” it said, adding that inclement weather “will probably still be in evidence” during the games though not as bad as in June and July so far.Another worry has been the capacity of Britain’s already overloaded road, rail and air networks to cope with the huge surge of traffic associated with the Games, particularly in and around London, where the sporting venues are concentrated. Olympics organizers have said privately that the risk of congestion has weighed as heavily as the threat of a terrorist attack.Concern has focused on Heathrow Airport near London, where long lines at immigration, already a common problem, have worsened in recent weeks, to the point where some passengers arriving from outside the European Union have complained of waiting as long as two and a half hours to clear passport control. The problem has persisted despite government commitments to add hundreds of immigration officers ahead of the Games, and repeated, heavily publicized “walk-through” visits to Heathrow by government ministers.In recent days, with an average wait of an hour or more for many passengers arriving on overnight flights from the United States and other distant points, the police have voiced concerns about a possible breakdown of public order in the arrival halls. Passengers in lines snaking back from the immigration area into the passageways leading from the aircraft have broken into prolonged stints of slow-hand clapping, verbal assaults on immigration officers and, in some cases, attempts to walk unchecked through unstaffed immigration control booths. As the Olympics near, the fear is that the situation could worsen substantially.At the High Court hearing on the missile deployments, Mr. Willers, the lawyer for the Fred Wigg Tower residents, said deployment of high-velocity Rapier missiles on the building’s roof, staffed by 10 soldiers and a protective guard of armed police officers, would invite an “evil statement” by terrorists in the form of an attack on the tower, and would violate a human rights law guarantee of an individual’s right to “peaceful enjoyment” of his home.But the judge, Sir Charles Haddon-Cave, dismissed the arguments summarily. The residents, he said, appeared to be laboring under “something of a misapprehension” about their rights, the relevant laws and the risks.'"
"'12-07-11,'0','Triple Five, the developer of the Mall of America, has renamed the project American Dream and drawn up plans to make it even bigger, with nearly 1.7 million square feet of retail space, an indoor ski hill, indoor sky diving, bowling, an aquarium, a live theater and the 14.7-acre amusement park.But the project continues to be dogged by delays. In announcing a tentative agreement between the current owners and Triple Five in May 2011, Gov. Chris Christie said he expected the developer to strike a deal with the owners and get financing for the project by the end of 2011 so that American Dream could be open for the 2014 Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium. But executives working with Triple Five now say that $1.75 billion in financing will not be completed until October and that the complex will not open until September 2014, seven months after the Super Bowl.Triple Five, which is owned by the Ghermezian family, has built two of the world’s largest and most successful entertainment malls. But the company faces special challenges in the Meadowlands, the least of which are the local blue laws that prohibit retail activity on Sundays.Many retailers say they are reluctant to get involved with the project because of its troubled history. “There were enough false starts that retailers want to see some substance,” said Ron DeLuca, a partner at R. J. Brunelli & Company, which represents a roster of retailers who had signed leases at Xanadu. “Until American Dream becomes a reality,” he said, “it is difficult to get retailers to make hard commitments.”The Jets and Giants, which both use MetLife Stadium, filed a lawsuit last month seeking to block construction of the project, saying it threatens to “clog the complex’s already congested transportation networks” on game days, when 80,000 fans converge on the stadium.The State Transportation Department approved the project, however, and Triple Five moved on Tuesday to dismiss the suit.The deal with DreamWorks provides the project with some Hollywood cachet and underscores Triple Five’s emphasis on entertainment.Entertainment conglomerates like DreamWorks say they view theme parks as a way to expand revenues for an industry buffeted by piracy, flagging DVD sales and a drop in network television viewers.The theme park industry is slow growing in North America, said John Robinett, senior vice president of economics for the Themed Entertainment Association, although the recent creation of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction at Universal Studios in Florida and a $1 billion makeover tied to “Cars” characters at Disney’s California Adventure park in Los Angeles have raised attendance substantially.Triple Five is hoping DreamWorks can do the same in the Meadowlands, where it says it hopes to attract 55 million visitors annually. But that may be easier in Minnesota or West Edmonton, Canada, where Triple Five already operates.“Not only does northern New Jersey not lack for shopping malls; there are a lot of destination attractions,” said David L. Malmouth, a developer in San Diego and a former Disney executive. “Manhattan is a pretty compelling theme park in its own right.”'"
"'12-07-11,'0','Randolph M. McLaughlin, a law professor at , said the new judicial attention was a product of the numbers: More than 80 percent of those stopped in New York are black or Latino, and last year there were 686,000 stops, with this year’s numbers heading higher.“People are starting to wonder: ‘What’s really going on here? Is this a racial policy?’ And judges read the newspaper too,” Professor McLaughlin said.In May, a federal judge granted class-action status to a civil suit filed on behalf of people who were frisked on the streets and released. The judge, , of Federal District Court in , condemned what she called the city’s “deeply troubling apathy towards New Yorkers’ most fundamental constitutional rights.”Separately, in recent weeks in two cases involving teenagers caught with guns, a midlevel state appeals court in Manhattan overturned weapons convictions. In those cases, too, there was a burst of judicial hostility toward police policies in minority neighborhoods.In the first case, the majority opinion in the 3-to-2 decision from a panel of the court, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, said a “gradual erosion of this basic liberty can only tatter the constitutional fabric upon which this nation was built.”The city says that the stop-and-frisk program, which dates to the 1990s, is concentrated in high-crime areas, and is not targeted at minorities. Mayor says it “saves lives” and the city has fought its critics in court. On Tuesday, the police commissioner, , would not speculate about whether court rulings might hurt the city’s efforts to curb crime. “I don’t know what the courts are going to do,” he said.Mr. Kelly has taken steps that he said could reduce the number of stop-and-frisk encounters, including better training of officers. But both he and the mayor have suggested the judicial branch was out of step with most New Yorkers’ goal of keeping crime rates low.The city has said it is pursuing appeals of all of the rulings. In an interview, , who as the city’s corporation counsel serves as its top lawyer, argued that the recent decisions were not part of any larger trend in the courts. He noted that the issue before the federal judge was merely whether the suit was appropriately a class action and that the state appeals rulings involved split courts analyzing the detailed facts of specific searches. “I don’t know that you can draw a conclusion that there’s some major change,” he said.The decision to appeal the rulings is risky, lawyers say, because it could lead to appeals court rulings clearing the way for fuller judicial criticism. If the federal appeals court in New York were to approve Judge Scheindlin’s ruling or to simply decline to hear the city’s appeal, a trial is expected as soon as this fall.David Rudovsky, the lead lawyer in a similar class-action case against Philadelphia that led to a settlement last year, said that the views that Judge Scheindlin expressed in May suggested that however the case comes to a conclusion, significant changes should be anticipated in New York’s stop-and-frisk policy.“One would expect a fairly substantial change in the number of stops,” Mr. Rudovsky said. “And you would expect fewer stops of minority young men.”Critics of New York’s policies say the results — a small percentage of the stops produced an arrest — do not warrant the intrusion on lives and the lost respect for law enforcement by a generation of young men stopped on the city streets.Darius Charney, a lawyer at the Center for Constitutional Rights, which is handling the New York class-action case, said the suit was seeking independent oversight of the . He said that even when stop-and-frisk numbers climbed sharply over the last decade, the city would not “even acknowledge it has a problem.”In the two teenagers’ gun cases, the city is appealing to the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals. That could open the way for the state’s chief judge, , who has forged numerous liberal rulings during his tenure, to help redefine complex legal precedents that set out stop-and-frisk rules.“These two cases might create the perfect opportunity for the Court of Appeals” to wade into the controversy over police tactics, said Vincent Bonventre, an expert on the court who is a professor at Law School.Some experts on police practices said the Court of Appeals might consider it time to update its stop-and-frisk rulings.Eugene J. O’Donnell, a professor at the , called one court precedent on the issue “laughably complex” in ways that can be confusing to officers who must make quick decisions in dangerous situations.“How can you be legitimately following the law, when no one can explain what the law means?” he said.In the interview, Mr. Cardozo, whose office is handling the stop-and-frisk appeals, noted that appeals courts regularly approve stop-and-frisk searches. But some lawyers said that tendency was what made the recent rulings against the city so notable.Professor Bonventre said it seemed the majority in the Manhattan appeals court rulings was announcing what amounted to a new policy: “We are going to start looking at these stop-and-frisks a lot more closely.”'"
"'12-07-11,'0','On news of that agreement, investors on Tuesday slightly reduced the pressure on Madrid’s borrowing costs. The yield, or interest rate, on Spain’s benchmark 10-year government bonds fell to 6.73 percent on the open market, from almost 7 percent on Monday. Even that slightly lower level, though, is seen as unsustainable in the medium term.Additional banking bailout payments are expected this year after Spain completes further audits of its troubled banks. In return, however, Spain’s banking overhaul will be subject to tighter European monitoring. Spain’s European partners are also demanding more evidence from Mr. Rajoy that he can clean up the nation’s public finances and enforce economic changes that would return it to growth.Mr. Rajoy’s conservative Popular Party was elected in November largely because voters punished the previous Socialist administration for its economic mismanagement.Instead of fueling confidence, however, Mr. Rajoy and his team have since broken most of the economic pledges made to voters. On Wednesday, for instance, Mr. Rajoy is expected to bow to European pressure and announce an increase in the value-added tax, a form of sales tax. As recently as April, Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, insisted that raising the tax was “absolutely” off the agenda for this year because it could choke off consumer spending.Some analysts warn of the danger of a steep fall in tax revenue in the second half of 2012, saying higher taxes will reduce private spending and create further incentives for tax evasion.“The current situation demonstrates a clear inability to collect taxes,” Santiago López Díaz, an analyst in Madrid for the brokerage house Exane, wrote in a note to clients.Budget data released last month by Madrid indicated how far off target the country was from its deficit-reduction targets. For the first five months of the year alone, the central government’s budget deficit was already at 3.41 percent of G.D.P.Even if Mr. Rajoy manages to tighten budgetary control at central government level, Spain’s fiscal discipline is also dependent on 17 regional governments that account for half of the country’s public spending.Madrid has ordered regions to cut their deficits to 1.5 percent of G.D.P. this year.But some of the regions have instead recently warned that they are close to fiscal asphyxiation, particularly in terms of meeting their debt refinancing obligations after having their credit ratings lowered to speculative, or junk, level.A reduced credit rating is a sign of increased risk and leads investors to demand a higher return for lending money to a government by buying its securities.“Obviously, if the regions don’t comply, the general government deficit can’t be on target,” said Edward Hugh, an economist in Barcelona. Among the most vulnerable regions are Andalusia and Catalonia, which are also Spain’s most populous. Mr. Hugh predicted that Madrid would have to take over budgetary control in at least one of these two regions in coming months, “which naturally will lead to even more political tensions.”The new round of austerity measures also risks setting off more social unrest in a country where almost a quarter of the work force is unemployed.While the surge in joblessness initially hit mostly construction workers and unskilled labor, “with the restructuring of the banking system and of the state, the job losses are now hitting the middle class hard, and there is despair and anger, particularly with the perception of socialism for the rich — the banks get rescued but nobody else,” warned Luis Garicano, a professor at the London School of Economics.“The successive plans of Spain and of Europe do not let people see any light at the end of the tunnel,” he said, “and the government is doing a horrendous job at communicating what is going on, why it is doing what it is doing and what comes next.”Mr. Garicano’s tunnel analogy seemed appropriate Tuesday, as columns of striking coal miners reached Madrid. The so-called black march by the miners was the culmination of a monthlong protest against plans by the government to further cut energy subsidies, particularly to a coal sector that has long relied on state aid to stay afloat.The protests have also recently led to violent clashes with security forces in Asturias, a northern region where striking miners also tried to set up roadblocks to vent their frustration.Among the miners who arrived in Madrid on Tuesday was Santiago Marzo, 47, who has worked for 25 years in the Ariño coal mine, in the eastern province of Teruel. He set out from his mine on June 22, since then covering about 400 kilometers, or 250 miles, on foot to reach Madrid.“This is a financial crisis whose consequences are being paid not by the politicians and bankers but by the most vulnerable people in our society,” Mr. Marzo said, as he inspected his feet for fresh blisters. “I don’t see any ray of light if subsidies are cut this year and my mine closes, because I live in an area that offers zero job alternatives at the moment.”'"
"'12-07-11,'0','In Germany, opponents of the two treaties that Mr. Schäuble defended on Tuesday — which passed the country’s Parliament on June 29 by a clear two-thirds majority — argue that the treaties’ terms violate the German Constitution. Opponents include a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s own center-right coalition as well as lawmakers from the opposition Left Party and other groups of disgruntled citizens.But Germany is hardly alone in facing domestic opposition to European integration measures that its leaders support.Dutch and Finnish voters also rankle at the idea that their tax contributions are being spent across wider Europe, while many in France take issue with the limits that European integration would place on how the government sets tax policy.Many analysts say that without these measures, which were drawn up in the last few months, weaker countries will remain at the mercy of financial market speculators and continue to labor under high borrowing costs as they try to revive their economies.“The fundamental problem with the euro zone is that what happens at the federal level in the United States still happens at the national level in the euro zone,” said Philip Whyte, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform in Europe.“Unless they correct that flaw, individual states are going to run into trouble, and when they run into trouble, the markets are going to question how much political appetite there is to keep that country within the euro zone,” Mr. Whyte said.It also is not the first time that efforts to save the euro have fallen into the hands of a panel of red-robed judges. In September 2011, the court in Karlsruhe ruled on challenges to the legality of earlier bailout measures. The judges upheld the legality of the measures but required Parliament to have a say in their approval.Because the German court’s full examination of the treaties under dispute on Tuesday could take months, the opponents also filed a separate emergency challenge, one aimed at preventing the German president from signing them until a final ruling is handed down.Even before the vote last month in Parliament, the judges asked President Joachim Gauck not to sign until they reached a decision on the emergency blocking measure.That decision had been expected by the end of July. But Andreas Vosskuhle, the presiding judge, indicated in his opening remarks Tuesday that the court would conduct a “very thorough summary review” of the issue, an indication that deliberations could stretch on.“In politics, unusual situations and crises often require unusual measures,” Mr. Vosskuhle said, pointing out that, though the ruling had implications beyond Germany, the judges were also required to protect the plaintiffs’ rights.The court’s action further delays the rollout of the stability mechanism’s bailout fund, which was originally envisioned to be in place July 1 or by Monday at the latest. Estonia, Ireland and Italy also have yet to ratify the measures. But given that Berlin’s contribution accounts for more than a quarter of the overall fund, the mechanism cannot come into force without German approval.The German court proceedings helped send the euro to a two-year low against the dollar on Tuesday, falling 0.6 percent, to $1.225 in afternoon trading in New York.Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany’s central bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, said at court on Tuesday that it was unclear what effect a delay in the ratification would have on financial markets.“A temporary ruling does not ensure that the risks can be comprehensively limited. Conversely, a quick ratification is no guarantee the crisis will not escalate further,” he told the court, Reuters reported.Many analysts predict that the court will uphold the measures, although some envisioned a compromise similar to one reached last year, with the court requiring approval from lawmakers in Berlin each time the fund is to be tapped.If a similar approval process is put into effect, Germany will require its partners to wait out its cumbersome legal procedures.“This would not be so ideal, as it would make Germany the bad guy, and put it in the position of being the one to decide what is ‘allowed,’ and what is not,” Christian Jasperneite, chief investment officer for the M. M. Warburg bank in Hamburg, said Tuesday.Yet that right to decide is what German voters insist is their due.Protesters gathered outside the courtroom held a symbolic funeral and sang the national hymn, standing over a headstone that reads “Here Rests in Peace the Constitution of the German Republic, born May 23, 1949, died June 29, 2012.”'"
"'12-07-11,'0','No Major League Baseball event would be official without the proper levels of absurdity, so yes, the All-Star Game can officially proceed now that the Home Run Derby devolved into a hometown uproar and Tony La Russa has poured a bucket of mud on the fun by snubbing the Mets knuckleballer R.A. Dickey as the National League starter.By the end of Monday night, Detroit's Prince Fielder had restored a little order to the proceedings by pulverizing more baseballs than anyone else and doing his best imitation of, well, Prince Fielder. That part was impressive, as Jayson Stark writes on ESPN.com, because Fielder was built for a home run derby, Joe Lemire writes on SI.com. His final blast also mercifully ended the booing of Robinson Cano of the Yankees, whose every blink drew howls from the Kansas City crowd because as the American League home run captain he had passed over the Royals' Billy Butler when selecting the team.This caps a trend by recent All-Star fans to turn what is normally a controversy-free spectacle into a reason to vent their collective spleen. The Royals fans took it too far in the opinion of Foxsports.com's Jon Paul Morosi, but as Anthony Witrado writes in The Sporting News, baseball gets some blame too because it could just mandate a home team player must be in the derby and be done with the spleen-emptying. Cano handled it as well as anyone could, well, aside from that hitting-no-homers part, which made the boo-birds happy.It was then time to move on to dismay over La Russa's choice of San Francisco's Matt Cain over Dickey as starting pitcher, which John Harper of The Daily News believes is La Russa's latest example of overthinking. Ken Davidoff of The New York Post hopes Dickey uses the snub as motivation.Monday's other news was similarly ephemeral in nature, full of things that have not really happened. The N.B.A. was transfixed with a supposedly proposed trade that will involve at least 10 players and send Dwight Howard to the Nets. Howard's current team, the Magic, holds the key to this one, and Chris Tomasson argues on Foxsports.com that the team does not gain anything by rushing into this. The team with the most to gain is the Nets because even if Howard brings his migraine-producing side to Brooklyn, a player of his caliber wanting to come to the Nets qualifies as a whole new era, as Howard Beck writes in The New York Times.'"
"'12-07-11,'0','PARIS — The International Criminal Court in The Hague sentenced a Congolese warlord to 14 years in prison on Tuesday for using child soldiers in his rebel army in 2002 and 2003. The sentence was the first imposed by the court in its history.Thomas Lubanga, a psychologist turned militia leader, was found guilty in March of “widespread” use of girls and boys under the age of 15, who were often abducted by his group, trained and then used to terrorize and kill villagers in the Ituri region of the Democratic Republic of Congo.The presiding judge, Adrian Fulford, said that the sentence reflected “undoubtedly very serious crimes” that violated the protections that must be afforded to children. But the sentence was far short of the 30 years the prosecution had sought.Mr. Lubanga, 51, who once led the Union of Congolese Patriots and asked every family in his region to contribute a cow, money or a child to his militia, will receive credit for the six years he has already spent in custody in The Hague. If he ends up in a European prison, his sentence could be further reduced if he is released on good behavior after serving two-thirds of his sentence, a common practice on the Continent.Judge Fulford made a point of praising Mr. Lubanga for his conduct and cooperation in court.The sentence, after a halting three-year trial, drew renewed attention to another suspect wanted by the court: Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord’s Resistance Army, which for years abducted children and turned them into soldiers as it rampaged through at least four Central African countries.'"
"'12-07-11,'0','The verdict also led to some soul-searching about the public and political pressure that led Mr. Olmert to resign in the autumn of 2008, almost a year before he was indicted.But a swift political comeback for Mr. Olmert, the first Israeli premier to be convicted of a criminal offense, seems unlikely. He is still embroiled in another serious corruption case, in which he is charged with taking bribes in connection with the construction of a huge residential complex while he was the mayor of Jerusalem.Mr. Olmert’s three-year tenure as prime minister was marked by high-wire peace talks and military actions and dogged by police investigations. Intensive talks with the were interrupted by a devastating three-week Israeli offensive in in the winter of 2008-9, and the elections that followed Mr. Olmert’s resignation brought of the conservative Likud Party to power. The peace process has largely been stalled since then.Mr. Olmert has acknowledged making mistakes in the years before he became prime minister, but he has always denied criminal wrongdoing. His lawyers maintained that he would prove his innocence in court.Quoting Menachem Begin, a predecessor as prime minister, Mr. Olmert declared on Tuesday, “There are judges in Jerusalem.”Mr. Begin, a stickler for the law, uttered those words in the late 1970s in a very different context, after Israel’s Supreme Court accepted the state’s position allowing the expropriation of land for a Jewish settlement in the . For Israelis, the phrase has come to symbolize the principle that the law and the judicial system should always stand above the government.Mr. Olmert came of age politically in Mr. Begin’s Likud Party, but by the time Mr. Olmert became prime minister, he was the leader of Kadima, a centrist party established in 2005.Mr. Olmert was visibly relieved at the verdict. Acknowledging that he had become a bit emotional, he said that he respected the court’s decision on the breach-of-trust charge and that he would “learn the necessary lessons.” Still, he insisted that the matter, known as the Investment Center affair, amounted to procedural irregularity rather than corruption. In that affair, which took place when he was minister of trade and industry, Mr. Olmert was charged with making decisions that benefited clients of a close associate.Mr. Olmert has kept a relatively low profile since he left office, but on Tuesday he promised that Israelis would be hearing much more from him.Eli Zohar, the lawyer who led Mr. Olmert’s defense team, said the verdict made Tuesday “a great day, first of all, for Israeli justice.”The panel of three judges ruled unanimously that the evidence did not prove beyond doubt that Mr. Olmert had acted with criminal intent in the most sensational of the three matters at trial, which involved , an American businessman whose testimony was instrumental in Mr. Olmert’s downfall. Israelis were stunned in May 2008 when Mr. Talansky told a court here that he had given about $150,000 to Mr. Olmert over 13 years, mostly in cash stuffed into envelopes, a claim Mr. Olmert denied.Mr. Talansky said at the time that much of the money was earmarked for election campaigns but that some was for Mr. Olmert’s personal expenses. It included at least $25,000 meant for a vacation in and almost $5,000 to cover Mr. Olmert’s bill at a hotel because Mr. Olmert’s own credit card was “maxed out,” Mr. Talansky testified. He added that some of the money was intended as a but was never repaid.According to the prosecution, the money was provided between 1992, when Mr. Olmert first ran for mayor of Jerusalem, and late 2005, when Mr. Olmert was minister of industry and trade. He became prime minister in early 2006.In their decision, which runs to 743 pages, the judges said that Mr. Talansky was a problematic witness whose testimony proved correct in part while also containing statements that were “incorrect and even false.” It continued, “Parts were mistaken, confused, and sometimes motivated by fears, interests, and trying to be too wise.”Mr. Olmert declared outside the court that “there were no envelopes of money, and there are no envelopes of money.” He added, “It never happened.”The second matter in which Mr. Olmert was cleared involved accusations that, while mayor of Jerusalem and later while in the cabinet, he billed multiple state and charitable agencies for the same travel expenses and used the extra money for private family trips.'"

"'12-07-12,'0','Like its smirking antihero and chief narrator, the serial con artist Frédéric Bourdin, “The Imposter” is slippery, manipulative, unstable and smoothly confounding. It’s also one of the most entertaining documentaries to appear since “Exit Through the Gift Shop,” a film similarly obsessed with role playing and deception.Cleverly deflecting our dislike of Mr. Bourdin’s smug narcissism and brazen amorality, the British director Bart Layton presents this bizarre true-crime narrative from multiple viewpoints. The resulting collage of interviews, re-enactments and home-video footage proves the perfect medium for the twisty story of Nicholas Barclay, a Texas teenager who disappeared in 1994.When, three years and some months later, a carefully camouflaged Mr. Bourdin surfaced in Spain, claiming to be the missing boy and armed with horrific details of torture and abuse, no one should have believed him. How could a 23-year-old, raven-haired French-Algerian pass himself off as a 16-year-old blond, blue-eyed American?That question bleats insistently throughout this mind-boggling relay of official incompetence, familial self-deception and ingenious duplicity. But Mr. Layton is less concerned with trapping the truth than in laying out its many disguises: invariably cocooned in a selection of hoodies, hats and scarves, Mr. Bourdin (and his stand-in for re-enactments, Adam O’Brian) slinks through the film like a mutating virus. Everyone is contaminated, from Child Protective Services and the United States Embassy in Madrid to the American news media and the F.B.I. And, not least, Nicholas’s traumatized family.“I washed her brain,” Mr. Bourdin boasts of his initial meeting with Nicholas’s older sister, Carey Gibson, whose face in interviews bears the look of a woman who expected a puppy for Christmas and unwrapped a viper.The rest of Nicholas’s family appears equally sideswiped, leaving us to wonder how long the ruse would have continued had not an unlikely hero hustled forward in the folksy form of Charlie Parker, a private investigator and inveterate clue sniffer. Round of belly and suspicious of mind, Mr. Parker pounces on the story, wrestles it to the ground and makes off with it to a destination that calls into question almost everything we have just seen.Unrepentant to the end, Mr. Bourdin presides over this tragedy with repulsive self-regard. But his director, working with the editor Andrew Hulme, refuses to cede control of the film’s tone. Using unexpected flares of humor — when a telephone rings in a police station, it’s answered by a delightful montage of famous small-screen detectives — and defiantly jaunty rhythms, Mr. Layton lightens the mood without making light of the crime. His subject does that all by himself.'"

"'12-07-12,'0','The clinic, the Jackson Women’s Health Organization, has responded that such complications are extremely rare and says that in any case it already has a standing transfer agreement with a local hospital as well as a physician on staff who has admitting privileges, though this doctor does not perform abortions.The clinic also argues that Gov. Phil Bryant, a Republican, and the law’s chief legislative backers have barely concealed the real motive behind the law: to stop all abortions in the state.“Whatever urgent interest the state asserts, the issue is: can women have access to abortions, which they are constitutionally allowed to do? And the answer is no,” Michelle Movahed, a lawyer at the Center for Reproductive Rights, which is representing the clinic, said in court.The discussion was less about the larger constitutional issues of the law and more about whether the clinic, which for now remains in operation, was under immediate threat.In the weeks leading up to July 1, State Representative Sam Mims, the law’s sponsor, publicly urged state health officials to force the clinic immediately to stop performing abortions if it was found to be out of compliance. Days later, health officials notified the clinic that it needed to prove that it had met its new obligations on or before July 1.But in court on Wednesday, lawyers from the Mississippi Attorney General’s Office said the statutory process of enforcing a new law was actually a long one that could take several months, including a “reasonable time” for the clinic to come into compliance as well as time for hearings and appeals.The prospect of the clinic’s closing, they said, is still uncertain and, in any case, a long way off. And in the ensuing months the physicians at the clinic, who have applied to seven local hospitals and are awaiting responses, may achieve compliance anyway.“The actual constitutional right — as opposed to mere inconvenience to the plaintiffs — will be unaffected for at least 60 days under the new law, likely much longer, and, indeed, will only be impacted if plaintiffs ultimately fail to obtain hospital admitting privileges,” read one of the state’s briefs.But lawyers for the clinic argued that if physicians simply waited for the administrative process to play out, they could not continue to perform abortions without being in “knowing violation” of the law. Without a hold on the new law, the lawyers said, the physicians and other employees at the clinic would be committing state crimes by performing abortions during the next few weeks or months, and could face prosecution or revocation of their medical licenses.At one point in the hearing, a lawyer for the state told the judge that the state board of health had approved new rules in accordance with the law that very morning.While the new rules essentially just bring health department rules into uniformity with the new law, the judge decided to examine them before making a decision. And with that, both sides were left simply to wait.'"

"'12-07-12,'0','Elected officials will be barred from speaking at this year’s ceremony to commemorate the anniversary of the attacks on the World Trade Center, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum announced on Wednesday.The change comes amid reports of tension between the office of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, the memorial’s chairman, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which is run by those states’ governors, over control of the ceremony and other developments at the World Trade Center site.The details of the annual ceremony are often the subject of heated debate among lawmakers and families of victims of the attacks. As in past years, family members will read aloud the names of the victims, a tradition that Mr. Bloomberg had once publicly considered ending.Politicians, who have typically recited poems, quotations and literary passages at the annual event, can attend but must stay silent. The memorial “is focused on honoring the victims and their families in a way free of politics, and this ensures that continues,” said Joseph C. Daniels, the president of the memorial and museum, in a statement.Last year, on the 10th anniversary of the attacks, President Obama, former President George W. Bush, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mr. Bloomberg were among several politicians who participated in the ceremony. None gave a speech, but each read from literary sources, including the Book of Psalms and a Civil War-era letter from Abraham Lincoln.But even that arrangement created some controversy, as rumors flew in the state’s political circles about a feud between Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Cuomo over which selection the governor had been asked to read. (Publicly, aides to both men denied any problems.)A spokeswoman for Mr. Bloomberg declined to comment on Wednesday about the reasons behind the decision.'"
"'12-07-12,'0','Through elision and allusion, Giverny has been packed into a tight suitcase. The famous pink stucco house with green shutters is evoked through a reconstructed facade by the Broadway set designer Scott Pask, a kind of prologue to the installation’s three dramatic episodes.The large courtyard pool at the rear of the conservatory is thickly populated with even more of the floating pastel waterlilies that Monet adored. Inside the conservatory, Mr. Pask has transposed the green footbridge at Giverny into a cool Japanese garden, surrounding a pool with ferns and grasses and border flowers in the shade of two spiky-leaved Japanese maples.The interpretive centerpiece of the show is a downsized version of the Grande Allée at Giverny, a long flower-lined path extending from Monet’s front door through the three acres of the Clos Normand. At the Botanical Garden, it has been recreated indoors, under glass.The view along the length of the conservatory’s walkway is a stunning optical trick. Green arches curve overhead, just as in the Grande Allée, although without the climbing roses. On either side of the path, on narrow seven-foot strips, low-growing nasturtiums, bushy hydrangeas, lilac-colored salvias and sky-blue delphiniums form tousled groupings, with flowers skillfully deployed according to scale and texture.Francisca Coelho, the show’s curator, has never been to Giverny. Working from photographs, she imposed her scheme with a free hand, which seems appropriate. For Monet, keen to acquire the latest hybrids and import plants from all over the world, gardening was an ongoing experiment with color and light.There were no rules, just a cascading series of enthusiasms disciplined by a masterly sense of color and structure. As she strolled through the installation, Ms. Coelho dropped a few hints about her guiding ideas.“Monet loved massing for instant impact,” she said. The conservatory’s walkway also expresses Monet’s strong preference for the artful disarray of the English-style garden. (He was a keen reader of Gertrude Jekyll’s columns in “Country Life.”)It is well known that Monet loved certain effects, like low underplanting with taller flowers thrusting overhead; translucent petals to transmit the diffuse light of the Seine Valley; bold color combinations with strong contrasts; and the stippling effect known to the Impressionists as “shimmer,” which he created in the garden by scattering white flowers.In a gardener’s version of a preliminary sketch, he played with new plants and new colors in raised “paint-box beds” that Ms. Coelho has reproduced in 10 wooden boxes along one side of the waterlily pool.“I am going to use things that will make people ask a lot of questions, like ‘Did Monet grow that?’ ” she said. “And I’ll say, ‘No, but if he were alive today he would have wanted to.’ ”THE show is intended to be inspirational, so I posed a challenge to Ms. Coelho. How would she create an even smaller version of Giverny — say, on a bed four feet square? I had one in mind, in my backyard.Pen at the ready, I prepared to jot down a long list of flowers and take detailed notes on planting schemes, with lots of arrows pointing every which way. Ms. Coelho looked me dead in the eye and offered three words of instruction: “Just be Monet.”That stopped me cold. But eventually the light dawned. Giverny is a dreamspace, not a paint-by-numbers project. It breathes the air of artistic freedom.For general guidance, amateurs can consult the Giverny plant inventory at giverny.org, or study the photographs in Elizabeth Murray’s book “Monet’s Passion: Ideas, Inspiration and Insights From the Painter’s Garden.” Ms. Murray, an artist and gardener, helped restore Giverny, and her photographs form part of the show at the Botanical Garden.The quest for authenticity has its limits, though. Many of the plants that Monet worked with are no longer available. His descendants introduced new ones. And Monet, a constant reviser, never saw Giverny as a completed work. Everything was in play, always.So. Just be Monet.My wife, Nancy, a keen gardener, joined me in a foraging expedition to the Home Depot in Woodside, Queens. Our mission was to prove that even weekend gardeners could establish a small corner of Giverny in unlikely surroundings, with readily available plants, using a few of Monet’s general principles.We settled on a hot, late-summer palette nicely analyzed in Derek Fell’s “The Magic of Monet’s Garden,” which picks apart Giverny to reveal its underlying structure and color schemes. Then we roamed the aisles of the garden section at the Home Depot, looking for fiery reds and blazing yellows and oranges, along with white blooms to impart the famed Impressionist shimmer.There were disappointments. We failed to find sunflowers, the emblem of summer for Monet (although they appeared mysteriously on the shelves a week later). Ditto the shaggy, yellow-orange dwarf sunflower known as Teddy Bear, which Ms. Coelho deployed all along the walk at the Botanical Garden.On the other hand, we got the last of the lantanas, which are the size of button marigolds but have tightly clustered multicolored petals, yellow and orange in this case.And hidden away in a remote corner of the lot, what should leap out at us, swaying on spindly stalks, but the threadleaf coreopsis called Route 66, a plant with small yellow daisy-like flowers that become maroon toward the center.Two hours later, we jammed about $450 worth of mature plants into a Honda Civic, with not a square inch to spare. Nancy carried two midsize potted plants on her lap. A rose standard, the planned centerpiece of the mini-garden, stuck out through the sunroof like a pet llama being taken for an outing.After digging up hairy vetch, a cover crop, and working in some compost, we had our four-foot-square canvas. At that point, we got to work organizing a preliminary sketch, moving pots back and forth around the center rose.The colors were much more extroverted than the pastels commonly associated with Impressionist paintings, or the light springtime palette still in evidence at the Botanical Garden.We chose bright-yellow African marigolds and strawflowers, hot-red geraniums, coneflowers the color of tomato soup and golden-orange tiger-eye rudbeckia. Route 66, waving gracefully on its stalks, gave a see-through effect, and the lantana delivered a zap of hot color, cooled down by white angelonia Angelface.Holding sway at the center of the bed was the rose standard, the Knock Out variety Sunny, with small creamy yellow blooms.The trick was to orchestrate the various colors, heights and textures, while allowing the rose to sound the main theme. Easy to say. In some ways, organizing a garden is like fixing a wobbly table. Shorten one leg, and the wobble simply changes location. Gradually, the table descends to floor level.And so it was with our miniature Giverny. A striking effect in Sector 8 created a hole in Sector 3, or clashed with Sector 6. Being Monet was hard work.After we had spent four hours shifting and adjusting in the sizzling heat, the plot looked as if it had finally come together. At any rate, I judged it tremendously appealing.Nancy scowled. “This looks like a flower display outside a grocery store,” she said, then turned on her heel and stomped off. End of Day 1.But sometime during the night, the muse descended. Nancy had a new plan. Bring more air into the massed plants, de-emphasize the pyramid shape, yet impart a stronger sense of structure. And get more spillover along the borders (Monet loved wandering plants, especially nasturtiums.)After more revising and shifting, the new plot took shape. It passed scrutiny, and planting began.Under normal circumstances, we would have grown plants from seed (much cheaper), then spaced them out when it came time to plant, letting the bed fill in on its own. To create an instant Monet, we had to splurge on mature plants and pack them together mercilessly.All things considered, though, the result was not bad: a blast of summer color surrounding an understated rose. Monet, I am certain, would have taken one look and started making changes. We will, too.The Botanical Garden has a few tricks up its sleeve as well. The plants are all in pots. Nearly every morning, crews revise the planting scheme, pulling out flowers that are starting to fade and replacing them with new recruits, in an unceasing process of revision that lets the seasons impose their own taste.And so, for a few months at least, Giverny broadcasts its unforgettable images of beauty and harmony all the way to the Bronx. And if you look out my back window, you can catch a fleeting glimpse of it in an unexpected corner of Queens.MONET was adventurous, a rule-breaker in his art and in his gardening. He was constantly on the hunt for the latest hybrid and the newest import. At the same time, the garden at Giverny illustrates a number of core principles and reflects his penchant for certain color combinations and arrangements. It does not have a code, but it does have a style. Here are a few things to keep in mind when planting your own miniature Giverny.• Create a sense of profusion and drama by massing flowers, grasses and foliage.• Avoid variegated foliage, but use lots of bicolor flowers.• Make abundant use of roses. Climbing roses can be trained over arches to add drama to paths. Rose standards can be placed singly, surrounded by flowers in contrasting colors.• Create contrast by grouping complementary colors together (violet and yellow, or red and green, for example).• Weave smaller-bloomed, airy white flowers into spring palettes of blue, purple and pink or summer palettes of red, orange and yellow to create a shimmering effect.• Use lots of low-growing trailing plants, like nasturtiums, along borders.• Remember that green is a color, too. Take advantage of the gradations of green in foliage.• Plant hot colors where they can catch the evening sun.• Put different sizes and textures of blooms close together, and put flowers with translucent petals in spots where the sunlight will shine through.• Plant local wildflowers along borders for a more natural look.• Use soft colors like blue, purple and violet near water.• Create a lace-curtain effect by intertwining vines with different-colored flowers on trellises and fences.'"
"'12-07-12,'0','LOS ANGELES — San Bernardino will become the third California city to file for bankruptcy this year, after officials conceded the city might not even be able to cover payroll through the summer.Faced with a budget shortfall of $45 million and city coffers that have already been drained, the San Bernardino City Council voted on Tuesday to file for bankruptcy. Andrea Travis-Miller, the interim city manager, told Council members before the vote that the city had very few options left.“I am concerned about our ability to make payroll, not only in the next 30 days but also in the next 60 to 90 days,” Ms. Travis-Miller said. “A major restructuring of this organization is needed.”Ms. Travis-Miller said it would take 30 days before city staff would be prepared to file the paperwork in bankruptcy court.Under a California law passed  this year, cities must hire a third-party mediator to negotiate with employee unions and creditors before filing for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections. However, cities can avoid this mediation process if they instead declare a fiscal emergency, which Mayor Patrick Morris said that San Bernardino planned to do.'"
"'12-07-12,'0','Mutations that cause Alzheimer’s lead to excessive amounts of beta amyloid in the brain; by contrast, the protective mutation slows beta amyloid production, so people make much less.“This paper provides strong evidence that it would work in the general population if you did it right,” Dr. Altshuler said.Scientists at the drug companies agreed. “We are thrilled,” said Ryan Watts, one of the authors of the new paper and head of the neurodegeneration labs at Genentech, which is developing two drugs to reduce brain amyloid levels.Dr. Richard Mohs, leader of neuroscience early clinical development at Eli Lilly, said the company was “very encouraged by these study results.” They show, he said, that despite an initial failure, the strategy of focusing on drugs to reduce beta amyloid levels is “a logical path for the development of effective therapies that may slow disease progression.”Many questions remain, of course. Most people do not have the protective gene mutation, but as common as Alzheimer’s is, most people do not get it. It is not clear why. And most who develop Alzheimer’s do not have one of the rare gene mutations that cause it. The reasons for their disease are unclear.The discovery of the protective gene mutation, a product of the revolution that has taken place in genetics, arose when researchers scanned the entire DNA of 1,795 Icelanders.About 1 in 100 had a mutation in the gene for a large protein that is sliced to form beta amyloid. Then the investigators studied people who had been given an Alzheimer’s diagnosis, and a group of people 85 and older. Those with the mutation appeared to be protected from Alzheimer’s disease.The investigators, led by Dr. Kari Stefansson, chief executive at DeCode Genetics, an Icelandic company, looked at genomes of North Americans and found the gene mutation in only about 1 in 10,000 people. That indicates, Dr. Stefansson said, that the mutation arose relatively recently in Scandinavia.The protective gene even appears to override a very strong risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease in old age — two copies of a gene known as ApoE4. Ninety percent of people with two ApoE4 genes get Alzheimer’s by age 80. But Dr. Stefansson says there are 25 people in his study with two copies of ApoE4. None have Alzheimer’s disease.The research “is obviously right,” said John Hardy, an Alzheimer’s researcher at University College London and a discoverer of the first gene mutation found to cause the disease. “The statistics and the finding are pretty secure.”The discovery is part of a continuing story that implicates beta amyloid as a central and crucial player in this destructive brain disease. The idea began two decades ago with the discovery of very rare gene mutations that always cause Alzheimer’s in those who inherit them, usually by middle age. The mutations were different in different families, but all had the same effect: They increased the amount of beta amyloid in the brain. That meant that a buildup of amyloid was sufficient to cause the disease.Elderly people with Alzheimer’s — who typically do not have these gene mutations — also had excess amyloid in the brain. So researchers reasoned that might mean that excess amyloid was causing the disease in them, too.Additional evidence of the role of beta amyloid was reported on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. Using spinal taps and brain scans to track the protein, investigators found that people with one of the Alzheimer’s-causing mutations start making too much beta amyloid as long as 20 years before they have symptoms of the disease.Researchers and drug companies focused on the amyloid hypothesis to the extent that almost every experimental drug being tested to slow or halt Alzheimer’s disease is designed to reduce the amount of amyloid in the brain. Most of those drugs are still being tested in clinical trials, but a Lilly drug that failed spectacularly in 2010, semagacestat, actually made people with Alzheimer’s worse and gave rise to soul-searching in the field.It emphasized a crucial question that hung over the endeavor. Was amyloid really causing Alzheimer’s in elderly people? Might the protein instead be a bystander, accumulating, for example, as part of the brain’s response to damage?The discovery of the protective gene mutation provides strong clues. People with the mutation make substantially less beta amyloid, but other than that they are no different from anyone else. And they do not get Alzheimer’s.People could be tested to see if they have the protective mutation, Dr. Stefansson said, but he added, “The benefits of doing so are not obvious to me.” He explained that since the gene is so rare, chances that a person being tested would have it — especially if that person is not Scandinavian — are extremely low. Almost everyone would end up with the same uncertainty they have now. There is as yet no way to prevent Alzheimer’s and, outside of families with one of the rare disease-causing gene mutations, no way to know who is going to get it.Still, Dr. Hardy noted, as provocative as the discovery of the protective gene mutation is, the strategy of reducing amyloid levels — the ultimate test of the amyloid hypothesis — still must be evaluated in typical Alzheimer’s disease. For example, perhaps people need to have lower levels of beta amyloid from birth to really be protected.Researchers and companies explain away the failure of the first few experimental drugs to reduce beta amyloid levels or to block the protein by saying they were not powerful enough and were studied in people who already had the disease and clear symptoms of mental decline. By then it might be too late to make any difference. When brain cells have died, nothing can bring them back.The strategy now is to use new brain scans and other methods to find and treat people before they have symptoms of mental decline.“The idea is that treatment has to start early to make a difference,” Dr. Watts said.Of course, people with the newly discovered mutation have lower levels of beta amyloid for their entire lives.'"
"'12-07-12,'0','The new look was hip-casual. Hardwood floors, plenty of barn board, funky metal chairs at nine tables, stools at a counter and a communal table. The executive chef, Tricia Brown, off a stint at New York’s Gramercy Tavern, created a menu featuring baguette sandwiches, soups and salads, and a signature-item-in-the-making: Big Bottom biscuits (regular, Cheddar and thyme, ham and cheese, even a “sea biscuit” with house-smoked salmon and capers and pickled red onions). The biscuit recipe belonged to Ms. Luedtke’s mother, who, as one of 20 employees, helped with the baking.Sales rose like the biscuit dough in the peak summer weeks and then tapered off in September. Still, the business remained profitable, and with the biscuits getting good buzz, the fledgling owners pondered a spinoff venture, considering wholesaling batches of frozen biscuits beyond the ones they sold from their own freezer cases. Then, in October and November, the bottom fell out for Big Bottom. “At the rate you guys are going,” their accountant warned, “You’re going to have to close your doors.”Yes, the owners had expected a downturn. “We thought maybe we’d lose about 30 to 40 percent of our business,” Mr. Volpatt said. But not 80 percent. “This is my first time at the rodeo, and I’ll tell you, we were freaking out.”THE OPTIONS The owners immediately sought to stem the hemorrhaging expenses. They closed the market on Mondays and Tuesdays and trimmed staff. Then they gathered everyone for a crisis retreat and came up with the following ideas to save the faltering start-up.¶ Revamp the wine inventory. Start by marking down the highest-priced wines to move them and help cash flow. Then restock with wines in the $12 to $15 range. While fine for the vacation crowd, average prices of $30 to $40 per bottle shot well past the budgets of local residents.¶ Market directly to Guerneville residents. Create a new sandwich each month for a prominent local resident and consider such promotions as a Thursday Community Day when everything in the store — food, candles, crafts — would be 15 percent off.¶ Open for dinner. Put a toe in the water with a $20 three-course meal on Wednesday nights.¶ Add a catering component. Prepare party food for pickup and also for events held in the market for an added fee.¶ Hit the road with a Big Bottom Market food truck. Increase sales and build the brand by turning the market’s popular biscuits into a movable feast.¶ Tilt the business more toward biscuits. Market the proprietary recipe as “the next cupcake” and sell frozen, ready-to-bake biscuit dough wholesale into a leading gourmet market like San Francisco’s Bi-Rite. Then expand from there, regionally or even nationallyWHAT OTHERS SAY Ari Weinzweig, founding partner of Zingerman’s Community of Businesses in Ann Arbor, Mich.: “Since no one knows exactly what will work, trying a lot of complementary things makes sense. We often look to specials — high-demand items at a good price point that will help bring people in at off-hours. Additionally I would — and they may well have already done this — look at what else related to food and drink is not currently offered in town that could be added: product categories, services, etc. I’d also consider things that don’t generate income directly but that bring people to their business and get them to think about the store. Often they’re less than obvious: farm share pickup, classes on how to cater a party, hosting a food-writing group at an off-hour, local fund-raisers, classes for kids. Each small event or activity might only bring a few people but over time it adds up.”Dave Hirschkop, owner of Dave’s Gourmet, a specialty food and hot sauce company in San Francisco: “Big Bottom Market’s situation is fairly typical for tourist-oriented areas. I would take a three-prong approach. Make sure that expenses are structured to match the seasonal income pattern — talk to the landlord about a modified rent structure and make sure not to overstaff during the off-season. Really focus on the local population for the off-season and adjust your offerings, pricing and promotions to appeal to them. Look for additional revenue options for the off-season — wholesaling food items, having cooking classes, selling specialty foods online.”Sam Mogannam, owner of Bi-Rite Market in San Francisco, a community-oriented grocery store that stocks Big Bottom’s frozen biscuits: “Focus on delivering a product that the locals want and need, make sure it’s priced right, and give it to them with the most genuine service you can. If the locals don’t embrace and support it, the business will always struggle to survive. It will be difficult to maintain cash flow and to retain great staff so that the business can have the foundation and stamina it needs to thrive. The tourist months should be the gravy — what make the business profitable and worth all the effort of being in the food business.”THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on Big Bottom’s choices on the You’re the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and in this space, we will give an update on how the market is preparing for the coming off-season.'"
"'12-07-12,'0','Yet finding the right balance has not been easy. City officials have watched in frustration as homicides have continued to climb. As of late Tuesday, 189 people had been killed in the city this year, compared with 169 at the same time in 2011.In most cases, Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey said, both the victims and the perpetrators have been black or Hispanic men.“I think we have to face some realities,” said Commissioner Ramsey, who is black. “We certainly do not want to be stopping people without the reasonable suspicion that we need to conduct a stop. But just because someone is complaining and they want to play the race card doesn’t mean it’s an inappropriate stop.”The total number of stops, he said, is not the issue. “The question is: Are you stopping the right people for the right reason?”Philadelphia, like New York, increased the use of the stop-and-frisk tactic, arguing that it would help remove guns from the streets and serve as a deterrent. In his 2007 mayoral campaign, Mr. Nutter promised to use the strategy to help combat a “crime emergency” in some neighborhoods. That year, police officers made 136,711 pedestrian stops. Two years after Mr. Nutter was elected, in 2009, the number nearly doubled to 253,276 — higher proportionally, in a city of 1.5 million, than the 685,724 stops made by police officers in New York last year.Commissioner Ramsey said many factors could be driving the increase in homicides, including reductions in police department staffing and the fact that “we have an enormous problem with guns in Philadelphia”; the penalties for possession of an illegal firearm in New York are far tougher than in , he noted.But he also said that after Philadelphia increased the use of the stop-and-frisk tactic a few years ago, gun violence decreased. There was a 22 percent reduction in homicides from 2007, a year before the policy began, to 2009, “and our shootings went down.” he said.Mr. Messing, the civil rights lawyer, said the problem was that as the number of stops escalated, the number of complaints he received grew even faster. “We were seeing huge numbers of stops being made without legal cause,” he said, adding that very few arrests were made and that guns were seized in about only 1 in 1,000 stops.Mahari Bailey, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, said that when he returned to Philadelphia after graduating from ’s law school, he was repeatedly stopped by officers who often behaved aggressively.“It just became too much,” Mr. Bailey said.In one instance, Mr. Bailey said, he was standing with friends outside a house in West Philadelphia when an unmarked car screeched up and two men in plain clothes jumped out, guns drawn, and told them to put up their hands.“We thought we were being robbed,” he said.Two other cars arrived. Mr. Bailey was handcuffed and placed spread-eagle against a police car. When Mr. Bailey said he was a lawyer and asked why he had been stopped, he got no answer, he said. But the officers threatened to call his employer “and say I was hanging with drug dealers.”In North Philadelphia, one of the poorest areas of the city, distrust of the police runs high. Police stops are frequent. In one neighborhood, Police District 25, where 32 of the city’s 324 homicides took place in 2011, 9,181 pedestrian stops were recorded in the first half of last year. The number of stops dropped to 5,842 in the second half of the year.Anthony Glenn, 32, said he had been stopped six times on Susquehanna Avenue in North Philadelphia over the last few months as he walked home at night from his job at a .“They ask you questions, ask you where you’re going and what you’re doing,” he said. Sometimes the officers are polite, Mr. Glenn said, but others tell him to “shut up and be quiet.” He has recently taken to getting rides from co-workers.Shelly Chappelle, 46, who sat rocking her 2-month-old granddaughter at a playground on North 15th Street while young men played league basketball on the neighboring court, said of the police, “Honestly, we don’t like them at all.” Instead of stopping people on the street, she said, “they should be doing something more constructive, like going to catch the murderers.”Fernando Montero, an at the and a plaintiff in the lawsuit who said he had been stopped nine times while conducting research in North Philadelphia, said some residents he had interviewed expressed more fear of being stopped by the police than of any violence they might encounter on the streets.The stop-and-frisk tactic, he said, “actually makes the interactions with the police more hostile and more full of suspicion.”But not everyone in North Philadelphia thinks the policy is misguided. Ange Johnson, 63, who was visiting her parents at the house where she grew up, said aggressive policing had made the neighborhood safer.“Their presence is very important,” she said of the police, adding that in the encounters she had seen, the officers had been friendly.Commissioner Ramsey acknowledged that the way some officers behaved during stops was a bigger problem than the stops themselves.“I would say if there is a real, valid issue in this debate, that’s it,” he said, adding that he was aware of the distrust pervasive in some neighborhoods.After a homicide a few weeks ago, Commissioner Ramsey said, the police were unable to elicit any information from residents in the neighborhood.“We’ve got the yellow tape and so forth, pools of blood, and directly across the street a bunch of kids are playing on the front porch,” he said. “Everybody’s acting like nothing happened.”His goal, he said, is to change that dynamic, “but we can’t do it if we’re being perceived as harassing the community.”To try to address the issue, the police department has developed new procedures for handling first-time complaints about verbal abuse, hoping to turn what has traditionally been an adversarial proceeding into a teaching opportunity. But Commissioner Ramsey fiercely defends the continued use of the stop-and-frisk tactic as essential.“The sense that I get from some is that they want to get rid of this tool completely,” he said, “and that would be a huge mistake.”'"

Few believe that he will do so; his predecessor, Yousaf Raza Gilani, refused an identical order that resulted in his dismissal from office by the court last month.Should Mr. Ashraf also be dismissed by the court, it would push the country into renewed political turbulence that could set off early elections. The Zardari-led government’s five-year term ends next March, and elections could take place as late as June — something most analysts now feel is unlikely.The confrontation between government and judiciary has consumed Pakistan’s political system over the past seven months, at a time when the country faces pressing challenges including severe energy shortages and a renewed wave of militant attacks.Hours before Thursday’s court hearings, at least nine trainee prison guards were killed in the eastern city of Lahore.

The family had previously said it planned to donate the brain, but it was unclear where it would be studied.The “release of materials for study was done at the request of the next of kin,” said Sarah Gordon, a spokeswoman for the medical examiner.The institute said it would conduct research and analysis on traumatic brain injury.

"'12-07-13,'1','The entertainment industry lobbied Congress hard for the Stop Online Piracy Act, or SOPA, which was withdrawn this year after an online uproar led by Web companies and their consumers. Another bill on Capitol Hill would establish intellectual property attachés in American embassies. An international antipiracy treaty, the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, or ACTA, was roundly rejected last week by the European Parliament.In the last two years, the Obama administration has closed about 800 Web sites suspected of piracy, including those that stream new Hollywood films. In a widely publicized case, the Justice Department has sought to extradite the operators of Megaupload, a site that let users anonymously share movies and music, on criminal copyright infringement.“There is a problem of copyright infringement on the Internet, and copyright owners have been struggling over how to deal with that,” said Mark A. Lemley, a Stanford law professor who has represented Internet companies like Google in intellectual property disputes. “The U.S. government is aggressively getting involved in turning what used to be civil lawsuits into criminal cases. The combination of that and reaching across the border is new.”The extradition case against Mr. O’Dwyer has turned him into something of a cause célèbre. Wikipedia’s founder, Jimmy Wales, is leading a crusade to save him, with an online petition that has gathered over 225,000 signatures worldwide in two weeks.Still, the British home secretary, Theresa May, approved the extradition order in March and said Monday that she would let the order stand. Mr. O’Dwyer has appealed; a hearing in Britain is expected this fall.His lawyer did not respond to requests for comment. The federal prosecutors in New York who are handling the case also declined to comment. The criminal complaint against Mr. O’Dwyer is sealed.Mr. O’Dwyer’s story began in 2008 when he set up his Web site, TVShack.net, which allowed users to search for and link to other sites, including ones that the authorities say showed pirated movies and shows. Because the domain name was registered in the United States, it fell under the ambit of American law. The government shut down TVShack.net in summer 2010.Mr. O’Dwyer was unbowed. TVShack.net had been growing in popularity, and it made about $230,000 from advertising over the course of two years, federal prosecutors say.“America? They have nothing to do with me,” Mr. O’Dwyer’s mother said he had told her. He reopened his site as TVShack.cc, which he reckoned was beyond the reach of the United States.A few months later came a knock on the door from the British police. A judge ruled that Mr. O’Dwyer would not be prosecuted in Britain. Instead, the United States would seek to extradite him.His mother was stunned. “This is for fugitives and murderers and terrorists,” she recalled thinking. “Richard has never fled the scene of a crime. He has never left the U.K.!”A judge released Mr. O’Dwyer on bail. On his mother’s orders, he shut down his site, which makes it difficult to tell how it operated.At the heart of the O’Dwyer case is a question of what to do about Web sites that help users find unlicensed content.According to British court documents examined by The New York Times, the Justice Department argues that Mr. O’Dwyer enabled Internet users to easily avail themselves of copyrighted material by providing links to third-party sites that contained thousands of pirated films and television programs.Prosecutors say that on one day in 2010, his Web site contained links to seven films, described as the “most popular movies today,” that were still playing in theaters and had not been authorized for distribution on the Internet.Mr. O’Dwyer, prosecutors suggest, was aware the material was copyrighted. They cite an announcement on TVShack that urged users to be patient with download times because they were “saving quite a lot of money (especially when putting several visits to the theater or seasons together).”Ted Shapiro, the Motion Picture Association of America’s general counsel for Europe, said the fact that Mr. O’Dwyer had not stored illegal material on TVShack itself signaled that he knew how to evade the law.“The fact that the U.S. government is willing to step up and protect content from the film industry and the copyright sector is an amazingly important thing,” Mr. Shapiro said. “We are talking about protecting things Americans are good at.”Mr. O’Dwyer’s backers say his site was effectively a search engine. To prosecute him, they argue, would set a dangerous precedent — tantamount to holding one person accountable for the acts of another.“Something that lets you find illegal content can also help you find legal content,” said Mitch Stoltz, a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation. “When you go after intermediaries, you’re going to shut down legal and legitimate speech and commerce and innovation to get at what they perceive as illegal copyright violation.”Peter Decherney, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who wrote the book “Hollywood’s Copyright Wars: From Edison to the Internet,” said the O’Dwyer case showed how difficult Hollywood has made it for people in other countries to consume American entertainment online.Sites like Netflix, Hulu and iTunes have limited offerings overseas, if any. The demand for American entertainment drives a lucrative underground economy of pirated movies and television shows.“In many other countries, unauthorized distribution is the only form of online distribution,” said Mr. Decherney, “and consumers will continue to make Robin Hoods out of anyone who can help them get to media online.”'"
"'12-07-13,'1','He said yields on California’s 30-year bonds, now at 4.01 percent, had also fallen this year, although they did not enjoy the highest ratings.Heavy burdens of bond debt are not always the main cause of municipal bankruptcy — the rising cost of pensions and health care can also be major factors. But whether or not bonds are the trigger, they can be treated very differently under federal bankruptcy law than under the state laws that normally govern their issuance. General obligation bonds, for instance, are normally a city’s best credit, but they can become unsecured credit in municipal bankruptcy.The question of whether municipal bonds pose hidden risk flared up two years ago, when a noted securities analyst, Meredith Whitney, appeared on the television show “60 Minutes” and predicted hundreds of municipal defaults within the next year. Although her prediction did not come true, it caused a major sell-off of municipal bonds that continued for months. Lately, investors have been returning to the market, and this week traders said they saw only scattered signs that small investors were dumping San Bernardino’s debt after its announcement.Still, if more municipal bankruptcies are in store, chances are that at least some of them will be in California. Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcies are extremely rare, and large ones are almost nonexistent. Of the 641 cases that have been filed since 1937, most have involved relatively small municipal utilities, special-purpose districts and public hospital systems — not big, complicated cities or counties with lots of people and debts.Within that rarefied group, most have been cities and counties in California.“Municipalities operate with a lot of autonomy in home-rule states such as California, and that autonomy leads to the freedom to get into trouble,” analysts for Trident Municipal Research said in a report issued Wednesday.The firm cited the kind of fiscal mismanagement that brought Stockton and San Bernardino to the brink, among other factors. But California’s biggest risk may be the lasting effect of Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot initiative that drastically lowered property taxes and has made them difficult to increase since then. There is no equivalent check on the cost of operating a municipal government, so many California cities and counties are increasingly caught in a painful squeeze between their limited revenue and their rising fixed costs — especially labor costs.Many operate pension plans that relied on steady investment gains that have evaporated in recent years and now have no way to replace the lost money.Trident’s analysts suggested that San Jose might be one of the next California cities to seek refuge in bankruptcy court; its mayor has been outspoken about the need to reduce pension costs.California lawmakers, sensing trouble ahead, passed a law this year making it harder for cities to declare bankruptcy. In doing so, however, they may have given the most distressed cities a road map to Chapter 9, by requiring cities considering bankruptcy to first go through a 60-day mediation session with their creditors.San Bernardino was so intent on seeking shelter in bankruptcy that it said it wanted to avoid the mediation requirement. The new law has an exemption for cities that have declared fiscal emergencies, which San Bernardino has done several times.The state also increased the fiscal pressure on cities earlier this year when it closed some 400 special redevelopment authorities and seized billions of dollars in property tax money that their host cities had previously controlled.“San Bernardino estimates that this year they expect to lose $6 million” as a result, said Mr. Larkin, of H. J. Sims. “By itself, it wouldn’t have caused bankruptcy, but when you add that to the city’s overspending, it made a bad situation worse.”James E. Spiotto, a Chapter 9 bankruptcy specialist at the law firm of Chapman & Cutler in Chicago, said the developments in California might not be a trend. But he sees them as a signal to other states to get ready to intervene in the affairs of their most troubled cities.“When you let the problem go too long, there’s no ready solution,” he said. “It’s like working with a melting ice cube.”'"

"'12-07-13,'1','CAIRO — In his first foreign visit as Egypt’s newly elected president, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood met Thursday with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, a signal that the two intended to set aside their profound ideological enmity in favor of pragmatic mutual interests.It was a meeting freighted with symbolism. The Saudi Arabian monarchy is the conservative anchor at the center of the authoritarian order that prevailed across the Middle East. It was a close ally of the former Egyptian strongman Hosni Mubarak, and in both Washington and Cairo, Saudi envoys pushed hard to rally support for his government and then to protect him from trial, Western and Egyptian diplomats say.Mr. Morsi owes his election to the popular uprising that finally cracked the old order, which the Brotherhood struggled for decades to overturn. The Islamist movement has long opposed the Saudi monarchy as a decadent, hypocritical and undemocratic tool of Western interests in the region. Though founded in Egypt, the Brotherhood has a sizable underground franchise in Saudi Arabia, despite a legal ban on its existence and deep animosity from the kingdom’s rulers.But Egypt desperately needs Saudi Arabian financial support to weather an economic crisis brought on by its 18 months of turmoil. In May, Saudi Arabia reportedly deposited $1 billion in Egypt’s central bank to help the country stay afloat until it can work out a proposed $3.2 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund, and it has pledged still more. Egypt is believed to need about $9 billion to avoid an economic calamity.Saudi Arabia also employs hundreds of thousands of Egyptians — including one of Mr. Morsi’s sons, a urologist — whose remittances home are a major support for the Egyptian economy.'"
"'12-07-13,'1','Today, the Permian Basin accounts for 14 percent of the nation’s oil production. That is far more than the combined output of other Texas fields, including the Eagle Ford Shale, and more than the Bakken Shale in North Dakota, another major drilling region.This latest boom has been driven by hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the technique of shooting water, sand and chemicals deep underground to crack hard rock and release oil. (The Permian Basin also produces natural gas, but some gets flared off, partly because of a pipeline shortage.)Fracking has allowed drillers to produce more oil than ever before, although the wells are more expensive, according to Tommy Taylor, the drilling manager with Fasken Oil and Ranch, an oil company that is building a new headquarters on Midland’s northwest edge. Also, fracking’s demand on aquifers has added to deep concerns about water availability in a region so parched that oil field trucks can kick up clouds of dust that look like smoke.Amid the resurgent drilling, Midland officials estimate that the city’s population has swelled by about 8 percent in the last two years, to about 120,000. There is talk of eventually hitting the 150,000 mark. Unemployment in Midland in May stood at just 3.8 percent — the lowest for a metropolitan area in the state — followed by nearby Odessa, at 4.3 percent.The oil fields offer generous pay, starting at around $15 an hour, Mr. Taylor said. That leaves other businesses scrambling for workers. Along a half-mile stretch of the Andrews Highway, an artery through the heart of Midland, “help wanted” signs are ubiquitous — at Long John Silver’s, Pizza Hut, Wendy’s, Whataburger, CVS and the Way Out West Steak & Buffet.“If you can’t get a job in Midland, Tex., you’re not going to make it,” said Jack Naumann, a geologist who has lived here since 1969.Even as more workers arrive, there is no guarantee they can find housing. That is why Jones Brothers, the company Mr. Wallace works for, is building the two-bed cabins and renting out trailer spaces with utility hookups.Jones Brothers, whose products include crushed limestone, is thriving. (“We sell everything we can crush,” Mr. Wallace said.) But it is struggling to find places to house prospective workers, who call about jobs from as far away as Indiana.“We have to tell them we’ve got the work, but we’ve got a problem with living conditions,” Mr. Wallace said. He plans to reserve some spaces in the new development for Jones Brothers workers and rent out the rest; a Craigslist ad, placed in late June, plus word of mouth, yielded at least 50 calls over two weeks, mostly for the R.V. spaces, he said.Besides subdivisions, cabins and R.V. parks, which are sometimes called “man camps,” hotels are going up rapidly. On Midland’s western edge, near the ballpark that is home to the city’s minor-league RockHounds baseball team (which projects record-breaking attendance this year), four hotels are being built or expanded, essentially within sight of one another.At the Sleep Inn & Suites, workers are rushing to complete a new wing in time for a major oil convention in October. “All the rooms that you see are rented,” said Dwayne Felker, who works for the construction company Shell Craft, speaking in the still-skeletal interior above the sounds of hammering and clinking.The hotels and other new developments could even start to meld Midland and Odessa, which lie 20 miles apart but vie with each other on and off the high school football field.“ ‘Modessa’ — it’s going to happen eventually,” said Mr. DeLaGarza, who does frequent inspections at a vast new subdivision near the ballpark.Some existing neighborhoods are wrestling with a different issue: drilling. Over the past 18 months, the City Council approved more than a dozen permits for drilling within city limits, and at least eight more are up for consideration in the next two months, according to John James, a councilman. Only a few have been rejected — one of them in the northwest Midland neighborhood where Craig Tellinghuisen, a retiree who worked in the oil business decades ago, lives.“One of the reasons that my wife and I moved out here was the peace and quiet and the country environment,” Mr. Tellinghuisen said of the area, which he moved to 11 years ago. Now, he is concerned about truck traffic and the noise of drilling. (The oil company has reapplied for the permit.)Regionwide, a surge in road accidents has raised concern. A recent report from the Midland-Odessa Transportation Alliance found that the traffic fatality rate for the Permian Basin area in 2010 was two and a half times higher than in the rest of Texas — and crashes and deaths have only climbed since.“We’re very concerned,” said James Beauchamp, the president of the alliance, which launched its Drive Smart campaign last week, with notices online and around town. In one especially awful week in June, he said, there were nine traffic deaths.Even schools are feeling the strains of the boom. The Midland Independent School District has about 22,500 students and is adding about 750 a year, according to its superintendent, Ryder Warren. The district plans to seek a bond issue that will probably include money to build three elementary schools, Dr. Warren said. Meanwhile, dozens of portable classrooms have been set up.All of the challenges have some people wondering when the boom is going to end, or at least ease. Longtime Midlanders say a bust is inevitable — it is just a matter of time. Oil prices have fallen more than 20 percent from their highs of around $110 per barrel in February.Mr. Taylor, the Fasken drilling manager, said that the recent price drop has already had an impact, and that for fracking — an expensive process — to continue, the economics must work.“If they don’t,” he said, “people will quit drilling wells.”'"
"'12-07-13,'1','The S.E.C. could investigate Silvercorp, which is traded on the New York Stock Exchange. But any such investigation would be difficult. Short-sellers have questioned whether the ore from the mine is nearly as good as the company claims, offering up analyses of ore samples they say fell off company trucks. They have also questioned whether the company’s sales are as large as is claimed.But the S.E.C. has no authority to obtain documents or interview witnesses in China. Without cooperation from Chinese authorities, there is no way for the commission to either put such suspicions to rest or conclude they are accurate and file a suit.Mary L. Schapiro, the commission’s chairwoman, and Ethiopis Tafara, the director of the commission’s office of international affairs, met in Beijing this month with Chinese officials led by Wang Qishan, a vice premier. There was no announcement of results from those meetings, but some articles in the Chinese press asserted that real progress was being made.The talks concerned the extent — if any — that Chinese officials will cooperate with the S.E.C.’s enforcement division when it investigates Chinese companies. S.E.C. officials declined to speak publicly about the talks, but the hope is that some cooperation on enforcement could begin by the end of this year, and lead to more cooperation with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which is overseen by the S.E.C. The board has been unable to conduct any examination of the more than 100 audit firms from China and Hong Kong that are registered with it.One positive sign was that the China Securities Regulatory Commission took part in the talks. American officials think that agency, the counterpart of the S.E.C., may be more sympathetic than the Ministry of Finance, which appears to have taken the lead in ordering Chinese auditing firms not to cooperate with the S.E.C. investigators. One Chinese newspaper, the Oriental Morning Post, reported the Chinese securities commission “will bear the main regulation responsibility.” The report said there was hope an agreement would be reached this year.It is possible that the Chinese are simply stalling, and have no intention of actually opening up. The chairman of the accounting oversight board, James Doty, had hoped that his inspectors could start observing Chinese inspections of audit firms by late this summer. His most recent remarks pushed that time back to the end of the year.Board officials have not commented on the state of their talks, but it seems likely that there have been disagreements on just what such observing might entail. Would American inspectors have access to audit work papers so they could form their own conclusions about the effectiveness of Chinese inspections, or would they just watch from across the room?If the board cannot reach an agreement, it may have to confront the question of whether audit firms immune from American inspection can continue to audit companies traded in the United States.It is easy to sympathize with the management of Silvercorp. Some of the most damaging accusations came in anonymous letters to regulators that had been posted on an Internet site that gave no indication of who was responsible for it.“We have gone above and beyond all reasonable efforts to deal with this ‘short and distort’ manipulation scheme,” said Rui Feng, the company’s chairman and chief executive, last October when the company released the KPMG report. “There is absolutely no substance to the anonymous allegations. Moving forward we will refocus and concentrate on our business of mining, mine development and exploration, things that build value for our shareholders.”But it is also possible to sympathize with some of those who were sued by Silvercorp. Jon Carnes, an analyst who published sharply critical reports about the company at Alfredlittle.com, claims that after the company filed a criminal complaint in China, the police in Luoyang, a small town where a Silvercorp subsidiary is based, “arrested, terrorized, and forbid my researchers from communicating with me or performing any further research on Chinese companies.”Mr. Carnes said the police had confiscated computers belonging to the researchers and had obtained files that included a copy of his personal address book. “Soon afterward,” he said in a report, the company asked a New York judge to order banks to provide information on any accounts owned by a list of people in the address book, or by anyone whose telephone number was on a list taken from the book. In an interview, Mr. Carnes said that one “telephone number” was actually his wife’s frequent flier account number.The suit against him and others is pending in a New York state court, and a similar case, against an Australian hedge fund manager, is pending in a Canadian court.In the New York case, a judge this week said Anthion Management, the hedge fund manager that has admitted writing the anonymous report sent to regulators, could not escape being sued on the argument that it had merely been trying to influence public officials, who had the power to stop Silvercorp stock from trading.Mr. Carnes’s most recent report points to what he thinks are conflicting statements by Silvercorp regarding the Ying mine, which is the company’s primary source of revenue. When I tried to ask the company about that, a spokesman cited the pending litigation in saying the company would not talk to me.On the day Silvercorp released a summary of the KPMG report, its stock leapt 18 percent, to $9.50. But it has since fallen back to around $5, despite reporting rising revenue and profits.Some of the stock weakness may be attributed to the limitations of what KPMG was asked to do. It confirmed that the revenue reported by Silvercorp matched the revenue it had posted in its accounting system, but it said it did not “undertake a comprehensive review of revenue and its source.”It got confirmations of account balances from Chinese banks, but investors recall that one of the most prominent Chinese frauds uncovered last year appeared to involve banks providing false confirmations to auditors.That is the credibility problem China faces. Lewis Ferguson, a member of the American accounting oversight board, says that 67 Chinese companies that trade in the United States have had their auditors resign, and 126 have either been delisted from American exchanges or have chosen to stop filing reports on their finances with the S.E.C.One of them, Sino Clean Energy, whose shares lost 90 percent of their value before Nasdaq suspended trading in them, sued some of the same people that Silvercorp is now suing, making similar accusations.There are frauds everywhere, of course, and this month happens to be the 10th anniversary of the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the United States. That law, which established the accounting oversight board, stemmed from the Enron and WorldCom scandals.But in the United States, a fraud as relatively simple as the one that some suspect took place at Silvercorp would have long since been proved or disproved as investigators established what the facts were. The stock would have either collapsed or resumed trading on the basis of trusted financial statements. China must decide whether it wants to give its companies the same benefit.'"
"'12-07-13,'1','BRUSSELS — A constitutional crisis in Romania seemed to be near resolution on Thursday, quieting fears for now of growing political instability on the eastern fringe of the European Union.The confrontation in Romania brought a sharp rebuke from European officials, including the head of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, who spoke of his “deep concerns” about the infighting and its potential for undermining the nation’s judiciary. This follows a similar crisis in Hungary, reviving worries about whether the European Union can protect its core values if relatively new democracies threaten to stray.The troubles in Romania began with the arrival of a center-left government in May under Prime Minister Victor Ponta, which immediately clashed with the conservative president, Traian Basescu, ostensibly over economic issues. Last week, after only two months, the Parliament voted to suspend the president pending a referendum on impeachment, which has been set for July 29.That, in turn, led to squabbling over a law passed by the previous government in its final days requiring that at least 50 percent plus one of the entire electorate turn out for such a referendum to be valid. Mr. Ponta’s government had sought to remove that requirement by decree, but the move was invalidated Tuesday by the Constitutional Court.The government initially indicated it would ignore the court’s ruling. But late Wednesday in Brussels, where Mr. Ponta said he had traveled to “give reassurances” to European officials, he said he would have his emergency decree revoked, in accordance with the court decision.'"
"'12-07-13,'1','Rising incomes among consumers in emerging markets like China, India and Brazil are poised to drive global growth in pharmaceutical spending over the next five years, according to a report released Thursday by the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics.The news is likely to be a welcome development for the drug industry, which is struggling to maintain sales in the United States and Europe as patent expirations and price controls eat into profits. The report predicts that the market for drugs will rebound in the next few years, to 5 to 7 percent growth in 2016 from an expected low point of 3 to 4 percent growth this year. Global spending will total almost $1.2 trillion by 2016, compared with about $956 billion in 2011.Governments and insurers in the United States and Europe, eager to curtail growing health care costs, are expected to take an even more critical look at drug prices, said Michael Kleinrock, director of research development at the institute.“As payers continue to spend more and more on medicines, the questions of the value and return for that spend become even more front-of-mind,” he said. The report found that rising incomes and more generous health care policies in emerging pharmaceutical markets — countries that will see more than $1 billion in drug growth over the next five years, but where the per capita gross domestic product is less than $25,000 — is leading to small but widespread increases in drug spending.“As incomes rise, the ability to afford medicines is one of the first things that come to these people,” Mr. Kleinrock said.'"
"'12-07-13,'1','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — The Pakistani Supreme Court on Thursday gave the new prime minister, Raja Pervez Ashraf, two weeks to restart a corruption investigation of President Asif Ali Zardari, setting the stage for a new confrontation in the months-old battle between government and judiciary.The court, led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, ordered Mr. Ashraf to write a letter to the authorities in Switzerland requesting that they reopen a graft case against Mr. Zardari that dates from the 1990s. Few believe that he will do so; his predecessor, Yousaf Raza Gilani, refused an identical order that resulted in his dismissal from office by the court last month.Should Mr. Ashraf also be dismissed by the court, it would push the country into renewed political turbulence that could set off early elections. The Zardari-led government’s five-year term ends next March, and elections could take place as late as June — something most analysts now feel is unlikely.The confrontation between government and judiciary has consumed Pakistan’s political system over the past seven months, at a time when the country faces pressing challenges including severe energy shortages and a renewed wave of militant attacks.Hours before Thursday’s court hearings, at least nine trainee prison guards were killed in the eastern city of Lahore. Unidentified gunmen stormed a house where 32 trainees, mostly police officers from northwestern Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province, were lodging.'"

"'12-07-14,'0','Young issued two straight walks to load the bases and, after inducing a pop foul for the second out, walked David Ross, sending another run across home plate.The lights went out suddenly at 8:07, during the top of the second, sending the players jogging back into the dugouts as the crowd buzzed excitedly. The organist played tunes until the lights slowly came back to life. Play resumed at 8:23, and Josh Thole, who came to plate already behind 0-1, struck out to end the inning.In the third, Young allowed hits to Chipper Jones and Freddie Freeman, putting runners on first and third with one out. One out later, Ross drilled a 1-0 fastball over the fence in left field. The three-run home run put the Braves ahead, 5-0.“Nothing was as sharp as I needed it to be,” said Young.The Mets finally awakened in the fourth. David Wright opened with a double into the left-center field gap. One out later, Lucas Duda walked and Scott Hairston smashed a double to left, scoring Wright from second. Kirk Nieuwenhuis then sliced a single to left, sending two more runs home. Nieuwenhuis had entered the series batting .133 (6-for-45) since June 16.Thole skipped a single off the front of the mound and into center field. That ended the night for Young, as Jordany Valdespin came up to pinch hit in the ninth spot. He popped out. Then Ruben Tejada, who fell into a two-strike count, shortened his swing and poked a single through the right side, scoring Nieuwenhuis to make it 5-4.Young’s three-inning start was his shortest of the season. He allowed six hits and three walks and struck out two. After throwing only 71 pitches, Young said he expected to be ready to start again Wednesday in Washington in the rotation spot of Dillon Gee, who underwent surgery Friday to repair a damaged artery in his right shoulder.That way, the Mets can avoid naming a fifth starter — whether the veteran Miguel Batista, the obvious choice, or the minor leaguer Matt Harvey, a riskier option — until next weekend.Tim Hudson’s start for the Braves ended when he allowed a single and a walk to open the fifth. His replacement, Christian Martinez, walked Duda to load the bases, but then got three straight outs to stanch the threat.Batista allowed the bases loaded with one out in the bottom of the inning. Josh Edgin, a 25-year-old left-hander, made his major league debut, struck out Juan Francisco and Bourn to end the inning, and got a firm handshake from Collins on the top step on the dugout.But Edgin gave up a two-out home run to Jones in the sixth. Dan Uggla’s run-scoring double off Ramon Ramirez made it 7-4.Andres Torres added a run-scoring single for the Mets in the eighth. But closer Craig Kimbrel blazed through the heart of the Mets’ order in the ninth, helping his team walk away with the win.Closer Frank Francisco, who went to the disabled list on June 24, halted his rehabilitation work after experiencing discomfort in his oblique muscle.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','A journalist and blogger praised by international human rights groups for championing press freedom was sentenced to 18 years in prison on Friday after his conviction last month on terrorism charges. The journalist, Eskinder Nega, and more than a dozen others — most of whom had fled the country — were convicted of attempting to foment a revolution in Ethiopia, human rights advocates said. Two opposition figures received life sentences. Mr. Nega’s case stemmed from writings challenging the prosecution of fellow reporters and editors. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat, strongly condemned Mr. Nega’s conviction in June, saying the Ethiopian government “misuses its institutions to silence its critics.” PEN International, which honored Mr. Nega with a press freedom award this spring, said Friday that it was “appalled” by the sentencing and called for his immediate release.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','Shooting a 59 is viewed as golf’s perfect game. As many golfers have completed the career grand slam — five — as have shot a 59 on tour. A low nine-hole score, while easier to accomplish, carries its own special splendor. Corey Pavin holds the PGA Tour scoring record with an eight-under 26 on the front nine in the first round of the 2006 U.S. Bank Championship in Milwaukee.“It seemed like it was a misprint,” Pavin said at the time.Jamie Kureluk, a Canadian pro, went one better in 2010, earning the nickname Mr. 25 when he shot that figure on the back nine at the Alberta Open.Thirty-five years ago, Al Geiberger became the first pro to shoot a 59 on the PGA Tour, at the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic. “A certain feeling of invincibility came over me, and I felt like I’d never screw up again,” he said.He shot a 73 the next day and has chased the feeling of the 59 ever since, he said.Annika Sorenstam, Ms. 59 for her record round on the L.P.G.A. in 2001, agreed with the notion that a 54 — a birdie on every hole — was attainable. At the 2010 Canadian Open, Mark Calcavecchia got halfway there, with birdies on a tour-record nine straight holes.What made Kite’s nine-hole score on Thursday extra special was that he accomplished it at age 62, and on a course designed to be the toughest challenge of the year on the Champions Tour.“The holes seemed as big as that swimming pool over there for a while,” Kite said.The fun started with an 18-foot birdie at No. 2. Then Kite benefited from a good lie in the right rough on the 434-yard, par-4 No. 4. He sank his 8-iron approach from 155 yards to a blind hole location for an eagle. The roar of the crowd told him everything.Kite capped a five-birdie, one-eagle, no-bogey front nine with a 12-foot birdie putt at 9. In doing so, he wiped from the U.S.G.A. record book four other rounds of 29, including one by Vijay Singh at the 2003 United States Open and another by the defending Senior Open champion, Olin Browne, in the third round at last year’s tournament at Inverness Club.Kite strung together seven straight pars on the back nine before a double bogey at the par-3 17th dashed his hopes of breaking the U.S.G.A.’s 18-hole Open scoring record of 63.“You’re not going to continue that streak that I had,” he said. “Those don’t come around that often.”'"
"'12-07-14,'0','“Now, we can already anticipate — we know what those who are opposed to letting the high-end tax cuts expire will say,” Mr. Obama said at the White House. “They’ll say that we can’t tax ‘job creators.’ ”But most small-business owners would be exempt, he said, because “97 percent of small businesses fall under the $250,000 threshold.”Republicans, by reframing the issue of taxes on the wealthy into a debate about job creation, have cannily evoked Americans’ patriotic support of small businesses as an engine of economic growth. Democratic and Republican politicians are equally given to praising small businesses for creating a majority of jobs.But the world of small businesses — more specifically, of individuals who report business earnings on their tax returns — is complex. Many enterprises do not fit the rosy image of a tech start-up in a garage or a mom-and-pop florist.Mr. Obama is correct that only a tiny sliver of business owners make enough to land in the top tax brackets. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan Congressional office, estimated last month that 3.5 percent of taxpayers with business income in 2013 would fall in the tax brackets that would rise under the president’s proposal.But the tax committee also supported Mr. Romney’s assertion that this sliver represents a significant share of the economy: those top earners generate 53 percent of all small-business income.Mr. Romney’s figure that a majority of Americans, 54 percent, are employed at companies whose owners file taxes as individuals is from a report by the accounting firm Ernst & Young, according to the Romney campaign.The report examined all types of “flow-through” businesses, in which profits pass from the business to the individual owners for tax purposes, including partnerships, sole proprietorships and other entities not subject to corporate taxes.The number and share of the economy of flow-through businesses have steadily grown in recent decades, to the point that many would hardly be considered small businesses. Seventeen percent of workers in flow-through enterprises work at companies with more than 500 workers, according to Ernst & Young.Flow-through businesses include large law partnerships and hedge funds. Before it went public in 1999, Goldman Sachs was a flow-through business.Republicans often argue that the owners of flow-through businesses are sensitive to marginal tax rates in making hiring decisions.“I used to run a small business; I used to have pass-through income,” the House speaker, John A. Boehner, said on Tuesday, promising to kill the president’s proposal in a vote later this month. “I would have been affected by this tax increase that the president’s calling for. This is not going to help our economy.”But the question of whether small-business owners are encouraged or deterred by marginal tax rates is robustly debated by economists.“If I’ve got $100 after taxes and you raise my tax rate and it goes down to $80, I might be less likely to go out and hire an additional worker, because I don’t have enough cash on hand,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser to President George W. Bush. Mr. Holtz-Eakin has done research linking an entrepreneur’s lower individual tax rate with a decision to hire more workers.Another expert, William G. Gale, a director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, disputed the notion that raising marginal tax rates on small-business owners depressed hiring. These businesses can deduct wages from their revenues, he said, with the potential to lower their effective tax rate.“They can deduct everything in full,” Mr. Gale said. “It’s a canonical result in economics that if you can immediately deduct the investment, then the effective tax rate should be zero.”In any event, recent studies have challenged the notion that small businesses are a key engine of job creation. Older small businesses, it seems, cut more jobs than they create. Research by the economist John C. Haltiwanger and others showed that the only small businesses that create more jobs than they destroy are those less than five years old — in other words, start-ups.“The small-business sector per se is not necessarily a dynamic part of the economy,” Mr. Gale said. Reducing taxes on high individual incomes across the board is applying too broad a brush, he said, to stimulate the fraction of small businesses that are young and innovating and generating most new jobs.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','“There’s no reason that what we do on the battlefield should not reflect the best medicine in the world,” said Air Force Lt. Col. Stephen Rush, who helped organize the training.The training was conducted by Long Island Veterinary Specialists, which is considered one of the most advanced veterinary hospitals in the country, and by K-9 Medic, a company that teaches how to give emergency medical care to service dogs.Colonel Rush, a clinical assistant professor of neurosurgery and radiation oncology at New York University, said the two-day training could serve as a model for future courses.There are about 2,700 dogs serving in the armed forces; 29 have been killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a military spokeswoman.The dogs sniff out bombs and detect booby-traps inside buildings and along roadways. The total value of a trained working dog — often German shepherds, black Labrador retrievers, or Belgian Malinois — can reach $40,000. In addition, the units they serve grow emotionally attached to their dogs.“A dog is like a brother to these guys,” Sergeant Joseloff said. Elite pararescuemen, trained as emergency paramedics, are responsible for many rescue and recovery missions in remote and dangerous locations.On a recent Monday at Long Island Veterinary Specialists in Plainview, the pararescue members took turns gently rolling two black Labrador retrievers, named Angel and Shadow, onto their sides. The men learned how to carry a dog without hurting its spleen and how to carry one with a back injury. A hospital worker showed the men how to examine a dog’s gums to determine if it is sick. They took the dogs’ pulses. For the most part, Angel and Shadow kept their poise, allowing the soldiers to poke and prod them.“You might not have it so easy in the field,” said Marissa Soto, a veterinary technician.The facility offers some of the most advanced animal care available anywhere, with a more sophisticated M.R.I. machine than many hospitals have and specialists who include dermatologists, ophthalmologists, hip surgeons and brain surgeons. Dr. Dominic J. Marino, the hospital’s chief of staff, has become so highly regarded for his work on dogs with certain neurological disorders that he has been invited to address conferences of doctors who treat humans with similar disorders.During the training, instructors emphasized the similarities in treating dogs and humans. The soldiers practiced sewing wounds on preserved pigs’ feet using the same kind of stitching they would use for humans. In other lessons, like treating a dog in shock, the men learned the appropriate dog-size doses of fluid to use.But there were important differences. Humans in pain rarely bite the medic treating them. Dogs can be a different story, so muzzling the injured animal is a priority. And the men were surprised to learn that applying a tourniquet to a wound, a standard procedure on humans, might cause more harm on a dog.As part of the training, they put on blindfolds and used their hands and feet to feel the ground and reach a stuffed dog inside the hospital’s rehabilitation center. With an instructor narrating beside them, they simulated a check of the dog’s vital signs. The instructor sprayed water to simulate blood escaping the dog’s body as the soldiers applied bandages. Many forgot to muzzle the animals.Jo-Anne Brenner, the director of K-9 Medic, helped plan the curriculum for the training. She said the goal was to make it hands-on and to ensure that the pararescuemen committed to memory the skills necessary to treat dogs in crisis situations.Ron Aiello, the president of United States War Dogs Association, an advocacy group for working dogs, says that the military’s treatment of working dogs has improved significantly during the last half-century.“I was a Vietnam-era dog handler,” Mr. Aiello said. “We knew nothing. Not even first aid. Not even first aid if your dog got hurt.”Now, military dog handlers are trained in first aid and veterinarians are stationed in war zones.

"'12-07-14,'0','“A very large number of them have already picked out their classes, and they’re going to the classes,” Kiewiet said. “They just don’t get registered until the deadline.”If students are not officially registered for enough classes during this three-week period, they can be considered part-time students, and part-time students are ineligible to compete in N.C.A.A. events.“Nobody was trying to get around the system,” Kunesh said. “It wasn’t like it was a loophole they lucked into. When you look at what happens at some Division I schools relative to what happens at Caltech, it’s all kind of silly.”Ellen Staurowsky, a professor of sport management at Drexel University, said the focus of the N.C.A.A.’s action seems misplaced. “A situation in which they have very specific reasons as to why they run their academic programs the way they do is a very different issue than an institution manipulating their academic program in order to allow athletes who should not be eligible to become eligible,” she said.Caltech’s penalties include a one-year postseason ban for sports in which ineligible players competed, a one-year ban on off-campus recruiting, three years of probation and a $5,000 penalty.Also, Caltech’s sports information department will soon meet with the N.C.A.A. to determine which wins and records the university must vacate. There was brief concern that the men’s basketball team’s 46-45 win over Occidental in 2011, which ended the 310-game conference losing streak, would be overturned. But no ineligible players were used in that game.“That was huge, because it definitely would have been very upsetting if they reversed that,” Kunesh said. “It was such a big deal to break that streak.”Mitchell said some athletes were found to be academically ineligible for failing to maintain individual requirements. But most of the missteps were related to the class shopping system. Mitchell said there was not enough communication between academic and athletic departments to certify whether an athlete was enrolled in enough classes to be eligible.“It became clear we had gaps and holes,” Mitchell said, “and we weren’t doing things at least the way I was accustomed to.”Many of those problems were rectified during the past academic year, Mitchell said. All 17 teams had a team grade-point average of 3.0 or higher, and the averages of the men’s swimming, women’s water polo and men’s cross-country teams were in the top three in Division III in their sports.Mike Paluchniak, a junior guard on the basketball team, said there was a noticeably different tenor regarding class registration in the past year.“There was a lot more focus put on making sure everything was being met with some compliance things,” Paluchniak said.Considering Caltech’s record of athletic futility, the one-year postseason bans are not akin to a major college football team’s being banned from a bowl. But Paluchniak said the basketball team, for one, was deflated by the news.“It sounds a little skewed to somebody not familiar with our program, but the postseason ban really has us bummed,” he said. “It’d be easy for somebody to laugh at that because of how things have gone, but this takes away from us. We’ve had our goal set on the postseason, and now we’ll just have to go out and win as many games as we can.”'"
"'12-07-14,'0','A federal judge in Mississippi partly lifted a barrier on a law on Friday that would put new restrictions on the state’s sole abortion clinic. But he blocked parts of the law that could expose the clinic to criminal or civil penalties while it tried to come into compliance with the new restrictions.The law, which the State Legislature passed in the spring, requires physicians performing abortions at a clinic to have admitting privileges at a local hospital. The two doctors who perform abortions at the state’s only clinic, in Jackson, do not have such privileges. Although they have applied to seven hospitals in the area, they have yet to hear a response.The clinic sued the state, and on July 1, the day the law was to take effect, Judge Daniel P. Jordan III of United States District Court temporarily blocked the measure. The judge held a hearing on Wednesday to decide whether to keep the law blocked.The state argued that the hold should be lifted because the administrative process for carrying out a new law can take up to six months, during which the clinic would be allowed to operate as it tried to come into compliance.Lawyers for the clinic responded that during that administrative process the doctors would still be breaking the law by performing abortions and could possibly face criminal prosecution, even if they later met the law’s obligations.Judge Jordan’s decision, which addressed both concerns, did not address the fundamental constitutional dispute: whether the law is, as the clinic argues, simply a pretext to stop abortions in the state altogether. Allowing the law to take effect, the judge said on Wednesday, would allow him to see whether or not the doctors would be able to comply with its new regulations. The outcome of that process would have an impact on determining the law’s constitutionality, he said.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','But Andrew J. Tabler, a senior fellow and Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said some chemical weapons had been moved in an area around Homs, where some of the heaviest fighting has taken place in recent weeks.“The Assad regime is losing control of its territory,” Mr. Tabler said. “You don’t move this stuff unless you have to, and they obviously felt they had to move it.”A second United States official with access to classified intelligence reports said rebels were placing increasing pressure on Syrian security forces across the country.“The armed opposition is becoming more effective,” said the official, who like the first official spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the assessments. “It’s using guerrilla tactics more frequently to attack regime forces and improving tactical coordination.”“It appears the insurgents are now operating in larger chunks of territory,” the official continued. “The situation is not at a tipping point as the regime still has significant military capabilities, but the military ground underneath Assad is increasingly unstable.”Israel and the United States have been monitoring movements of all Syrian weapons, and are believed to have allowed the Syrians to move some conventional weapons over the border into Lebanon without protesting, said one analyst with long experience in Syria, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The rationale for Israel’s not speaking up is that any interference would play into the government’s accusation that the entire uprising is an Israeli plot, the analyst said.Obama administration officials, who have maintained from the beginning of the turmoil in Syria that the country’s chemical and biological arsenal remained secure and in storage, warned the Assad government on Friday to keep it that way.“We have repeatedly made it clear that the Syrian government has a responsibility to safeguard its stockpiles of chemical weapons, and that the international community will hold accountable any Syrian officials who fail to meet that obligation,” said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman.But Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, “We cannot discount that the Assad regime could make a decision to use these weapons in an act of desperation, and we must act accordingly.” He neither confirmed nor denied that Syria had moved the munitions.George Little, the Defense Department spokesman, said: “We would caution them strongly against any intention to use those weapons. That would cross a serious red line.”American intelligence analysts had probably observed the movement of chemical weapons or the preparations to move them in satellite imagery and communications intercepts, security specialists said.Jeffrey White, a former Defense Intelligence Agency intelligence officer who now studies Syria at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said if the munitions were being deployed to firing units, that would suggest that preparations were being made for their use. If they are being concentrated at a smaller number of secure sites, that would suggest concerns about enhancing security.Mr. White said that moving the chemical weapons raised concerns that government convoys could come under attack with the risk that deadly agents could be released or could fall into the hands of rebel forces.Moving the munitions around would also pose new challenges to Western analysts trying to keep track of them. “Presumably the intel community will be checking all known C.W. facilities, but they could be going anywhere,” Mr. White said.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','In just the last few years, Delaware and the District of Columbia have passed laws that allow for third “de facto parents,” who have the same rights and responsibilities toward their children as adoptive parents.Meanwhile, courts in at least a half-dozen states, stretching from Oregon to Massachusetts, have also recognized three legal parents in a handful of cases over the last decade. Courts in Canada and New Zealand have as well.Nancy Polikoff, a professor at the American University Washington College of Law, said those cases merely allowed the law to reflect the many different kinds of families that already exist in the 21st century.“This is about looking at the reality of children’s lives, which are heterogeneous, as opposed to maintaining a fiction of homogeneity,” Professor Polikoff said. “Families are different from one another. If the law will not acknowledge that, then it’s not responding to the needs of children who do not fit into the one-size-fits-all box.”Conservative groups, however, have called the California bill an attempt to redefine the family radically, opening the door for children to have six, eight, even a dozen parents.“This bill is a Trojan horse for the same-sex-marriage agenda,” Peter Sprigg, a senior fellow at the Family Research Council, said.“Advocates for same-sex marriage are very interested in separating parentage and marriage from biological parentage, because that’s the one thing same-sex couples can never achieve,” he added.The bill passed the California Senate on a party-line vote, with Democrats supporting it and Republicans opposed, and could reach the Assembly floor by next month.Mr. Leno, a Democrat from San Francisco, insists that fears of children with dozens of parents are unrealistic. Third parents would still have to meet the same legal standards currently in place. A judge would also have to rule that it was in the child’s best interest to recognize a third parent.Instead, Mr. Leno said he hoped that allowing the court to recognize a third or fourth parent could help keep children out of foster care in a small number of cases.Mr. Leno’s bill follows a court case here last year in which a young girl being raised by two lesbian mothers was sent to foster care after a fight landed one mother in the hospital and the other in jail. The girl’s father, who had maintained a relationship with his daughter, asked the court to release her to his custody.The trial court ruled that both mothers and the father were all parents. But a California appeals court reversed the decision, ruling that the child could have only two parents.Still, parents hoping to keep their children out of foster care are hardly the only ones who hope to benefit if the bill becomes law.In San Francisco, Mr. Delaney said, the two sets of parents go on vacations together with the children, have family dinners together and have signed agreements about how to handle situations like a falling-out.But Mr. Delaney, who is the biological father of his two girls, is not currently one of their legal parents. He said his becoming a legal parent would give the whole family a greater feeling of security.“This would be the final piece, so we don’t have to worry if something happens to the legal parents or if I am out with the kids and something happens,” he said. “Legally, they could just take my kids and I couldn’t do anything about it.”And while many of the third-parent adoption cases have involved same-sex couples, heterosexual couples have also sought legal recognition for third parents.In Portland, Ore., Sean Kane adopted his wife’s two children from her first marriage. But because they maintained close ties with their biological father, who now lives in California, Mr. Kane did not want the court to sever that legal relationship. Instead he pursued a third-parent adoption, which was finalized last year.“I wanted to send the message to the children that they were my children, as far as I was concerned,” he said.Mr. Kane’s adopted daughter, Sara Miner, 20, said: “If it were a choice between dropping my dad to be replaced by my stepdad, I would not have been open to it, but with a joint adoption you don’t have to battle about who is going to be Mom and who is going to be Dad. You can have a situation where everyone is happy and part of the family.”Like other parents in nontraditional families, Mr. Kane also cited some practical concerns in his decision to become a legal parent: he wanted to be able to pick his children up from school without hassle and make sure they would be provided for if he died. Access to health insurance, tax deductions and potentially even citizenship can also hinge on these legal relationships.Some critics of the California bill point out that the addition of another parent could open the door for particularly messy battles over custody or child support.“If we are creating multiple parents for a child, we know that in approximately 50 percent of cases, parents are going to separate and possibly dispute what to do with that child,” said Diane Wasznicky, president of the Association of Certified Family Law Specialists.“If divorce is difficult for children who have two parents, imagine it with three or four,” she added.But Beth Allen, the lawyer who handled Mr. Kane’s adoption, said the possibility of divorce should not prevent judges from offering legal rights and protections to multiple people who were acting as parents.“So often, we are struggling with parents who don’t want the responsibilities and obligations of parenting,” she said. “So when you have another parent willing to step up and take on those responsibilities, aren’t we so lucky?”'"

"'12-07-14,'0','Producer prices for finished goods unexpectedly rose in June for the first time in four months, reflecting an increase in food costs.The 0.1 percent gain in the producer price index came after a 1 percent decrease in May, the Labor Department reported on Friday. The median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of 70 economists called for a 0.4 percent fall. Excluding volatile food and energy, the so-called core measure increased 0.2 percent as projected.Also Friday, a survey showed confidence among consumers unexpectedly declining in July to the lowest level this year as Americans grew more pessimistic about their finances.Weak growth in the United States may also limit price pressures through the production pipeline, reinforcing Federal Reserve policy makers’ projections that inflation is likely to be subdued.“Producer prices will be pretty much contained in coming months as commodity costs have come off,” Kevin Cummins, an economist at UBS Securities in Stamford, Conn., said before the report. “That’s likely to persist. There are worries about global growth and demand in the U.S. is also slowing.”'"
"'12-07-14,'0','Senator John McCain lent support Friday to the United States Anti-Doping Agency in its case against Lance Armstrong, saying the agency follows a fair process that has been authorized by Congress and that it has the right to investigate and bring charges against Armstrong.“This process is the proper forum to decide matters concerning individual cases of alleged doping violations,” McCain said in a statement.His comments come a day after Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, called the antidoping agency’s authority to punish Armstrong for doping violations “strained at best.” On Thursday, he sent a letter to the Office of National Drug Control Policy questioning the antidoping agency’s procedures and the public funding it receives.The antidoping agency last month charged Armstrong, who denies doping, with violating the World Anti-Doping Code by doping and playing a key role in systematic doping that the agency says took place on his Tour de France winning teams. He faces a lifetime ban from Olympic sports and the loss of his Tour titles if he accepts the charges or if arbitrators rule against him.He has until next month to decide whether to accept the charges or proceed to arbitration, a process his lawyers have said deprives him of his constitutional rights to due process. They have filed a suit in federal court to stop the antidoping agency from moving forward.Johan Bruyneel, Armstrong’s longtime team manager, also has been charged with a doping violation as a part of the case. He notified the antidoping agency Friday that he has chosen to dispute the charges and go to arbitration.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','Joseph Saunders, the chief executive of Visa, reiterated that the settlement was in the best interest of all the parties. Together, MasterCard and Visa have agreed to pay $5.2 billion.As part of the settlement, MasterCard and Visa additionally agreed to reduce the charge to process transactions for eight months. That fee reprieve is estimated by the plaintiffs to be worth $1.2 billion.“We think this is a historic victory,” said K. Craig Wildfang, a lawyer with Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi who represented the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.The retailers battling the card giants include Kroger and Safeway.Last year, retailers won another victory over what financial firms can charge them when customers use a different form of plastic, the debit card.Under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, banks had to reduce “swipe fees” that they collect from merchants each time a customer makes a purchase with a debit card.Under the credit-card settlement on Friday, worked out over months of negotiations, merchants can charge higher prices to consumers who decide to pay for their purchases with credit cards.A customer, for example, who buys a $100 item with a credit card might be charged an additional $2.50. A judge still needs to approve the settlement.Until now, the card companies banned merchants from adding such a surcharge, although gas stations and other retailers sometimes offered a discount for customers who paid in cash.Lawyers for the merchants said the ability to charge for credit card use would not necessarily result in greater costs for consumers, but rather can be used as a way to push the credit card processors to reduce the amount they charge merchants.Retailers have long sought to be able to charge customers more who pay with credit, reasoning that levying greater fees would help reduce their overall costs for accepting the plastic.Merchants pay roughly $40 billion in fees each year to MasterCard and Visa issuing banks, Mr. Wildfang said.The American Bankers Association said in a statement that while the banks “may not like all the results in this case, our industry is ready to put this matter behind us.”Frank Keating, the association’s president, said: “Let’s be clear — retailers, not consumers, benefit from today’s resolution.”'"
"'12-07-14,'0','The executive board also chose to dismiss concerns by the organization’s legal counsel that the award violated protocols by being financed directly by the government and not by the nongovernmental organization listed in the prize statutes. The counsel had recommended that the funds not be disbursed for the prize.The director general of Unesco, Irina Bokova, also opposed the award but felt she had to follow the wishes of the executive board, Unesco officials said. Ms. Bokova, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on Friday. But in a letter to the chairman of a group of Western European and North American diplomats on Thursday, Ms. Bokova wrote that she was “constitutionally obliged to implement the decisions of the executive board,” and that had the board not acted, “I would have continued to suspend the implementation of the prize.” The group had complained in a letter to Ms. Bokova on Monday that “the prize is detrimental to the reputation of Unesco,” and that the board ignored the advice of Unesco’s legal office.Later on Friday, the group wrote another letter to the executive board urging that the prize not be awarded until the legal issues are resolved, “so there is no cloud of illegality hanging over the prize.” The letters were provided to The New York Times by diplomats who oppose the prize.Mr. Obiang, who took power in a coup in 1979, provided $3 million over five years; half the money is to go to recipients and half is to cover the costs of selecting the winners, who are all distinguished scientists. There are three winners a year, who each get $100,000, a diploma and a statuette by the Equatorial Guinean artist Leandro Mbomio Nsue, a former government minister.David T. Killion, the United States ambassador to Unesco, said Friday that while Washington supported recognition of African scientists, “We condemn Unesco’s decision to award this prize against the wishes of many of its own member states and the international human-rights community.”He said that the source of the prize money was “questionable,” and that international rights organizations and nongovernmental organizations considered Equatorial Guinea “one of the world’s worst human-rights offenders.” He said it “scores poorly on most global indices related to freedom of expression and access to education.” Despite its relatively recent oil wealth, the tiny country has one of the highest infant-mortality rates in the world and an average life expectancy of 62.75 years.The influence of the United States in Unesco has been reduced since it cut off all its financing for the organization — once 22 percent of the total budget — because the Palestinian Authority was made a full member last October. Washington said it had to cut off financing under existing legislation, and the Obama administration has thus far failed to persuade Congress to change its mind.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','SIEM REAP, Cambodia — President Thein Sein of Myanmar addressed a dinner of American business executives in this city near the ancient ruins of Angkor Wat on Friday, inviting them to invest in his impoverished country after an absence of 25 years.The appearance of Mr. Thein Sein, who traveled to Cambodia from his nearby country for the occasion, was the latest sign of a significant warming of relations between the United States and Myanmar, a Southeast Asian country that had been firmly in China’s orbit.Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton welcomed Mr. Thein Sein to the gathering on the last full day of her Asia trip, one intended to show that Washington’s commitment to the region reached beyond strengthening of military alliances to economic ties. Most countries in the region, with the Philippines as an exception, do more trade with China than with the United States.The meeting followed President Obama’s announcement on Wednesday of the easing of sanctions on American investments in Myanmar, a decision reached after two months of debate within the administration over how much and how quickly to reward the Myanmar government for the reforms it has undertaken so far.The administration placed some conditions on investments, including the requirement that American companies investing more than $500,000 must report to Washington on their human rights policies and anticorruption efforts. American energy companies that conclude deals with the state-owned Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise — which the opposition leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, wanted to be kept under sanctions — will be required to report their investments to Washington within 60 days.'"
"'12-07-14,'0','BEIJING — The authorities in China’s central Hunan Province have determined that a veteran dissident who was found dead in his hospital room last month took his own life, a government-affiliated news service reported Thursday.The findings, the result of a monthlong investigation by a handpicked team of Chinese forensic experts, contend that the man, Li Wangyang, a 62-year-old labor activist who spent more than two decades in prison, hanged himself with a strip of fabric he tore from his bedsheet.That report, published by the Hong Kong China News Agency, appears to have done little to ease the suspicions surrounding Mr. Li’s death on June 6, days after he gave interviews proclaiming his determination to continue agitating against China’s authoritarian government.In Hong Kong, where thousands took to the streets last month to protest the authorities’ initial ruling that Mr. Li had committed suicide, a number of local officials and rights advocates said they would continue pressing for an independent inquiry.Critics have assailed the contention that Mr. Li killed himself, saying his poor health — he was almost entirely blind, deaf and physically weak — made it unlikely that he could orchestrate his own hanging. They also questioned how he carried out the suicide given the presence of police minders outside his hospital room.Commissioned by the Hunan Province Public Security Bureau in response to the public uproar over Mr. Li’s death, the report cited “experts” who reviewed surveillance video and determined that only nurses, caregivers and his roommates had entered Mr. Li’s room in the hours before his body was found hanging from a window.'"

"'12-07-15,'0','This, of course, was before the scandals of the subprime mortgage era. It was before the bailouts, before Occupy Wall Street, before ordinary Americans began complaining about “banksters” and “muppets” and “the vampire squid.” In short, before Goldman Sachs became, for many, synonymous with Wall Street greed.And yet, even today what happened next to the Bakers seems remarkable. With Goldman Sachs on the job, the corporate takeover of Dragon Systems in an all-stock deal went terribly wrong. Goldman collected millions of dollars in fees — and the Bakers lost everything when Lernout & Hauspie was revealed to be a spectacular fraud. L.& H. had been founded by Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, who had once been hailed as stars of the 1990s tech boom. Only later did the Bakers learn that Goldman Sachs itself had at one point considered investing in L.& H. but had walked away after some digging into the company.This being Wall Street, a lot of money is now at stake. In federal court in Boston, the Bakers are demanding damages, including interest and legal fees, that could top $1 billion. That figure is nearly twice what Goldman paid to settle claims that it misled investors about subprime mortgage investments before the financial crisis of 2008.This account is based on a trove of legal filings — e-mails, motions and roughly 30 depositions, more than 8,000 pages of sworn testimony in all — that open a rare window on Goldman Sachs and the mystique that surrounds it.JAMES AND JANET BAKER, now in their 60s, are computer speech revolutionaries. Both Ph.D.’s, they became interested in voice-recognition technology in the 1970s, back when a personal assistant like Apple’s Siri would have seemed more science fiction than scientific fact.They are widely credited with advancing speech technology far faster than anyone thought possible, primarily because of an epiphany Mr. Baker had while doing his doctorate research. He figured out that speech recognition could, in essence, be reduced to math. You didn’t have to teach a computer to recognize accents or dialects, Mr. Baker realized — you just had to calculate the mathematical probability of one sound following another. His algorithms proved remarkably accurate and eventually became the industry standard. (Want to know more? Ask Siri.)The Bakers founded Dragon Systems in 1982 in an old Victorian house in West Newton, Mass. At that time, despite having two school-age children and a big mortgage, they were determined to take no venture capital and to finance the company’s growth with its own revenue — once they had a product. They figured they could last 18 months, maybe 24.Their first product was a software program for a British-made PC called the Apricot that let users open files and run programs by voice command. Then came DragonDictate, a groundbreaking speech-to-text system for dictation that still required the speaker to pause. Between. Every. Word.For years, the Bakers pressed on, convinced that they were on track to create a program that would recognize continuous speech.To do that, however, they eventually decided that they needed more capital. While Mr. Baker worked on the technology, Ms. Baker brokered a deal with Seagate Technology, the disk drive manufacturer. Seagate bought 25 percent of Dragon for $20 million. Then, in 1997, Dragon introduced Dragon NaturallySpeaking, a program that recognized more words than could be found in a standard collegiate dictionary. It was available in six languages and could handle normal speech, even sentences with words that sound alike, such as, “Please write a letter right now to Mrs. Wright. Tell her that two is too many to buy.”By this time, I.B.M. and others had piled into the voice technology market, too. As the Nasdaq market raced toward record highs, the Bakers considered taking Dragon public. But in 1999, several companies — including Sony and Intel — expressed interest in buying into Dragon. Finally, unsolicited buyout offers began to arrive. One came from Visteon, a subsidiary of Ford Motor. Another arrived from Lernout & Hauspie.TO the uninitiated, the mystique of Goldman Sachs may be hard to fathom. Known for what might politely be called ruthless professionalism, Goldman, the thinking goes, is smarter and more plugged in than just about any other investment bank. In the late 1990s, under Henry M. Paulson Jr., who later became the Treasury secretary and orchestrated the Wall Street bailouts, Goldman was the alpha dog in the lucrative game of mergers and acquisitions.So it was that in December 1999, the Bakers, in over their heads when it came to M.& A., signed a five-page engagement letter drafted by Goldman. In it, Goldman pledged to provide “financial advice and assistance in connection with this potential transaction, which may include performing valuation analyses, searching for a purchaser acceptable to you, coordinating visits of potential purchasers, and assisting you in negotiating the financial aspects of the transaction.”To the Dragon deal, Goldman assigned four bankers, two in their 20s and one in his early 30s. That wasn’t unusual. Although Dragon Systems was worth everything to the Bakers, the company — with $70 million in revenue and 400 employees — was small beer on Wall Street. Dragon agreed to pay Goldman a flat fee of $5 million, less than some Goldman bankers were pulling down.But who, if anyone, supervised these bankers — later called “the Goldman Four” in court documents — remains something of a mystery. One of the four, the most senior, testified later that their supervisor was Gene T. Sykes, a Goldman partner who at the time specialized in technology and who this year was promoted to head of M.& A. at the firm, one of the most powerful jobs on Wall Street. In a deposition, Mr. Sykes disavowed any involvement.Most of the Goldman Four didn’t stay long at the bank. Richard Wayner, who was 32 when the Dragon deal was cut, struck out on his own in 2002 and eventually landed at the Keffi Group, an investment firm. T. Otey Smith, then 21, left Goldman in 2000 and now works for RLJ Equity Partners. Alexander Berzofsky, then 25, left Goldman at about the same time and is now a managing director at Warburg Pincus, the big private investment company. Chris Fine, then 42, was a Goldman information technology specialist who was enlisted on the deal and is still with Goldman. (None of the four agreed to be interviewed for this article.)Before the engagement letter was signed in late 1999, Goldman sent Dragon a memo indicating that its first steps would include beginning to conduct due diligence — Wall Street-speak for kicking the tires — on L.& H. The memo included specific areas of concern, including L.& H.’s sources of revenue, its major customers, its license agreements and royalty agreements, its expected growth, its partnerships and its financial statements.THAT December, Mr. Wayner of Goldman accompanied Ms. Baker and Dragon’s chief financial officer, Ellen Chamberlain, on a trip to Belgium to meet L.& H. executives. For the trip, another of the Goldman Four, Mr. Berzofsky, prepared a list of due diligence questions. Goldman also prepared a “merger analysis” that predicted the companies’ combined sales per share, earnings per share and total debt under three acquisition scenarios: all cash, all stock and half and half.In its initial offer, L.& H. proposed paying $580 million, half in cash and half in stock. But the Bakers weren’t sure. News reports had questioned L.& H.’s revenue, particularly in fast-growing Asian markets, as well as some of the company’s licensing deals. Mr. Baker felt that L.& H. had inferior voice technology. But then, he reasoned, if L.& H. could generate so much revenue with lesser technology, imagine what it could do with Dragon.By mid-February 2000, Ms. Chamberlain had sent an angry memo to Goldman. It urged the bank to move faster in its analysis of L.& H. Talks with the other companies had gone nowhere, and she expected Goldman to “drive” the due diligence process. Mr. Wayner testified later that the bank’s reaction to that memo was “to do as our client asked and to revisit all of our analyses.”But on Feb. 29, Dragon received an odd memo from Goldman. It wasn’t addressed to anyone in particular at Dragon, and it wasn’t signed by anyone at Goldman. The Goldman Four testified later that they had no idea who had sent it. But the memo referred to many of the same due diligence issues that Ms. Chamberlain raised. The memo asserted, however, that Dragon’s accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, should do the work, not Goldman.The memo shocked Ms. Chamberlain. She had come to Dragon from Seagate, where she had participated in similar deals. She believed that this sort of thing was generally done by investment bankers, not by accountants. But the moment passed. No one at Dragon or Goldman brought up the mystery memo again — at least not until the lawsuits began flying. (The Bakers also filed suit against other participants in the transaction.)THE Dragon executives thought that Goldman was taking a hard look at L.& H. After all, Dragon was paying Goldman $5 million for its advice. If Goldman wasn’t conducting due diligence, what was it doing?“They put items on and off the due diligence list,” Ms. Baker later testified. “We discussed the issues at — at basically every meeting that we were at, and we were meeting often in person or by phone, typically, several times a week in this time frame — sometimes multiple times a day, as we’ve seen. And so they knew what everybody was doing. And they were, they were directing it.”One of the tasks was a conference call that Mr. Wayner arranged, at Ms. Baker’s request, between Dragon and Charles Elliott, a Goldman analyst in London. Dragon was wondering why L.& H.’s share price had been gyrating wildly. Mr. Wayner told Ms. Baker, he later testified, that Mr. Elliott was following L.& H.’s stock and was up to date on its fluctuations. And Mr. Elliott assured Ms. Baker that investors were worried about the market in general, rather than L.& H. in particular. He also said he expected the stock price of the combined companies to rise substantially once a merger was struck.Years later, in his deposition, Mr. Elliott told a more complete story. He acknowledged that he actually had not been following L.& H.; that had been the responsibility of another Goldman analyst who had left the firm shortly after the Bakers retained Goldman. After the other analyst left, Mr. Elliott testified, Goldman terminated its coverage of L.& H. No one told the Bakers that Goldman was no longer covering the company they were about to bet their futures on.Mr. Elliott also testified that he was unaware of press reports at the time that suggested L.& H. was claiming huge revenue gains in Asia. If he had been aware, he said, he would have been “very skeptical” of those gains, given the challenges that Asian languages present for speech recognition. He also acknowledged that it would not have been difficult for him to call up L.& H.’s customers and check the revenue claims.As the Nasdaq composite index raced toward a record high that March, Dragon’s executives made fateful decisions. On March 8, the Bakers met with L.& H. executives and that company’s advisers from SG Cowen to try to reach a definitive agreement.A few days before that meeting, Mr. Wayner of Goldman told Ms. Baker that he would be away on vacation and couldn’t make the session. He also said that he would be unable to call in and that it was pointless to send anybody else from Goldman because there wasn’t time to catch up on the deal. It was at this meeting that L.& H. proposed shifting the $580 million deal from half stock and half cash to all stock. The Bakers, with their high-priced investment bankers M.I.A., agreed.Later, after L.& H. collapsed, Mr. Wayner testified that the bank “did not form a point of view” as to whether an all-stock deal would be risky or advisable for the Bakers. He said he could not remember if it had crossed his mind to warn the Bakers about potential issues with an all-stock deal.Two weeks after the initial agreement was reached, Mr. Wayner told Ms. Baker that he would be leaving the next day for another vacation. He would not participate in a conference call with L.& H.’s accounting firm, KPMG, that was set up to discuss any open questions about accounting and due diligence. Mr. Berzofsky of Goldman did participate but later acknowledged that he did not raise any concerns. The Bakers say they believed that all issues had been addressed.Mr. Wayner was still on vacation on March 27, when Dragon’s board met to take a final vote on the proposed acquisition. This time, Mr. Fine and Mr. Smith of Goldman attended the meeting, and Mr. Wayner called in from Argentina. No one from Goldman gave a presentation, but minutes from the meeting, taken by Dragon’s outside lawyers, indicate that the Goldman bankers expressed confidence that the combination of Dragon and L.& H. would produce a market leader. The board voted unanimously to accept the $580 million all-stock deal.Years later, Mr. Wayner testified that lingering issues of due diligence had never been resolved to his satisfaction. He was asked if he had said as much that March day on the phone from his vacation.The deal closed on June 7. By Aug. 8, the merged companies were in crisis amid reports that L.& H. had cooked its books. Reporters for The Wall Street Journal did something the Goldman Four did not: they picked up the phone and called L.& H.’s supposed customers in Asia. They found that companies in South Korea and elsewhere that L.& H. had claimed were its customers weren’t doing any business with it at all. L.& H. had pulled sales figures out of thin air.Although the Goldman Four never tried to call those customers, it emerged during litigation that other bankers at Goldman had done precisely that — about two years earlier, when Goldman itself considered investing in L.& H. in a plan known internally as Project Sermon. In it, Goldman’s merchant banking division took a closer look at L.& H. — but, apparently, never shared what it knew, and was never asked. Goldman was considering putting $30 million into L.& H., a step that, at the time, might have seemed conceivable, given the hype surrounding L.& H.“Whenever we invest, we always want to talk to customers,” Luca Velussi, a Goldman analyst who worked on Project Sermon, later testified. Based on what Project Sermon’s team leader, Ramez Sousou, termed “preliminary” due diligence, Goldman declined to invest in L.& H.By Nov. 29, L.& H. had plunged into bankruptcy. Indictments and convictions followed. L.& H.’s stock price sank to zero — and the Bakers lost everything.Dragon Systems, the Bakers’ “third child,” was put up for sale at a bankruptcy auction. Visteon acquired some of Dragon’s technology. ScanSoft bought the bulk of it and went on to become a $7 billion giant, with a licensing deal with Apple. (The Bakers believe that some of their technology made its way into Siri.) ScanSoft later acquired — and assumed the name of — Nuance, another voice technology company.Indeed, Nuance had gone public about the same time L.& H. bought Dragon, and Goldman handled the initial offering — a fact that still angers the Bakers. They say they had no idea Goldman was simultaneously representing their company and a rival.It wasn’t until after the bankruptcy auction, the Bakers now say, that the full force of what had happened hit them. The money was one thing. But what they really wanted was the opportunity to complete the work they had started decades earlier. As part of the deal with L.& H., they had expected to continue their research. Once L.& H. collapsed, they had held out hope that they might get their technology back — either through litigation or through the bankruptcy auction. They now knew that it wasn’t going to happen.“The door is closed,” Mr. Baker remembers thinking. “Not only do we not have the technology any more, but we have no chance of getting it back.”THE Bakers’ case against Goldman is simple. Their lawyer, Alan K. Cotler of Philadelphia, captured it in a single sentence in a motion for summary judgment: “The Goldman Four were unsupervised, inexperienced, incompetent and lazy investment bankers who were put on a transaction that in the scheme of things was small potatoes for Goldman.”Summarizing Goldman’s defense is more complicated. Based on the firm’s response to the complaint, its motion for summary judgment and testimony of the people it employed, most of that defense falls under one of three rubrics: The Bakers do not have standing to sue. Goldman had no obligation to do a financial analysis of L.& H. And Goldman’s bankers actually performed quite well. The firm released a statement that asserted, “Goldman Sachs was retained as a financial adviser by Dragon Systems, not its shareholders, and performed its assignment satisfactorily in all respects.”Goldman’s lawyer, John D. Donovan of Ropes & Gray in Boston, has argued that under the terms of the engagement letter, only Dragon Systems had the right to sue, and Dragon no longer exists. Goldman has even filed a countersuit against Ms. Baker, contending that by suing Goldman she had breached the contract. Even though Ms. Baker lost everything in a deal Goldman orchestrated, the firm says Ms. Baker should now pay its legal fees.To support the argument that Goldman was not obligated to perform due diligence, the firm points to that mystery memo of Feb. 29, 2000 — the memo that no one at Goldman has acknowledged sending — as establishing that Dragon Systems needed to push its accounting firm to explain any red flags or resolve outstanding worries.Goldman’s lawyers have argued in a motion that while Goldman “strongly urged” Dragon to engage an international accounting firm to do a “forensic accounting analysis on L.& H.,” Ms. Baker “prevented” Dragon from following Goldman’s advice because she did not want to incur the expense of the due diligence and did not want to delay the transaction. The Bakers call this argument “complete fiction,” and even the Goldman Four seem dubious. They testified that Ms. Baker did nothing to block the performance of due diligence.Goldman also hired an independent investment banker, Ian Fisher, who filed an expert report arguing that Goldman was not obligated to conduct due diligence because Dragon did not order what is known as a fairness opinion, an analysis of the acquisition price.The Bakers have hired their own expert, Donna Hitscherich, a former investment banker with JPMorgan Chase who lectures at Columbia Business School. She wrote in her expert report that Goldman was obligated to perform due diligence with or without a fairness opinion.If the case goes to trial in Boston, as scheduled, on Nov. 6, the final argument that Goldman can be expected to make is that the bankers, as Mr. Wayner testified, gave the Bakers “great advice.”Mr. Berzofsky, too, testified in his deposition that the Goldman Four did a “great job.”Even though Dragon lost everything?“Yes,” Mr. Berzofsky said. He was given several opportunities to clarify. And then he was asked one more time — the fact that the Bakers and Dragon’s shareholders lost everything doesn’t affect your opinion?'"

He also used to be “a Pepper.” Mr. Kloster and his family own Dublin Bottling Works, the soft-drink company that was known as Dublin Dr Pepper until Jan. 11.That was the day the Klosters agreed to sell their rights to the Plano-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group, which had filed a lawsuit claiming the small bottler had violated its licensing agreement by selling beyond its distribution territory and using an unauthorized logo. The settlement ended both a 120-year relationship and Dublin’s run as the state’s iconic — and, for several decades, only — bottler of Dr Pepper made with real cane sugar.The news devastated Dr Pepper fans. Calls for a Dr Pepper boycott went out over social media. But six months later, the company lives on. On June 9, Dublin Bottling Works began bottling and selling its own line of fountain drinks — including Vintage Cola, Tart and Sweet Lemonade, Retro-Grape and several others. All, of course, are sweetened with Imperial cane sugar, which Dublin employees still lug off pallets, one 50-pound bag at a time.“Instead of folding up the tent we said, ‘No, we’re going to keep doing what we do,’” Mr. Kloster said on a blazing July day as he hauled cases of soda and “bag in box” syrup into the bed of his Toyota Tundra from an Austin storage space he calls “the South Texas office of Dublin Bottling Works.”Mr. Kloster, who lives in Austin and spends two days a week in Dublin, is like many restaurant, boutique or other retail shop owners who chucked an old life (he had practiced law since 1992) for something different and more fun.

"'12-07-15,'0','Since November, at least 34 people in the United States alone have been killed by avalanches, and three of the four worst years for fatalities since 1950 have occurred since 2007, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center.“The extremes are becoming more extreme,” said Tucker Chenoweth, a mountaineering ranger at Denali National Park and Preserve. Mr. Chenoweth trains search and rescue teams on McKinley from the ranger station here in Talkeetna, which oversees the mountain and its expeditions about 60 miles from base camp.In a strange way, Mr. Chenoweth and other experts said, wild places like McKinley are getting wilder, or at least harder to predict.Sharper seasonal variations of ice and snow and temperature are being repeated all across the world from the Himalayas to the Andes, which scientists say are driven by a higher level of energy in the atmosphere from global warming. As a result, climbers have to think twice about what they might expect one year to the next, or even one day to the next, in places they might have climbed for decades.On McKinley, the snows this year have been prodigious, and the four avalanche deaths have tied a record last seen in 1987. And conditions have varied widely. This month, a weather station on the mountain recorded a temperature range from 21 degrees above zero to 13 below over two days, with 21 inches of snow falling in the middle, rare for July.“The chances of having an average year are very likely going down as climate variability increases,” said Brian Lazar, the executive director of the American Institute for Avalanche Research and Education and a senior scientist at Stratus Consulting, an environmental research company.Going to the Peruvian Andes in June? By most historical predictors and local memory, it should be dry. “Now it might be, or it might not,” Mr. Lazar said.Compounding the consequences of that shift is that the biggest changes on the mountain in general are happening not in upper reaches, where the risks and challenges are often greatest from altitude and fatigue, but lower down, where wider temperature swings are creating new stresses on glacial ice and rock.That is especially true here at McKinley, which is laced by glaciers. And while avalanches are a concern everywhere on the mountain, the four Japanese climbers — two men and two women — were killed far below the areas where slopes are steeper and avalanches often have the worst consequences.Last year, an ice fall — essentially an avalanche, but made of giant ice blocks rather than snow — surged down the mountain, producing an air blast ahead of it that blew four climbers out of their tents and killed one of them.Venturing into high and wild places has always carried its dangers, of course. Mountain weather, as even a casual day hiker in the Rockies or the Appalachians knows, is invariably capricious. And as climbers often say, even years of experience are only as good as the next life-or-death decision to be made.Michael J. Ybarra, a veteran climber and adventure writer, died in a fall while free-climbing in Yosemite National Park this month, and a ranger on Mount Rainier in Washington fell thousands of feet to his death during a rescue in June. In both cases, apparently, a slipped handhold or moment of lost footing was all it took.But veteran climbers say today’s conditions are combining to create a volatile highball of risk.“In the past, people saw mountains like McKinley as the apex of their climbing careers, something they built toward for years,” said Brian Okonek, considered the local dean of McKinley climbers, with 20 trips to the summit. “Now they want everything faster, they want to go for the bigger mountains sooner than they used to.”Colby Coombs, a co-owner of the Alaska Mountaineering School, said he regularly sees people showing up to buy equipment for expeditions who do not have a clue what they are going to face or what equipment they might need.“They underestimate the severity of the environment and overestimate their own ability,” he said. Many, he said, are particularly unprepared for the brutal cold that can occur even in July this far north, or the sudden storms that can blow in from the Arctic, driving the windchill factor well below zero.So far this year, only 43 percent of climbers have reached McKinley’s summit, compared with the long-term average of 52 percent.Some longtime McKinley watchers say changes in the easiest and shortest route — the West Buttress, taken by more than 80 percent of expeditions going up — could ultimately lead to a crisis if trends continue lower down the mountain.Ice chunks breaking off at a place on the Buttress called Windy Corner, they say, are gradually exposing a sharply steeper and potentially impassable face. The alternative route would require many more miles and days on the mountain, and might add new hazards as well, including a crossing of the McKinley River.Mr. Roche, 34, a college academic counselor from Wisconsin, said he was not sure whether he would return here someday. But he said he was acutely conscious, both in going up and coming back down, that he was walking in the footsteps of the climbers who died last month.But he arrived back home on Friday with what he said was a nugget of wisdom, even if the summit was beyond reach. His 2-year-old son, Gus, shouted joyfully in the background as he spoke on the phone.'"
"'12-07-15,'0','This, of course, was before the scandals of the subprime mortgage era. It was before the bailouts, before Occupy Wall Street, before ordinary Americans began complaining about “banksters” and “muppets” and “the vampire squid.” In short, before Goldman Sachs became, for many, synonymous with Wall Street greed.And yet, even today what happened next to the Bakers seems remarkable. With Goldman Sachs on the job, the corporate takeover of Dragon Systems in an all-stock deal went terribly wrong. Goldman collected millions of dollars in fees — and the Bakers lost everything when Lernout & Hauspie was revealed to be a spectacular fraud. L.& H. had been founded by Jo Lernout and Pol Hauspie, who had once been hailed as stars of the 1990s tech boom. Only later did the Bakers learn that Goldman Sachs itself had at one point considered investing in L.& H. but had walked away after some digging into the company.This being Wall Street, a lot of money is now at stake. In federal court in Boston, the Bakers are demanding damages, including interest and legal fees, that could top $1 billion. That figure is nearly twice what Goldman paid to settle claims that it misled investors about subprime mortgage investments before the financial crisis of 2008.This account is based on a trove of legal filings — e-mails, motions and roughly 30 depositions, more than 8,000 pages of sworn testimony in all — that open a rare window on Goldman Sachs and the mystique that surrounds it.JAMES AND JANET BAKER, now in their 60s, are computer speech revolutionaries. Both Ph.D.’s, they became interested in voice-recognition technology in the 1970s, back when a personal assistant like Apple’s Siri would have seemed more science fiction than scientific fact.They are widely credited with advancing speech technology far faster than anyone thought possible, primarily because of an epiphany Mr. Baker had while doing his doctorate research. He figured out that speech recognition could, in essence, be reduced to math. You didn’t have to teach a computer to recognize accents or dialects, Mr. Baker realized — you just had to calculate the mathematical probability of one sound following another. His algorithms proved remarkably accurate and eventually became the industry standard. (Want to know more? Ask Siri.)The Bakers founded Dragon Systems in 1982 in an old Victorian house in West Newton, Mass. At that time, despite having two school-age children and a big mortgage, they were determined to take no venture capital and to finance the company’s growth with its own revenue — once they had a product. They figured they could last 18 months, maybe 24.Their first product was a software program for a British-made PC called the Apricot that let users open files and run programs by voice command. Then came DragonDictate, a groundbreaking speech-to-text system for dictation that still required the speaker to pause. Between. Every. Word.For years, the Bakers pressed on, convinced that they were on track to create a program that would recognize continuous speech.To do that, however, they eventually decided that they needed more capital. While Mr. Baker worked on the technology, Ms. Baker brokered a deal with Seagate Technology, the disk drive manufacturer. Seagate bought 25 percent of Dragon for $20 million. Then, in 1997, Dragon introduced Dragon NaturallySpeaking, a program that recognized more words than could be found in a standard collegiate dictionary. It was available in six languages and could handle normal speech, even sentences with words that sound alike, such as, “Please write a letter right now to Mrs. Wright. Tell her that two is too many to buy.”By this time, I.B.M. and others had piled into the voice technology market, too. As the Nasdaq market raced toward record highs, the Bakers considered taking Dragon public. But in 1999, several companies — including Sony and Intel — expressed interest in buying into Dragon. Finally, unsolicited buyout offers began to arrive. One came from Visteon, a subsidiary of Ford Motor. Another arrived from Lernout & Hauspie.TO the uninitiated, the mystique of Goldman Sachs may be hard to fathom. Known for what might politely be called ruthless professionalism, Goldman, the thinking goes, is smarter and more plugged in than just about any other investment bank. In the late 1990s, under Henry M. Paulson Jr., who later became the Treasury secretary and orchestrated the Wall Street bailouts, Goldman was the alpha dog in the lucrative game of mergers and acquisitions.So it was that in December 1999, the Bakers, in over their heads when it came to M.& A., signed a five-page engagement letter drafted by Goldman. In it, Goldman pledged to provide “financial advice and assistance in connection with this potential transaction, which may include performing valuation analyses, searching for a purchaser acceptable to you, coordinating visits of potential purchasers, and assisting you in negotiating the financial aspects of the transaction.”To the Dragon deal, Goldman assigned four bankers, two in their 20s and one in his early 30s. That wasn’t unusual. Although Dragon Systems was worth everything to the Bakers, the company — with $70 million in revenue and 400 employees — was small beer on Wall Street. Dragon agreed to pay Goldman a flat fee of $5 million, less than some Goldman bankers were pulling down.But who, if anyone, supervised these bankers — later called “the Goldman Four” in court documents — remains something of a mystery. One of the four, the most senior, testified later that their supervisor was Gene T. Sykes, a Goldman partner who at the time specialized in technology and who this year was promoted to head of M.& A. at the firm, one of the most powerful jobs on Wall Street. In a deposition, Mr. Sykes disavowed any involvement.Most of the Goldman Four didn’t stay long at the bank. Richard Wayner, who was 32 when the Dragon deal was cut, struck out on his own in 2002 and eventually landed at the Keffi Group, an investment firm. T. Otey Smith, then 21, left Goldman in 2000 and now works for RLJ Equity Partners. Alexander Berzofsky, then 25, left Goldman at about the same time and is now a managing director at Warburg Pincus, the big private investment company. Chris Fine, then 42, was a Goldman information technology specialist who was enlisted on the deal and is still with Goldman. (None of the four agreed to be interviewed for this article.)Before the engagement letter was signed in late 1999, Goldman sent Dragon a memo indicating that its first steps would include beginning to conduct due diligence — Wall Street-speak for kicking the tires — on L.& H. The memo included specific areas of concern, including L.& H.’s sources of revenue, its major customers, its license agreements and royalty agreements, its expected growth, its partnerships and its financial statements.THAT December, Mr. Wayner of Goldman accompanied Ms. Baker and Dragon’s chief financial officer, Ellen Chamberlain, on a trip to Belgium to meet L.& H. executives. For the trip, another of the Goldman Four, Mr. Berzofsky, prepared a list of due diligence questions. Goldman also prepared a “merger analysis” that predicted the companies’ combined sales per share, earnings per share and total debt under three acquisition scenarios: all cash, all stock and half and half.In its initial offer, L.& H. proposed paying $580 million, half in cash and half in stock. But the Bakers weren’t sure. News reports had questioned L.& H.’s revenue, particularly in fast-growing Asian markets, as well as some of the company’s licensing deals. Mr. Baker felt that L.& H. had inferior voice technology. But then, he reasoned, if L.& H. could generate so much revenue with lesser technology, imagine what it could do with Dragon.By mid-February 2000, Ms. Chamberlain had sent an angry memo to Goldman. It urged the bank to move faster in its analysis of L.& H. Talks with the other companies had gone nowhere, and she expected Goldman to “drive” the due diligence process. Mr. Wayner testified later that the bank’s reaction to that memo was “to do as our client asked and to revisit all of our analyses.”But on Feb. 29, Dragon received an odd memo from Goldman. It wasn’t addressed to anyone in particular at Dragon, and it wasn’t signed by anyone at Goldman. The Goldman Four testified later that they had no idea who had sent it. But the memo referred to many of the same due diligence issues that Ms. Chamberlain raised. The memo asserted, however, that Dragon’s accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, should do the work, not Goldman.The memo shocked Ms. Chamberlain. She had come to Dragon from Seagate, where she had participated in similar deals. She believed that this sort of thing was generally done by investment bankers, not by accountants. But the moment passed. No one at Dragon or Goldman brought up the mystery memo again — at least not until the lawsuits began flying. (The Bakers also filed suit against other participants in the transaction.)THE Dragon executives thought that Goldman was taking a hard look at L.& H. After all, Dragon was paying Goldman $5 million for its advice. If Goldman wasn’t conducting due diligence, what was it doing?“They put items on and off the due diligence list,” Ms. Baker later testified. “We discussed the issues at — at basically every meeting that we were at, and we were meeting often in person or by phone, typically, several times a week in this time frame — sometimes multiple times a day, as we’ve seen. And so they knew what everybody was doing. And they were, they were directing it.”One of the tasks was a conference call that Mr. Wayner arranged, at Ms. Baker’s request, between Dragon and Charles Elliott, a Goldman analyst in London. Dragon was wondering why L.& H.’s share price had been gyrating wildly. Mr. Wayner told Ms. Baker, he later testified, that Mr. Elliott was following L.& H.’s stock and was up to date on its fluctuations. And Mr. Elliott assured Ms. Baker that investors were worried about the market in general, rather than L.& H. in particular. He also said he expected the stock price of the combined companies to rise substantially once a merger was struck.Years later, in his deposition, Mr. Elliott told a more complete story. He acknowledged that he actually had not been following L.& H.; that had been the responsibility of another Goldman analyst who had left the firm shortly after the Bakers retained Goldman. After the other analyst left, Mr. Elliott testified, Goldman terminated its coverage of L.& H. No one told the Bakers that Goldman was no longer covering the company they were about to bet their futures on.Mr. Elliott also testified that he was unaware of press reports at the time that suggested L.& H. was claiming huge revenue gains in Asia. If he had been aware, he said, he would have been “very skeptical” of those gains, given the challenges that Asian languages present for speech recognition. He also acknowledged that it would not have been difficult for him to call up L.& H.’s customers and check the revenue claims.As the Nasdaq composite index raced toward a record high that March, Dragon’s executives made fateful decisions. On March 8, the Bakers met with L.& H. executives and that company’s advisers from SG Cowen to try to reach a definitive agreement.A few days before that meeting, Mr. Wayner of Goldman told Ms. Baker that he would be away on vacation and couldn’t make the session. He also said that he would be unable to call in and that it was pointless to send anybody else from Goldman because there wasn’t time to catch up on the deal. It was at this meeting that L.& H. proposed shifting the $580 million deal from half stock and half cash to all stock. The Bakers, with their high-priced investment bankers M.I.A., agreed.Later, after L.& H. collapsed, Mr. Wayner testified that the bank “did not form a point of view” as to whether an all-stock deal would be risky or advisable for the Bakers. He said he could not remember if it had crossed his mind to warn the Bakers about potential issues with an all-stock deal.Two weeks after the initial agreement was reached, Mr. Wayner told Ms. Baker that he would be leaving the next day for another vacation. He would not participate in a conference call with L.& H.’s accounting firm, KPMG, that was set up to discuss any open questions about accounting and due diligence. Mr. Berzofsky of Goldman did participate but later acknowledged that he did not raise any concerns. The Bakers say they believed that all issues had been addressed.Mr. Wayner was still on vacation on March 27, when Dragon’s board met to take a final vote on the proposed acquisition. This time, Mr. Fine and Mr. Smith of Goldman attended the meeting, and Mr. Wayner called in from Argentina. No one from Goldman gave a presentation, but minutes from the meeting, taken by Dragon’s outside lawyers, indicate that the Goldman bankers expressed confidence that the combination of Dragon and L.& H. would produce a market leader. The board voted unanimously to accept the $580 million all-stock deal.Years later, Mr. Wayner testified that lingering issues of due diligence had never been resolved to his satisfaction. He was asked if he had said as much that March day on the phone from his vacation.The deal closed on June 7. By Aug. 8, the merged companies were in crisis amid reports that L.& H. had cooked its books. Reporters for The Wall Street Journal did something the Goldman Four did not: they picked up the phone and called L.& H.’s supposed customers in Asia. They found that companies in South Korea and elsewhere that L.& H. had claimed were its customers weren’t doing any business with it at all. L.& H. had pulled sales figures out of thin air.Although the Goldman Four never tried to call those customers, it emerged during litigation that other bankers at Goldman had done precisely that — about two years earlier, when Goldman itself considered investing in L.& H. in a plan known internally as Project Sermon. In it, Goldman’s merchant banking division took a closer look at L.& H. — but, apparently, never shared what it knew, and was never asked. Goldman was considering putting $30 million into L.& H., a step that, at the time, might have seemed conceivable, given the hype surrounding L.& H.“Whenever we invest, we always want to talk to customers,” Luca Velussi, a Goldman analyst who worked on Project Sermon, later testified. Based on what Project Sermon’s team leader, Ramez Sousou, termed “preliminary” due diligence, Goldman declined to invest in L.& H.By Nov. 29, L.& H. had plunged into bankruptcy. Indictments and convictions followed. L.& H.’s stock price sank to zero — and the Bakers lost everything.Dragon Systems, the Bakers’ “third child,” was put up for sale at a bankruptcy auction. Visteon acquired some of Dragon’s technology. ScanSoft bought the bulk of it and went on to become a $7 billion giant, with a licensing deal with Apple. (The Bakers believe that some of their technology made its way into Siri.) ScanSoft later acquired — and assumed the name of — Nuance, another voice technology company.Indeed, Nuance had gone public about the same time L.& H. bought Dragon, and Goldman handled the initial offering — a fact that still angers the Bakers. They say they had no idea Goldman was simultaneously representing their company and a rival.It wasn’t until after the bankruptcy auction, the Bakers now say, that the full force of what had happened hit them. The money was one thing. But what they really wanted was the opportunity to complete the work they had started decades earlier. As part of the deal with L.& H., they had expected to continue their research. Once L.& H. collapsed, they had held out hope that they might get their technology back — either through litigation or through the bankruptcy auction. They now knew that it wasn’t going to happen.“The door is closed,” Mr. Baker remembers thinking. “Not only do we not have the technology any more, but we have no chance of getting it back.”THE Bakers’ case against Goldman is simple. Their lawyer, Alan K. Cotler of Philadelphia, captured it in a single sentence in a motion for summary judgment: “The Goldman Four were unsupervised, inexperienced, incompetent and lazy investment bankers who were put on a transaction that in the scheme of things was small potatoes for Goldman.”Summarizing Goldman’s defense is more complicated. Based on the firm’s response to the complaint, its motion for summary judgment and testimony of the people it employed, most of that defense falls under one of three rubrics: The Bakers do not have standing to sue. Goldman had no obligation to do a financial analysis of L.& H. And Goldman’s bankers actually performed quite well. The firm released a statement that asserted, “Goldman Sachs was retained as a financial adviser by Dragon Systems, not its shareholders, and performed its assignment satisfactorily in all respects.”Goldman’s lawyer, John D. Donovan of Ropes & Gray in Boston, has argued that under the terms of the engagement letter, only Dragon Systems had the right to sue, and Dragon no longer exists. Goldman has even filed a countersuit against Ms. Baker, contending that by suing Goldman she had breached the contract. Even though Ms. Baker lost everything in a deal Goldman orchestrated, the firm says Ms. Baker should now pay its legal fees.To support the argument that Goldman was not obligated to perform due diligence, the firm points to that mystery memo of Feb. 29, 2000 — the memo that no one at Goldman has acknowledged sending — as establishing that Dragon Systems needed to push its accounting firm to explain any red flags or resolve outstanding worries.Goldman’s lawyers have argued in a motion that while Goldman “strongly urged” Dragon to engage an international accounting firm to do a “forensic accounting analysis on L.& H.,” Ms. Baker “prevented” Dragon from following Goldman’s advice because she did not want to incur the expense of the due diligence and did not want to delay the transaction. The Bakers call this argument “complete fiction,” and even the Goldman Four seem dubious. They testified that Ms. Baker did nothing to block the performance of due diligence.Goldman also hired an independent investment banker, Ian Fisher, who filed an expert report arguing that Goldman was not obligated to conduct due diligence because Dragon did not order what is known as a fairness opinion, an analysis of the acquisition price.The Bakers have hired their own expert, Donna Hitscherich, a former investment banker with JPMorgan Chase who lectures at Columbia Business School. She wrote in her expert report that Goldman was obligated to perform due diligence with or without a fairness opinion.If the case goes to trial in Boston, as scheduled, on Nov. 6, the final argument that Goldman can be expected to make is that the bankers, as Mr. Wayner testified, gave the Bakers “great advice.”Mr. Berzofsky, too, testified in his deposition that the Goldman Four did a “great job.”Even though Dragon lost everything?“Yes,” Mr. Berzofsky said. He was given several opportunities to clarify. And then he was asked one more time — the fact that the Bakers and Dragon’s shareholders lost everything doesn’t affect your opinion?'"
"'12-07-15,'0','Each is experienced on links courses; Westwood has played in 17 Opens, Donald 11 and Rose 10. But their Open records are spotty.Westwood missed the 36-hole cut last year at Royal St. George’s when Darren Clarke won, but he was second to Louis Oosthuizen at St. Andrews in 2010 and tied for third at Turnberry in 2009, when 59-year-old Tom Watson nearly won. Donald missed the cut last year but tied for fifth in 2009. Rose has never had a top-10 finish in the event after tying for fourth as an amateur in 1998.As the captain of European Ryder Cup teams that defeated the Americans in 1985 and 1987 and retained the Cup with a tie in 1989, Jacklin, who also won the 1970 United States Open at Hazeltine near Minneapolis, has closely followed the careers of Westwood, Donald and Rose.“Luke doesn’t seem to excel on links courses,” Jacklin, now a longtime course architect in Bradenton, Fla., said in a telephone interview. “His best game is from 100 yards in. On the bumpy links course that the Open is always played on, whether in England or Scotland, those shots are not as predictable as they are on the manicured U.S. courses.”“Westwood seems to have the best chance,” Jacklin added. “He can flat play, and he wants it very badly. He’s such an accomplished player, but he seems to get in his own way a little bit on the last nine holes in the majors. He doesn’t always trust his instincts; he’s always crossing the t’s and dotting the i’s. He’s missed critical putts. He’s trying harder than he needs to.”As for Rose, Jacklin liked that he had won four times on the PGA Tour; Donald has won five times, Westwood only twice. Worldwide, Westwood has 38 victories, and Donald and Rose each have 12.“Rose is an accomplished player now,” Jacklin said. “He has a great swing, he controls his golf ball very well, and he’s won in America. That’s important. I know when I came back to England in 1969 after having won at Jacksonville on the PGA Tour the year before, it gave me a lift.”Two other English golfers are in the top 50 of the world ranking: Ian Poulter at No. 27 and Simon Dyson at No. 49.“Poulter is made of the right stuff,” Jacklin said. “We’ve seen that in the Ryder Cup; he relishes the challenge. I’m not sure that Dyson has dealt with the pressure that will be there; he’s never won in America. But all the prominent English golfers will feel an upsurgence of support from the fans there. If you’re playing well, they can lift you. If not, it can work in reverse.”Faldo would attest to that. In his early years at the Open, the British tabloid headlines often referred to him as Foldo, but he soon ascended.After winning at Muirfield in 1987, he finished third at Lytham in 1988, when Seve Ballesteros won. He won at St. Andrews in 1990 and at Muirfield in 1992, then was second to Greg Norman at Royal St. George’s in 1993. In between, he won the Masters in 1989 and 1990, then won it again in 1996 when he overtook Norman, with a 67 to a 78, in a memorable final round.But even as one of history’s best English golfers, Faldo never completed the English Slam that now challenges Donald, Westwood and Rose. And maybe Poulter and Dyson.'"
"'12-07-15,'0','“We wanted some iconic venues and thought it would be cool to hit the baseball stadiums,” said Charlie Stillitano, an executive at CAA Sports. “For us, it’s good business because the fun part of seeing a different game on a baseball ground is unique. It’s a great environment and a new perspective.”The Liverpool-Fenway connection is natural. Two years ago, the owners of the Boston Red Sox acquired Liverpool, which has not been to the United States since 2004. (Roma’s owner is a partner in that ownership group.) Fenway experienced soccer success two years ago when a match between Celtic and Sporting Lisbon drew nearly 33,000 fans.“Fenway is a pretty good venue for soccer,” said Billy Hogan, Liverpool’s chief commercial officer. “It’s intimate and it’s got great sightlines.” With joint ownership of the club and the ballpark, Hogan added, “Fenway had a leg up because we’re not paying a fee to rent it and we control the operations.”Staging soccer games at baseball stadiums while a home team is on the road, or at football stadiums during the off-season, is an obvious way for teams to add revenue. Yankees executives look at their matches — for which the stadium will be rescaled to a capacity of up to 40,000 — and see a profitable formula, as they do for concerts and college football games like the Pinstripe Bowl.“It used to be that there were only two or three big international stars that everybody knew,” Holtzman said. “But today, there are probably 50 who mean something here.”Foreign teams have played friendlies in North America for years. But more games than in recent memory will be played this year because of the foreign clubs’ increasing desire to market to their expanding fan bases, the rising popularity of England’s Premier League games that are televised into American homes and the higher level of play by M.L.S. teams.“The goal is to let our global fans see the team in person,” Hogan said, adding of Liverpool’s home stadium, “Not everyone can get to Anfield.”Teams often receive a fee ranging from $150,000 to $2 million to play outside their home cities and countries. But Ron Gourlay, Chelsea’s chief executive, insisted the club was “not on a cash mission.”Chelsea, which won the European Champions League title in May, is using its tour as a training camp, as are the other foreign teams, and to further build its grass-roots soccer program in the United States.“We have a long-term plan,” Gourlay said. “It’s not just to play and get out.”Chelsea will start in Seattle with a game against the Sounders, then head to Yankee Stadium to play Paris St. Germain, then to PPL Park, home of M.L.S.’s Philadelphia Union, to play the M.L.S. All-Stars, and finally to Miami Gardens, Fla., to finish the tour against A.C. Milan at Sun Life Stadium.“It’s a great opportunity to prepare for the season,” Gourlay said. “The facilities and hospitality are second to none. We’ve got top-tier awareness and can continue to raise our team’s brand awareness.”Hogan said that Liverpool could prepare at home, but that traveling abroad had its benefits.“The tour gives the team chances to bond,” he said, adding, “Logistically, it might be easier to train at home, but with the fan bases we can reach, we want to train abroad.”The amount of planning by teams now is far different than years ago, M.L.S. Commissioner Don Garber said.“They used to come here without any strategy or a mind to an effective schedule, corporate sponsorship or broadcast plan,” he said. “So it made sense to us about three years ago to create a more focused and centralized international game schedule.”Garber said that it was not a problem if the international teams played each other on their summer tours. But a game against an M.L.S. team can have a clear effect.When Manchester United played Sporting Kansas City two years ago at Arrowhead Stadium, the match drew 52,342 fans, which in turn helped sell season tickets for the next season at the M.L.S. club’s new home, Livestrong Sporting Park.“Our view is not to be threatened by the growth of international soccer, but to embrace it,” Garber said.One international team that has declined to train in North America is Arsenal. The club’s largest investor is Stan Kroenke, the owner of the M.L.S. Colorado Rapids, as well as the St. Louis Rams, the Denver Nuggets and the Colorado Avalanche. Its chief executive is Ivan Gazidis, a former deputy commissioner of M.L.S.The naysayer has been Arsène Wenger, the Arsenal coach, who prefers to play in Austria and in Asia. Perhaps he does not know he can take his Gunners to Fenway Park.'"

They have taken an oath to uphold the law. They have chosen to be placed into a higher level of scrutiny than you or I. And that is what makes these officers in Atlanta (if it is true) truly disgusting.They have taken that oath and tarnished it with their lies. Even if it takes a common criminal with a checkered past to bring them to justice, so be it.Like “The Wire,” but real. ...Sad story about the intersection of #poverty, #racism and #crooked cops in #atlanta.LAST TOUR OF THE ROCK-STAR DIPLOMATWe don’t know what Hillary Clinton could really have accomplished if she had her way, because as Myers is forced to point out, she has subordinated her own views to those of the president despite differences on keeping a strong American presence in Afghanistan and Iraq, the need to resist Putin and to promote human rights. In each case, Clinton’s instincts seem to have been on the right side of the issue, but as a dutiful servant of the president, she wound up being the public face of bad policies.I’m tired of this meme, oft-repeated in these pages, about Hillary Clinton being “dutiful” and “a Girl Scout.” Being a committed, honorable public servant willing to work in a collegial way with your rivals should not be characterized as either someone’s loyal hound or as a teenage girl (despite all the respect and admiration I feel for the Girl Scouts as an organization). The people who choose to describe Clinton this way are showing their bias, their entitlement and more than a little poor judgment.Reading John Jeremiah Sullivan on “Absalom, Absalom!” was like revisiting this “greatest Southern novel ever written” after a long hiatus. Faulkner may have broken every rule of creative writing, but he knew what he was doing.I have a bone to pick with John Jeremiah Sullivan over his otherwise splendid treatment of Faulkner’s novel “Absalom, Absalom!”He effectively deep-sixes his entire analysis by dwelling at ridiculous length on what he finds to be a problem, located at the intersection of our tortured racial history and the use of realistic dialogue in novels — the word “nigger,” Faulkner’s use of which forces Sullivan to go all squeamish. I taught “Huckleberry Finn” in a federal prison and found myself wimping out on using a direct quotation from the novel of the offending word in similar fashion.I was saved by the baddest-looking prisoner/student of all, who interrupted my cowardliness by saying, “Don’t worry, Doc; we’ve heard that word before,” to the vast amusement of all.

Yes, most books and movies lose money, but a few hits can pay off spectacularly. And while corporate profits may be relatively small, moviemaking is not very labor intensive (compared with making widgets with tens of thousands of factory employees), so the gains from hits are shared by a select, highly elite group. For those in the club, it’s not a bad business at all. In addition, in my decade covering the business of Hollywood as a journalist, I met many studio “suits” who were in fact passionate cineastes — in some cases on the level of academic experts. People are in the movie business because they love movies. Also sex and fast cars.Not very labor-intensive? Have you ever been anywhere near a film set?

"'12-07-15,'0','The occasional knock on the growing new Nordic culinary trend is that foraging has a tendency to trump flavor, that product provenance sometimes supersedes taste. Gastrologik, an excellent new restaurant in Stockholm, does not suffer from this affliction.Opened in October 2011 on a quiet street corner in the residential Ostermalm district, Gastrologik is the passion project of two young chefs: Jacob Holmstrom, who was an executive chef at the two Michelin-starred Mathias Dahlgren restaurants in Stockholm, and Anton Bjuhr, who specializes in baking and pastry. Together they helm a new Nordic kitchen as exciting as any of their critically lauded, Michelin-starred competition.The restaurant seats only about 30 guests in its two small, spare dining rooms whose design subtly celebrates Scandinavia, from its pendant lamps (made of copper, formerly a major industry in Sweden) to its floors (Danish oak) and even the color of its walls (a hue called “Stockholm white”).The minimalist aesthetic carries over to the menu card, which presents a single option without elaboration: three courses or six? The lack of specificity means that, for guests, the entire meal is a surprise. And though some diners may bristle at the uncertainty, during a six-course dinner in late April, not one course disappointed.The use of indigenous ingredients was immediately apparent in the intriguing pre-appetizer snacks. In one, Swedish angelica was used to make a refreshing ice cream, while another featured foraged lichen deep-fried in sourdough batter.“The food at Gastrologik always starts with the produce,” Mr. Holmstrom told me later. But the best dishes paired the seasonal larder with seafood or meat. Fresh oysters were accompanied by fermented cucumber; gossamer pork fat was draped on a scape of young garlic and was delivered with an exhaustively detailed description (our server identified the garden from which the garlic — about one month old — had been pulled).Taking the pride-of-product theme one step further, Gastrologik also operates a shop next door, called Speceriet, which sells the same high-quality produce and herbs, fresh seafood, rare cuts of meat, homemade breads, Swedish cheeses and hard-to-find products served at the restaurant. (Casual weekday lunches are also served at Speceriet, which shares a kitchen with Gastrologik.) “We wanted to have a place where everybody could find nice produce and also get something to eat,” Mr. Holmstrom said. “And get a piece of Gastrologik as well.”'"
"'12-07-15,'0','Even so, other data suggest that the next 18 months will see a rush of new projects.In fact, in Manhattan below 96th Street over the next few years, about 1,500 new condo units are expected to hit the market each year, says Kelly Kennedy Mack, president of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.In contrast, about 900 units a year were introduced during the downturn, Ms. Mack saidAnd while that extra supply might seem copious, far more would be needed to slake the newfound appetite for this type of housing; the scarcity is even putting upward pressure on prices, she said.Indeed, the current average condo price of $1,400 a square foot is expected to shoot up to $2,000 per square foot once all the planned condos go up, said Ms. Mack, adding, “We are truly entering a new development renaissance.”Living in Midtown Manhattan may not be for everyone, but continued interest from foreign buyers and those looking for pieds-à-terre appears to be firing developers’ enthusiasm.An example is the Baccarat Hotel and Residences New York, a 46-story tower under construction at 20 West 53rd Street, across from the Museum of Modern Art.Co-developed by Starwood Capital Group, the creator of the W hotel chain, and Tribeca Associates, the $400 million tower will have 114 hotel rooms and 64 condos over 45 stories. The condos will range from one- to three-bedrooms, and there will be a duplex penthouse. The units will have 12- to 16-foot ceilings, and some will have terraces, according to Starwood.The building, designed by Skidmore Owings & Merrill, will meet feng shui standards, said Barry Sternlicht, Starwood’s chairman.At the tail end of the boom, a 57-story tower from the Alexico Group was supposed to be built at this address, and developers got as far as the foundation. But the site, at Church Street in TriBeCa, has mostly been quiet since.Behind the scenes, though, there’s been a big push to line up financing for this long-stalled project, which will open a sales office by the end of the year, said Ms. Mack, whose firm is handling the marketing.To make this happen, the circle of partners has broadened to include Hines, the national developer, which joined Dune Capital Management, Goldman Sachs and Alexico, she said. Spreading the risk across a syndicate like this is becoming more common in the post-recession period, analysts say.With 145 one- to five-bedrooms, the tower was designed by Herzog & de Meuron, which also created 40 Bond.Boutique buildings used to dominate Lower Manhattan, Ms. Mack said, but with 56 Leonard, “we will soon see a new product type, on a grander scale, that will be very architecturally driven.”This conversion of the 20-story apartment building at East 61st Street is being undertaken by the developer RFR Holding. Sales began this month. Unlike the jazzy designs of RFR projects like One Jackson Square, with its wavy glass facade, No. 530 seems understated.Its 119 units, studios to four-bedrooms, are priced around $3,200 a square foot, though there was a one-bedroom listed last week, on the ninth floor, at $2.32 million, or $2,800 a foot, according to its Web site. Buyers will begin moving in this fall, according to Aby Rosen, an RFR managing partner, although about 20 pre-conversion renters will stay on.The building, dating to 1941, retains its cream-brick facade. The apartments will have wood floors, glass-fronted kitchen cabinets and crown moldings. Mr. Rosen, a noted collector of contemporary art, will also take a restrained approach in common areas. “Prewar has its own charm,” he said, “so you don’t have to overdo it.”The building is to have a fitness center overlooking a garden with a reflecting pool, which will add a level of modernity not usually associated with the area, he said. “We wanted to create a Second Avenue-type building, in terms of amenities, on Park,” he said.This 65-unit condo has 50 stories overlooking the park; from afar it resembles stacks of glass cubes. It has had a troubled history: IStar Financial, its lender, foreclosed on the original developer, Slazer Enterprises, for missing millions in loan payments, though that process was derailed when other creditors filed for bankruptcy.In April the Related Companies, along with HFZ Capital and Amalgamated Bank, took control of the site after striking a deal with those creditors.Related is renovating the lobby of the building, whose official address is 23 East 22nd Street, and completing construction, even though 12 apartments are sold and some already occupied. The 53 remaining one- to five-bedroom units will most likely hit the market this fall, according to a source close to the project. Prices have not yet been set.What won’t be revived for now is a 22-story condo planned for an adjacent lot. Designed in 2008 by Rem Koolhaas, the cantilevered 21-unit tower has been permanently shelved, according to a source close to the project. No replacement plan for the empty lot has been announced.After years of delays, a former women’s residence with a warren of 200 tiny rooms is being reborn as a spacious 16-unit condo called 18 Gramercy Park — across from the park, natch.Its developers, the brothers Arthur and Will Zeckendorf and Eyal Ofer of Global Holdings, teamed up to build the megasuccessful 15 Central Park West, whose prices soared even through the housing bust.They have once again hired the architect Robert A. M. Stern to design the units, most of which have 4 bedrooms and 18 to 34 windows, many with 6-over-6 sashes. The developer will provide residents with keys to the gated park for Year One, after which they can renew at $350 a year. Four park keys for residents’ use will also be kept by the doorman.Prices, too, may recall the team’s prior project. The average unit will cost $17.5 million, the developers say; that works out to about $4,000 a square foot. Factored into the number, though, is the pricey duplex penthouse, with outdoor pool and hot tub, at $42 million. (The building is costing developers $60 million.)But there seems to be interest. A few contracts have already been signed, said Will Zeckendorf, even though the bulding’s in-house sales office will not open till September.That wait might seem minuscule compared with the delays that dogged the project, including a struggle to find financing when the market went south in 2008. The developers ended up essentially borrowing money from the seller, the Salvation Army, to get the deal done. That’s all in the past now, they say. “The market looks strong from my vantage point,” Will Zeckendorf said. And “there’s only one Gramercy Park,” Arthur Zeckendorf added, finishing the thought.If this project under construction near Fulton Street in Downtown Brooklyn is any indication, developers are thinking bigger this time around. At 594 feet, or 53 stories, the glassy skyscraper from the Stahl Organization will be Brooklyn’s tallest residential building when it opens in 2014.Not all of its 378 units will be condos; hedging its bets, Stahl will also offer 234 rentals, on Floors 7 through 31. The 144 condos will enjoy the best seats in the house, on Floors 32 through 53.“This is a good way to handle the market,” said Gregg Wolpert, a co-president of Stahl, the developer of the Laureate, the Upper West Side condo whose penthouse went for $3,000 a square foot.Prices have not yet been determined for Bridge Street, Mr. Wolpert said, but he does not expect it to be nearly as expensive. “We will not be selling $15 million apartments,” he said.Reflecting a new reality about how these kinds of projects get financed, Stahl is kicking in $120 million of its own equity for the $265 million project, or about 45 percent, which is a huge change from the boom years. “The days of putting up 5 or 10 percent are gone,” Mr. Wolpert said.One of Park Avenue’s few rental buildings, a 21-story red-brick prewar with 103 units, is being converted to condos by Harry Macklowe, a developer who lost much of his Manhattan portfolio during the recession but seems to be in the midst of a comeback.Work has begun on the low-ceilinged, marble-walled lobby, and is to move on to the market-rate apartments, of which there are about 60, or about two-thirds of the building. The other third, which are rent-regulated, will most likely keep their tenants, a source close to the project said. Other details, like whether any of the units will be combined, were not available, even though an offering plan was filed with the state last summer.The project’s lender, the CIM Group, a real estate investment group based in Los Angeles, declined to comment, as did Mr. Macklowe.Perhaps nothing embodies the renewed interest in large-scale condo projects in quite the same way as 432 Park Avenue, the home of the former Drake Hotel.Mr. Macklowe bought the hotel for $418 million in 2006 and tore it down a year later, with the intention of building a condo. Then he lost the site (along with much else) in the recession.Now, like a phoenix, a condo plan has resurfaced, and so has Mr. Macklowe, though he has partnered this go-around with the CIM Group, which took control of the site in 2010. The plan, according to a source close to the project, is to erect a condo tower 1,398 feet tall, which would easily make it the city’s tallest apartment building. (One57, which will be the tallest until 432 Park opens, clocks in at 1,004 feet.)Designed by Rafael Viñoly, 432 Park will probably have 128 units of one to three bedrooms, according to a source close to the project, though the submitted offering plan has not yet been approved. The L-shaped site, which touches East 56th and East 57th Streets, will also have space for 16 retail stores, according to public documents.It was one of the most eagerly anticipated high-rises of the last decade, even though the Department of City Planning effectively lopped off its top. Part of that excitement stemmed from the fact that the now-78-story condo was being designed by Jean Nouvel, who also created 100 11th Avenue.The wedge-shaped skyscraper, which is to be at 53 West 53rd Street, is back on track, according to a spokeswoman for Hines, the developer. When built, it should provide bird’s-eye views into the Baccarat across the street.In 2010, Extell joined Angelo, Gordon & Co. to buy this 16-story former residential hotel at 680 Madison, stretching along a full block between 61st and 62nd Streets.It sits amid Madison Avenue’s prime retail offerings — among them Hermès and Barneys — which might explain why so much marketing attention has been paid to its expanded retail space, which will include 34,000 square feet across two stories. But the upstairs is getting a makeover too; 156 units upstairs will become 68 condos and go on sale this fall, according to sources close to the project. When the building is completed in mid-2014, it will have two stories added to its roof, and will also incorporate a town house on 61st Street.'"
"'12-07-15,'0','Residents of buildings working with Spot will have membership fees waived and receive discounts and priority access to services that might get booked up quickly, said Mitch Marrow, the founder and chief executive of the Spot Experience. For five- or seven-day-a-week day care, residents would pay $26 to $28 a day, he said.“Compared to what you pay for a dog-walker in the city,” Mr. Marrow said, “if you had to have a minimum of two walks while you were gone from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., it’s a discount.”The doggy day care amenity eliminates the need for multiple dog-walkers to wander throughout buildings, Ms. Kaufman said. “We wanted to make sure our buildings are secure,” she said, “so it’s not some random dog-walker bringing 10 dogs into the building and having them on every floor.”The dog-care services also will give Rose a marketing edge when it comes to leasing apartments, Ms. Kaufman said. Rose will offer dog owners information packets on the services, along with chew toys and dog treats, and those who don’t own dogs will get information titled “Thinking of Getting a Dog?”Already, at the Aldyn and the Ashley, Spot Experience residents have been asking about certain dog breeds, Mr. Marrow said.“They want to get a puppy now, because having these services makes it easy for them to have it. We can housebreak it for them; we can do the basic training; we can do all the tough stuff, and they can have their pup to play with.”Mr. Marrow, a former hedge-fund employee who says he wants his dog-care company to compare to any other high-end amenity provider, describes Manhattan’s dog owners as underserved.“Almost 70 percent of New Yorkers who live in residential buildings with an income of over $150,000 own a dog,” he said, “so that’s a pretty big number.”As an Upper West Side resident with a St. Bernard and a bull mastiff, Mr. Marrow said he struggled to find a company to provide the right care for his dogs, and would often run home from work to feed and walk them.“I couldn’t get my head around why there wasn’t just somebody that came in and really did it right,” he said, “because there’s obviously such a need.”The next step for Spot is to work with property developers to create Spot facilities within or near a residential building, specifically for that building’s residents, Mr. Marrow said. Ms. Kaufman said Rose was considering such facilities for some of its buildings.Bob Cohen, a resident of the Park Millennium in the Lincoln Center area, urged his condo board to consider the Spot Experience as an amenity. Mr. Cohen, the owner of a golden doodle named Spike, had been disappointed with a previous dog-care company.He described his first visit to a Spot facility as “kind of Zen atmosphere,” adding, “The dogs just hanging out, and everyone was just kind of grooving.”Since January the Park Millennium has had a partnership with Spot, and about 30 of its condo owners use the service regularly.

"'12-07-15,'0','The acceleration in activity has occurred over the last six months, with smaller lenders jumping into the fray, said Melissa Cohn, the chief executive of the Manhattan Mortgage Company, a large mortgage broker. “Banks are flush with cash and need to lend,” she said.Lenders made $63.8 billion in jumbo loans in the first quarter, 18 percent more than in the first quarter of last year, according to the latest data available from Inside Mortgage Finance, which estimated that jumbo loans accounted for 16.6 percent of all loan originations in the first quarter, up from 9.9 percent for all of 2009.Mr. Cecala says that lenders see the jumbo market as profitable because it is generally populated by borrowers who tend to have a higher net worth and credit scores, and because borrowers are often required to make larger down payments, usually starting at 30 percent of the purchase price.As they compete for business, some lenders are seeking to carve out niches — based, for example, on geography, or on a borrower’s credit quality or background. Mr. Auerbach said that First Choice had been lending to many foreigners and people returning from overseas markets. It also provides “superjumbo lending” of up to $6 million, he said.Other lenders are loosening requirements on self-employed borrowers and even offering interest-only mortgages to borrowers who meet certain income standards, according to Keith Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH.com, a financial publisher in Pompton Plains, N.J.And there is also what Ms. Cohn describes as an asset liquidation loan, in which lenders can qualify people who may have large bank balances and other assets but not enough income. “There’s far more creativity in the jumbo space than there is in the conforming market,” she said.Because there are “57 flavors in the jumbo market” it’s important for borrowers to take the time to compare loan products. Mr. Cecala suggests starting with smaller lenders like community banks, some of which may be more likely to approve a mortgage application if a borrower already has an account there.Mr. Auerbach says borrowers should get preapproved, because some lenders tailor their requirements to the size of the loan. They may, for example, have higher credit standards or require bigger down payments for loans above $1.5 million.'"
"'12-07-15,'0','But this is no misery memoir, despite its obvious miseries, including a childhood featuring eight children (Moran was the oldest) chaotically crammed together in public housing. They were home-schooled, which essentially meant they ran wild, and poor to the point that Moran wore her mother’s hand-me-down underpants.Too bad, is her attitude. “My core belief is that if you’re complaining about something for more than three minutes, two minutes ago you should have done something about it,” she said.As a child, she haunted the library, read about a book a day, mostly the autobiographies of writers, and dreamed of the Algonquin Round Table. Her break came in the form of a winning essay in a national writing competition, which in turn gave her a summer column in The Observer newspaper at 15. Two years later, she began working for The Times of London, where she has been a columnist, critic and feature writer ever since.Now 37, she has a cultlike following. Addressing in the book the vexing question of what to call your “No. 1 vestibule” — your vagina — she describes how she asked her 200,000-plus followers what they call theirs and immediately received more than 500 responses. (These included “tuppence,” “cupcake” and “ City Center.”)Interviewed at her home in North London, Moran talked the way she writes — fast, hyperbolic, cheery, filled with swear words and sui generis slang and CAPITALS. She has a big cloud of dark hair with a dyed gray streak in the middle; she plans to reverse the colors when she turns 50.The word “feminism,” Moran said, has for some reason gone off the rails to connote, incorrectly, preachy humorlessness and grim separatism. “When I talk to girls, they go, ‘I’m not a feminist,’ ” she said. “And I say: ‘What? You don’t want to vote? Do you want to be owned by your husband? Do you want your money from your job to go into his bank account? If you were raped, do you still want that to be a crime? Congratulations: you are a feminist.’ ”She makes no apologies, even when describing the she had when she became pregnant two years after having her second daughter with her husband, a rock critic.“Everyone was like, ‘You’ve written a very brave book,’ ” Moran said. “But I’ve not done anything bad in that book. Every woman bleeds, every woman masturbates — I hope. One in three women will have an abortion; everyone’s had a bad boyfriend; everyone’s had some kind of fantasy relationship in their head. But if we keep these things secret and don’t talk about them publicly — then that to me looks like the behavior of oppressed people.“Before I wrote the book, I wondered: Am I going to get in trouble? Will I be perceived as a dirty woman?” she went on. “And you know what? Nothing bad happened, everyone liked it, it was fine. The secret is: You don’t need to keep it secret.”'"

"'12-07-16,'0','BELVIDERE, Ill. — You can lead a dog to water, but can you make him jump?That was one of the questions at Summer Splash, a three-day event at Meyer’s Tails Up Farm, a dog training center an hour northwest of Chicago. More than 150 dogs competed — yes, competed — by leaping into a four-foot-deep pool from a dock two feet above the water.It was part of a growing sport called dock jumping, a laid-back pastime that does not have the high profile and histrionics of better-known events like Westminster. The premise behind dock jumping is simple: dogs jump into the water, and they are judged on how well they do. In this competition, a mutt is as welcome, if not more, than a purebred.There are different disciplines. In the Big Air event, the dogs’ jumps are measured for distance. Lanky, athletic dogs tend to gravitate toward the Extreme Vertical, in which the competitors jump to snatch a dog toy suspended eight feet over the pool. The Speed Retrieve tests how fast a dog can swim when fetching a thrown object. A dog can enter all three events and compete for the Iron Dog title, a distinction of all-around athleticism.Although many dogs have a natural instinct to retrieve something, not all are inclined to leap off a dock into cold water. At Summer Splash, which was held in mid-May and hosted by the Chicagoland Dock Dogs chapter, a few of the competitors merely sniffed around looking befuddled. The dogs must jump of their own volition; handlers cannot nudge or bump the dog into the water. But, as an incentive to individual competitors, anything that floats can be tossed out over the water. Flying disks, tennis balls, rubber ducks and retrieval toys called bumpers are common choices.“There are no professional dogs,” said Beth Wiltshire, the event’s organizer. “They are all people’s dogs.”'"
"'12-07-16,'0','“It’s undeniable how big a part of all of our businesses the digital properties are going to be,” Mr. Capus said in an interview at his office at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. “We think we have a much better opportunity to shape them, and frankly grow the news division over all, if we have direct control over all of it.”In describing MSNBC.com, Mr. Capus said, “What we have right now is fine.” He stretched out the last word. “But I hate the word ‘fine.’ We want something more than fine.”Like a couple who stays together for far too long — to their friends’ discomfort — the breakup between NBC and Microsoft has been a long time coming. The partnership was pioneering at first, with a best-in-its-class Web site owing to Microsoft’s technologists in Washington State and a companion cable news channel run by NBC’s news-gathering teams in New York. But drastic changes in the media business, differing priorities inside the companies and the physical distance between them brought them apart.Microsoft’s stake in the cable channel was dissolved in 2005. But NBC came to feel handcuffed by the Web arrangement; an increasing number of advertisers wanted to buy ads both on its TV newscasts and its Web sites, a strategy called cross-media sales, but it could not respond effectively because Microsoft ran the ad sales part of the business.The joint venture set up a special team for such sales, and it has been particularly successful with the “Today” show and Today.com.“Our success in cross-media sales was one of the driving forces in wanting to get a deal done,” said John Kelly, the executive vice president for ad sales for NBC News.Another driver was MSNBC, the cable channel, which started to take on a politically progressive persona several years ago. As the image of MSNBC changed, the head of MSNBC.com, Charlie Tillinghast, floated a name change.“Both strategies are fine, but naming them the same thing is brand insanity,” he said to his staff in early 2010.NBC and Microsoft could not agree on proposed changes that year. But conversations resumed after Comcast acquired a majority stake in NBCUniversal in early 2011. Divorce talks between Comcast and Microsoft started in earnest last winter and were reported by a number of media outlets in the spring. The deal was signed last Friday.For now, MSNBC.com will automatically redirect browsers to NBCNews.com, and the site will initially look the same, save for a new logo. But it will be owned and operated by NBC, which will make changes more nimbly in the future. Production of the site will shift to New York, though some engineers and other technical employees will stay in Washington State, where NBC will set up what it calls the NBC News Innovation Center.“The whole news organization will benefit,” said Vivian Schiller, whom Mr. Capus hired a year ago to be the chief digital officer for NBC News.Microsoft, too, expects it will benefit from the breakup. The restrictive terms of the joint venture stopped its portal site, MSN.com, from doing deals with any other news providers, putting it at a disadvantage to other portals.Bob Visse, its general manager, said the site would now make such deals and link to competitors of MSNBC.com. In addition, he said, “we’re going to go out and build a world-class news team.” He declined to say how many journalists would be hired for the new site, which will be introduced in the fall.About half of MSNBC.com’s traffic came from MSN, and through a new traffic deal between the two companies, this will continue for some time. But NBCNews.com may seek other sources of traffic. NBC News had informal conversations with The Huffington Post this year, but the terms of the joint venture limited how far those talks could go; now that the joint venture is dissolved, Mr. Capus said, “we’re open for business.”“I expect that Vivian’s phone is going to be lighting up all the time with people who want to do deals, and we’ll consider them,” he said.By venturing out on its own, NBC is playing down the importance of portals — a stark contrast with ABC News, which aligned itself with Yahoo last year.Yahoo and ABC News’s combined news sites have 81 million unique visitors a month in the United States, according to the measurement firm comScore, with Yahoo representing the vast majority of the traffic. Detractors say ABC is inflating its totals via its Yahoo partnership, but ABC describes it as an important growth move.MSNBC.com and its associated sites have 50 million visitors, according to comScore; CNN and its sites have nearly 56 million.At first, NBCNews.com will retain sections for MSNBC’s political programs like “The Rachel Maddow Show” and “Morning Joe.” But those will be moved onto a new MSNBC.com early next year, further splintering traffic.Most of the joint venture’s roughly 300 employees will remain employed by NBC.The name, Mr. Capus said, “liberates them to think: how do we jump forward a couple steps ahead of everybody else, in terms of new ways to deliver news, new ways to deliver video?”Said Mr. Kelly, “There’s a big opportunity for the MSNBC cable brand to have its own digital destination.”'"

"'12-07-16,'0','Few people here suspect the state attorney of political motives, but Mr. Olmert’s aides and supporters say that Mr. Lador’s zealousness caused him to overlook what the court later found to be the “problematic” nature of central witnesses like the New Jersey woman, Rachel Moore, and Mr. Talansky.“I do not want to speak about a conspiracy, because Olmert also does not believe in a conspiracy,” said a senior lawyer on Mr. Olmert’s defense team. “But there are some facts. Private investigators were going around Israel trying to get people to open criminal files against Olmert. A few people told us that they were offered money.”Mr. Olmert’s associates spoke on the condition of anonymity because the legal troubles of the former prime minister are not over. He is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of breach of trust, the least serious of the charges he faced.And he remains embroiled in another serious corruption case, in which he is charged with taking bribes in connection with the construction of a residential complex while he was the mayor of Jerusalem.Mr. Olmert has not given any interviews since the court decision. But in an interview broadcast on CNN in early May, he spoke generally of having had “to fight against superior powers, including millions and millions of dollars that were transferred from this country,” meaning the United States, “by figures which were from the extreme right wing that were aimed to topple me as prime minister of Israel. There is no question about it.”Ms. Moore, a mother of seven from East Windsor, N.J., has become a central figure in the Olmert saga for those trying to prove it was born of political motives. The newspaper Maariv, which is generally viewed as conservative-leaning, published a series of articles last week that drew attention to Ms. Moore’s role in the Olmert case. The author, Ben Caspit, an influential and often provocative commentator, has been harshly critical of Mr. Olmert in the past and wrote that he was “never part of his troupe.”But of Ms. Moore, Mr. Caspit wrote, “This story clearly demonstrates the involvement of right-wing figures, political figures, unseen and dark forces who conspired to oust an incumbent prime minister of Israel from office, and found a faithful partner for that endeavor in the State Attorney’s Office.”Ms. Moore came to Israel in 1995 and worked for a year and a half in Mr. Olmert’s office, helping with some travel matters when he was mayor of Jerusalem. She returned to the United States in 1998. Ten years later she read in a newspaper that Mr. Olmert was suspected of fraudulently billing multiple state and charitable agencies for the same flights when he was mayor and then as the minister of trade, using the extra money for personal trips and vacations. She contacted the Israeli authorities.Ms. Moore was the only witness who volunteered information against Mr. Olmert in what became known as the double-billing affair, but the judges wrote in their ruling that they found her to be “a witness whose credibility is in doubt.”They added, “It cannot be ruled out that her testimony was influenced, or even motivated, by considerations that do not correspond with the duty to testify truthfully.”According to the court, Ms. Moore did not handle payments related to Mr. Olmert’s travel and was in no position to know how much the flights cost or how much was paid. She told of a trip to China years before Mr. Olmert ever traveled there.Mr. Caspit made much of Ms. Moore’s acknowledgment that she had consulted with a rabbi, whom he described as an “extremist,” before meeting with Israeli police investigators. Mr. Caspit added that the rabbi, Joseph Isaac Lifshitz, who works at the Shalem Center, a conservative-leaning institute in Jerusalem, had “instructed her to lodge a complaint against Olmert.”In their ruling, the judges noted that at the time that Ms. Moore approached the Israeli authorities, her husband was writing a blog that identified with the positions of the Israeli right and was severely critical of Mr. Olmert’s performance in security matters. The judges wrote that her testimony was in no way rejected because of her husband’s political opinions, but that it was “problematic” that she “hid the information” from investigators.Others involved in the story tell it a different way.Rabbi Lifshitz said in a telephone interview that Ms. Moore, a longtime acquaintance, had indeed called him but only to ask for a religious ruling on whether testifying against Mr. Olmert would constitute “lashon hara,” gossip or slanderous talk that is considered a sin in Jewish law.Rabbi Lifshitz said that he was apolitical, and made a point of never mixing politics and Halakha, or Jewish law. “I told her that if you tell the truth,” he said, “it is not considered lashon hara.”Reached by telephone in New Jersey, Ms. Moore declined to comment. But her American lawyer, Jeffrey A. Udell, utterly rejected any suggestion that his client had acted out of political motives.“Ms. Moore made crystal clear in her testimony that her only motivation was to tell the truth,” he said.“She had no agenda, was not ‘sent’ by anyone, and she answered the questions of the prosecutor and the defense to the best of her memory,” he said.It seems that Ms. Moore became more deeply entwined in the case than she had originally intended — she had to be subpoenaed to testify.In the end, Mr. Olmert’s bureau chief, Shula Zaken, was convicted of fraud and breach of trust in the double-billing affair. The court ruled that there was no evidence that Mr. Olmert knew the details of the billing or that any of the extra funds had been used for private travel. Ultimately, the court also found Mr. Talansky, from Woodsburgh, in Nassau County, to be a problematic witness whose testimony included statements that were incorrect, confused and “even false.”The judges wrote that Mr. Talansky was an amiable man who loved Israel and deeply admired Mr. Olmert.But an Olmert aide noted that Mr. Talansky had originally supported Mr. Olmert “as a rightist mayor of Jerusalem” and not as a prime minister offering concessions to the Palestinians.Unlike Ms. Moore, Mr. Talansky did not approach the Israeli authorities. Instead, during a visit to Jerusalem the police came knocking on his door. The identity of the person who tipped off the Israeli investigators about Mr. Talanksy has never been revealed.'"
"'12-07-16,'0','To win approval, Universal is expected to sell pieces of EMI or its own catalogs. Universal had been largely silent about this possibility until last week, when its chairman, Lucian Grainge, told The Financial Times, “I’m extremely open-minded about working with the commission in the context of behavioral remedies as well as divestitures.”For media analysts, the critical question now is not just whether Universal will divest assets, but whether it will have to sell so many that the deal will no longer be attractive.“There’s no question that we expect that these divestitures will erode some of the potential values and synergies,” said Tuna N. Amobi of Standard & Poor’s Equity Research. “The only question is how much value will be eroded.”Universal, formed through mergers in the 1990s, is the largest of the four major record companies; EMI, with roots in 19th-century Britain, is the smallest. But EMI’s catalog includes jewels by the Beatles, the Beach Boys and Frank Sinatra, as well as more recent hits by Norah Jones and Lady Antebellum.According to two people who had been briefed on the negotiations but were not authorized to speak publicly, two likely EMI divestments are Virgin Records and EMI Classics. To appease regulators, Universal could either offer European rights to music under those labels, or sell the labels outright. Another likely spinoff is EMI’s distribution rights to the independent label Mute, the sources said.EMI’s music publishing holdings were sold for $2.2 billion to an investor group led by Sony; that deal, seen as less troubling to regulators, closed last month.The music industry, which 15 years ago had six major labels, has consolidated in the last decade as it has been transformed by the shift to digital media. Today it is essential for labels to maintain vast song catalogs, as leverage in negotiating with digital services and to extend the traditional risk economics of the industry, in which the failures of the many are subsidized by the hits of the few.Samina Karim, an assistant professor at the Boston University School of Management who specializes in mergers, likened it to the model of the pharmaceutical industry. “Most drugs don’t make it through efficacy trials, and most artists do not make hits,” she said. “In both industries, they want to have more to gamble with in order to cover their losses.”For Universal, whose price for EMI was seven times earnings, the value of the deal could drop significantly if it is forced to sell assets at low prices, therefore losing expected efficiencies. According to rough calculations by commentators, a divestment of 10 to 15 percent of EMI’s catalogs could cost Universal as much as $400 million. A Universal spokesman declined to comment for this article.The success of the EMI deal is also critical to Vivendi. Stock in that company is near a nine-year low. Last month, its chief executive, Jean-Bernard Lévy, stepped down in a boardroom struggle. Like Mr. Lévy, Jean-René Fourtou, the chairman, is said to support the merger.Universal’s unusual deal to assume all regulatory risk is now seen as a liability, but many analysts said the company probably had no choice, given the music industry’s past regulatory challenges.The Warner Music Group, a Universal rival that has lobbied hard against the Universal-EMI merger, has tried to merge with EMI several times only to be rebuffed by regulators. When Sony Music made a deal to merge with BMG’s record divisions in 2004, it went through two long rounds of regulatory review in Europe before gaining final approval.“There was no way that Citi would agree to sell to the market leader, in a sector where in the past regulators have been extremely skeptical about consolidation, without Universal taking on the risk of the transaction,” said Claudio Aspesi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company in London.Universal must propose remedies for the European Commission’s concerns by Wednesday. The proposal could include divestments and so-called behavioral remedies like changes to licensing contracts. The commission’s deadline to rule is Sept. 6, although it could decide earlier. The F.T.C., whose investigation is not public, is also expected to rule in coming weeks.For Universal, the least painful course would be to sell rights to its music only in Europe, where in some countries its combined market share would creep above 50 percent. That could satisfy regulators’ concerns about cultural diversity. But Universal may be required to sell worldwide rights, as Sony did to win approval for its EMI publishing deal.Either way, Universal is betting that the long-term value of EMI’s songs will outweigh any short-term losses, even if they run high.“It’s clear that it’s better for them to engage with the regulators and sell perhaps more than they had originally intended,” said Omar Sheikh, a media analyst at Credit Suisse. “They’d much rather the deal be approved than not.”'"

"'12-07-16,'0','But at the genteel and very Southern Palmetto, the only other trustees turn out to be Kincaid’s trophy wife, JoJo, and daughter, Claire. This gives Grove a swing vote. That will be important once he figures out how risky the Palmetto Foundation’s activities really are. “Five to 10,” he says to JoJo at one point. “Percent?” she asks. “Years,” he says.Mr. Vonnegut further revs up “The Trust” by going beyond Palmetto’s questionable business dealings. He also throws in a Catholic charity that turns out to be financing an adult porn superstore in Fayetteville, N.C. The angry burghers of the local community near the store are represented by Biscuit Hughes, a tubby lawyer who is as much fun as his name.Biscuit, who will eventually join forces with Grove, tries to track down the store’s owners. He does it with the white-collar cleverness that is Mr. Vonnegut’s specialty. Going straight for the owners will get him nowhere. And Biscuit knows it. So he ferrets out the C.P.A.’s who filed each investor’s Form 990 (“Return of Organization Exempt From Income Tax”) with the I.R.S. The accountant for something called the Catholic Fund is particularly blunt when it comes to his client’s connection to a porn retailer. He asks if Biscuit wants to buy the business. “Everything is on the table,” the laughably pious accountant says, “when children’s lives are at stake.”There’s enough novelty to this plot to set “The Trust” apart from garden-variety business thrillers, the ones in which Bernard Madoff stand-ins run Ponzi schemes. Anyway, Mr. Vonnegut is just getting started. Soon Grove is dealing with a priest of the Maryknoll order who makes big-money deals with Palmetto for the sake of maimed Filipino orphans — or so he says. But the Manila Society for Children at Risk turns out to be one more part of a complex and devious shell game.One of the book’s neatest tricks is Grove’s way of using an analytics Web site, to see how much online traffic the dubious-sounding charities attract. When he finds out that the charities aren’t popular enough to account for the sums being donated, he knows that he’s digging in the right direction.As he narrates “The Trust,” Grove throws in jaundiced asides about how Wall Street does business. Mr. Vonnegut may or may not know whereof he speaks, but it helps that he explains stockbrokers while using the royal “we.” When a broker signs a noncompete agreement, “it’s like enlisting in the Marines,” he writes, “except we make more money, and nobody shoots at us.” As a rule in dealing with clients, “every stockbroker knows how to say one thing and do another.”Another of Mr. Vonnegut’s favorite ploys is writing about how families like the Kincaids (or, in “The Gods of Greenwich,” anyone with an art collection and a 27-bathroom house) spend money. This is money-porn beach reading, after all. “With $10 million you fly first-class,” he says. “With $50 million you fly private, NetJets or one of its competitors. With $200 million you’re wondering where to park your Citation X in Monte Carlo.”Inventive as most of it is, “The Trust” does fall back on some ho-hum conventions of the action thriller. So Grove finds himself in physical jeopardy, and Mr. Vonnegut’s writing style takes a temporary dive. (“His eyes widened. He leered at me, his smile sadistic.” “Suddenly, my face became his speed bag.”) But “The Trust” keeps clichés to a minimum. And even the taunting has snap. (“You know what whoosh money is?” “Whoosh it were still here.”) When the prime villain in this story starts bragging, the battle cry is this: “You’ll never untangle my spaghetti.”Quick literary note: This Mr. Vonnegut is a distant cousin of the better-known one. Quick psychiatric note: In each of Norb Vonnegut’s earlier books a person was devoured by a carnivore of another species. This time the kinky torment involves Great Stuff Big Gap Filler, the foaming sealant. The brand name is mentioned. The foam is put to killer use. Product placement doesn’t get much worse than this.'"

"'12-07-17,'1','WASHINGTON — More than one-third of the flight schools in the United States that cater to foreigners are not certified by the Federal Aviation Administration, according to the Government Accountability Office, raising concerns that the schools are illegally backing student visas although they have no intention of teaching the students to fly.The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which oversees the student visa program, keeps such sloppy records that it does not know how many of the 10,000 schools that can submit paperwork for such visas are accredited by the states where they do business, according to a new G.A.O. report. It said 167 of the 434 flight schools in the United States were not accredited by the F.A.A. and could not provide students with the proper documents to show they know how to operate a plane.The report, which is scheduled to be released on Tuesday, said that even if schools are already under investigation for issuing documents for illegal visas, the customs agency does not have the authority to stop them from issuing more.Three senators — Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York; Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa; and Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California — asked the G.A.O. in 2011 to investigate how the customs agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, issues student visas.The senators requested the inquiry after it was revealed that Tri-Valley University of Pleasanton, Calif., had provided foreigners with paperwork for student visas, with no intention of educating them.'"

"'12-07-17,'1','From a distance, it looks as if it could be an unusually large mailbox, or perhaps a doghouse almost three feet off the ground. Tucked under the shade of a tree and bolted into a sidewalk on St. Marks Avenue in Brooklyn, this wood box, 20 by 24 inches, turns heads as neighbors stroll by.Children are, of course, more willing to explore.On Monday, the siblings Evan and Elinor Bither, moving by on their scooters, halted to a stop in front of what has quickly become a fixture in Prospect Heights. Evan, 6, turned a wooden latch to open the glass front door.He had come to New York’s first official Little Free Library.Evan flipped through the collection: eight novels by Patrick O’Brian, a book by Elie Wiesel and “The Night Remembers” by Kathleen Eagle.“Why are there only grown-up books in here?” Evan said.Alas, it is one of the difficulties of a library shared by all. The collection, limited by its compact home and the supply of donations, is ever changing. But many neighbors say the absence of children’s books on Monday was an anomaly.The Little Free Library, whose slanted roof carries the messages “Saint Marks Children’s Book Stop” and “Take a Book, Return a Book,” was opened at the end of May. Its housing was provided by the national Little Free Library organization, which estimates that there are 2,200 such places, across almost every state and about 30 countries. Each local library pays $25 to register with the group. About 20 percent buy the wood box from the national organization, which can cost a few hundred dollars. The rest, using materials like canoes or ovens, make them for themselves.'"

"'12-07-17,'1','Under the terms of the settlement, Visa, MasterCard and banks including JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America will pay retailers about $6 billion to settle claims that they had engaged in anticompetitive practices in payment processing.Retailers could start imposing a surcharge for payments made by credit cards as soon as December, if the court grants preliminary approval of the settlement, said K. Craig Wildfang, a lawyer with Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi who represented plaintiffs in the lawsuit.But because the settlement results from a class action, plaintiffs can opt out of it or object to it. One plaintiff, NACS, the convenience store association, has said it will reject the settlement, in part because it does not stop Visa and MasterCard from raising rates.For some retailers, the outcome of the settlement could be different prices at the checkout counter depending on how customers pay, said Keith Dailey, a spokesman for Kroger. “The discounting aspect is, in our view, a very powerful tool at a merchant’s disposal,” he said.Under the terms of the settlement, retailers can disclose to customers how much each type of payment costs retailers, and give discounts for those paying with cash, debit cards or low-frills credit cards that cost retailers less than traditional cards.“Through discounted pricing on electronic payments, we can begin to inform our customers and also drive our customers through using more efficient and lower-cost products,” Mr. Dailey said. He said Kroger had not yet decided how this would work — for instance, whether it would have signs on merchandise showing two-tier pricing or whether the differences would be applied at the register.Given a shaky economy, many restaurants and other retailers said they had no plans to charge more when customers paid with credit cards.“Shopping with a credit card is a convenience for our customers and is an important part of our customer service,” said Carolyn Beem, a spokeswoman for L.L. Bean. “We have absolutely no plans to add a surcharge for credit card purchases.”Rick Camac, chief executive of the Fatty Crew group of six restaurants, including Fatty Crab, said that “customers might see it as another way you’re trying to get at them.”“I think you have to take the hit, or make it up by adjusting your prices,” Mr. Camac said of paying for the credit card fees.Rich Jeffers, a spokesman for Darden Restaurants, which operates the Red Lobster, Olive Garden and Longhorn Steakhouse chains, among others, said customers would pay the same price regardless of payment method. “Whether our guests choose to pay with cash, credit, debit or even one of our gift cards, the amount doesn’t change,” Mr. Jeffers said.For luxury restaurants, there was also little expectation that customers who pay with credit cards would be treated differently. “It’s not a very elegant thing to do,” said Eric Ripert, executive chef and an owner of Le Bernardin in Manhattan.Still, many retailers and restaurateurs were preparing to press Visa and MasterCard for better transaction rates so they would not need to pass costs on to customers — or absorb them. A big sign at checkout — already common at many gas stations — offering shoppers discounts for using cash would presumably stop some people from using cards — giving merchants some negotiating power.“All merchants will, for the first time, have some leverage with the big banks,” said Mr. Dailey of Kroger.Mallory Duncan, general counsel for the National Retail Federation, said he had doubts that stores would be able to negotiate good rates with the credit card companies under the terms of this settlement.“Now, they won’t negotiate with the biggest merchants in the entire country, so how are 100 hardware stores going to come together and have any kind of effect? It’s illusory,” he said.'"
"'12-07-17,'1','WASHINGTON — In early 2010, a new organization called the Commission on Hope, Growth and Opportunity filed for nonprofit, tax-exempt status, telling the Internal Revenue Service it was not going to spend any money on campaigns.Weeks later, tax-exempt status in hand as well as a single $4 million donation from an anonymous benefactor, the group kicked off a multimillion-dollar campaign against 11 Democratic candidates, declining to report any of its political spending to the Federal Election Commission, maintaining to the I.R.S. that it did not do any political spending at all, and failing to register as a political committee required to disclose the names of its donors. Then, faced with multiple election commission and I.R.S. complaints, the group went out of business.To Democrats and some campaign finance watchdogs eager to force more transparency in spending by independent groups, Hope, Growth and Opportunity stands out as the kind of “pop-up” organization that operates in virtual secrecy, with legal impunity.“I still don’t know who they are,” said John Spratt, the former chairman of the House Budget Committee, who lost his 2010 re-election bid after facing a deluge from the group. “It’s a classic case.”Efforts to require more public accounting of campaign money hit a new roadblock Monday evening in the form of a Republican filibuster that stopped the Senate from formally debating it. The measure fell 9 votes short of the 60 required to clear the procedural hurdle, with no Republicans voting in favor. But Democratic senators planned to keep discussing the bill — the Democracy Is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act — into the night, and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, voted no so that under Senate rules, he could bring it up for a second vote on Tuesday to highlight Republican opposition.'"
"'12-07-17,'1','If Community Education were to collapse, that could significantly disrupt New Jersey’s corrections system, and if the company remains financially hobbled, its halfway houses in New Jersey could continue to suffer.The documents also suggest that Community Education’s chief executive, John J. Clancy, highlighted Mr. Palatucci’s ties to Mr. Christie in an effort to impress investors and secure desperately needed financing for the company.The documents were submitted on Friday in federal court in Newark in an employment lawsuit brought against Community Education by a former executive. They portray a company that has been in crisis and trying to fend off creditors, even as it has mounted a robust lobbying and public relations campaign., in a three-part series last month, detailed extensive problems in New Jersey’s halfway houses, including escapes, violence and drug use. The system of halfway houses, which the state has long promoted as a national model, handles thousands of inmates annually who are leaving prison or on parole.Community Education has dominated the system for over a decade, and more than 15 former workers told The Times for its articles last month that the company had kept staffing levels very low in recent years to save money. As a result, the workers said, the company did a poor job delivering counseling and other services intended to help inmates make the transition to society.The company’s financial difficulties have not stemmed from its government contracts in New Jersey, which have steadily grown over the last decade, according to the documents and interviews. Community Education has instead run into trouble after an aggressive expansion foundered in states like and . The resulting shortfalls have been a factor in staff and other reductions in New Jersey.Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Mr. Christie, declined on Monday to comment on Community Education’s finances, referring questions to the Corrections Department.Asked about Mr. Clancy’s emphasizing the political influence of Mr. Palatucci, Mr. Drewniak said, “We have no way of knowing the veracity of that assertion, but it would be inappropriate for any company to do that.”The Corrections Department, which is part of the Christie administration, said there was nothing about Community Education’s finances that warranted concern.“The company has consistently maintained its services under the terms of its contracts with the Department of Corrections and, like all similar providers, was scrutinized for financial stability prior to any contract award,” the department said in a statement.In a statement, Community Education said it had been hurt by the financial crisis but was proud of the work that it continued to do. “C.E.C. has never had a disruption of a contract in New Jersey or any other state, never missed a payroll, and never had a basis that necessitated disclosure of a nonissue,” the company said.The documents in the lawsuit, including depositions from current and former Community Education executives, show that the company was under threat of bankruptcy in 2010 because it borrowed too heavily for its national expansion and could not make debt payments.The company, which is privately owned, received roughly $300 million annually from government contracts around the country in 2009 and 2010. But one projection by the company in 2009 showed that because of its debt burden, it would soon have only $13,702.02 in cash on hand.“Everybody in that building was aware on a daily basis that we were making choices of who to pay, who not to pay, “ Community Education’s former treasurer, Frank English, said in a deposition, referring to the company’s headquarters in West Caldwell, N.J.“Everybody knew that the company was struggling,” Mr. English added.Asked directly whether the company had contemplated bankruptcy, Mr. English said yes.He added that the company had hoped that it would not come to that and had always found a way to meet its payroll.Nevertheless, another former company executive, Chris Rausch, said in a deposition: “We were short cash. We couldn’t afford any extra head count.”On the brink of bankruptcy, Community Education received $235 million in financing in December 2010, at interest rates as steep as 15.25 percent.The documents in the lawsuit indicate that the company’s finances have not improved markedly since then. Despite the new financing, the company remained in debt even to its auditors.Several documents about Community Education’s current finances — as well as sections of testimony — were not available for review because they were filed with the court under seal.After the articles about the state’s halfway houses were published in The Times last month, state lawmakers said the system should be regulated more tightly. The Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats, approved a measure requiring the Corrections Department to provide more information about halfway-house operations to the Legislature.But Mr. Christie, a Republican, used a line-item veto to weaken the requirements. His aides said the measure was burdensome, but some lawmakers contended that he was trying to protect Mr. Palatucci, the company executive who is his close friend.Since the 1990s, the state has allowed Community Education to obtain its contracts through a nonprofit organization that the company controls, skirting a state law that excludes private companies from this work.Last year, the office of the state comptroller, Matthew Boxer, raised alarms about this arrangement. After conducting an audit that harshly criticized state oversight of the halfway-house system, the office concluded that regulators were kept in the dark about Community Education’s finances.The Christie administration took no action in response to the comptroller’s warning.Mr. Clancy founded Community Education in the 1990s, promoting large-scale halfway houses as a solution for states seeking to scale back their prison systems. Since that time, he has courted politicians of both major parties while obtaining government contracts in New Jersey.Community Education has a total of 1,900 beds in six halfway houses in New Jersey, which 7,700 state inmates and parolees cycled through last year. The company has hundreds more beds for county and federal inmates.The company received about $71 million in the 2011 fiscal year from state and local government agencies in New Jersey, out of total halfway-house spending of roughly $105 million.The court documents show that in an effort to forestall bankruptcy, Community Education has had to give investors without substantial experience in corrections a role in running the company.LLR Partners, a private-equity firm in that invested $53 million in the company with a partner, and other investors have been involved in deciding how to allocate personnel.“That’s done in an interest to maximize their investment?” Kevin J. O’Connor, the plaintiff’s lawyer in the lawsuit, asked at a deposition.answered Mr. Rausch, who was dismissed in 2009 after clashing with Mr. Clancy.The court documents stem from a lawsuit filed against Community Education last year by its former chief financial officer, David N. T. Watson.Mr. Watson contends that Mr. Clancy lied about the company’s financial turmoil when recruiting him and improperly fired him in December 2010.Mr. Watson and his lawyer, Mr. O’Connor, both declined to comment.Last month, responding to questions from The Times about the lawsuit, Community Education vehemently denied that it had experienced financial problems.“The company has never defaulted on any payment of debt,” the company said in a statement. “No financial issues existed that would have required disclosure.”That denial was described in the first article in The Times’s series, published on June 17.In depositions made public on Friday, however, five current and former Community Education executives, including Mr. Clancy, repeatedly acknowledged that the company was in default in 2009 and 2010.“It was in default for a lot of that time,” Mr. Clancy said. “It could have been all of that time.”Asked on Monday about the discrepancy, the company stood by its previous statement and added: “The referenced event concerns compliance with certain financial covenants contained in the company’s document. Those issues were subsequently remedied.”The court documents offered new insight into ties between Community Education and Governor Christie.In his deposition, Mr. Clancy said that he was a Democrat who supported Mr. Christie and that he was standing with Mr. Christie on the night he won election in November 2009.“The correct person won, which should make for a better 2010,” Mr. Clancy wrote to Seth J. Lehr, a co-founder of LLR Partners, the company investor.Mr. Lehr responded, “Relationships matter, and that’s a deep one for you and Bill”; that was a reference to Mr. Palatucci.Soon after, Mr. Clancy told another company executive to emphasize Mr. Palatucci’s connections to Mr. Christie in the information the company was sending to banks and potential investors, Mr. Clancy acknowledged in his deposition.At the time, the company was in dire straits and seeking capital. Mr. Clancy wanted the investors to know that Mr. Palatucci was co-chairman of Mr. Christie’s inauguration committee, and Mr. Christie’s former law partner, according to the deposition.Mr. Clancy said in the deposition that he considered Mr. Christie a friend. “ ‘Friend’ does not mean more business,” Mr. Clancy said. “ ‘Friend’ does not mean anything more than we were friends.”The depositions also raise new questions about a $130 million contract that Community Education received in 2011 to house federal immigrant detainees and county inmates in Newark.Immigrant advocacy groups have long asserted that the contract, which was administered by Essex County, was written in a way to ensure that only Community Education could receive it.In depositions, former company executives said Mr. Clancy had been so certain that Community Education would receive the contract that he used it as leverage in negotiations with investors.Community Education, which was the only bidder, received the contract. The company said Monday that it had not had an unfair advantage in the process.'"
"'12-07-17,'1','“Courts Putting Stop-and-Frisk Policy on Trial” (front page, July 11) attributes the claim of unconstitutionality to “recent rulings by federal and state courts.” But even aside from the racial targeting of these frisks, the law has been clear for more than 40 years, and New York City has been blatantly violating it.Ever since a Supreme Court ruling in 1968, reiterated a number of times over 25 years, the law regarding when police officers are allowed to frisk has been clear: police may legally frisk people only if they have a reasonable suspicion, based on articulable facts, not a hunch, that the person frisked is armed and dangerous.That the police rarely have legally adequate reason to frisk is proved by the fact that their own statistics show that they find guns as a result of such frisks in less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the frisks — more than 380,000 of them last year, more than 85 percent of them blacks and Latinos. Either the police are spectacularly incompetent at assessing reasonable suspicion, or they are frisking illegally.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has tried to rally public support for this unconstitutional policy by claiming that it prevents crime, but he provides no proof of this claim. How is crime prevented by violating the rights of innocent people?The writer is a former executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.'"
"'12-07-17,'1','Mr. Dittrich said that association members were meeting Libyan government officials and business people, and that they were “not so much there to sell, as more developing relationships as they do their planning process and decide where to go now.” He mentioned Libyan trade shows focusing on oil, transportation and infrastructure development, health and education.Mr. Dittrich said the Libyan economy had begun to be liberalized in 2005, when Muammar el-Qaddafi, then president, began courting the West. From a business perspective, he said, that means “the glass is more than half full,” adding, “The ingredients are all there for them to pull this off in a very good way.”American businesses that wait too long, fearing the risks, could be left behind, he said. Mr. Dittrich said his group visited in April, and “we were the first organized U.S. business organization to go to Tripoli since the conflict.” But, he said, “Turkish and European delegations were there right from the early days.”But a business traveler briefly stopping in the region has to make different preparations from someone who is based in a country in the midst of change. Marshall L. Stocker, a chartered financial analyst with the Boston hedge fund manager Emergent Property Advisors, moved to Cairo in June 2010, and temporarily fled after the mass protests began on Jan. 25, 2011.“In Egypt, cells were off, the Internet was off. Obviously there was no business to be done. I was barricaded in my apartment,” he said, adding, “I self-evacuated to the airport with tickets for three different flights” that his wife had arranged for him from the United States.Mr. Stocker returned in February 2011, after Hosni Mubarak resigned as president. Despite the disruptions, he said, Egypt presents business opportunities. “Now is a great time to buy assets,” he said. “Conceptually, and in practice here, assets are falling in value.”He said his company was interested in Egypt because of the direction its business climate was moving. “One of the things that attracted us to Egypt was that the World Bank had improved its ‘ease of doing business’ rating,” he said. “Egypt had become more hospitable to investment. From 2004 to 2007, it had the single greatest improvement in ‘ease of doing business’ of any country in the world.”While things have generally settled, he said he was prepared for emergencies. “As a result of the Arab Spring, I bought political evacuation insurance, and I have a satellite phone,” he said. He uses Global Rescue, a company that provides medical evacuation, security services and other emergency assistance. Still, Mr. Stocker said some Cairo business travel costs had decreased, including hotel rates and airfares.The Arab Spring also affected regional flight patterns, particularly between Egypt and Israel, where near-daily direct flights once connected Tel Aviv and Cairo. The Israeli airline El Al now flies once a month, and the Egyptian carrier Air Sinai often cancels scheduled flights.Ms. Mashiah suggested using neutral Jordan as an alternative meeting or connection point for these and other Middle East countries. She also recommended using Europe for initial meetings between American and Middle Eastern business people, avoiding visa issues and other risks.With no direct flight connections between the United States and Libya, Mr. Dittrich said his group used varied hubs, including Frankfurt, Rome and Istanbul, to reach Tripoli. Once there, he said, internal connections on Libya’s Buraq Air were in “new Boeing planes, right on time and cheap.”There are now fewer direct connections between the United States and Egypt, Mr. Stocker said. He now flies through Amsterdam or Paris, lamenting the connection time. Egyptair has direct flights from Kennedy Airport in New York to Cairo.The Arab countries are not the only region of the world undergoing transformation. John McAuliff, executive director of the Fund for Reconciliation and Development, which works to normalize relations between the United States and Cuba, said certain sectors of Cuba’s economy were open to Americans, despite Treasury Department restrictions.“Agriculture is allowed. Ag people can do this, can go for the purpose of discussing sales,” with Cubans, he said, adding that “telecommunications is allowed.”Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, also recently liberalized its economy, though there are few Western business travelers. Marilyn Downing Staff, president of Asia Transpacific Journeys, said she had mostly seen travelers from aid groups like CARE, World Vision and Doctors Without Borders.Asian business travelers have long made inroads, she said, from Chinese oil industry representatives to sales teams from Korean and Indian car, soap, clothing and refrigerator companies. “All bets are off with the embargo lifting,” she said. “Things are changing as we speak.” The problem, she said is “the business traveler is going to struggle to get appropriate accommodations. The infrastructure is maxed out,” with few hotels at international business standards.Still, those with experience in troubled or developing regions will discount such concerns. Ms. Mashiah, the Israeli consultant, said, “If you are afraid of turbulent times, this is not right for you.”But, she added, “the more risk, the more opportunity.”“There is a risk for business people who wait five years, but some come in right on the ground, like in Iraq,” she said. “And they are reaping the profits.”'"
"'12-07-17,'1','GARDEN CITY, N.Y. (AP) — No criminal charges will be filed in a friendly fire shooting that killed a federal agent after he tried to intervene in a pharmacy robbery on Dec. 31, the Nassau County district attorney said Monday.The district attorney, Kathleen M. Rice, said the retired Nassau police lieutenant who shot the off-duty senior special agent, John Capano of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, “clearly did not enter this situation with the intent to use deadly physical force.”“He resorted to it,” her report said, “only when he perceived that his own life was in danger.”The retired lieutenant, Christopher Geraghty, and another bystander, an off-duty New York City police officer named Joseph Arbia, were justified when they used deadly force, Ms. Rice said.The men were in a deli in Seaford, about 25 miles east of the city, when they were alerted to a robbery at a nearby pharmacy. When they arrived there, they saw Agent Capano, 51, and the robbery suspect wrestling for a gun, which turned out to be Agent Capano’s.Mr. Geraghty told investigators that he opened fire, killing Agent Capano, after a bullet from his weapon whizzed past Mr. Geraghty’s head. The report noted that Mr. Geraghty “found himself looking down the barrel of a gun that he perceived to have been pointed at him by John Capano,” adding that Mr. Geraghty then believed that Agent Capano was trying to kill him.'"
"'12-07-17,'1','But Office is under attack, most notably by Google, which is doing everything it can to suck the profits out of Microsoft’s cash-cow businesses. Google offers a suite of applications that run inside Web browsers, and a number of users favor them for their simplicity and the way they are accessible from nearly any device, not just computers.While Google has had some success in persuading businesses to use the corporate version of its Web-based e-mail service, businesses have been slower to jettison other Office applications over concerns about security and reliability. Sales of Office have continued to grow in recent years. Many business customers are locked into multiyear contracts that buy them upgrades to Microsoft’s software.But the shift toward new mobile devices like tablets represents a potential threat to Office. The iPad has become an unexpected hit in the business world, and many people have begun to carry the devices around for work purposes, though often not as a full replacement for a traditional computer. Apple is by far the biggest player in the tablet market with an estimated 60 to 70 percent share.Microsoft has also redesigned its Windows operating system so it will run on touch-screen devices. The new version of the software, Windows 8, is expected to begin shipping on tablets starting in the fall. Office will run on tablets and more traditional computers that run Windows 8 and a related version called Windows RT.Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research, said she was impressed with the new Office, but she wondered whether Microsoft was “leaving a gap” for competitors to fill with versions that run on various devices, including the iPad. “It’s the best version of Office yet, but that doesn’t make it invulnerable to competition and disruption,” she said.Google, for instance, recently acquired a start-up called Quickoffice that makes software for mobile devices, including iPads, that lets people open and edit Microsoft Office files.Microsoft, in fact, has an internal effort to develop a version of Office for the iPad, though it is not clear when it plans to releases the software, several people with knowledge of the project have said. They declined to be named discussing Microsoft’s confidential plans. Microsoft will not confirm the effort.It seems unlikely, though, that Microsoft would release an iPad version of Office until well after it releases Windows 8, since the software could create a potential advantage for Apple among business users who want touch-screen versions of Word, Excel and other applications. Microsoft does offer iPad versions of a couple of Office applications, including OneNote, a note-taking program.On Monday, Microsoft said the new version of Office would automatically upload Office files to a Microsoft storage service called SkyDrive. This is meant to allow users to more easily switch between devices while working on their Office files. The company posted preview versions of the new Office on its Web site.Microsoft said it had also integrated the corporate social networking service Yammer into the new Office. Microsoft in June agreed to acquire Yammer for $1.2 billion to better compete with Salesforce.com and other companies that are supplying social networking tools for businesses.'"
"'12-07-17,'1','Children with disabilities are almost four times more likely to be victims of violence than other children, according to a new report commissioned by the World Health Organization.The report, published in The Lancet on Thursday, found that disabled children were 3.6 times more likely to be physically assaulted and 2.9 times more likely to be sexually assaulted.The most common victims of sexual assault were those with mental illness or retardation, and institutionalized children were attacked more often than those living at home.Last week’s report was a meta-analysis of 17 other studies that collectively gathered evidence on 18,374 children, all of them living in wealthy countries, from the United States to Europe to Israel. About 3 percent of children in rich countries and up to 6 percent in poor ones have disabilities.“Physical violence” included threats and spanking that left marks on the skin. A study published about 10 years ago estimated that 53,000 children under age 18 are murdered each year.Dr. Etienne Krug, the director of the W.H.O. department of violence and injury prevention, said that strategies that have proven to protect other children should be studied for the disabled. Among these are training for violence-prone parents and home visits by nurses to children at risk.'"
"'12-07-17,'1','Archaeologists exploring a cave in Namibia have found evidence for the earliest domesticated animals in sub-Saharan Africa.The cave, in the northwestern part of the country, contains stone and bone tools, beads and pendants, pieces of pottery, and the bones of many animals — guinea fowl, ostriches, monitor lizards, tortoises, impala, rock hyraxes and various rodents.The researchers also found two teeth of either a goat or a sheep — the teeth were too worn to say which, but their form is consistent with that of modern African domesticated sheep and goats. There are no wild sheep or goats in sub-Saharan Africa today. Although some wild species probably became extinct around 12,000 years ago, there is no evidence of their presence in the western part of the continent. The researchers are certain that the remains they found belong to domestic animals.The teeth date from 2,190 and 2,270 years ago. Until now, the oldest radiocarbon-dated remains were of 2,105-year-old-sheep found in South Africa.The study, a collaboration between the National Museum of Namibia and the National Museum of Natural History in Paris, appears in PLoS One. Its lead author, David Pleurdeau, an assistant professor at the Paris museum, said the find did not necessarily mean that people living near this site were breeding domestic animals.“In the cave, there is no evidence that the inhabitants were herders,” he said. “We still don’t know if it’s herders migrating to the area, or the introduction of a few sheep among an indigenous group.”'"

"'12-07-18,'1','Much as I detest that overused adjective “awesome,” it seems an appropriate word to describe the Canadian director Robert Lepage’s recent staging of Wagner’s “Ring” cycle at the Metropolitan Opera. Like it or not, it was an astounding feat of engineering.Awesome also describes this 16-hour, four-opera masterwork about the creation and destruction of the world, a work that Wagner considered unstageable in his time.Susan Froemke’s impressively well-organized new documentary, “Wagner’s Dream,” argues that stagecraft unimaginable in the 19th century has made what seemed impossible possible. The film’s few snatches of the final productions first staged during the Met’s 2010-11 season have a majestic flow that matches a score roiling with fire and thunder. The film focuses primarily on the creation of a 90,000-pound set nicknamed “the machine.” In its stately design, the production at times suggests the stage equivalent of Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey.”Mr. Lepage’s concept was inspired by the mythology found in the Icelandic Edda writings, which he cites as the primary source for the “Ring.” His production was based on the theory of plate tectonics, in which pieces of the earth’s crust are continually shifting. In his view the lava coming out of the ice is the equivalent of the gods expressing themselves.Translating that idea to the stage entailed building a platform of 24 movable planks that turns into staircases and walls where computer-generated imagery is projected. In the early rehearsal scenes, as the device creaks and grinds to a halt, you wonder how it could possibly operate smoothly. You also worry about the ability of the performers to vocalize comfortably amid so many hazards. In one scene they rush to avoid being crushed by the lowering platform.'"

"'12-07-18,'1','Scholars argue that university presses are vital for academic discourse. They publish erudite texts that commercial presses do not, giving scholars a forum to share and further research. Professors often rely on them to publish the works they need for tenure and promotion. But they are usually money-losing operations. The presses at the University of Chicago, Oxford and Cambridge are the only ones widely believed to be profitable.In their early decades the bottom line did not matter. Cornell started the first university press in the United States in 1869, and the presses were set up to publish the research results of faculty. As time passed, however, presses were increasingly asked to generate revenue for their institutions. Now their future at many campuses revolves around two questions: Are presses part of a university’s core mission, akin to an academic department? Or are they business investments, expendable if they fail to draw profit?“Many institutions are grappling with these questions — and all of them should, because support for scholarly communication remains vital, not just for scholars themselves, but for the university’s ability to communicate with the world around it,” said Kathleen Fitzpatrick, director of scholarly communication at the Modern Language Association.Other universities have taken steps to revolutionize their publishing systems. Project Muse, which has published academic journals online as part of the Johns Hopkins University Press since 1995, began publishing full-length digital books in January.After closing its press in the mid-1990s, Rice University reopened a digital-only operation in 2006, but it shut that down after four years. Rice’s example revealed a difficult truth about digital scholarly publishing: it is still expensive. Most of the cost in producing scholarly writings comes before anything is printed on paper, through expenses like hiring people for peer review.Speer Morgan, the editor of the literary magazine The Missouri Review, will head the new press. Under the University of Missouri’s new plan, the more than 2,000 books already published by the existing press operation, which will make way for the new one after production of its fall books, will be digitized and promoted by university libraries, a news release said. The new press will publish about 25 titles a year in hard copy, slightly less than the current output of 30, and digital format, though most will be in print initially, according to Brian L. Foster, provost of the university’s Columbia campus.The university also will honor the contracts of authors signed to coming works and plans to publish the titles on its spring list, Mr. Wolfe said. Administrators do not know exactly how much the new model will cost, Mr. Foster said.“One of the things that I believe is, if in fact we come up with a model that is more effective at disseminating scholarly work,” Mr. Wolfe said last week in an interview, “the other presses are going to have to look at this model and say, ‘Can we do what the University of Missouri is doing?’ ”Before becoming president in February, Mr. Wolfe spent his entire professional career in business. When he announced in May that he would eliminate the press’s subsidy, detractors said he did not appreciate its value. Mr. Wolfe defended the decision-making process, saying he relied on the university’s chancellors and vice presidents who have lifelong backgrounds in academia.But Mr. Wolfe acknowledged that he had never spoken to or consulted employees of the current press, and none of them were involved in the creation of the new model. Many critics said the new plan was vague and full of corporate jargon. They were concerned about the prospect that under the new plan students would be handling much of the work. “Will established scholars be willing to work with such a haphazardly staffed press?” Bruce Joshua Miller, a sales representative for university publishers, and Ned Stuckey-French, a professor at Florida State who has published with the Missouri press, wrote in a more than 1,500-word news release responding to the university’s announcement. Mr. Miller and Mr. Stuckey-French have led much of the resistance, creating the Facebook page and an online petition that has gathered more than 4,700 signatures.The administration seemed unaware that the press already was doing the supposedly new things described in the plan, Clair Willcox, the current editor of the press, said. The press, for instance, already publishes e-books, he said.“The staff was enraged,” Mr. Willcox said his colleagues’ response to details of the new plan. “They were looking at descriptions of what they already did. It suggests that somehow they weren’t doing a good enough job over here.”'"
"'12-07-18,'1','MOSCOW — Two former business associates of Viktor Bout, the convicted Russian arms dealer now in federal prison in the United States, have been blocked by the government of Mauritius from setting up an aviation company that could have been used for smuggling guns, according to the government and a private American arms investigation group.In a report scheduled for release on Wednesday, the group, Conflict Awareness Project, says that Mr. Bout’s former lieutenants Sergei Denisenko and Andrei Kosolapov had applied for an air operation certificate in Mauritius for their company, Island Air Systems. The certificate would have enabled the firm to bypass United Nations weapons embargoes and move weapons through Iran, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.Mr. Denisenko, who acknowledged that he had worked with Mr. Bout in the past, said he had divested his share in Island Air Systems after accusations of fraud led to a falling-out with his former business partners. “When I saw what was happening, I gave up my shares in the company and left,” he said. “I don’t like to play games when people lie to one another.”Mr. Kosolapov said by telephone that he was a director for Island Air Systems, but that the company had legally applied for the certificate to charter regional flights out of Mauritius, an island nation, and was not engaged in weapons trafficking. “Everything that I have done has been correct and perfectly legal,” he said.In a letter provided to The New York Times by the Conflict Awareness Project, the Mauritian ambassador to the United Nations wrote that the country had denied Island Air Systems’ application for the certificate in July and that Mauritius “will not allow its territory or its institutions to be used for illicit purposes.” However, the official said, a continuing internal investigation has not proved that Island Air Systems would use the certificate to move weapons.If true, the report said, the allegations could implicate companies and individuals based in the United States, Finland, Australia and South Africa, which were linked to Island Air Systems through financing deals or contracts to provide aircraft and flight crews to the company.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','The Senate Finance Committee will consider the measure on Wednesday, and aides expect a strong bipartisan vote. The issue has taken on urgency because Russia will join the World Trade Organization by the end of summer, and without normal trade status, American firms like Boeing and John Deere will not be able to take advantage of the reduced barriers.“American businesses win increased market access to Russia without giving up a single thing in return — no tariff changes, no market concessions, nothing,” Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee, said in a statement. To address human rights, he is incorporating a bill known as the Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act, named for a Russian lawyer who was arrested and died in prison after investigating official corruption.In an attempt to press the Soviet Union to allows Jews to leave, Congress enacted the Jackson-Vanik law in 1974. It denied favored trade treatment to Communist countries that hindered freedom of emigration and was named after its Democratic sponsors, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington and Representative Charles Vanik of Ohio. Since the Soviet collapse, presidents have lifted the restrictions for Russia each year on the grounds that Moscow had stopped preventing emigration, but none of them could persuade Congress to eliminate the strictures permanently.That failure had little substantive effect on trade but was a sore point for Russian leaders who bristled at the Jackson-Vanik stigma and what they considered a broken promise. Now that Russia has finally won membership in the World Trade Organization, it will have a tangible effect for the first time because only countries with permanent trade relations qualify for eased W.T.O. trading rules.“This isn’t a gift to Russia,” Philip H. Gordon, an assistant secretary of state, said in an interview. “We’re doing this for us and our firms.”Businesses have been lobbying to lift Jackson-Vanik, a move that Mr. Aslund estimates would double annual American exports to Russia to $19 billion in five years.“Our competitors from every other W.T.O. member country will not hesitate to take market share away from American companies, thus jeopardizing American jobs,” said Edward Verona, president of the United States-Russia Business Council.The Magnitsky measure requires the denial of visas and freezing of assets of Russian officials deemed responsible for abuses. The Obama administration lobbied against attaching it to the trade bill, arguing that it had already denied visas for some people tied to Mr. Magnitsky’s death.“We very much share the goals and aims of such legislation,” Mr. Gordon said. “We agree with those senators who think Russia hasn’t done what’s necessary to identify those responsible for Mr. Magnitsky’s death, and we share the broader democracy and human rights goals.”But lawmakers rebuffed the administration and insisted on linking the issues.“It’s frankly a decisive repudiation of the administration’s approach to Russia,” said Randy Scheunemann, a foreign policy adviser to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, in the 2008 presidential election who is now working with Russian opposition figures supporting the Magnitsky bill. The administration “put human rights beyond the back burner,” he said.The administration has privately conceded that the trade and human rights measures will be merged and is trying to massage the language. While some officials once wanted to broaden the sanctions to apply worldwide rather than singling out Russia, the administration has rejected that approach, worried it would complicate relations with nations like China and Saudi Arabia. The Senate bill applies worldwide; a separate House bill applies only to Russia.Russia has threatened retaliation, and lawmakers from Moscow visited Washington last week to lobby against the sanctions, arguing that Mr. Magnitsky was not the hero his backers suggest, but they won little traction on Capitol Hill. Mr. Magnitsky’s mother, Natalia Magnitskaya, responded with a letter denouncing their statements about her son, calling them “shameful and not deserving of the honorable title of people’s representative.”Vladimir Kara-Murza, a well-known Russian journalist working in Washington, was fired after he supported the Magnitsky bill. Mr. Kara-Murza said his dismissal showed “how afraid corrupt officials and human rights violators” in Russia are. “This bill hits them where it hurts, closing access to their ill-gotten gains in the West,” he added.'"

"'12-07-18,'1','Bill de Blasio, the New York public advocate and presumptive candidate for mayor, emerged earlier this year as an unlikely ally to the city’s usually maligned yellow taxi industry.Fund-raising records for Mr. de Blasio released this week show that the industry, known for its deep pockets, did not overlook that support.Mr. de Blasio’s campaign received about $85,000 in the last six months from executives, lobbyists and other affiliates of the yellow taxi industry, slightly more than 10 percent of his receipts for the fund-raising period, according to papers filed with the city’s Campaign Finance Board.The contributions coincided with an aggressive attempt by the industry to derail a Bloomberg administration plan that would have allowed hundreds of new metered livery cabs in northern Manhattan and in the other boroughs, parts of the city traditionally underserved by yellow taxis.Mr. de Blasio loudly opposed the mayor’s plan, saying the administration had not received the proper permission from the City Council to enact it, and in May, his office filed a brief in support of a lawsuit filed by the yellow taxi industry against the city. That suit prompted a judge to halt the plan, leaving it in limbo; the city, which is counting on $1 billion in revenue tied to the plan, has appealed.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','Referring to the California city that voted this month to file for bankruptcy, Mr. Haggerty added, “I hope we can pull this off without pulling a San Bernardino and saying, ‘We’re bust.’ ”In San Antonio, George B. Hernández Jr., the president and chief executive of University Health System, which is financed in part by Bexar County taxpayers and includes University Hospital, used the calculator on his iPhone to talk about the impact of Mr. Perry’s decision. The system runs a financial-assistance program called CareLink that subsidizes the costs of health care to the uninsured. Mr. Hernández said 26,600 CareLink members would qualify for coverage if Medicaid was expanded and would no longer rely on the county subsidies. The annual cost of CareLink is roughly $2,000 per member, so a Medicaid expansion in 2014 would save the system $53.2 million a year.“There are consequences to it, and the consequences are to local taxpayers,” Mr. Hernández said of not expanding Medicaid. “There’s an opportunity for tax relief that we’re passing up.”In rejecting Washington’s proposals in an interview on Fox News and in a letter to Kathleen Sebelius, the federal secretary of health and human services, Mr. Perry emphasized his philosophic opposition to expanding Medicaid and creating a state exchange, and did not address the financial concerns of county leaders and public hospital officials. The refusal was only the latest example of Mr. Perry’s long opposition to what he sees as the overreach of Washington into state affairs. In 2009, he rejected $556 million in federal stimulus money for the state’s unemployment insurance program, saying too many strings were attached.“Every Texan has health care in this state,” Mr. Perry said on Fox News. “From the standpoint of being able to have access to health care, every Texan has that. How we pay for it and how we deliver it should be our decision, not some bureaucrat in Washington, D.C., that may have never been to Texas a day in their life or, for that matter, in any of the other 49 states, trying to mandate this one-size-fits-all health care.”Among the states, Texas has the highest uninsured rate, 24 percent, and the second-highest number of uninsured residents, 5.6 million children and adults, according to state and federal health officials.By expanding Medicaid, the government health-insurance program for low-income and sick people, and by creating an online exchange to help residents and small businesses buy health coverage, Texas would reduce the uninsured rate to 12 percent, or about 2.9 million residents, state health officials said.The federal government would pay 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid for the first three years, and in the years that followed, Texas would never pay more than 10 percent. The expanded program would cost the state roughly $16 billion over 10 years, not $26 billion as originally estimated, Thomas M. Suehs, the Texas health and human services commissioner, told a state House Appropriations Subcommittee on Thursday. Though the state would receive $100 billion in additional federal money in a Medicaid expansion over that period, Mr. Suehs said he agreed with the governor’s position.“There’s enough money in the Medicaid system — we just don’t spend it very wisely,” he told legislators. “Let’s fix what we currently have first before you debate the issue of what you want to expand and how you want to expand.”Community health advocates and others criticized the governor’s decision as long on talk but short on solutions or alternatives. Mr. Perry and his aides said he had indeed put forward a solution by calling on the federal government to allocate Medicaid financing as block grants so each state could tailor its Medicaid program to the needs of its residents. Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry, said that in opposing the expansion of Medicaid, the governor had the concerns of taxpayers in mind.“The bottom line is that whether at the federal, state or local level, expanding Medicaid under Obamacare would cost billions of tax dollars and increase the burden on hard-working taxpayers,” she said in a statement. “States and local governments can’t simply print money to cover the cost of this program when the federal government leaves us holding the bag.”Despite Mr. Perry’s rejection of key components of President Obama’s health care overhaul, Texas and its residents continue to benefit from various federal programs created by the law.From August 2010 to March 2012, the federal government paid more than $100 million in claims to about 5,100 Texans in the federally run Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan, which provides health insurance to people denied coverage by private insurers because of pre-existing conditions like cancer or diabetes. And nearly two years before Mr. Perry formally turned down the creation of a health exchange, Texas was awarded a $1 million federal grant in 2010 to plan for one.Texas later returned about $900,000 of that money, state and federal officials said.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','A teenage Tibetan monk in Sichuan Province died on Tuesday after setting himself on fire in what has become an increasingly familiar protest against harsh government policies in the region, exile groups said. The monk, Lobsang Lozin, 18, from the Gyalrong Tsodun Kirti Monastery in Ngaba, an autonomous Tibetan prefecture, died around noon, shortly after igniting his fuel-soaked garments near the monastery. Witnesses quoted by the Tibetan government in exile said he shouted slogans before he collapsed. It was the 44th self-immolation since the suicidal protests began in 2009. In March, two monks from the same monastery died after setting themselves on fire. The Chinese news media did not immediately report Tuesday’s death, but in the past it has portrayed the spate of self-immolations as acts of terrorism orchestrated by the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. He has denied the accusations, saying that protesters are motivated by a widely held belief that government policies in the region restrict religious practices and are a threat to Tibetan culture and language.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','In addition, the political winds are not blowing in their favor. The spectacular fall this spring of Bo Xilai, the Politburo member who openly espoused a populist philosophy at odds with elite leaders, offered an object lesson in the dangers of challenging the status quo. And official silence surrounding his case underscores high-level fears that any public cracks in the leadership’s facade of unity could lead its power to crumble.As a result, few people here expect the party to willingly refashion itself anytime soon. And even those within the elite prepared to discuss deeper changes, including the second-generation “princelings,” as they are known, have a stake in protecting their own privileges.“Compare now to 1989; in ’89, the reformers had the upper hand,” said Mr. Zhang, a historian formerly associated with the government’s Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, referring to the pro-democracy student protests that enjoyed the support of a number of important party leaders but were crushed in Tiananmen Square. “Twenty years later, the reformers have grown weaker. Now there are so many vested interests that they’ll be taken out if they touch anyone else’s interests.”To Mr. Zhang and others, this is the conundrum of China’s rise: the autocracy that back-flipped on Marxist ideology to forge the world’s second-largest economy seems incapable of embracing political changes that actually could prolong its own survival.Much as many Americans bemoan a gridlocked government split by a yawning partisan gap, Chinese advocates for change lament an all-powerful Communist Party they say is gridlocked by intersecting self-interests. None of the dominant players — a wealthy and commanding elite; rich and influential state industries; a vast, entrenched bureaucracy — stand to gain by ceding power to the broader public.Many who identify with the reform camp see change as inevitable anyway, but only, they say, because social upheaval will force it. In that view, discontent with growing inequality, corruption, pollution and other societal ills will inevitably lead to a more democratic society — or a sharp turn toward totalitarianism.An overriding worry is that unless change is carefully planned and executed, China risks another Cultural Revolution-style upheaval that could set it back decades.“The bureaucrats still don’t have this sense of a crisis,” one editor at a major Communist Party newspaper, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said in an interview this year. “They think that they can continue to muddle through.” And perhaps they can — at least for a while longer. Most Chinese credit the party for lifting hundreds of millions of citizens from poverty and creating a huge urbanized middle class, providing a foundation of support for the status quo.But many people are dissatisfied with an elite that retains tight political control, holds immense wealth and operates with largely unchecked authority. Scholars say the number of “mass incidents” — a vaguely defined official measure of discontent that includes spontaneous citizen protests — has doubled since 2005. The government stopped publicly reporting the total in 2006.“We recognize the achievements,” said Yang Jisheng, an editor of the liberal journal Yanhuang Chunqiu. “But we worry about how to sustain them.“The cake is extremely big, the second-biggest cake in the world. But it’s divided extremely unfairly,” Mr. Yang added. And “it’s systemic. If the system doesn’t change, it is always going to be unfair.”Some leaders share those fears. The Communist Party’s only vocal advocate of systemic reform, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, warned at his annual news conference in March that failing to overhaul the party’s leadership risked setting off a second Cultural Revolution. Political change is a common topic of debate in the government’s many research groups and in the party’s school that trains up-and-coming leaders.“Neither the rulers nor the ruled are happy with the current situation,” said Mr. Zhang, the historian. “The prevailing belief is that change is coming soon, but the question is how. Change is either going to come from the top leadership, or from the grass-roots level.”Critics complain of stagnation during President Hu Jintao’s decade in power, and note that Mr. Wen has only halfheartedly pushed for change. They say the party has focused less on addressing citizen grievances than on erecting a sophisticated security apparatus to stifle them.Mr. Hu’s stab at loosening up the Communist apparatus has been a call for “intraparty democracy,” code for giving the party’s lower ranks more voice in setting policy and choosing higher-ups. But there is scant evidence that even those minor changes in the power equation have been seriously pressed.Little is clear about the leanings of a new generation that will supplant Mr. Hu and most other members of the Politburo standing committee, the party’s top ruling body, in the transition starting this fall.The political views of Xi Jinping, China’s vice president and Mr. Hu’s anointed successor, are unknown, though he has flashed brief signs in a few speeches and meetings of what sound to analysts like more progressive leanings.Some others who seem likely to ascend to the leadership have shown glimmers of support for change. They include Li Keqiang, Mr. Wen’s expected successor as prime minister; Vice Premier Wang Qishan; Li Yuanchao, the head of the party’s powerful organization department; and Liu Yandong, a contender to become the standing committee’s only female member.“I’m optimistic,” Zhou Zhixing, a media executive and former official at a Communist Party research organization, said of the next standing committee. “I think these people have a very good understanding of China’s current situation, and they know that people’s demands include political reform.” Mr. Zhou’s Web site, Consensus Net, has become an important forum for political debate.If peaceful change is to occur, Mr. Zhou and many others say, it must begin inside the Communist Party; the lesson of Tiananmen Square is that the leadership will not tolerate threats to its control. Many speak of a transformation along the lines of that in Taiwan, where authoritarian rulers peacefully gave way to direct elections in 1996, and helped spawn today’s robust democracy.But the pro-reform contingent agrees on little else: on whether China should seek Western-style democracy, a more open form of the Communists’ single-party dictatorship or something altogether different.Populists want to remake the party to reflect Mao’s early vision, redistributing billions in government riches to the people. A so-called new democracy movement, led by a rural economist and journalist named Zhang Musheng, is gaining followers with a plan to add checks and balances to one-party rule and to significantly expand welfare benefits. But Mao-style populism is disdained by most current leaders, and Mr. Bo, perhaps its leading apostle, was felled by scandal last spring.A second Communist camp wants to open the party to internal competition, abandoning the leadership’s facade of unity and letting rival factions take their ideas to the wider party for approval. Over the long run, they say, transparency will spawn competing parties under a Communist umbrella — a sort of one-party democracy. But in a China where stability is the leadership’s obsessive concern, the notion of baring divisions at the pinnacle of power seems almost farcical.Indeed, the reformers cannot even agree on their motivation. Intellectuals and dissidents see political opening-up as an article of faith. Many in the second red generation, the children of the founding warriors, are driven by anger over what they believe China has become under Mr. Hu.“They think the Youth League has ruined the country that their fathers fought and died for,” said Mr. Zhang, the historian, referring to the Communist Youth League, which is Mr. Hu’s base of support.The beleaguered idealists cannot afford to be too choosy, though. “We welcome them,” Mr. Zhang said. “It’s better to at least have an interest in reform, no matter why.”But the sheer scope of the discord leads some who call for change to wonder whether they are less a movement than a debating society — intellectuals trading theories over plates of noodles in their apartments, the second red generation trading theories over lavish hotel banquets.“Mao used to say that ‘revolution is not a dinner party,’ ” Mr. Yang, the editor at Yanhuang Chunqiu, said sardonically. “But right now, revolution is precisely a dinner party.”'"
"'12-07-18,'1','A three-judge federal appeals panel on Tuesday upheld the first-ever federal rule protecting people from acute exposure to emissions of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant implicated in asthma attacks and other respiratory problems. The judges rejected a challenge from the American Petroleum Institute, ruling that both science and the law justified a 2010 decision by the Environmental Protection Agency to limit maximum one-hour concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere to 100 parts per billion. More than half the nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere comes from vehicles, and concentrations are greatest along highways.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','Unesco on Tuesday awarded a prize for research in the life sciences that drew controversy because it was financed by the dictator of Equatorial Guinea, a tiny, repressive and impoverished state. The award was heavily criticized by Western countries and human-rights groups as a misuse of funds by Equatorial Guinea and a stain on the reputation of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The director general of Unesco, Irina Bokova, who had opposed the prize, did not attend the ceremony, Unesco officials confirmed, citing protocol; because the president of Equatorial Guinea, Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, did not appear, Ms. Bokova sent her deputy. Western countries like the United States and France also refused to attend. The first winners, who received $100,000 apiece, were respected scientists: Maged Al-Sherbiny of Egypt, who studies vaccines; Felix Dapare Dakora of South Africa, who studies food scarcity; and Rossana Arroyo of Mexico, who studies parasitic diseases.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','Steven Rattner (“China’s Economy, Still Strong,” column, July 12) writes, “emotions and knee-jerk skepticism aside ... the economic picture looks rosy, at least to me.”China’s growth has come at a fearsome price for the Chinese people. China leads the world in wealth inequality, pollution, corruption, exploitation of its workers, and punishment of intellectuals, minorities, and artists and writers who speak for justice.Mr. Rattner acknowledges that “China may be totalitarian”; yet I wonder why the United States spent billions to defeat totalitarianism in the Soviet Union but has for years eagerly invested billions to prop up and legitimize China’s totalitarian dictatorship.Wall Street investors have profited handsomely from the lost American jobs that have gone to Chinese factories, where workers have no rights.That so many American investors and policy makers defend the Chinese Communist Party sets a morally repugnant double standard that human rights are not universal, that might makes right, and that totalitarianism isn’t so bad after all.The writer is a consultant to Radio Free Asia.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','To say that criticizing the financially successful business practices of Mitt Romney is the same as condemning capitalism misses the point. There are many ways to be successful in business. Just because most companies were outsourcing jobs to be successful doesn’t mean that there weren’t creative alternatives.A man running to be the leader of a country should be held to a different standard than the chief executive of a corporation. People rightly want to know if he can create jobs and improve the economy for all people, not just for a few shareholders at the expense of American workers.I agree wholeheartedly with David Brooks’s defense of offshoring and outsourcing as constructive elements of modern capitalism. To the extent the Obama campaign thinks those tactics are global problems, it is mistaken.Modern capitalism, most avidly practiced by Bain Capital and other private equity firms, seeks profits by employing resources around the globe. As Mr. Brooks notes, the results of that quest can be powerful positives: higher standards of living for overseas workers and lower costs for all consumers, especially American consumers.That is modern capitalism at its ruthless best, producing a net overall global benefit. But make no mistake — those tactics entail little or no regard for the American workers and communities that suffer in the process. To the extent that the Obama campaign is contrasting that disregard with Mitt Romney’s professed love for all things American, the campaign has a legitimate point.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','“We’ll see $699 systems” for ultrabooks in the fall, Mr. Otellini said. “In a softer selling season these devices become even more attractive.” While just a few kinds of ultrabooks have appeared in the last few months, Mr. Otellini said there were “over 140 designs in the pipeline” for later this year.Over 40 of these designs, he said, will have touch-sensitive screens similar to Apple’s iPad and iPhone, or the Surface tablet recently announced by Microsoft. Intel would also get a boost from the release of the new Windows 8 operating system by Microsoft, he said.Intel reported that its net income in the quarter ending in June rose to $2.8 billion, or 54 cents a share, from this time last year. Revenue climbed 5 percent, to $13.5 billion. The company appeared to have sacrificed some of its gross profit margin for the higher revenue, however. Gross margins were at 63.4 percent, compared with 64 percent a year earlier.Wall Street analysts have been lowering their outlook for semiconductor demand. Analysts had expected 52 cents a share and revenue of $13.56 billion, according to a survey of analysts by Thomson Reuters.“What’s saving them is lowered expectations,” said Douglas Freedman, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “They are performing on their business better than expected, but it is a mixed bag on growth.”Intel’s performance was significantly better than that of its chief competitor, Advanced Micro Devices. This month AMD warned that its second-quarter revenue would decline about 11 percent from the preceding quarter, instead of the 3 percent growth it had earlier projected. AMD said its results, which will be announced Thursday, had been affected by lower sales of consumer devices and slower economic growth in Europe and China.Intel is also a major supplier of chips for computer servers, which are increasingly used in cloud-based data systems. Intel said its data center sales grew 15 percent from a year ago, to $2.8 billion. Sales to PC makers rose just 3 percent over the quarter, to $8.7 billion.Unlike many tech companies, Intel continues to invest heavily in research and development. Intel previously said it would spend $18.3 billion in R&D this year, up from a little over $16 billion in 2011, but Stacy J. Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer, said that because of the lowered outlook, the company was cutting this year’s R&D to $18.2 billion.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','The world economy may be stumbling, but its consumers are still buying Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite.The Coca-Cola Company, the maker of those brands and many other beverages, reported on Tuesday that its second-quarter profit edged lower, to $2.79 billion, or $1.21 a share, compared with $2.8 billion, or $1.20 a share, in the period a year earlier, when more shares were outstanding.Coke’s performance held up despite higher ingredient costs and a 4 percent decline in sales in Europe, where a combination of abysmal weather and economic and financial crises dented the appetite for fizzy drinks. Nor is the outlook rosy, Muhtar A. Kent, Coke’s chief executive, warned analysts. “We find ourselves navigating through a challenging global economy,” he said.But Coke has been performing well under such conditions for the last couple of years, he said. “Operating in this environment has become the norm for us,” Mr. Kent added. Sales volume was up 4 percent worldwide and 1 percent in North America.The company’s use of a mix of packaging sizes, which allows it to adjust various prices — and profit margins — has helped it, as have lower prices for plastics, aluminum and other commodities.Coke’s big Olympic marketing campaign has started, with Mr. Kent carrying the torch on one leg of the pre-Olympic relay. Coke will do more recycling of its packaging at these Games than ever before, and has committed to reusing what it recycles within six weeks.Coke faced an unexpected challenge in the second quarter from Americans who apparently stayed home instead of setting out in their cars for summer vacations. That meant more people bought lower-margin multipacks of sodas than the more profitable single-serving sizes sold in gasoline stations and convenience stores.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','Stocks rose on Tuesday after Coca-Cola and Goldman Sachs joined the growing roster of companies that exceeded analysts’ profit forecasts and as the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, seemed to leave the door open to the possibility of more monetary stimulus if needed to revive the economy.Fears of a collapse in earnings have not been borne out thus far. Though the earnings season has been under way a short time, some 72 percent of the big companies that have reported have beaten estimates, albeit from a significantly lowered bar.Goldman Sachs shares ended up 0.3 percent at $97.98 even as its quarterly profit fell 12 percent. Coca-Cola, whose earnings were little changed, rose 1.6 percent to $77.69.Early on, traders were frustrated when Mr. Bernanke provided few clues about whether the Fed was planning any stimulative quantitative easing measures, known as QE3, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, and stocks moved lower.But equities rebounded after Mr. Bernanke said the Fed’s policy makers would consider a range of tools to further stimulate growth if it became clear unemployment was not falling or if deflation risks mounted.'"
"'12-07-18,'1','Mr. Almunia’s office is negotiating with Google to try to settle the commission’s concerns about the company’s dominance of the Internet search and advertising markets. The resumed compliance struggle with Microsoft, some legal experts said, could harden his position with Google.Mr. Almunia’s announcement “sounds like a warning to Google and to other technology giants in the commission’s line of fire,” said Nicolas Petit, a law professor at the University of Liège in Belgium. It shows that “settling a case is not the end of the story” and that companies must follow up with “effective monitoring mechanisms.”Mr. Petit pointed out that more than a year and a half went by in the case announced Tuesday before other companies in the sector reported the problem and the commission took action, “which suggests that this approach just did not work” because “no one noticed.”In announcing the action on Tuesday, Mr. Almunia said Microsoft committed a serious breach of E.U. antitrust rules by not complying with commitments the company made in 2009 as part of the settlement. Those sanctions, he added, could be particularly severe because, if confirmed, this would be the first time a company had defied an antitrust settlement offered by the commission.The potential fine could be up to 10 percent of a company’s global annual revenue. In Microsoft’s case that could mean a penalty of $7 billion, but it is probably unlikely to reach that level. The largest single fine ever levied by the European antitrust authorities was €1.1 billion, or $1.4 billion, in 2009 against Intel for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market. Intel is still appealing ruling.The issue on Tuesday stems from the settlement of a case concerning Microsoft’s dominance in Internet browsers.In Microsoft’s 2009 settlement, the company did not pay a fine but instead committed to installing a system called Browser Choice Screen with Windows to offer users alternatives like Chrome and Firefox to counter the strength of Internet Explorer, Microsoft’s own browser product.On Tuesday, Microsoft blamed “a technical error” for not offering users the choice of browsers it had promised. The error affected 28 million personal computers running Windows 7 SP1, the company said in a statement.The company said it only learned recently of the error when the commission sent a notification about reports it had received indicating that alternative browsers were not being offered on some personal computers.Microsoft also said it took immediate steps to resolve the issue, and said it would send all affected users’ computers a software update by the end of this week allowing users to choose a browser other than Explorer.“We have fallen short in our responsibility,” Microsoft said in a statement. “While we have taken immediate steps to remedy this problem, we deeply regret that this error occurred and we apologize for it.”Mr. Almunia also said Tuesday that more should be done in the future to monitor settlements in order to ensure that breaches do not go undetected for long periods of time.“If the commitments are not really monitored, then compliance will not be high on the list of priorities for management,” said Emanuela Lecchi, a partner at the law firm Watson, Farley & Williams in London, who does not represent clients involved in the case.E.U. officials said that the remedies negotiated in 2009 had already helped make the market for browsers fairer in Europe, where they said Chrome, Firefox and Explorer are nearly evenly matched.The officials referred to measurements by StatCounter, a company that tracks browser usage, and which showed each with about 30 percent of the market in June across 50 European countries. Microsoft’s Explorer had close to 60 percent of the European market in July 2008.Continuing to enforce the 2009 agreement by making Microsoft offer its Windows users a browse choice until 2014, when the measure was set to expire, “has proved very effective when implemented,” Mr. Almunia said Tuesday. “It gave consumers a real choice to use the product that most suited their needs,” he said.Microsoft on Tuesday offered to extend that period by an additional 15 months.The commission may have also been buoyed in its determination to crack down again on Microsoft after the commission’s victory in a different case last month, when the second-highest court in the European Union largely upheld a separate, billion-dollar penalty against Microsoft.That fine was imposed in 2008 to punish Microsoft for breaching an order to modify the way it used its Windows computer operating system in the market for powerful network server computers.Microsoft was “caught once before , so in their case it really should have been high on their list of priorities,” said Ms. Lecchi, the lawyer. She said Microsoft did have good reason to be “frightened of a big fine” in the case, given its track record.The company said it had hired outside lawyers to lead an investigation into how the error occurred. “We understand the Commission may decide to impose other sanctions,” the company said.Samuel Miller, an antitrust attorney in San Francisco with the firm Sidley Austin, declined to speculate on whether the European Commission would levy a fine against Microsoft, but he said Microsoft appeared to handle the error appropriately.“Companies sometimes make mistakes, but Microsoft did what you would hope a company would do when it discovers mistakes, which is promptly disclose and promptly try to remedy,” said Mr. Miller, who was the lead counsel in the U.S. Department of Justice’s first antitrust case against Microsoft in the mid-1990s.'"

"'12-07-19,'1','A guardian angel singing snatches from the greatest hits of the British rock band Queen is perhaps the strangest apparition in “Hand Stories,” an autobiographical work from Yeung Fai, a Chinese-born puppeteer, presented at the Clark Studio Theater as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.Mr. Yeung, the show’s creator and the principal puppeteer, was born to a father celebrated for his glove puppetry, a traditional Chinese art form that dates back centuries and is passed down directly through families. In an early sequence we watch a film from the 1960s of Mr. Yeung’s father, Yang Shen, performing a scene of courtship between a lord and lady projected on a narrow strip of screen at the back of the stage. Mr. Yeung then performs the same scene live, using beautifully fashioned hand puppets that move with a delicacy that evokes real movement and also gently lampoons it to humorous effect.Mr. Yeung’s father had the misfortune of being an artist during the violent upheaval of the Cultural Revolution, hauntingly symbolized by a silver-scaled dragon that appears, snaking through the darkness. A moving scene depicts a puppet version of Yang Shen enduring the humiliating re-education process that artists and intellectuals were forced to undergo in this grim period in Chinese history. It is chilling to discover that even an art form as seemingly innocuous as puppetry was considered suspect, and its practitioners mercilessly harassed.After the death of his father, the result of a grueling sentence of hard labor, Mr. Yeung himself is jailed, although the details of the episodic story are sometimes hard to pick out. (There are no subtitles and very little dialogue, but a synopsis is included in the program; it’s a good idea to read it beforehand.) Entering the story himself, Mr. Yeung is seen cowering in a prison cell, hiding behind Chairman Mao’s Little Red Book.Eventually freed, Mr. Yeung returns to his puppetry. One of the show’s most purely entertaining sequences takes us behind the scenes. The small stage is turned around so that we can see the mechanics of the performance — an elaborate comic sequence involving a tiger who swallows a man — while a video of what the audience would see is projected onto the screen. Surprisingly it detracts little from the enjoyment of the show itself to see how the various puppets are manipulated by the two puppeteers as they scramble back and forth behind the scenes. (Mr. Yeung is assisted by the skilled Yoann Pencolé.)You may be wondering by now exactly when and how that angel with the distinctive musical tastes enters the story. Mr. Yeung, who sent his son to the United States, eventually follows him there when the Tiananmen Square protests inspire a crackdown by the authorities. But he is unable to find work and loses his inspiration. Enter the madcap angel, who somewhat bizarrely is also apparently a piggy bank with a slot on his head for coins. The angel raises Mr. Yeung’s spirits by singing bits of Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “We Are the Champions” while flitting around his small room, pestering him to return to practicing his art.This Mr. Yeung eventually does, even if it sometimes means busking on the street with a sign on his back advertising that he is a fifth-generation puppeteer. “Hand Stories,” a production from the Théâtre Vidy-Lausanne , gives a flavorful taste of a traditional art form rarely seen and perhaps in danger of extinction.'"

After housing prices shot up in the early 2000s, when commuters from the San Francisco Bay area bought and built up homes here, the median home price plummeted by more than 60 percent in the last five years. In the first half of this year, the city had the highest foreclosure rate of any in the country, according to RealtyTrac, a company that collects foreclosure data. While it has come down a few points in recent months, for the last few years the unemployment rate hovered around 17 percent, nearly double the national average.While Stockton’s bankruptcy troubles can be traced in part to the collapse of the housing market and the subsequent erosion of the city’s tax base, for years city leaders also mismanaged and overspent funds, pushing the city into financial peril, analysts and current city officials say. Stockton cannot afford the $417 million it owes for retiree health benefits, city officials say, and this year a bank repossessed city-owned parking garages and a $40 million building the city had bought with plans for an upgraded City Hall.Since 2009, the city has cut 25 percent of its police officers, 30 percent of its Fire Department and over 40 percent of all other city employees. And while the Police Department has started hiring again, much ground has already been lost. Last year, there were 58 homicides here, a record. Halfway through 2012, there have already been 35. Other cities across the state are also teetering. On Wednesday night, city leaders in San Bernardino, Calif., voted to declare a fiscal emergency, which would allow the city to file for bankruptcy within 30 days.After the three burglaries, Ms. Hinson and her husband, John Hinson, 68, a retired city finance director, installed an alarm system, video cameras and a locking gate at their home. But when the alarm goes off, which it has on several occasions, they say the police do not come. “They used to serve and protect, but now they can’t protect us anymore,” said Ms. Hinson, who works for a company that manages homeowner associations. “We have to protect ourselves.”To that end, the Hinsons joined their neighborhood watch group and have started patrolling the city park adjoining their house. Stockton now has about 100 neighborhood watch groups, and more are forming all the time as concern over rising crime spreads, according to police officials.Some predict the city will see a boom in self-policing efforts similar to the one that occurred in nearby Vallejo, which experienced a 40-fold increase in neighborhood watch groups since it filed for bankruptcy in 2008.Cuts at the Stockton Police Department have improved the fortunes of private security companies. Delta Hawkeye Security Services, the largest private security company in the city, has seen an 80 percent increase in business since 2009, according to Ron Cancio, the company’s manager. Homeowner associations, landlords and businesses hire officers for $18 to $25 an hour (with or without a gun) to do work that until recently was done by city police.“People call us before they call the police because we respond quicker,” Mr. Cancio said.This year, the increase in crime and clients prompted Delta Hawkeye to have 10 of its 75 officers certified to carry firearms and Tasers. The company intends to triple the number of armed officers by next summer, Mr. Cancio said.Darien Wilson, 19, carries a gun during his graveyard shift, while he zigzags around town in his company-issued Hyundai, checking on dozens of foreclosed houses and responding to everything from domestic violence calls to reports of fistfights. If he sees a violent crime in progress, he calls the police. But he also uses his Taser and pepper spray and can handcuff people until the police arrive. He says most often the sight of an armed officer sends people running.“Not very many 19-year-olds can say they’re armed and working security on the streets of one of the most dangerous cities in America,” Mr. Wilson said.While the city’s financial morass has allowed Mr. Wilson’s ilk more responsibility and swagger, it has left a multitude of others in need of refuge, a roof and a hot meal.In 2008, 716 battered women received counseling at the Women’s Center Youth & Family Services, a nonprofit here serving victims of domestic violence. Last year that number had jumped to 3,347. The center’s shelters are over-capacity, said Joelle Gomez, the center’s executive director. “We’ve never seen anything like the increases we’ve seen in the last four to five years in calls to our helplines, our emergency shelter, counseling services and requests for restraining orders,” Ms. Gomez added. They also arrive more brutalized. “The nature of the domestic violence that is occurring is more violent than we’ve seen before,” Ms. Gomez said. “People have lost their sense of hope and stability, and with that comes a lot of anger.”The city’s homeless shelters are operating at 125 percent capacity and have been since 2009 when foreclosures left many, particularly renters, with nowhere to go, said John Reynolds, executive director of Stockton Shelter for the Homeless, a nonprofit with multiple shelters throughout city.The hardships here are hardly limited to those already at the margins of poverty. The women’s shelter has seen more middle- and upper-middle-class battered women. “These days almost every person I see has been through foreclosure or their mortgages are seriously underwater,” said Timothy Miller, a psychologist who has served wealthier Stocktonians for 30 years. “People feel absolutely crushed by that pressure.”Even the city’s cats, dogs and parakeets have become orphans of economic adversity. Officials at the Delta Humane Society & S.P.C.A. said the shelter was 60 percent over capacity, forced to turn away those who try to drop pets off they cannot afford, or animals that, along with their owners, lost homes to foreclosure.“People are dropping off boxes of kittens at the gate during the night,” said Patrice Davidson, the executive director. “We’ve got kittens in the bathroom and cat cages in the lobby.”Stocktonians disagree on whether bankruptcy will, in the end, help or harm their city. Some say Chapter 9 is a stain the city will never be rid of while others swear it is the last chance to crawl back from insolvency and tough luck.Regardless of where they fall on that spectrum, many residents’ misfortunes track with the city’s own.Yuri Campos’s grandparents first arrived here as farm workers from Mexico 50 years ago. As the city grew from an agricultural town into what was, until recently, a rapidly expanding exurb, Ms. Campos’ family grew with it. She bought a house, had a son and opened a shop called Party Barn specializing in handmade piñatas. But these days few here have the means, or the will, for parties.As the city stumbled into financial ruin, Ms. Campos, 30, and her family fell with it. By last November, the bank had foreclosed on her house and the homes of three other family members in town.Ms. Campos started looking at rental listings in Southern California cities like Oxnard and Long Beach. One of her aunts decamped for Arizona.Then in March, Ms. Campos was at a bar when a fight broke out and a man was shot and killed. When she tried to contact the police with information about what happened, she says no one at the Police Department would meet with her or call her back.By the end of June, the city’s bankruptcy made national headlines and for the first time in her life, Ms. Campos began to feel something akin to shame.“People will ask me, ‘Where are you from?’ ” she said. “Sometime I hesitate to say. I just feel like they’ll think I’m a violent person. They’ll look at me like I might hurt them.”'"
"'12-07-19,'1','It is a sad fact of Republican politics that wild statements from its right flank are rarely challenged by ranking party leaders. Give credit to John McCain, too often a wayward voice in recent years, for taking to the Senate floor Wednesday to skewer a crackpot allegation of a Muslim Brotherhood conspiracy to infiltrate the government.The claims involve Huma Abedin, a Muslim who is a trusted, longtime aide to Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton. Senator McCain, who knows Ms. Abedin from her years of Senate and diplomatic work, properly condemned the “unfounded attack on an honorable woman, a dedicated American and a loyal public servant.”Representative Michele Bachmann and four Republican colleagues have called for a federal investigation in a mischievous resort to McCarthyism that questioned Ms. Abedin’s loyalty and cited a right-wing think tank’s purported research. In one letter to the State Department, lawmakers alleged the department, with “the specific direction” of Secretary Clinton, took actions “enormously favorable to the Muslim Brotherhood and its interests.”Without naming fellow Republicans, Senator McCain dismissed the accusation as “sinister,” devoid of any evidence and “specious and degrading.” The senator said: “Huma represents what is best about America: the daughter of immigrants, who has risen to the highest levels of our government on the basis of her substantial personal merit and her abiding commitment to the American ideals that she embodies so fully.”Since his defeat for the White House four years ago, Senator McCain has too often seemed a listless, unpredictable political figure, forgetful of his own bearings as his party steered resolutely rightward. It was heartening to hear him back on deck condemning Know-Nothingism, especially in a week that started with his vote against a campaign finance disclosure act that should have had his strong backing.'"
"'12-07-19,'1','MADRID — A plane has finally reached the ghost airport of Castellón, in southeastern Spain.Rather than sitting on the runway, however, the aircraft, an aluminum model, was placed this week atop a giant statue along the entrance road to the airport — another twist in the tale of a $183 million project that has become a symbol of the wasteful spending that has sunk Spain deep into a recession and a banking crisis.The statue, 79 feet tall and budgeted at $375,000, was supposed to honor Carlos Fabra, the longstanding head of Castellón’s provincial government and the driving force behind the airport project.Mr. Fabra was placed under judicial investigation this year in connection with several cases of corruption and tax evasion. He has not been charged, however, and he is not expected to appear in court before the end of the year.On Saturday, Mr. Fabra formally stepped down as the head of the provincial branch of Spain’s governing Popular Party, which he had run for 22 years. He still maintains the chairmanship of the public company that runs the airport.Even though the airport has failed to attract a single scheduled flight, Mr. Fabra has staunchly defended his project. In March 2011, when the airport was formally inaugurated, he argued that it would provide a unique opportunity to turn an airport into a tourist attraction, giving visitors full access to the runway and other areas normally kept out of bounds because of safety concerns.On Saturday, he again described the airport as “a necessary development tool” for his province. Castellón lies in the region of Valencia, which has a debt load of just under $25 billion and a credit rating that was recently downgraded to junk status.'"
"'12-07-19,'1','“The first two days were rough on my toddler,” Mary Pedone Howard wrote on the Facebook wall for Viacom, where hundreds have posted angry rants against the company (and against DirecTV). Now, though, when it is TV time, she said her daughter asks for the Disney Channel instead. “Leave it to a 3-year-old to show mom that adaptation is a great thing,” she wrote.It will take months to determine whether there are long-term effects to this “forced sampling,” as another irritated parent, Brian Chisholm, called it on Facebook.First, the blackout has to end, and on Wednesday, there was no new sign of light. On Wednesday afternoon Derek Chang, an executive vice president of DirecTV, said that “we’re exchanging ideas” with Viacom in “multiple calls every day.” But Denise Denson, his counterpart at Viacom, said in a telephone interview a few minutes later that the two companies were at an impasse. Her daily calls with Mr. Chang, she said, are short and insubstantial. “We don’t see an end in sight to the blackout,” she said.Blackouts of cable channels are rare, and when they do happen, they tend to be resolved within hours, not days.“I’ve never seen a situation like this. The outage has lasted so long and it’s so broad,” said Sandy Wax, the president of Sprout, a channel for children backed by NBCUniversal and the Public Broadcasting Service. DirecTV made Sprout, which was already available to most of its subscribers, available to all after the blackout started.“We don’t relish this happening to anyone,” Ms. Wax said in an interview. But “the idea that more customers are going to be able to sample us,” she admitted, “that’s a positive for us.”She added, “Hopefully they’ll come back after all the dust settles.”About 2.5 million people are typically watching Viacom’s children’s channels at any given time, according to Nielsen. The flagship Nickelodeon started to see a drop-off in viewership late last year, causing alarm at the highest levels of Viacom. The reasons for the declines continue to be debated, with some citing a lack of new hit shows and others blaming the Web streaming of shows like “SpongeBob SquarePants.” But it is clear that the dispute with DirecTV has deepened the channel’s ratings decline.On July 10, the day before the blackout started, 1.76 million viewers were watching Nick during the day, according to Nielsen. On July 11, that average dropped to 1.23 million, a drop of 30 percent overnight. DirecTV distributes TV to about 20 percent of the households in America that pay for cable or satellite TV.The Disney Channel, which had already been gaining on Nickelodeon, seemingly picked up some of the disappearing audience, though it is hard to draw a direct connection between the DirecTV blackout and the Disney gains.“Disney has been gaining share, anyway,” Todd Juenger, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday. “Certainly some percentage of kids (and moms/decision makers) will get hooked on Disney programming and stay with it.”In the first six months of the year, the Disney Channel had about 1.64 million viewers at any given time. In the first five days of the DirecTV blackout of Viacom programming, it had about 2.27 million viewers.Smaller channels for children have seen sharp gains, as well. The Hub, a relatively small player in the space co-owned by Discovery Communications and Hasbro, had about 88,000 viewers at any given time earlier this year, and about 159,000 viewers since the blackout took effect. Sprout had about 153,000 viewers before the blackout, and about 264,000 since.A few days after the blackout began, DirecTV announced carriage of another channel for children, Disney Junior. Representatives for Disney declined interview requests on Wednesday. But they were more than happy to share ratings data about the success of their channels.Mr. Chang, too, noted in an interview that “Disney is obviously gaining quite a bit from Nick.” DirecTV has helped, by replacing Nickelodeon in its lineup with interactive links to alternative channels for children. “A lot of viewers are saying, ‘I found stuff I didn’t know existed, and this is great,’ ” Mr. Chang said.Ms. Denson of Viacom said she was not surprised that Nickelodeon and the other channels had sagged in recent days. “In the short term, we will endure ratings issues,” she said. “But in the long term, DirecTV will endure long-term asset loss from customers leaving or customers never coming on in the first place.”Maybe, maybe not. In the meantime, just try explaining a corporate spat to a 5-year-old.'"
"'12-07-19,'1','The owners of a fast-growing Queens company that teaches toddlers with disabilities took nearly $1.5 million from a public preschool program, paying themselves inflated salaries and rent, and billing the government for their cars, children’s furniture and even cosmetics, a state audit has found.The company’s owners, who were once married, also violated tax regulations, gave the wife’s sister a no-show job and wrongly billed the state for utility expenses incurred by a private day care business they operate on the side, investigators said.Investigators for the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, referred their findings in the audit, to be released Thursday, to prosecutors in the Queens district attorney’s office, his office said, and may also alert state tax authorities.State records show that billings by the company, Bilingual SEIT and Preschool, based in Flushing, exploded over the last decade, to more than $15 million in the 2010-11 school year, from $808,935 in 2002-3. Most of its revenue comes from employing “special education itinerant teachers,” or SEITs, who work one-on-one with children in their homes or in nursery schools.But auditors examining just two years of the company’s records said they found a wide array of overcharges and improper accounting: The executive director, Cheon Park, overpaid his wife, Hyun Ham, by more than $100,000 over that period, calling her an assistant executive director when she was really a payroll clerk. The two began paying themselves and other employees as independent contractors, avoiding payment of hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes. And Ms. Ham, who owned the buildings where their company ran preschools, charged the state for the interest on her mortgages.'"
"'12-07-19,'1','It was the sort of minor transaction that happens in every N.B.A. preseason, the kind that merits a one-line mention in the local newspaper and is quickly forgotten. In this case, Morey had unknowingly provided one of the signature lines in Lin’s now-famous profile, as the undrafted, overlooked, twice-waived kid from Harvard.The first waiver was executed by the Golden State Warriors, Lin’s hometown team, two weeks earlier. But it was the Rockets’ decision that indirectly sent Lin to New York, setting in motion a chain of events that would save the Knicks’ season and captivate much of the sports world.Lin’s soon-to-be-legendary streak was just three games old — with averages of 25.3 points and 8.3 assists in victories over the Nets, Utah and Washington — when Morey started answering queries and taunts on Twitter, where he is a semiregular participant.Fans prodded for signs of regret. Morey demurred at first, acknowledging that Lin was “a very good player,” but that “Linsanity was not happening here this year.” Finally, someone accused Morey of being “defensive” and asked, “Why not just accept the mistake?” So Morey did, breaking with years of tradition and well-worn platitudes by sports executives everywhere.Five months later, Morey ensured he would not make the same mistake. The Rockets courted Lin harder than any other team, the Knicks included. They made an initial offer of three years and $19 million — the only formal offer Lin received — during the July moratorium, so named because deals can be negotiated but not signed.When the Knicks publicly declared they would match the deal, Morey bumped the offer to $25 million, with a $14.9 million balloon payment in the third year that was explicitly intended to make the Knicks squirm. As a high-payroll team, the Knicks would have had to pay a staggering luxury tax, as much as $35 million, in that final season.After months of public and private assurances that they would keep Lin at any cost, the Knicks for the first time wavered. Days later, the Knicks caved and let their most popular player in 10 years walk away.As hearts broke in New York and Linsanity took root in Texas on Tuesday night, Morey idled outside a Las Vegas fast-food restaurant, shouting his family’s order into the drive-through speaker. Morey, a 39-year-old father of two, had left the Cox Pavilion at U.N.L.V. a short time earlier, after watching the Rockets’ summer league team beat Portland’s, 99-88.The Rockets’ greater victory had just occurred in New York, but Morey had no time to celebrate. After apologizing for the background ruckus and straightening out French-fry portions, he reflected on the symmetry of the moment.“Obviously, a player we didn’t want to let go,” Morey said. “Ended up letting him go last year, and we’re excited for him and how he blossomed in New York. And we’re thrilled to have him back in Houston.”In some quarters, Morey has been criticized (anonymously) for violating an unwritten code by changing the terms of Lin’s deal. It was a legal maneuver, however, because no contract had been signed. Two rival executives contacted Wednesday said Morey was well within bounds, technically and ethically. In fact, they praised Morey for the bold maneuver.Others question the wisdom of a $25 million deal for a player with 25 career starts, but Morey is not much of a conventional thinker, or even a conventional N.B.A. executive. With a master’s degree in business administration from M.I.T. and a bachelor’s degree in computer science, Morey was the first advanced-statistics practitioner to become an N.B.A. general manager, in May 2007.At the time the Rockets promoted Morey, analytics were hardly part of the N.B.A. conversation. Now nearly every team in the league sends a representative to the annual M.I.T. Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, a veritable advanced-stats festival, which Morey runs.Bill Simmons, an ESPN columnist, has dubbed the conference “Dorkapalooza” and crowned Morey as “Dork Elvis,” because of his exalted status among the young stat geeks drawn to the event.As a general manager, Morey has advocated a blend of old-school scouting and new-age analysis, and the Rockets have an impressive record of discovering hidden gems in the draft, from Aaron Brooks (the 26th overall pick) and Carl Landry (31st) in 2007 to Chase Budinger (44th in 2009) and Chandler Parsons (38th in 2011).The search for a superstar — the high-salary, high-ceiling players who change a franchise — has proved more challenging. Morey has repeatedly acquired and flipped high-value players and draft picks, reshuffling the roster in a perpetual quest to put the Rockets in position to make a blockbuster trade.“A mad scientist,” one rival team executive said, using the term as a compliment. “He’s creative.”Morey was one of the few executives willing to acquire Carmelo Anthony without any long-term assurances in 2011, when Anthony was pushing Denver to trade him to the Knicks. He had threatened not to re-sign anywhere else, but Morey was undaunted, believing he could persuade Anthony to stay if he got him.Now Morey is pushing hard to acquire Orlando’s Dwight Howard, who similarly has demanded a trade to one team (the Nets) with a threat to leave any other. To make room for Howard — and the bad contracts Orlando would want to dump in a trade — Morey has virtually stripped Houston’s roster of veteran talent, waiving Luis Scola and trading Lowry to Toronto (for a draft pick he can send to Orlando). He let Dragic leave for Phoenix, rather than tie up cap room.Morey is the only N.B.A. general manager who regularly interacts with fans through social media, even trading occasional barbs with Simmons and other writers on Twitter. His Facebook profile page includes two Chinese characters, a phonetic translation of his name in Mandarin (mo lei).The Rockets have enjoyed strong ties to China ever since drafting Yao Ming, and they are poised to capitalize on those relationships now with Lin, the only Taiwanese-American player in the N.B.A.But it is Lin, the player, who has most intrigued Morey. Where others see a risk, Morey sees a high-value play — a talented player with a high work ethic and high intelligence who has improved tremendously in a very short time. “An extremely, extremely good risk,” Morey said.“We have a young team with every player on the upswing of their career,” Morey said, “and we think Jeremy is someone who can help lead that group.”Later Tuesday night, Morey was back on Twitter, his message both celebratory and sheepish.“Welcome to Houston @JLin7!” he wrote. “We plan to hang on this time.”'"
"'12-07-19,'1','Novatek is partly owned by Gennady N. Timchenko, one of a coterie of longtime acquaintances of President Vladimir V. Putin who have made fortunes in business during Mr. Putin’s tenure in the Kremlin. Mr. Timchenko, once a little-known sales manager of a local oil refinery, also co-owns a commodity trading company that moves billions of dollars in oil, including for the Russian state oil company Rosneft.Mr. Putin and Mr. Timchenko have denied that their relationship played any role in the success of Mr. Timchenko’s businesses, and Mr. Timchenko partly won a lawsuit in which he insisted he was not a “friend” of Mr. Putin, but an acquaintance.A spokesman for Mr. Timchenko, Anton Kurevin, denied that Mr. Timchenko had lobbied the government for concessions for Novatek, and attributed the company’s success to its “outstanding management skill and high level of corporate governance.”The French oil giant Total owns 15 percent of Novatek, and Gazprom owns 10 percent. Novatek has been gaining market share in Russia at the expense of Gazprom, reaching a deal to sell gas to the Magnitogorsk steel mill and the regional government of Chelyabinsk, for example. However, Novatek had been excluded from the vastly more lucrative export market, where Gazprom has had a legal monopoly since 2006.Novatek had already skirted this law for its exports from a liquefied natural gas project on the Yamal Peninsula, in the Russian Arctic, by agreeing to sell the gas through Gazprom’s export subsidiary, rather than directly to international markets. But that project is years from completion.The deal with EnBW would open the spigot sooner.In a news release last Thursday that did not disclose the seller, EnBW said the first deliveries were scheduled for October. The utility said it would spend about 600 billion euros over 10 years to buy gas under the new contract.Dirk Ommeln, a spokesman for the utility, said in an e-mail that the seller had asked not to be identified. Stock traders, though, quickly decided it was Novatek, and shares in the Russian company rose sharply after the statement went out.Kommersant, a Russian business newspaper, reported that Novatek had struck a deal with the export arm of Gazprom to act as an intermediary, complying with the law and giving Novatek access to Gazprom’s pipeline network.The rationale for Gazprom’s legal monopoly on exports was to prevent competition among Russian companies that would push down the price of natural gas in Europe. But those prices have been tumbling anyway because of an abundance of liquefied natural gas and the weak economy. Russia supplied 26 percent of Europe’s natural gas in 2011.Allowing a second seller into the market might help the Russian industry retain market share, but it could also have long-range consequences for the country’s economy. Gazprom has used its immense, legally protected profits from European sales to finance drilling in the far north and, critics say, to dispense patronage and wield political influence.'"
"'12-07-19,'1','Most analysts said they thought that Mr. Netanyahu, whose term officially ends in October 2013, could hold off elections for a few more months. But the date does not make much difference, they said, so long as he remains peerless.Mr. Netanyahu’s term has been largely quiet, with little domestic terrorism, and his finance minister, Yuval Steinitz, told Israel Radio on Wednesday that the government had “protected Israel’s citizens from the global economic crisis.”Mr. Netanyahu, of the conservative Likud Party, has pursued a cautious line.When he was forming a government after the February 2009 elections, he turned to those he described as his “natural partners,” parties representing the Israeli right and the ultra-Orthodox. In recent months, even with the centrist Kadima in the government, he has done nothing to upset those constituencies, and Kadima’s short tenure in the coalition had no apparent impact on policy.Instead, when the Supreme Court ordered the evacuation of five buildings housing 30 families in Ulpana, an offshoot of a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, because they were built on privately owned Palestinian land, Mr. Netanyahu persuaded the residents to move out quietly by making an offer that their leaders could not refuse — a promise to build hundreds of additional settler homes.And after the Supreme Court invalidated a law that exempted masses of ultra-Orthodox Jews engaged in religious studies from military service, on grounds that it was unconstitutional, Mr. Netanyahu determined to replace it with a law that would phase in a more equitable distribution of the burdens of citizenship while not overstepping the lines that his religious partners could tolerate.Critics of Mr. Netanyahu say that he has chosen his and his party’s alliance with the religious parties over the interests of the country.The fast-growing ultra-Orthodox population is an important political force because its voters are disciplined and tend to vote according to the instructions of rabbis.But Nahum Barnea, a columnist for the newspaper Yediot Aharonot and one of Israel’s most prominent political commentators, said in an interview that when it came to building governing coalitions, the religious parties would go with whoever promised to preserve their interests.“The only alliance they have is with the Holy One, blessed be he,” he added.The Israeli public, meanwhile, has been losing its faith in the political system. Voter turnout has declined over the years to about 65 percent in the 2009 elections, compared with figures closer to 80 percent through the 1990s, according to the Israel Democracy Institute, an independent research organization in Jerusalem.Hundreds of thousands participated in protests for socioeconomic change last summer, and about 20,000 people took to the Tel Aviv streets this month to demand a broader draft and the ouster of politicians who opposed it. But enthusiasm for that issue could fade, analysts said.“By the winter, there will be so many other issues,” said Shmuel Sandler, another professor who specializes in politics at Bar-Ilan University, adding that the military draft issue “is not going to be at the center.”Peter Medding, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, listed Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran and Syria as just a few of the other factors that could present a challenge and affect the Israeli agenda.No matter what, he said, Mr. Netanyahu was “perceived in the polls as the most suitable, the most capable” candidate for prime minister.Neither Shaul Mofaz, the Kadima leader, nor Ms. Yacimovich of the Labor Party are considered to pose a serious threat to Mr. Netanyahu at this stage. Commentators have suggested that Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister who was acquitted last week of two major corruption charges, could eventually make a comeback and challenge Mr. Netanyahu if he were to unite all the centrist parties and forces.But for now, Mr. Olmert is awaiting sentencing after being convicted of breach of trust in a third matter, and he remains embroiled in another serious corruption case, in which he is charged with taking bribes in connection with a real estate deal while he was the mayor of Jerusalem.“Mr. Netanyahu is not popular in the popular sense of the word,” said Mr. Barnea, the columnist. “But he is accepted because he is the only prime minister around.”'"
"'12-07-19,'1','The Obama administration warned Wednesday that food supplies were at risk from the worsening drought afflicting more than half of the country and called on Congress to revive lapsed disaster aid programs.President Obama reviewed the situation with Tom Vilsack, the agriculture secretary, who called it “the most serious situation” in about 25 years and added that he was praying for rain.“I get on my knees every day, and I’m saying an extra prayer now,” Mr. Vilsack told reporters at the White House after his discussions with Mr. Obama. “If I had a rain prayer or rain dance I could do, I would do it.”Mr. Vilsack said 1,297 counties, or roughly a third of those in the nation, had been designated disaster areas. He said 39 more were being added on Wednesday.More than three-quarters of the nation’s corn and soybean crops are in drought-affected areas, and more than a third of those crops are now rated poor to very poor, Mr. Vilsack said. The price of corn has increased in recent weeks by 38 percent, and the price of beans is up 24 percent. The country may still have the third-largest corn crop in history because earlier good weather encouraged planting, but Mr. Vilsack said the drought would increase food prices into 2013.The cost of beef, poultry and pork may go down in the short term because those herds are being liquidated, putting more meat on the market, he said. But those prices will probably rise later in the year or early next year.He declined to speculate on whether the drought was tied to climate change. “All we know is that right now there are a lot of farmers and ranchers who are struggling,” Mr. Vilsack said, adding that the priority should be “what we can do to help them.”'"
"'12-07-19,'1','“The whole thing is available, except for the black stripe,” an agency spokesman, Aaron Donovan, said. (The message beneath the stripe, instructing riders the direction in which they should swipe, will also remain.)Mr. Donovan said it was quite likely that many classic yellow cards would remain in circulation even after any advertising buys. But New Yorkers will not be able to choose. “Whatever card is next up in the stack is the next one you get,” he said.The bid to raise revenue at the financially strained agency comes months before hearings are expected on a possible fare increase. It is unclear when ad-covered MetroCards may start appearing.The authority has sold space on the backs of cards intermittently since 1995, beginning with a campaign promoting an Anita Baker album. The most recent campaign came in February, when Domino’s Pizza advertised its $7.99 pies. The card was distributed only in Brooklyn.The front of the MetroCard, though, has remained virtually untouched since 1997, with the introduction of what was then called the MetroCard Gold.Advertisers can place advertisements on the backs of 50,000 cards for $25,500 and on 2.5 million cards for $450,000, Mr. Donovan said. Rates for the front have not yet been determined but will be higher than those charged for the back.Amy Schulz, 31, from Hell’s Kitchen, said brandishing a standard yellow MetroCard was a rite of passage when she moved to the city eight years ago from Texas.“People associate New York with the subway,” she said. “And when you think of the subway, that picture — the yellow and blue, with ‘M.T.A.’ — is what you think of. It’s what I reach for in my wallet.”On an uptown C train on Wednesday afternoon, one rider complained that “the commercialization of humanity is destroying everything in the world” and suggested “it would be nice to have public transportation separate from brainwashing.”He declined to give his name, he said, pulling his hat low, because “all great philosophers are anonymous.”Still, many noted that the cards themselves were not very old and that similar laments of a bygone era were commonplace at the time of the subway token’s demise. Any extra revenue, these travelers said, was a good thing.“I think most people would rather have an advertisement than an increase in fares,” said Julissa Rivas, 17, a high school student from Washington Heights.“If it bothers you,” Jim Mooney, 50, from Rego Park, Queens, said of a prospective ad, “don’t look at it.”Gene Russianoff, the staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group, said he appreciated the transportation authority’s quest for alternative revenue but was “skeptical that charging premium rates for the front of MetroCards will yield a lot.”Sacrificing its most visible branding space could also prove costly for the authority. Micah Wallace, 24, a designer from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said visitors’ immediate connection between the card and the agency could dissipate without a constant reminder.“People scrapbook this when they go on vacation,” he said of the current card, removing one from his pocket. “Will it become a Coca-Cola card?”'"
"'12-07-19,'1','Re “To Use and Use Not: A New Edition of ‘A Farewell to Arms’ Includes Alternate Endings” (Arts pages, July 5):A couple of years ago, I reread “The Old Man and the Sea” and “A Farewell to Arms” and found reading Ernest Hemingway’s eloquent and profound prose a joy once again. I look forward to buying the new edition of “A Farewell to Arms” and reading the alternative endings along with the early drafts.I will be reminded once again how technology has changed our lives. The computer has replaced the handwritten manuscript, and if Hemingway were writing today, his changes could be easily deleted and not become part of literary history. What a loss that would be.'"
"'12-07-19,'1','Most of the entities are clearing agencies, which facilitate the confirmation and settlement of trades of financial instruments and the transfer of funds underlying the trade.The financial market utilities are one of three groups that the council will designate as “systemically important.” The other groups, whose members have not yet been designated, are financial institutions — mainly banks — and nonbank financial companies. The council is in the process of identifying those members.Half of the market utilities group consists of entities overseen by the S.E.C.: the Depository Trust Company, the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, the National Securities Clearing Corporation and the Options Clearing Corporation.Two others are overseen by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission: the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and ICE Clear Credit, which provides clearing services for credit-default swaps. And two are primarily regulated by the Fed, the Clearing House Payments Company, which operates the Clearing House Interbank Payments System, and CLS Bank International, which provides settlement services for foreign-exchange transactions.The firms were selected unanimously at a closed meeting of the council on Wednesday.At an open session, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary and council chairman, said significant work remained to be done.Among the priorities, he said, are additional reforms both for money market funds and for the tri-party repo market, where securities dealers finance their portfolios through repurchase agreements. The S.E.C. has been studying money market reforms for more than a year, and is expected soon to recommend regulations that it hopes will make the funds less vulnerable to an investor run if a fund has significant losses.The council also called for greater customer protection standards and segregation of customer assets, problems that came to light with the recent failures of MF Global and Peregrine Financial Group.Fixing “the broken housing finance system” is also a priority, Mr. Geithner said, as is a tightening of mortgage servicing standards. In a nod to JPMorgan Chase’s losses earlier this year, the council called for financial institutions to have independent risk-management structures that “establish clear accountability for failures of risk management.”High-speed trading deserves attention, the council said. It called for the S.E.C. and the C.F.T.C. to consider adopting regulations and “risk-management standards for exchanges, clearing firms and other market participants that are relevant for a high-speed trading environment.”The council identified the euro zone as perhaps the biggest threat to the nation’s financial stability. While noting that the direct net exposures of large American banks to volatile European states are “small relative to capital,” it offered a stern warning: “A systemic crisis in Europe, in which contagion and spillover effects spread widely among euro area countries and markets, represents a significant risk for U.S. institutions.”In addition, the so-called fiscal cliff — which includes the expiration of individual tax cuts and extended unemployment benefits, as well as spending cuts mandated by the Budget Control Act — “represents a threat to the recovery and financial stability if not addressed,” the report said.'"
"'12-07-19,'1','“A deeper euro area crisis would have substantial global implications,” the I.M.F. said in its report, which also warned of other possible shocks to the euro currency bloc, including the failure of a big bank.The central bank did not comment on the fund’s report.Deflation is typically a feature of severe economic decline and soaring joblessness that far outweighs any benefit to consumers from falling prices. A downward price spiral would make it harder for countries like Greece, Italy and Spain to control government debt, the fund said, because falling prices and wages would further depress tax receipts.Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy has been a leading proponent of government bond buying by the central bank. Spanish leaders have been pleading with the bank to buy their bonds and hold down borrowing costs.The central bank has spent 212 billion euros, or $260 billion, at the current exchange rate, buying government bonds since 2010, but has resisted calls for it to mimic the much larger purchases by the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England.Since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed has made two rounds of purchases, totaling hundreds of billions of dollars. Many economists say this quantitative easing is a reason the United States economy recovered from the crisis faster than most of its European counterparts.Richard Barwell, an economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, doubted that the central bank would follow the monetary fund’s advice without evidence of deflation throughout the euro zone. “I think they would view it as being counterproductive,” he said. “It would be alleviating all pressure on policy makers to solve the underlying cause of the problem.”But fund officials framed their call for big bond purchases as a way for the central bank to maintain its control over interest rates and contain borrowing costs for troubled countries.“It is an essential part of the E.C.B. fulfilling its mandate,” Helge Berger, an adviser in the fund’s European department, said during a conference call Wednesday with reporters.Quantitative easing is how central banks stimulate the economy when they have already pushed interest rates as low as they can go. This month, the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate below 1 percent for the first time, to 0.75 percent. But quantitative easing is opposed by Germany, the biggest contributor to the bank, because it would amount to the use of the central bank to finance governments. And German sentiment carries weight with the bank, which is reluctant to further divide the euro zone.Mr. Draghi has given no clear signals that the bank is seriously considering quantitative easing or other measures. But on Tuesday, at a meeting here with Michael Noonan, the Irish finance minister, Mr. Draghi tentatively addressed a widespread concern that central bank bond buying hurts more than it helps. For instance, it could make the central bank a senior creditor over other bond buyers, who would then be at greater risk if a government defaulted on its bonds.This year, when the central bank, I.M.F. and European Union agreed to another rescue of Greece, the bank would not share in the losses that private investors were required to take on their Greek bonds. That position inadvertently increased the perceived risk of other governments’ bonds, by signaling that private investors would be last to collect in case of future losses.But Mr. Draghi, at his meeting with Mr. Noonan, apparently indicated that the central bank was reconsidering its insistence that it rank above private investors when it holds a government’s bonds. “Mr. Draghi noted that the question of burden sharing with senior bond holders is evolving at the European level,” the bank said in a statement later.The fund’s warning about deflation was part of a report on euro zone policies in which the fund again criticized European leaders’ handling of the euro crisis. “The deepening of the crisis suggests that its root causes remain unaddressed,” the report said. It faulted what it said was a lack of “ambitious policies to restore strong and balanced growth across the euro area.”“The viability of the monetary union itself” is in doubt, the fund said. It praised progress by European leaders in recent weeks on creating a banking union with a central regulator — based at the E.C.B. — which it said would help prevent national regulators from pursuing policies designed to protect their banks at the expense of those of other countries.Common bank supervision “allows banks to be guided by European or euro area considerations,” Mahmood Pradhan, deputy director of the fund’s European department, said during the conference call.But the fund said that euro zone countries needed to go further, eventually issuing common debt and ceding some authority over their national finances. Germany and some other countries remain firmly opposed to common debt, so-called euro bonds, unless they have more control over spending by other euro zone countries. France and other countries favor euro bonds but have not been willing to give up control over their own budgets.The fund acknowledged that it would take time to build a more durable currency union and said that central bank action was needed in the meantime.“Monetary policy can play a role in easing the transition until structural reforms become effective,” the fund said. “Because inflation is low and falling, the E.C.B. has room for lowering rates, and deploying additional unconventional measures would relieve severe stress in some markets.”In a response to the report on behalf of European Union institutions, Ambroise Fayolle, who represents France on the executive board of the fund, said that officials were “in broad agreement” with the fund’s conclusions. He highlighted the progress that European leaders had made to impose more spending discipline on one another and strengthen the banking system.“The authorities reiterate their resolve to take all the necessary actions to preserve the integrity and stability of the euro area,” he said in a statement.'"

They might describe a drive along the Pacific Coast Highway, a lingering sunset or laughing with loved ones. After each recollection, participants inhale and exhale together, slowly. The point of the exercise is to attain the same mental state that they aim to elicit with the mobile applications they are developing.“Designing Calm,” a graduate course at Stanford’s Institute of Design, is part of an emerging field that seeks to alleviate stress by embedding mindfulness into the devices that pervade contemporary life.“Chronic stress primes the body for all kinds of disease and dysfunction,” says Neema Moraveji, who directs Stanford’s new Calming Technology Lab. “Here, we are focused on calmers, which trigger the opposite of stress: a state of calm, or flow, for the user.”Dr. Moraveji’s work is based on studies demonstrating that slow, steady breathing, along with cultivating gratitude and savoring pleasurable experiences, can improve productivity and well-being. His doctoral research led to his invention of “breathwear,” a belt rigged with a sensor that detects respiratory rate. If the user enters “e-mail apnea” — the affliction associated with a full in-box — an iPhone app provides an exercise that can restore optimal respiration. Breathwear is now in beta testing with the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine.“Designing Calm” draws students from computer science, product design, engineering and biology. One student prototype allows iPhone users to assign colors to their moods; another app vibrates in tune with a distant loved one’s heartbeat; several involve sending text messages encouraging users to rate activities like sleep, hugs or meeting new people.Among course instructors are Roy Pea, an education professor, and Gus Tai, a venture capitalist with Trinity Ventures. Mr. Tai provides entrepreneurial coaching for students whose projects might spin into start-ups. While the legacy of Stanford-Silicon Valley collaborations looms large here, Mr. Tai believes calming technologies signal a paradigm shift.'"

"'12-07-20,'0','But some communities have raised concerns that trains, too, produce noise and fumes. In 2009, more than a dozen civic groups in Queens banded together to form Civics United for Railroad Environmental Solutions to call for reducing the impact of freight trains. “Whatever expansion is taking place is certainly going to have a more negative effect on those living near the freight rail lines,” said Gary Giordano, district manager for Queens Community Board 5.The expanding freight rail network is the culmination of decades of efforts, some unsuccessful, across the city and region. “There’s been all kinds of resistance,” said United States Representative Jerrold Nadler, a Democrat representing parts of Manhattan and Brooklyn who has long pushed to expand freight rail. “Rail fell out of use, and people just didn’t see it anymore.”According to the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council, a regional organization charged with transportation planning, just 1 percent of the 434.7 million tons of freight transported through the city and its suburbs in 2004, the latest year analyzed, was by rail, compared with 89 percent by truck. The council estimates that by 2030, the total amount of freight will nearly double, rising to 804.4 million, though some transportation experts have suggested that number may be too high.In other parts of the country, a larger share of freight is carried by rail. In 2010, 9.7 percent of the 18.3 billion tons of freight transported nationally was by train, compared with 68.2 percent by truck, according to federal transportation data. Nationally, the total amount of freight is projected to rise to nearly 27.5 billion by 2040.“There needs to be another way to handle the increasing capacity, other than roadways,” said Lisa Daglian, a spokeswoman for the New York council, citing growing population and consumer demand for products in the region. Bruce Lieberman, chairman of the New York and Atlantic Railway, said his business has steadily attracted new customers, climbing to more than 22,000 carloads annually.CSX Transportation, one of the nation’s largest freight railroad companies, now runs four freight trains a day, each with an average of 75 rail cars, along its main line through the Bronx, compared with two trains a day seven years ago, said William Goetz, a vice president of the company. The cargo carried on the four trains would fill about 900 trucks, he added.At the 65th Street Rail Yard last week, a line of graffiti-covered rail cars filled with auto scraps waited to be rolled onto barges. The city, which acquired the 24-acre site for $2.5 million in 1981, has periodically tried to revive the rail yard. But in recent years, it has remained closed, in part because the city was embroiled in a legal battle with the New York Cross Harbor Railroad, which previously operated the barge service to and from New Jersey, Mr. Nelson said.Today, the barges are operated by New York New Jersey Rail, a small railroad owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, using a smaller, city-owned rail yard nearby. The barges will move to the new 65th Street Rail Yard, which can handle longer rail cars and has two “float bridges” made of timber and steel to anchor the barges as the railcars are rolled off. The other site has only one float bridge.“That was the back porch; this is the front yard,” said Don Hutton, managing director of the railroad, as he pointed out the float bridges, which have been used only for tests since they were built in 2000. “This is really the big deal. Our guys can’t wait.”Mr. Hutton said his goal was to haul 23,000 rail cars a year by 2017, up from 1,600 rail cars now. The cargo will include Washington State apples bound for city markets, home heating oil for Long Island homeowners, and newly made cars for dealerships across the region.'"
"'12-07-20,'0','The new instructions caution jurors that eyewitness testimony must be scrutinized carefully.“Human memory is not foolproof,” the instructions say. “Research has revealed that human memory is not like a video recording that a witness need only replay to remember what happened. Memory is far more complex.”The new instructions, which take effect on Sept. 4, address the problems the State Supreme Court identified last August in a unanimous ruling that concluded that the traditional test for reliability of eyewitness testimony, which the United States Supreme Court set out in 1977, was outdated and should be revised.Although it applies only in New Jersey, the ruling was widely heralded for containing the most exhaustive review of decades of scientific research on eyewitness identification.The new instructions are expected to be influential as other state courts look to revise their approach to eyewitness identification, several legal experts said.“These instructions are far more detailed and careful than anything that exists anywhere in the country,” said Brandon L. Garrett, a law professor at the University of Virginia and the author of “Convicting the Innocent,” a book that includes a study of eyewitness misidentifications, which was cited by the New Jersey court in its decision.“These instructions are far from perfect,” he added, “but they are a remarkable road map for how you explain eyewitness memory to jurors.”Barry C. Scheck, co-director of the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, which had filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the New Jersey case, called the changes “critically important” and predicted the new instructions would not only affect how juries are instructed, but would also influence trials themselves and the evidence-gathering that precedes them, since both sides will know that such instructions will be given.“It changes the way evidence is presented by prosecutors and the way lawyers defend,” he said, adding, “The whole system will improve.”Stuart J. Rabner, the court’s chief justice, who wrote last year’s decision, said by phone that the ultimate issue of whether to trust eyewitness testimony was for a jury to decide.“We expect juries are going to hear this evidence, so we want to give them the tools with which to evaluate the eyewitness testimony,” he said.The State Supreme Court also issued a rule that requires law enforcement officers to record details of how an identification was made. Officers must identify anyone, not just law enforcement personnel, with whom a witness has spoken about the identification — before, during or after it occurred — and include a detailed summary of what was said.“If the record that is prepared is lacking in important details as to what occurred,” the rule says, a judge may declare the identification inadmissible or allow the jury to hear only portions of it.Jennifer E. Laurin, an assistant professor of law at the University of Texas, who has written about the politics of criminal justice, said the new instructions are important because jurors will now be “more fully educated about our most contemporary understanding about what makes eyewitness identification more or less reliable.”'"
"'12-07-20,'0','A JUDGE in Britain has ordered Apple to post notices on its Web site and to take out newspaper ads declaring that Samsung did not infringe Apple design patents.The unusual decision was the latest twist in a global legal battle over patents between the two rivals in the smartphone and tablet businesses. It followed a Pyrrhic victory last week for Samsung, when the same judge, Colin Birss, rejected an Apple claim over tablet designs, saying consumers were unlikely to confuse Samsung’s Galaxy tablets with Apple’s iPad because the Galaxys were “not as cool.”“It isn’t a bad thing if judges aren’t always buttoned up,” said Florian Müller, a consultant in Augsburg, Germany, who blogs about patent issues. “But the ‘not as cool’ thing is such a value judgment.”In the latest order, issued on Tuesday, Judge Birss told Apple to post a notice on its British Web site for six months to tell visitors Samsung did not violate its design patent. According to Bloomberg News, which said it had obtained a copy of the order from Samsung’s lawyers, the order requires Apple to take out advertisements to a similar effect in The Financial Times, The Daily Mail and several other British publications.In a statement, Samsung said, “Should Apple continue to make excessive legal claims based on such generic designs, innovation in the industry could be harmed and consumer choice unduly limited.”'"
"'12-07-20,'0','A NEW political order is emerging in the Middle East, and Turkey aspires to be its leader by taking a stand against authoritarian regimes. Earlier this week, Turkey’s prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, went so far as to denounce the Syrian government’s continuing massacres of civilians as “attempted genocide.”Turkey’s desire to champion human rights in the region is a welcome development, but Mr. Erdogan’s condemnation of Syria is remarkably hypocritical. As long as Turkey continues to deny crimes committed against non-Turks in the early 1900s, during the final years of the Ottoman Empire, its calls for freedom, justice and humanitarian values will ring false.Turkey’s attempt to cultivate an image as the global protector of Muslim rights is compromised by a legacy of ethnic cleansing and genocide against Christians and terror against Arabs and Kurds. Memories of these crimes are very much alive throughout former Ottoman territories. And Turkey cannot serve as a democratic model until it acknowledges that brutal violence, population transfers and genocide underlie the modern Turkish state.Using documents from the Ottoman government archives in Istanbul, which were once classified as top secret, I have sought to pull back the veil on Turkey’s century of denial. These documents clearly demonstrate that Ottoman demographic policy from 1913 to 1918 was genocidal. Indeed, the phrase “crimes against humanity” was coined as a legal term and first used on May 24, 1915, in response to the genocide against Armenians and other Christian civilians.Britain, France and Russia initially defined Ottoman atrocities as “crimes against Christianity” but later substituted “humanity” after considering the negative reaction that such a specific term could elicit from Muslims in their colonies.'"

"'12-07-20,'0','A star attraction at the Phillips Collection in Washington is the chapel-like Mark Rothko Room, where four of that artist’s late paintings hang, one on each wall. At first glance the space seems like any other Rothko installation — abstract canvases of saturated colors. There is “Green and Maroon,” “Green and Red on Tangerine,” “Orange and Red on Red” and “Ochre and Red on Red.” But the cumulative effect is profound, almost mystical. The longer viewers spend there, the more the paintings seem to change.The same kind of spiritual experience is soon to be created again at the Phillips. The German artist Wolfgang Laib will not be working on canvases, though, nor will he be using paint. The artist, who is known for works that use natural materials in magical, often ephemeral ways, will install a small chamber fashioned from wax. It will be only the third site-specific commission for the museum. (Besides the Rothko Room, designed in 1959 by the institution’s founder, Duncan Phillips, to Rothko’s exact specifications, the Phillips commissioned Ellsworth Kelly to make a sculpture for its new courtyard unveiled in 2006.)When he went to Washington to present a talk last year, Mr. Laib walked around the museum. “Not surprisingly, he particularly responded to our Rothko Room,” recalled Dorothy Kosinski, director of the Phillips. Mr. Laib also happened on a tiny, almost closetlike space in the part of the museum that was the founder’s house, built in 1897; there he will create the wax chamber.“It’s bold for us to commission a work because it’s not like we have acres of empty real estate,” Ms. Kosinski said, adding that the project was in keeping with Duncan Phillips’s mission to show the work of living artists and to take risks. “It makes a big statement in a quiet way,” she added.Mr. Laib has been creating wax chambers since 1988 for exhibitions from New York to the Netherlands. For temporary shows, he said, he creates wax slabs that can be dismantled. But for this permanent installation, expected to open early next year, he will need about 500 pounds of wax, which will come from a candle factory and be applied directly to the walls. “It has to have the right consistency, not too pure like the wax that is sold to cosmetic companies that doesn’t have dirt or pollen,” he said in a telephone interview. The wax is then melted to just the right temperature. “If it gets cold then it shrinks and cracks,” he said. It takes two or three people to mix and oversee the wax. Mr. Laib applies it with a putty knife as though he were applying plaster, keeping it no more than one inch thick. “I then go over the walls with a flame and iron to make sure it’s smooth,” he said.'"
"'12-07-20,'0','He and other Mono-ha artists paired natural materials with industrial ones, suggesting an earthier, less bombastic Richard Serra or, alternately, a more Zenlike Robert Smithson. And they emphasized the surroundings of their artworks, often placing them on the floor or ground or propping them against walls and trees.Their art wasn’t really about activating a particular space, or unpacking a particular process; it was about generating an overarching awareness of contingency in the world, transforming the usual subject-object relationship into something more profound and inclusive. The works themselves were often ephemeral, as in Koji Enokura’s “Symptom-Sea-Body,” in which the artist, lying on a beach, curved his spine to match the waterline.These attributes of Mono-ha make it especially difficult to revisit, and the works in “Requiem for the Sun” should be seen as a mere skimming of the surface. That’s especially true of this version of the show; the Blum & Poe presentation in Los Angeles was larger (and to judge from photographs, better), making use of the gallery’s structural features and outdoor spaces. Both were organized by Mika Yoshitake, an assistant curator at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.The current installation, at Gladstone’s West 21st Street branch, disappoints. The high-ceilinged main gallery dwarfs many of the works and its small footprint crowds them, although a few pieces tucked away in alcoves on the second and third floors retain their potency. The gallery might have done better to extend the show to its West 24th Street location, currently home to an uninspiring survey of the Belgian sculptor Jan Vercruysse.Fortunately, “Requiem for the Sun” has a thorough, museum-level catalog that helps overcome some of the show’s physical limitations. It includes many historical photographs and newly translated artist writings, along with essays by Ms. Yoshitake and the art critic Minemura Toshiaki. Mr. Minemura’s piece, in particular, helps to distinguish Mono-ha artists from some of their Western contemporaries.“Their choice of mono — which often included such raw materials as stone, wood, paper, fabric, sand and iron plates — definitely set them apart from the mainstream of contemporary art at the time, which consisted of fabricated works similar to Primary Structures and various kinds of Kinetic and Op objects,” he writes. “If these mainstream artists attempted to hide the collapse of the medium by foregrounding the self-sufficiency of things, Mono-ha artists relentlessly pushed the collapse to its extreme end.”At the gallery the radicalism of that idea takes a while to sink in. Visitors first stumble on Katsuro Yoshida’s “Cut-off” (1969). A giant steel pipe stuffed with cotton, it epitomizes Mono-ha’s balance of manufactured and organic materials and its reversals of interior/exterior.In the main gallery is another work by Mr. Yoshida: a wooden beam suspended from the ceiling in a kind of rope sling and tethered to a rock. The different elements of this piece seem to hold one another in check, with some help from the architecture.Nearby, Susumu Koshimizu’s slab of granite partly shrouded in a giant hemp-fiber envelope brings to mind the children’s game of rock, paper, scissors — not a bad analogy for Mono-ha.Mr. Sekine’s two-part sculpture “Phase of Nothingness — Water” looks, initially, like textbook Minimalism. But on closer inspection its solid-looking volumes are revealed as liquids in thin containers of lacquered steel. Mr. Sekine’s “Phase-Mother Earth” (1968), a cylinder of soil 9 feet tall and 7 feet in diameter that was displayed alongside the site of its extraction, was recreated for the Blum & Poe exhibition but is, sadly, absent here; it’s one of the foundational works of Mono-ha, and a distant cousin of Land Art.The movement’s chief philosopher, at least, is well-represented. Lee Ufan, the Korean-born, Japanese-schooled subject of a 2011 Guggenheim retrospective, contributes two sculptures. One consists of bracket-shaped steel plates, deployed as spatial parentheses. Another uses circular forms of varying dimensions — rocks, a loop of electric cord, a charcoal wall drawing and the light from a bulb — to link the wall and the floor in classic Post-Minimalist fashion.Ultimately, however, “Requiem for the Sun” makes you aware that Mono-ha is not really like Post-Minimalism, Process Art or any contemporaneous Western movement — even though you can’t quite put your finger on the difference. Writing in 1969, and reprinted in the catalog, Mr. Lee comes as close as anyone. Mono-ha, he says, is “an act or gesture as an aspect of the world itself, the world that reveals that it is a world.”Correction: July 21, 2012  An art review on Friday about “Requiem for the Sun: The Art of Mono-ha,” at the Gladstone Gallery on West 21st Street in Manhattan, misspelled, in some editions, the given name of an artist whose work is featured in the show. The error was repeated in an accompanying picture caption. The artist was Katsuro Yoshida, not Katzuro. The review, using information from the exhibition catalog, also rendered incorrectly at one point the name of a Japanese critic who wrote an essay for the catalog. The critic, Minemura Toshiaki, uses the traditional Japanese name order in which the family name is first. Thus he is Mr. Minemura, not Mr. Toshiaki. The review also misstated the given name of a Belgian artist whose work is on display at the gallery’s West 24th Street site. He is Jan Vercruysse, not Jean.'"
"'12-07-20,'0','It is a reputation built on savvy and star-studded programming, including a production of “Uncle Vanya,” adapted by Mr. Upton, directed by Tamas Ascher and featuring Ms. Blanchett as Yelena, that runs at City Center as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.They have also raised three young sons while navigating unfamiliar and at times noxious artistic territory, and learning what it means to be each other’s better half.Contemplating a union in which they have committed to sharing their creative endeavors, Mr. Upton said: “It works for us. Possibly not for everyone else.”When the two are together in person, their contrasts all but point themselves out. Ms. Blanchett, an Academy Award winner who has played Katharine Hepburn and Elizabeth I on screen, was dressed in a rugby shirt and pantsuit and carried herself with a certain upright decorum.Seated next to her — a position where anyone would suffer by comparison — Mr. Upton, a playwright, was unkempt and wearing a leather jacket and jeans, prepared for Australian winter rather than suffocating Manhattan heat.Both had formative experiences with the Sydney Theater Company, which in the 1990s presented Mr. Upton’s adaptation of “Cyrano de Bergerac” as well as the production of David Mamet’s “Oleanna” that helped jump-start Ms. Blanchett’s career. They lived for several years in Britain before moving back to Australia in 2007.From the moment it was announced that Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Upton would inherit the stewardship of the company from Robyn Nevin their tenure has been one of superlatives and extremes.Before their first season was unveiled, they had secured the patronage of the fashion designer Giorgio Armani and drawn fire from the Australian actor Colin Moody, a departing company member, who in a parting shot said that “an Oscar for acting is not a suitable recommendation to run the biggest theater company in the country.”The company’s productions that have featured Ms. Blanchett have toured globally and received rapturous reviews. Those include “Uncle Vanya,” an experience that Ben Brantley, who saw it in Washington, described in The New York Times as “among the happiest of my theatergoing life,” and “A Streetcar Named Desire,” directed by Liv Ullmann and starring Ms. Blanchett as Blanche DuBois.Some productions in which she has been absent have had tougher fates. Reviewing a London production of “Riflemind,” written by Mr. Upton and directed by Philip Seymour Hoffman, a critic for The Guardian wrote that Mr. Upton “has invented a different kind of dull.”Without citing herself, Ms. Blanchett pointed to productions like Botho Strauss’s existentialist play “Gross und Klein” (“Big and Small”), in which she played the adrift protagonist, Lotte Kotta, as “a programming risk” that could entice audiences “if you put one familiar component into it.”Looking at their overall track record, Ms. Blanchett said, “We’ve had some doozies and we’ve had some — — ”“No one sets out to have a stinker,” Ms. Blanchett said.Richard Roxburgh, a longtime friend of the couple who plays the title character in “Uncle Vanya,” said in a telephone interview that, regardless of any baggage they might bring to their jobs, the role of artistic director is inherently “treacherous” and “kind of ghastly.”“The casting of productions and choosing which plays to put on — that’s easy, that’s the glamour part,” Mr. Roxburgh said. “It’s the day-to-day slogging at things. It’s also an ambassadorial role. The politics run very deep.”For Mr. Upton the position required him to embrace a public spotlight he was unaccustomed to, Mr. Roxburgh said.“I think originally there was an awkwardness there, a shuffling and a looking at shoes a bit, which was always endearing,” he said. “But he’s really grabbed that place now.”Ms. Ullmann spoke enviously of seeing Ms. Blanchett, during their work on “Streetcar,” balance rehearsals, fund-raising events and parental duties without faltering, even when Ms. Blanchett was accidentally hit on the head by an errant radio during a performance in Washington.“She was just laughing and going on, finished the performance and laughed and laughed,” Ms. Ullmann said in a telephone interview. “I think the doctor who was called, he didn’t get the drama he would have liked.”Under Ms. Blanchett and Mr. Upton’s direction the nonprofit Sydney Theater Company had budget surpluses in 2009 and 2010, and ran a $9,000 deficit (on revenues of $28 million) in 2011. (Figures for 2012 are not available.)For whatever book-balancing skills Ms. Blanchett may bring to the table, the organizers of Lincoln Center Festival do not mind acknowledging the more salient celebrity wattage she adds to their lineup.“It would be disingenuous if I didn’t,” said Nigel Redden, the Lincoln Center Festival’s director.Yet in promoting this production, “we’re not trying to make it Cate Blanchett and Sydney Theater Company,” Mr. Redden said. “We’re trying to make it ‘Uncle Vanya’ of the Sydney Theater Company. Yelena is an important role, but it is not the role around which the rest of the play is made.”While Ms. Blanchett is finishing her run in “Uncle Vanya” (which ends on July 28), Mr. Upton will fly back to Australia to be with their sons, Dashiell, 10, Roman, 8, and Ignatius, 4, who often travel with their parents on tour.“Tutoring our sons in third- and fifth-grade maths was far more challenging than performing Lotte Kotta, actually,” Ms. Blanchett said. “Talk about a sense of failure.”The couple cited the upbringing of their children as a principal reason they would not seek a longer stay with the Sydney Theater Company. Mr. Upton and Ms. Blanchett are informally advising its board while it searches for a new artistic director but said they had no specific demands of their successor “as long as everything gets better,” Mr. Upton said.They said they had no concrete plans after they step down, though Ms. Blanchett said she had “this strange, probably unachievable fantasy about performing in German in Berlin.” (The hindrance being that “I don’t speak German,” she said.)Asked if they could eventually see themselves running another theater company somewhere else in the world, Mr. Upton almost immediately answered: “Totally. Totally.”Ms. Blanchett took a few additional moments to contemplate the question, then said with a laugh: “Well, I’m with him. So if he goes, I go.”'"

"'12-07-20,'0','SEATTLE — An accounting charge related to Microsoft’s ill-fated acquisition of an online advertising business led to a loss for the software giant’s last quarter, its first in more than two decades as a public company.But while that loss can be played down as an anomaly for a company that has been a reliable moneymaker for decades, weak sales in Microsoft’s Windows business cannot. Microsoft said on Thursday that its revenue from Windows fell 13 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30.Windows sales looked worse than they really were in part because Microsoft had to change how it recognized that revenue because of an offer it has extended to people who buy PCs running Windows 7. Under that offer, users can pay $14.99 to upgrade to Windows 8 when it comes out in October.If Microsoft had not had to defer a portion of its Windows sales — $540 million in this case — its Windows revenue would have declined 1 percent, still a dismal performance that underscores the challenges in the traditional computer business right now.Sales in the PC market have stagnated as consumers have diverted their technology spending to more exciting technologies, including smartphones and tablet computers like the iPad. Microsoft and other companies in the PC industry are hoping to reignite growth in the business with the release of Windows 8, an operating system that has been revamped to work better on touch-screen devices.'"
"'12-07-20,'0','Frank-Walter Steinmeier, leader of the opposition Social Democrats in the Bundestag, said his party was supporting the measure only “because a refusal by Germany would be catastrophic.”The proceedings in Berlin illustrate once again how difficult it is for European leaders to win political support for measures that economists say are essential to survival of the common currency. Ms. Merkel had to work hard to win support just from members of her own governing coalition.In contrast to another bailout fund vote last month, Ms. Merkel was able to muster a majority solely with members of her own Christian Democrats and her coalition partners, the Free Democrats. A failure by Ms. Merkel to rally her own government would have been a blow to her prestige and illustrates the resistance she faces within her own party.Under an agreement by European leaders in late June, bailout money could go directly to Spanish banks. But Germany, which because of its size has effective veto power over use of the funds, refuses to allow the bailout money to bypass governments until the European Central Bank assumes control of bank regulation for the euro zone, a move that is months away.That means that Spanish banks and the Spanish government remain in a fatal embrace — the banks damaged by their holdings of questionable government debt, and confidence in the government’s creditworthiness tarnished by the potential cost of a bailout. Partly as a result, the yield on 10-year Spanish bonds on Thursday rose above 7 percent, a level that economists say could eventually be more than the government can afford.“We have very clearly formulated under what conditions we are willing to provide this aid,” Volker Kauder, chairman of the Christian Democratic delegation in Parliament, said during the two-and-a-half-hour debate Thursday. “There will be no direct bank financing.”The Bundestag’s approval coincided with a separate vote in the Spanish Parliament, where lawmakers endorsed an austerity package worth 65 billion euros that had been presented by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy last week. The outcome of the Spanish vote was a fait accompli, as Mr. Rajoy’s Popular Party holds a parliamentary majority.The measures include a rise in the sales tax and cuts in unemployment benefits, as well as the removal of an end-of-year bonus for civil servants. The bonus cut has led to daily protests over the last week, with civil servants setting up temporary road blockades in Madrid and other cities.Mr. Schäuble, the German finance minister, praised Spain’s efforts to get government spending under control and deregulate the labor market. Spain is being treated unfairly by investors, he said.“Without the extreme insecurity in the financial markets, Spain would be able to handles its own banking problems,” Mr. Schäuble said. “We are dealing with an emergency situation.”Abroad, Ms. Merkel, who attended the parliamentary debate but did not speak, is often viewed as an obstacle to solving the euro crisis because of her stubborn reluctance to commit German money to help ailing countries. But at home, polls show that her position wins wide support.Ms. Merkel’s room to maneuver is also constrained by Germany’s Constitutional Court, which has delayed the entry into force of the euro zone’s permanent bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism, pending a review of whether it is in line with Germany’s constitution. The fund was scheduled to come into operation this month but the court has said it will not deliver its verdict until Sept. 12.The German vote, paving the way for a formal agreement on the terms of the Spanish rescue, was welcomed by Spanish economists despite confusion over whether part of the European financing could be used to buy Spanish sovereign debt, should all the funds not be required by the banks.Robert Tornabell, banking professor at the Esade business school, said that “it is an important symbol, however small the amount, that some of the money could be used to buy sovereign bonds in the primary and secondary markets.”The Spanish Economy Ministry, however, denied that such a possibility existed. It said in a statement that “the assistance program for the recapitalization of the Spanish financial sector is earmarked only for this purpose and not for the purchase of bonds in the primary and secondary markets.”Spain’s Parliament also approved on Thursday a decree allowing the country’s bank restructuring agency to disburse funds immediately to banks in need of liquidity.On Friday, euro zone finance ministers are scheduled to hold talks by videoconference to agree on the release of 30 billion euros of the Spanish bank rescue.Spain has yet to explain how the funds will be distributed. Novagalicia Banco is among the ailing banks that recently indicated they would need more capital than initially thought. Bankia, the largest troubled lender, asked in May for an additional 19 billion euros of capital.In addition, four auditing firms that were commissioned by the Spanish government to go through the books of the banks are not expected to produce their findings until September.In the German Parliament, only the Green Party was unequivocally in favor of the aid to Spanish banks. Jürgen Trittin, a party leader, praised provisions in the law that limit the pay of Spanish bank executives and prevent banks that receive aid from paying dividends to shareholders.But he said Spain illustrated that bank supervision in Europe remained inadequate.“I believe it is correct to help Spain,” Mr. Trittin said. “But why are we again in the situation of rescuing banks with tax money?”'"
"'12-07-20,'0','Stocks rose on Thursday for a third consecutive day, as the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed to a 2 1/2-month high after earnings from technology companies and expectations for more stimulus outweighed weak economic data.So far in this earnings season, a majority of companies have beaten analysts’ lowered expectations. In the latest results, I.B.M. raised its full-year outlook, eBay’s profit beat forecasts and Qualcomm said it expected a “strong December quarter.”“Europe has been quiet, and earnings news, while not earth-shattering, is slightly better than expected,” said Fred Dickson, chief market strategist at D.A. Davidson & Company in Lake Oswego, Ore. “A trading range environment is how we see it.”Weak manufacturing and employment data as well as falling revenue at the investment bank Morgan Stanley, which sent its shares down more than 5 percent, capped gains in the wider market.Even so, expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon step up stimulus efforts have helped the market shake off bad news.

"'12-07-20,'0','Exxon Mobil helped break the ice when it signed exploration contracts last year. Baghdad criticized the move as illegal and barred Exxon, which has a contract to expand production at one of the largest Iraqi oil fields, called West Qurna, from bidding in a recent auction for exploration acreage.The authorities in Baghdad believe that oil and gas operations in Kurdistan need their approval. But the two sides have not been able to reach agreement on managing the resources or sharing revenue.Chevron, which is buying its stake from Reliance Industries of India, is considered a cautious company, so the fact that it is willing to risk Baghdad’s ire is a testament to Kurdistan’s attractions.“Chevron believes Kurdistan holds considerable promise,” a company representative said. Unlike Exxon Mobil, Chevron does not yet have an Iraqi project.The region now has a roster of sizable players, including Marathon Oil and Hess of the United States. Last year, Tony Hayward, the former chief executive of BP, took charge of Genel Energy, a company with stakes in some of Kurdistan’s best fields.Companies are attracted to Kurdistan because of its exploration potential and business-friendly approach. Kurdistan offers financial terms that are more attractive than the service contracts Baghdad offers.Under Kurdistan profit-sharing contracts, the companies will earn $3 to $5 a barrel, compared with less than $1 a barrel on oil deals in the south, according to Mr. Munton.Yet doing business in Kurdistan still carries considerable risk. The only way to export oil from the region is by an Iraqi pipeline or by truck to Turkey. Baghdad and Kurdistan have been unable to reach an agreement on exports.Pipeline exports have been halted for several months because of a dispute with Baghdad over payments. Kurdistan’s production capacity is about 250,000 barrels a day, but output is much lower because of export restrictions.The oil produced is mostly sold in Kurdistan for about $60 a barrel, well below the world price.“The political risks are not to be taken lightly,” Mr. Munton said. “It is going to take time for agreements to be reached.”Mr. Munton said that the entry of large companies into Kurdistan was a double-edged sword. Agreements bolster Kurdistan’s prestige, but also infuriate oil authorities in Baghdad and may cause Iraq to bargain even harder on export agreements.The two blocks Chevron is buying span 490 square miles north of Erbil, the Kurdistan regional hub. Chevron did not disclose a price, but a person familiar with the transaction who was not authorized to speak about it on the record said it was paying $200 million to $300 million for 80 percent stakes. The Austrian company OMV holds the rest.'"
"'12-07-20,'0','“Verizon Wireless has once again demonstrated its industry leadership, combining strong revenue growth with record margins and high customer loyalty,” Lowell McAdam, Verizon’s chief executive, said in a statement.In the quarter, Verizon Wireless added 888,000 contract subscribers, the most valuable type of customer for the company, down from 1.26 million a year ago. But total revenue from mobile data was $6.9 billion, up 18.5 percent from a year ago.Those results perpetuate an industrywide trend: contract subscriber growth is slowing because most people who want cellphones have them. So now the carriers are improving profits by using different pricing structures for mobile data, or by attracting one another’s customers with new smartphones and faster data networks.Verizon sold 5.9 million smartphones in the quarter, including 2.9 million Droid handsets and 2.7 million iPhones. Typically, iPhone sales slow in summer because many consumers expect Apple to introduce an upgraded version in the fall. Nonetheless, Apple’s handset aided Verizon’s growth: A quarter of the people buying iPhones were new to Verizon. Over all, 73 percent of Verizon’s phone sales to subscribers were smartphones.Verizon is leading the race in the United States to build faster fourth-generation networks, using a technology known as Long Term Evolution. It has LTE deployed in 337 cities, compared with AT&T, which has installed it in 47 cities.In late June, Verizon introduced “shared data” plans, which allow customers to pay for a pool of wireless data and share it across multiple smartphones, tablets and laptops, a first for the American wireless industry. For new Verizon customers, shared plans and prepaid plans will be the only options. The older tiered data plan is no longer available to new customers.The shared plans took effect too late to influence Verizon’s earnings, but some analysts said imposing shared plans on new subscribers was a bold move. The plans offer value to high-income families that already spend a lot for data, text and phone services, but not to people who are light users and are trying to save money.Fran Shammo, Verizon’s chief financial officer, said in a conference call that the company did not expect shared data plans to have an immediate impact. But he said that the new pricing structure was already prying some customers away from their older unlimited data plans, which will help the company make more money over time.“The benefit we do see is that we are seeing some 3G unlimited customers move into our 4G shared data plan product,” Mr. Shammo said. “That is excellent for us.”Following Verizon, AT&T introduced its shared data plans on Wednesday with nearly identical pricing.Tero Kuittinen, an independent mobile analyst and vice president of Alekstra, a company that provides services to help consumers reduce their cellphone bills, said that the shared data plans were a sign that Verizon and AT&T had grown confident that they would not lose subscribers to smaller rivals, no matter how expensive their plans become.“This is what happens in a duopoly,” Mr. Kuittinen said in an interview. “One company raises prices, and the other does the same thing. It looks like AT&T and Verizon have both concluded that they’re not serious competitors.”Shares of Verizon Communications declined $1.35, or 2.9 percent, on Thursday to close at $44.54'"

"'12-07-20,'0','Anticipation built in the packed, darkened movie theater. Life and its cares began to recede.Then, just after midnight on Friday, fantasy became nightmare, and a place of escape became a trap, when a man strode to the front in a multiplex near and opened fire. At least 12 people were killed and 58 wounded, with witnesses describing a scene of claustrophobia, panic and blood. Minutes later, the police arrested , 24, in the theater’s parking lot.“It was just chaos. You started hearing screaming. You looked up and people were falling. It was like a dream,” said Jamie Rohrs, 25, who was there with his fiancée, cradling his 4-month-old son, Ethan, in his arms as the movie began. It was the midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises,” the latest Batman sequel, at the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora, about 10 miles from downtown Denver.Mr. Rohrs jumped between the seats for cover, still holding the baby. He stumbled and crawled trying to figure out what to do, clutching his son to his chest as he went. “Do I run out the door? Is he going to shoot the baby? What am I to do?” Mr. Rohrs said, his voice quavering. But he, his fiancée and the baby eventually made it out.And so once again, with a squeeze of a trigger, just 20 miles from , scene of the 1999 student massacre, the nation was plunged into another debate about guns and violence.Mayor of New York, who has waged a national campaign for stricter gun laws, offered a political challenge. “Maybe it’s time that the two people who want to be president of the stand up and tell us what they are going to do about it,” Mr. Bloomberg said during his weekly radio program, “because this is obviously a problem across the country.”Luke O’Dell of the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, a Colorado group on the other side of the debate over gun control, took a nearly opposite view. “Potentially, if there had been a law-abiding citizen who had been able to carry in the theater, it’s possible the death toll would have been less.”Some survivors thought at first they were witnessing a promotional stunt. The gunman, wearing what Aurora Police Department officials described as nearly head-to-toe “ballistic gear,” including a throat protector and leggings, plus a gas mask and a long black coat, came in through a parking lot exit door near the screen of Theater 9.“He walked in so casually,” said a witness, Crofter, 19, a Batman fan who had gone with a group of friends and had a seat in the front row. The gunman, still perhaps regarded by some as a performer, then released two devices down the theater aisles emitting what the police said was smoke or some sort of irritant.Witnesses told the police that Mr. Holmes said something to the effect of “I am the Joker,” according to a federal law enforcement official, and that his hair had been dyed or he was wearing a wig. Then, as people began to rise from their seats in confusion or anxiety, he began to shoot. The gunman paused at least once, several witnesses said, perhaps to reload, and continued firing.Mr. Holmes was detained by the police soon afterward, standing by his white . He was identified by the authorities as a former Ph.D. student at the in Denver, and an honors graduate in neuroscience from the University of California, Riverside. He had in the car an AR-15 assault rifle, a Remington 12-gauge shotgun, and a .40 caliber Glock handgun, said Chief Dan Oates of the Aurora police, and all three were believed to have been used inside the theater. Another Glock .40 caliber handgun was recovered inside the theater. Chief Oates said that “many, many” rounds were fired, but that there was no count so far.In the last 60 days Mr. Holmes had purchased four guns at local gun shops, Chief Oates said. And through the Internet, he bought more than 6,000 rounds of ammunition: more than 3,000 rounds for the assault rifle, 3,000 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition for the two Glocks, and 300 rounds for the 12-gauge shotgun. The guns were all bought legally, a federal law enforcement official said.Mr. Holmes also purchased online multiple magazines for the assault rifle, including one 100-round drum magazine. “With that drum magazine, he could have gotten off 50, 60 rounds, even if it was semiautomatic, within one minute,” Chief Oates said.The Federal has given information on where and when the guns were purchased to the police in Aurora.After the chaos — the evacuation, the rush of 911 calls beginning at 12:39 a.m., the mass casualties rushed to area hospitals, the images that witnesses described to authorities of dead or dying friends or loved ones left inside — the emerging details got more mysterious and in some ways more horrifying still.“Our investigation determined his apartment is booby trapped with various incendiary and chemical devices and apparent trip wires,” Chief Oates said around midday Friday. “We have an active and difficult scene. It may be resolved in hours or days. We simply don’t know how we’re going to handle that.” Federal law enforcement officials said that the apartment had been so extensively booby-trapped that the devices could not be safely defused and that a robot would be sent to trigger them. Late Friday, the dozens of residents in five apartment buildings in the area remained evacuated.“It is a very vexing problem how to enter that apartment safely,” Chief Oates said. “Personally I’ve never seen anything like what the pictures show us is in there. I’m a layman when it comes to bomb stuff. I see an awful lot of wires. Trip wires. Jars full of ammunition. Jars full of liquid. Some things that look like mortar rounds. We have a lot of challenges to get in there safely.”In the suspect’s neighborhood of low-slung, red-brick apartment buildings and dusty lots, not far from Children’s Hospital , where some of the victims were taken, neighbors shook their heads in disbelief as the police and bomb squad vehicles cordoned off the area.“I think this is a lot like Columbine,” said Jennifer Evans, who lives near Mr. Holmes’s apartment. “This is crazy.”At one point, as shirtless children played in an overgrown front yard and stared in disbelief, firefighters in a hook and ladder truck smashed a window in the third story of the building where the police said Mr. Holmes resided.Whether a violent movie had inspired violence in real life, or was merely the coincidental setting, police authorities in some other cities, including New York, said they were taking no chances and had increased security at theaters showing the movie.In , canceled a red-carpet premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises,” along with other promotional events. On Friday afternoon workers removed a giant Batman mask that had been mounted on the front of a theater along the Champs-Élysées, where the screening was to take place.Warner Bros., which is owned by , released a statement Friday, saying that the company and the filmmakers were “deeply saddened” and “extend our sincere sympathies to the families and loved ones of the victims at this tragic time.” Several broadcast networks and cable channels stopped running commercials on Friday for “The Dark Knight Rises.”The shooting inevitably stirred memories of Columbine High School and the murders there in April 1999, when two heavily armed students stalked through the hallways, killing 12 students and a teacher as they went, before shooting themselves.And the psychological echo and the similar feel of the two massacres was palpable: Theater 9 was a place of seeming safety, if not sanctuary, not unlike Columbine’s library, where some of the killings occurred. Both were ordinary settings that became death traps.Mr. Holmes seemed ordinary too, for the most part, said Billy Kromka, a premed student at the University of Colorado, , who worked with Mr. Holmes for three months last summer as a research assistant.“There was no way I thought he could have the capacity to commit an atrocity like this,” said Mr. Kromka, who is from Aurora. Mr. Kromka said that Mr. Holmes’s “disposition was a little off” and that he could be socially awkward, one of the quieter people in the lab. He spent much of his time immersed in his computer, often participating in role-playing online games.His criminal history with the Aurora Police Department consisted before Friday of one traffic summons, for speeding, in October.A spokeswoman for the University of Colorado Denver-Anschutz Medical Campus, Jackie Brinkman, said Mr. Holmes was in the process of dropping out of school because of academic problems. She said the university was unaware of any incidents with campus police or disciplinary problems involving Mr. Holmes while he was enrolled.Mr. Holmes grew up in a quiet, middle-class community at the eastern edge of , where his parents still live. Two-story, Spanish-style tract homes line both sides of the street, all white stucco with red tile roofs and well-kept lawns. His mother, Arlene Rosemary Holmes, is a .One neighbor, Margie Aguilar, said she knew the Holmes family, who she said had lived in the area for at least 10 years. Her son was a little younger than Mr. Holmes and attended the same high school, Westview, which is just up the street.“The parents are really, really nice people,” Ms. Aguilar said. “This is the last thing you’d expect.”One of the victims, Jessica Ghawi, was a 25-year-old college student and sports broadcaster active on Twitter under the name Jessica Redfield — a tribute to her red hair. She posted early Friday that she was at the movie screening after convincing a friend to go with her.Her brother, Jordan Ghawi, said in a blog post on Friday that when the gunfire began, Jessica took two rounds. “My sister took one round followed by an additional round which appeared to strike her in the head,” he wrote.Her last tweet said the movie would start in 20 minutes.Just a little more than a month ago, Ms. Ghawi described how she narrowly escaped a shooting rampage at a Toronto shopping mall on June 2. She had been in the food court. Her receipt showed that she made her purchase at 6:20 p.m. before what she said was an “odd feeling” propelled her to step outside.The shots in Toronto rang out in the food court striking seven people about 6:23 p.m., she recalled. “It’s hard for me to wrap my mind around how a weird feeling saved me from being in the middle of a deadly shooting,” she wrote on her blog.'"

"'12-07-21,'0','Perhaps because we’re bank-scandaled out, this story hasn’t gotten the attention it truly deserves. Unlike, say, the “London whale” scandal — in which the bank’s traders simply made a big, dumb bet — what HSBC did amounts to serious wrongdoing. It was also a recidivist. Twice before, in 2003 and 2007, the bank had been cited by regulators for what The Times described as its “extensive money laundering ways.” Despite the reprimands, it continued to do business with banks that laundered money for drug traffickers and institutions suspected of having ties to terrorists. At the hearing, HSBC’s top compliance executive strayed from his prepared remarks to announce that he would be leaving that post. The others, of course, promised to do better. Don’t they always?And where were the regulators? “Subcommittee investigators found that the OCC” — that’s the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which is the nation’s primary bank overseer — “had failed to take a single enforcement action against the bank, formal or informal, over the previous six years, despite ample evidence” of money laundering, reads the report.Let’s now turn to “Liborgate,” where the plot continues to thicken. When last we left this scandal, Barclays had agreed to pay $450 million in fines, and a handful of top officials, including its chief executive, Bob Diamond Jr., had lost their jobs because the bank had been manipulating the , a key benchmark for all kinds of and derivative transactions. In recent days, however, the story has begun to revolve more and more around ... hmmm ... the regulators.It turns out that in 2008, Barclays told the New York Federal Reserve what it was up to. , then the president of the , sent a note to Mervyn King, the leader of the , that suggested that the British regulators “eliminate incentives to misreport.” Nothing of the sort took place, and Barclays continued to lowball its Libor reporting well into 2009. The has held a series of hearings with King and other top British regulators of the “what-did-you-know-and-when-did-you-know-it” variety.Meanwhile, it has become clear since the scandal broke that Libor is a problematic benchmark in any case, because a lot of the unsecured interbank lending it is supposed to represent doesn’t even occur anymore. “It is clear that the Libor system is structurally flawed,” , the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told the Senate this week. Now he tells us.But, finally, there’s this: On Wednesday, , the big purveyor of credit cards, agreed to pay $210 million — including reimbursing customers to the tune of $150 million — because one of its vendors had deceptively marketed and sold customers needless add-on products.Where were the regulators? In this case, it was the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, along with the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that conducted the investigation and brought the action against the bank. For the year-old bureau, this was its very first enforcement action.These days, I guess, that amounts to progress.'"

"'12-07-21,'0','The company, the maker of electric turbines and jet engines, posted a profit of 38 cents a share, excluding one-time items, a penny above analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters. It excludes 5 cents in charges from its former subprime mortgage unit and its Japanese consumer finance business.“G.E. had the perfect opportunity to bring expectations down and blame it on Europe and that would have been the telltale move that would have said, ‘O.K., G.E. is beginning to suffer here in this environment.’ And they didn’t do that,” said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer at the Harbor Advisory Corporation in Portsmouth, N.H.The division of the energy infrastructure unit, created in a 2008 restructuring, into three parts will cut annual expenses by $200 million to $300 million a year once it is completed, executives said. The three separate divisions will report directly to Mr. Immelt.John Krenicki, a 50-year-old G.E. vice chairman who runs the division, plans to leave the company at the end of the year, G.E. officials said.“We discussed him taking other roles within the company, subsequent roles within the company and I think his sense was it was time for him to think about other things he can do,” Mr. Immelt said.G.E. declined to make Mr. Krenicki available for an interview.The energy arm, G.E.’s largest industrial unit, was one of its strongest performers in the quarter, with profit jumping 13 percent on a 15 percent rise in sales. The company has stepped up its presence in the energy sector over the last couple of years, making more than $11 billion in acquisitions and expanding beyond its core of making electricity-producing turbines to offer more equipment used in oil and gas production.Shares of G.E. closed up 7 cents, or 0.35 percent, to $19.87 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.Sales rose 2.5 percent, to $36.5 billion from $35.6 billion — shy of Wall Street’s expectation of $36.8 billion. The company noted that the strengthening dollar reduced revenue by $900 million in the quarter.“Revenue was a little lighter than expected, even though earnings beat and they had a strong industrial business,” said Cort Gwon, chief strategist at HudsonView Capital Management in New York.The strongest revenue growth came at its transportation unit, which makes railroad locomotives, where sales rose 27 percent, to $1.6 billion.GE Capital revenue declined 8 percent, to $11.49 billion, reflecting the company’s continuing efforts to pare back the operation. The unit’s profit rose 31 percent, to $2.12 billion.'"

Ann and I join the president and first lady and all Americans in offering our deepest condolences for those whose lives were shattered in a few moments -- a few moments of evil -- in Colorado.I stand before you today not as a man running for office but as a father and grandfather, a husband, an American. This is a time for each of us to look into our hearts and remember how much we love one another and how much we love and how much we care for our great country. There’s so much love and goodness in the heart of America.In the coming days we’ll surely learn more about the lives that have been lost and the families that have been harmed by this hateful act. We’ll come to know more about the talents and the gifts that each victim possessed, and we’ll come to understand the hope and the opportunity that’s been lost.Our hearts break for the victims and their families.

"'12-07-21,'0','Now, even as we learn how this happened and who’s responsible, we may never understand what leads anybody to terrorize their fellow human beings like this.  Such violence, such evil is senseless.  It’s beyond reason.  But while we will never know fully what causes somebody to take the life of another, we do know what makes life worth living.  The people we lost in Aurora loved and they were loved.  They were mothers and fathers; they were husbands and wives; sisters and brothers; sons and daughters, friends and neighbors.  They had hopes for the future and they had dreams that were not yet fulfilled.And if there’s anything to take away from this tragedy it’s the reminder that life is very fragile.  Our time here is limited and it is precious.  And what matters at the end of the day is not the small things, it’s not the trivial things, which so often consume us and our daily lives.  Ultimately, it’s how we choose to treat one another and how we love one another.  (Applause.)It’s what we do on a daily basis to give our lives meaning and to give our lives purpose.  That’s what matters.  At the end of the day, what we’ll remember will be those we loved and what we did for others.  That’s why we’re here.I’m sure that many of you who are parents here had the same reaction that I did when I heard this news.  My daughters go to the movies.  What if Malia and Sasha had been at the theater, as so many of our kids do every day?  Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter tonight, and I’m sure you will do the same with your children.  But for those parents who may not be so lucky, we have to embrace them and let them know we will be there for them as a nation.So, again, I am so grateful that all of you are here.  I am so moved by your support.  But there are going to be other days for politics.  This, I think, is a day for prayer and reflection.So what I’d ask everybody to do, I’d like us to pause in a moment of silence for the victims of this terrible tragedy, for the people who knew them and loved them, for those who are still struggling to recover, and for all the victims of less publicized acts of violence that plague our communities every single day.  So if everybody can just take a moment.Thank you, everybody.  I hope all of you will keep the people of Aurora in your hearts and minds today.  May the Lord bring them comfort and healing in hard days to come.I am grateful to all of you, and I hope that as a consequence of today’s events, as you leave here, you spend a little time thinking about the incredible blessings that God has given us.Thank you very much, everybody.  God bless you.  God bless the United States of America.'"
"'12-07-21,'0','Pamela Geller, executive director of the group that sought to place the ad, called the decision “a victory for freedom-loving people.”Ms. Geller is an outspoken blogger and critic of Islam whose group ran ads on city buses in 2010 that opposed construction of an Islamic center near ground zero.Judge Engelmayer said he would delay the effect of his order for 30 days, to allow the transportation authority to consider its appellate options and alternatives to the current rule.Aaron Donovan, a transportation spokesman, said on Friday that the authority was reviewing the decision, and that it was also “evaluating its existing advertising standards in light of the court’s ruling.”A statement by the authority also cited portions of the opinion, including one in which the judge said that “the court does not impugn in the slightest” the agency’s motives in devising its “no-demeaning” standard or applying it to the proposed ad.“Quite the contrary,” Judge Engelmayer wrote, noting that testimony and evidence in the case showed that the authority “has aspired to hold ads on public buses to a standard of civility.“Its goal of preventing ads on city bus exteriors from being used as a medium for abuse and division in this diverse metropolis is entirely laudable,” the judge wrote. “It appears likely that M.T.A. drafted the standard in question with an eye toward the groups it felt most likely to be targeted by demeaning ads, without adequately considering the First Amendment implications.”The judge said the authority had “reasonably read” the ad as referring to Muslims as “savages.”But, he added, it was “well settled that, where a violation of the First Amendment is concerned, the government’s benign, even noble, intentions are no cure.”The judge noted that the authority’s rule barred only ads that contained language that demeaned on the basis of the nine listed categories, which included ancestry, gender, age, disability or sexual orientation. Outside that list, the judge noted, the rule would permit demeaning ads.He even offered examples, like “Southerners are bigots,” “Upper West Siders are elitist snobs,” “Fat people are slobs,” “Blondes are bimbos” and “Lawyers are sleazebags.”Under the standard, he wrote, an ad could even accuse a private citizen of being a child abuser or running a Ponzi scheme.“Whatever weight might be assigned to the governmental interest in banning demeaning speech on the exterior of New York City buses on an evenhanded basis,” Judge Engelmayer said, “there is no good reason for protecting some individuals and groups, but not others, from such abuse.”The “no-demeaning” standard, he said, was, “therefore, inconsistent with the First Amendment.”The group whose pro-Israel ad was rejected had sought to run it on about 318 city buses for four weeks, at a cost of about $25,000, the judge noted.The ruling came two days after the transportation authority announced that it would sell advertising space on the front of MetroCards. Mr. Donovan said on Friday that the authority “does not intend to open MetroCards to noncommercial advertisements,” a decision that was reached, he said, before Friday’s ruling.The authority has said in court papers that it received $116.4 million in revenue in 2011 from advertising sold throughout its subway, commuter rail and bus systems; of that, it received $4.65 million from noncommercial advertising, which included political ads.“M.T.A. is cash-strapped,” the judge wrote. “It regards the money it receives from such ads as an important source of revenue.”'"
"'12-07-21,'0','Stocks fell on Friday as Europe’s debt crisis flared up again on fears that Spain may eventually need a bailout, prompting traders to cash in three days of gains.The news that the heavily indebted region of Valencia had asked the Spanish government for financial aid interrupted a period of relative calm for Wall Street and raised the specter that Spain, the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy, may itself need to be rescued.Bank shares, sensitive to signs of trouble in Europe, were among the biggest losers. The KBW bank index fell 1.9 percent, taking its weekly decline to 2.3 percent. Shares in Morgan Stanley fell 3.6 percent, to $12.78.Valencia, on Spain’s central Mediterranean coast, has already used several government credit lines in the first half of the year to meet debt repayments. But it still needs to repay 2.85 billion euros ($3.5 billion) by the end of the year. That figure is not huge in itself, but investors are concerned about the overall stability of the country and its banks.“We don’t want to go to a full Spanish bailout if we don’t have to,” said Paul D. Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial Services in Charlotte, Vt. “Maybe the market is just overreacting to it, but these days you never know.”'"
"'12-07-21,'0','Sir Mark and other ambassadors declined to speculate on what appeared to be a rapidly changing picture on the ground in Syria, where activist groups said more than 300 people died in clashes on Thursday and at least 140 on Friday and the United Nations refugee agency reported an enormous surge of people fleeing the country.Refugee officials in Geneva reported a conspicuous increase in cars departing Damascus, the capital, which had been relatively insulated from the insurgency against Mr. Assad until this week, when rebels of the Free Syrian Army took the fight to neighborhoods in earshot of the presidential palace.Then, in the most potent strike on the government since the uprising began, a bomb attack killed three of Mr. Assad’s top security officials on Wednesday at one of the government’s most secure locations in the capital. A fourth victim, Lt. Gen. Hisham Ikhtiar, the head of National Security, one of the government’s intelligence agencies, died of his wounds on Friday, Syria’s state television announced.The public funeral for the first three victims, including Asef Shawkat, President Assad’s brother-in-law and a long-feared security chief, was held Friday in a military ceremony on Qassioun Mountain, overlooking Damascus, state television said. The two top figures officiating were Farouk al-Sharaa, a vice president largely kept out of view since he was singled out by outside powers last year as a possible transitional leader, and Gen. Fahd Jassem al-Freij, who was named minister of defense on Wednesday, immediately after his predecessor died in the bombing.Mr. Assad and his brother, Maher, the commander of the country’s most elite military forces, did not attend.The Security Council’s unanimity on extending the monitor mission contrasted with the acrimonious discord in the Council chambers the day before, when Russia and China vetoed a Western-backed British resolution that would have threatened Mr. Assad’s government with economic sanctions under Chapter 7 of the United Nations Charter if he did not comply with the peace plan.Russia and China have consistently opposed invoking Chapter 7, which can also authorize military intervention to enforce the Council’s will, as an unwarranted intrusion into Syria’s domestic affairs. Western diplomats expressed outrage at the veto and accused Russia and China of protecting Mr. Assad despite his government’s record of brutality.The Russians and Chinese countered that acts of brutality have been committed by both sides. Russia’s United Nations ambassador, Vitaly I. Churkin, further accused Western nations of concealing what he called their true motive: deposing Mr. Assad in order to deprive Iran of its only remaining Middle East ally.The Council’s unanimity on Friday barely masked Western anger from the veto 24 hours earlier. Susan E. Rice, the American ambassador, said the Council’s decision to extend the mission for 30 days “was not the resolution the United States had hoped to adopt in the first instance.”Rather than emphasizing the monitoring mission’s extension as a final opportunity for Mr. Annan’s plan, Ms. Rice described it as a way to allow the monitors “to withdraw safely.” Her description did not sit well with Mr. Churkin.“I was somewhat surprised to hear Ambassador Rice’s description,” he told reporters later. “This is not about withdrawal.”But there was no sign that the antagonists in Syria were interested in accepting Mr. Annan’s plan. Iraq was reported to have thrown up blast walls to seal its main border crossing with Syria, Abu Kamal, after rebel forces took control of all four crossings into Iraq and one into Turkey a day earlier.The government’s accounts of fighting Friday focused on what state television called the valiant rescue of the Midan neighborhood in Damascus from rebel control after days of combat. “Our heroic forces have completely cleansed the Midan area of the terrorist mercenaries and restored security,” state television reported, using the government’s standard label for the rebel forces. It broadcast pictures of bodies of rebels lying in blood, flies buzzing around them.“We are not ‘armed gangs or terrorist groups,’ ” said Abu Rami, 25, one of the rebel fighters abandoning Midan. “We are a popular armed force and ordinary people support us. If we were not hosted by the people, we could not fight in these districts.”In the western Damascus neighborhood of Mezze, opposition activists reported helicopters firing heavy machine guns and tanks shelling buildings. In the northern suburb of Qaboun, Syrian soldiers and shabiha, pro-Assad militiamen, joined in teams to chase Free Syrian Army groups.“The soldiers are moving around in tanks and armored vehicles — they cannot walk because they fear the Free Syrian Army,” said Abu Bassam, a 60-year-old resident who accused the government forces of looting after most residents had fled. The electricity had been cut off since Tuesday, he said, and the area bombed repeatedly from helicopters.“The F.S.A. controls the land, and the regime’s helicopters own the sky,” he said.'"

"'12-07-22,'0','The new theater Jack in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, is wallpapered in aluminum foil. Even the tree underneath a lovely skylight is silver. Watching a noisy, frenetic production of Brecht’s “Baal” inside this space is like being inside a Jiffy Pop popcorn pan.Only a few blocks away from the new Barclays Center, Jack is a storefront theater with promise. Alec Duffy, the artistic director of the ambitious troupe Hoi Polloi, helps run the space and directed this inaugural show.Evocatively designed by Mimi Lien, the production makes a more convincing argument for the space than the play.“Baal,” Brecht’s first play, is the work of a young playwright, a sprawling yet static portrait of a dissolute poet who corrupts everything in his path. It appears to be trying to shock, but almost one century after it was written that’s a difficult task. In 2000 Jim Simpson gave the play a Beat flavor at the Flea Theater. Mr. Duffy aims for a more abstract staging that has the vibe of experimental theater in the 1960s. It is blunt, angry and indulgent.As Baal, Jason Quarles stumbles forcefully, often half-clothed, around the room where most of the audience stands, nearly tipping people over. As he moves from one sexual conquest to another, his furious physicality is the most alive thing in a production that has trouble gaining momentum. A loud drumming escalates the energy, and sex scenes are staged with scowls. The directorial choices are too on the nose, however, to startle. The cast surrounding this seductive, destructive title character moves through the audience chaotically, making few striking stage vignettes.The front door of the theater remains open, blurring the lines between the play and the rest of the world. At one point a honking horn interrupted the loud, screeching sound effects. I don’t think it was part of the show, but it felt perfectly in the spirit of it.'"

"'12-07-22,'0','The most asked question in golf — and even for those barely interested in golf but fascinated by Tiger Woods — has been the same since March: Is Tiger back?There are two answers, and the second matters far more than the first.If being back means hitting technically proficient shots with increasingly ordinary effort, if it means a relatively calm putting stroke, if it means sound course management and a placid existence because his marital and adultery scandal no longer comes up on or off the course, then Tiger is back. He has demonstrated that he is again performing at a level matched by few. With three PGA Tour victories this year, he would be player of the year if the vote were held today. Some would say that is the definition of being back on top.But if being back means seizing the major champion’s moment and facing the attendant pressure with so few hiccups it intimidates others into flinching, if it means making the stellar effort seem routine, if it means drawing the momentum to your side and letting it propel you where you need to go to win not just a PGA Tour event but a major championship, then Tiger is not back.He may yet win Sunday; he is only five strokes behind Scott. That woud be a definitive answer to most every question. But Saturday’s late-round stagger to the finish has become all too familiar for Woods in the last 15 months. For a while, it seemed the problem was the health of his legs. Then it looked as if it was his putting stroke that caused pivotal slip-ups. Then it was his driving. Then it was a lack of practice time.All those issues have largely gone away or been resolved (just don’t bring up his wedge play, but no one is perfect). The fact is Tiger Woods now regularly gets in position to do something majestic in the same ways he once habitually did superlative things in major championships. He is right there, the way he was always right there, and it seems inevitable that he will at least stay there and maybe stamp all over the competition during the final round.But these days, that has not happened. More commonly, Woods hits a shot, and as it tracks through the air, he gets a puzzled look on his face that we had almost never seen before 2010. The ball ends up in a bunker or, more commonly, over the green. He makes par instead of the birdie that would have shaken up the leader board. He tries to throw a haymaker at the field, but it misses. He is still standing, but so is everyone else. He still has a good chance, just as he does in Sunday’s final round at Royal Lytham & St. Annes. And so does everyone else.He marches on, the momentum of the moment leaking from his countenance with every step.He is clearly getting better, or maybe closer. At the United States Open last month, Woods fell apart Saturday. This time, he never fell apart; he just kicked away his best opportunity in the final 75 minutes.“I’m still in there,” he said late Saturday. “We’ll see what happens tomorrow.”He says that kind of thing all the time now. Over and over.Not yet. One more day to find out.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','The United States lost to host Venezuela by 2 points in the semifinals but rebounded to win the bronze medal and finish the tournament with a 4-1 record, good enough to qualify for the 2003 under-19 World Championships. Puerto Rico won the gold in Venezuela.The United States has fielded amateur teams with multiple future superstars — Patrick Ewing, Chris Mullin and Michael Jordan competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles — but in the history of the under-18 FIBA Americas Junior World Championship qualifying tournament, no other team can match the overloaded talent of the 2002 team; Anthony’s offense fused with a futuristic look at Iguodala’s lockdown defense, Brooks’s sneaky speed, Bosh’s big-man fundamentals, Humphries’s any-sport athleticism and Williams’s savvy. Bosh and Humphries, second and third in the team in scoring, came off the bench.“I’ll take that team any day,” Anthony said, mulling the idea of the team’s best players as the nucleus for an N.B.A. team.“We sold them on team success will lead to individual success, and we did a good job that way,” Kent said in a phone interview.Anthony, who led Syracuse to a national title the next year, took almost twice as many shots as any of his teammates in Venezuela, his preternatural scoring ability on display outside the United States for the first time.“Even at that age, he was almost unstoppable one on one,” Kent said.Iguodala and Williams started, Iguodala in a familiar role as a defensive stopper — he had 10 steals against Argentina — and Williams a point guard still finding his way.“I remember sitting him down and us telling him if you ever got in shape, you could be one heck of a player,” Kent said of Williams.Kent said Dee Brown, who became Williams’s teammate at Illinois, was the best American player in Venezuela.“Dee Brown would coach your team on the floor,” Kent said. “He would coach the officials. And he could coach the other team, too, because he was a tremendous leader, vocal leader, charismatic leader.”Anthony and Bosh were drafted third and fourth in the 2003 N.B.A. draft the next June. Brown and Williams returned to play for Kent a month later in Thessaloniki, Greece, at the under-19 world championships. C. J. Watson, who recently signed with the Nets to be Williams’s backup, played behind him in Greece as well.The team was again ousted in the knockout rounds despite tying Argentina for the tournament’s best record at 7-1.“Greece was a great destination for us to go to,” Williams said. “Again we had a pretty good team. Just came up a little bit short.”Anthony went on to play in Greece, on the 2004 Olympic team that won bronze, a squad with systemic failures that led to the revamping of USA Basketball under the stewardship of Jerry Colangelo and Mike Krzyzewski.The intersection of Anthony and Williams as teammates in Venezuela foretold little of their intertwining futures, 10 years on, as franchise cornerstones of the Knicks and the Nets.Williams, Anthony and Iguodala rehashed their time last week over breakfast in Las Vegas before heading to practice at Mendenhall Center.From the moment in 2002 that the players stepped off the plane, many of them outside the United States for the first time, nothing came easily.“The first hotel, the beds were like concrete and the hotel didn’t have running water,” Iguodala said.The team’s trainer, Joseph Sharpe, who will join Williams, Anthony and Iguodala in London, talked of small beds, floors that looked like dirt and windows without panes.Anthony noted that everything in the hotel’s surrounding area was “blown up.”The team was upgraded to a Holiday Inn a day later.On the court and around the court, the players were given a crude introduction to international play and heated rivalries.“Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic got into a fight; they were throwing things on the court,” Anthony said.Referring to rougher play and looser officiating, Sharpe said: “They were a little bit more physical, pushing and grabbing. Our guys were not used to that. I can remember guys coming off to the sideline, ‘They’re grabbing me.’ ‘Well, yeah, you’re right. They are grabbing you, but they’re not doing anything about it right now.’ ”The tournament was played at an arena that was open to the outside from the mezzanine level, which allowed humidity to thicken the air and wind to occasionally alter the playing conditions. With Hugo Chavez fighting to regain power and many Venezuelans looking to leave the country to find work, the young Americans arrived at a volatile time.“We didn’t really understand what was going on,” Anthony said.Iguodala added: “We weren’t a threat to anybody. We weren’t high profile enough for anybody to kidnap us or anything like that. We were kids. We just tried to have fun.”'"
"'12-07-22,'0','Brandt Snedeker, the American who led Scott by a stroke after two rounds, was also at seven under after a day full of adventure and misadventure on this historic course that is finally beginning to dry out.“It was one of those days where you shake your head and wonder what’s going on,” said Snedeker, who had not made a bogey through 40 holes but then made consecutive bogeys Saturday on the fifth and sixth holes.On No. 5, he missed a short putt for par. On No. 6, he landed in one of Lytham’s infamous pot bunkers for the first time this tournament. But he showed impressive pluck on the difficult closing holes, producing birdies on Nos. 16 and 18, where he holed a long curling putt.“I still have a chance tomorrow,” said Snedeker, a 31-year-old from Nashville. “I’ve come back from way farther back than this. I realize there’s a lot of golf left.”Snedeker will be paired on Sunday with Woods, who is five shots behind Scott at six under par. Ernie Els and Zach Johnson are at five under.It is an impressive leader board, brimming with former major champions, although Scott, for the moment, has yet to join that increasingly broad-based club. He has won eight times on the PGA Tour and came agonizingly close to winning the Masters in 2011 on a wild ride of a final day that ultimately finished in favor of the young South African Charl Schwartzel.But Scott is in prime position now and in the lead at a major tournament for the first time after 54 holes. His four-shot cushion could come in quite handy if the Sunday forecasts for strong winds, with gusts up to 30 miles per hour, prove correct.The forecasts have hardly been as solid as Scott’s ball striking here on the Lancashire coast.But Scott, who grew up in coastal Australia, has played plenty in the wind. So has McDowell, the expansive Northern Irishman.“The golf course, obviously, it still is a sleeping giant,” he said. “It’s certainly played a lot easier than we all expected in practice.”McDowell was also in the final group at this year’s United States Open, where he missed a 25-foot putt on the 18th that could have gotten him into a playoff with the young American Webb Simpson.Simpson became the 15th different player in a row to win a major golf tournament. McDowell, who won the 2010 United States Open, is the only man still in contention at Royal Lytham & St. Annes who can keep that remarkable streak from being extended to 16.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','Jamie Dimon, the chairman and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has bought about $17 million worth of common shares and sold about $13 million in preferred shares, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Mr. Dimon spent about $17.1 million buying common shares for himself and indirectly for his wife and limited liability company.He directly purchased 110,000 common shares at about $34.43 a share on Thursday and 250,000 shares at $34.02 on Friday for a total of about $12.3 million, bringing the number of shares he owns directly to 3,226,153, according to the filing.Mr. Dimon also bought 65,000 shares indirectly for the benefit of his wife for about $2.23 million, according to the filing, which was made on Friday, bringing the total shares she owns to 971,459. Additionally, he bought 75,000 shares at $34.45 for a limited liability company.The purchases came after the sale of 12,142 preferred shares at $1,110 each, for a total of $13.48 million, which he had held indirectly for trusts or limited liability companies, according to the filing.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','As Mr. Barofsky writes, he had assumed that his assignment to oversee TARP meant that he should be fiercely independent from the Treasury Department, and vigilant against waste, fraud and abuse. But after canvassing other inspector generals for guidance, he writes, he learned of different priorities: maintaining and possibly increasing budgets, appearing to be active — and not making enemies.“The common refrain went like this,” Mr. Barofsky writes. “There are three different types of I.G.’s. You can be a lap dog, a watchdog or a junkyard dog.” A lap dog is seen as too timid, he was told. But being a junkyard dog was also ill-advised.“What you want to be is a watchdog,” he continues. “The agency should perceive you as a constructive but independent partner, helping to make things better for the agency, so everyone is better off.” He also learned, he says, that success as an inspector general meant that investigations come second. Don’t second-guess the Treasury. Instead, “focus on process.”Thus the collision course was set between Mr. Barofsky and a crew of complacent, bank-friendly Treasury officials. He soon discovered that the department’s natural stance of marching in lock step with the banks meant that he had to question its policies and programs repeatedly to ensure that taxpayers weren’t at risk for fraud and abuse.“The suspicions that the system is rigged in favor of the largest banks and their elites, so they play by their own set of rules to the disfavor of the taxpayers who funded their bailout, are true,” Mr. Barofsky said in an interview last week. “It really happened. These suspicions are valid.”To be sure, Mr. Barofsky and his team were up against a powerful status quo. And that meant that they ran into plenty of brick walls.“Bailout” covers a lot of ground, running through attempts of the inspector general’s office to ensure that additional rescue programs suggested by the Treasury had safeguards in place to avoid conflicts of interest, collusion and fraud. One battle involved the Public-Private Investment Program, designed to get troubled mortgages off banks’ balance sheets by encouraging private investors to buy them using mostly taxpayer dollars. When the inspector general’s office recommended ways to protect against fraud and to fix other flaws in the program, Mr. Barofsky writes, the Treasury rejected the suggestions, maintaining that they would gut the programs and reduce participation.Another skirmish involved the department’s ill-conceived loan modification plan, known as the Home Affordable Modification Program. When the Treasury began discussing the program’s outlines, Mr. Barofsky said he became concerned that it would open the door to fraudulent foreclosure rescue schemes, in which large upfront fees could be extracted from desperate borrowers eager to participate in what was supposed to be a free government program. When his office recommended fraud-prevention measures, several were ignored, he writes.A few months after the modification plan was announced, his office began a preliminary audit of its rollout. “We soon verified what we had suspected,” Mr. Barofsky writes. “Treasury had failed to ensure that the servicers had the necessary infrastructure to support a massive mortgage modification program.” It barely got off the ground, and few homeowners have received the help they hoped for.THIS was just one of many examples from Mr. Barofsky’s 16-month tenure, during which, he says, Washington abandoned Main Street while rescuing Wall Street. “There has to be wide-scale acknowledgment that regulatory capture exists, dominates our system and needs to be eradicated,” Mr. Barofsky said in the interview. “It was my job to bring as much transparency to taxpayers so they knew what was going on. Writing the book, I tried to bring the same level of transparency so people understand how captured their government has become to the financial interests.”I asked Mr. Barofsky, now a senior fellow at the N.Y.U. School of Law, what could be done to get regulators to man up, as it were.“We need to re-educate our regulators that it’s O.K. to be adversarial, that it’s not going to hurt your career advancement to be more skeptical and more challenging,” he said. “It’s implicit in so much of the regulatory structure that if you don’t make too many waves there will be a job for you elsewhere. So we have to limit those job opportunities and develop a more professional path for regulators as a career. That way, they won’t always have that siren call of Wall Street.”Mr. Barofsky’s assessment of his former regulatory brethren is crucial for taxpayers to understand, because Congress’s financial reform act — the Dodd-Frank legislation — left so much of the heavy lifting to the weak-kneed.“So much of what’s wrong with Dodd-Frank is it trusts the regulators to be completely immune to the corrupting influences of the banks,” he said in the interview. “That’s so unrealistic. Congress has to take a meat cleaver to these banks and not trust regulators to do the job with a scalpel.”Finally, Mr. Barofsky joins the ranks of those who believe that another crisis is likely because of the failed response to this one. “Incentives are baked into the system to take advantage of it for short-term profit,” he said. “The incentives are to cheat, and cheating is profitable because there are no consequences.”Despite all of this, Mr. Barofsky ends on something of a positive note. Meaningful changes to our broken system may finally come about, he writes, if enough people get angry. His conclusion is this: “Only with this appropriate and justified rage can we sow the seeds for the types of reform that will one day break our system free from the corrupting grasp of the megabanks.”That’s not much of a silver lining. But I guess it’s better than none.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','When the riders reach the cobbled Champs-Élysées, Wiggins’s teammate and countryman Christopher Froome will be in second, 3 minutes 21 seconds back; Nibali will be third, 6:19 off the pace.Nibali need not watch his back, though: the fourth-place Jurgen Van Den Broeck, a Belgian on Lotto-Belisol, trails him by nearly four minutes.In recent years, the Tour has often been decided by a tense final time trial. In 2010, Alberto Contador held off Andy Schleck in an individual test that finished in Bordeaux, though he eventually yielded the title to Schleck after a positive doping test. Last year, Schleck lost the yellow jersey in Grenoble to Cadel Evans.Both were the only lengthy time trials of their Tours, however; those races were considered more of a climbers’ test.This year’s course featured three time trials totaling more than 60 miles, which seemed tailor made for Wiggins.If Saturday’s stage seemed devoid of suspense, it was because of Wiggins’s performance in the first time trial of distance, a 25.8-mile test held July 9.On a hilly course that finished in Besançon, near the France-Switzerland border, Wiggins opened up considerable time. His closest rival at the time, Evans of BMC Racing, lost nearly two minutes, a gap that widened in the mountains.“I started as a kid in time trialing and racing at the track,” Wiggins said. “So to win the Tour like this at a discipline that I’m so good at is beautiful.”On Saturday, there was little elevation change as the race passed through the agriculturally rich Eure-et-Loir department.In intervals of three minutes, riders left the start in Bonneval one by one and rode past industrial windmills and wheat fields on the way to Chartres, less than 60 miles southwest of Paris.During the previous individual test, Fabian Cancellara posted the fastest result before Wiggins snatched the stage. But Cancellara, who held the yellow jersey for eight days at the Tour’s outset, was not in Chartres. He pulled out of the race July 11 to be with his pregnant wife — and rest his legs in advance of the Olympic time trial in August.Playing Cancellara’s role on Saturday was Luis León Sánchez of Rabobank, who finished the day in third. Sánchez was first knocked off the lead by Froome, who finished in second, before Wiggins came barreling through in the final miles to win the stage.It was a release of emotion nearly a year in the making. After crashing out of the Tour last year, Wiggins watched the final week of the race from home, wondering what could have been.“Watching Cadel in Grenoble win the Tour a year ago and seeing the sense of what he was going through and how happy he looked, that was my motivation,” he said. “I wanted to feel what he felt.”Evans’s performance on Saturday was a far cry from that of one year ago, when he tore along the streets of Grenoble to capture his first Tour victory.Evans, a 34-year-old Australian, was passed on the course by his 23-year-old teammate Tejay van Garderen of the United States. Van Garderen, however, played down any pretensions of taking over Evans’s role as BMC Racing’s team leader.“Cadel has had a bit of sickness; he’s been dealing with a lot of stuff this Tour,” van Garderen said.“I still think he has another Tour win in him, and if he’s going to do it next year, I want to be there with him.”As the riders make their way along the 74.6-mile course from Rambouillet to Paris on Sunday, van Garderen will be celebrating along with Wiggins.Van Garderen will finish this Tour as winner of the white jersey, given to the top-placed young rider.But he will surely have his eye on Wiggins, who is about to realize a childhood dream.“When you’re 12, what you want to do is win the Tour de France, but nobody thinks it’s really possible, though,” Wiggins said. “But here I am, 20 years on, about to do that.”'"
"'12-07-22,'0','That Picasso gig was about 25 years ago, and all evidence suggests that the Freeport is more treasure-crammed than ever. Though little known outside the art world, this surprisingly drab series of buildings is renowned by dealers and collectors as the premier place to stash their most valuable works.They come for the security and stay for the tax treatment. For as long as goods are stored here, owners pay no import taxes or duties, in the range of 5 to 15 percent in many countries. If the work is sold at the Freeport, the owner pays no transaction tax, either.Once it exits the premises — either because it’s been sold or because the original owner has moved it — taxes are owed in the country where it winds up. But for as long as a work is in the Freeport, it’s as if it resides in a no-man’s land where there is no Caesar to render unto.Only a few years ago, in fact, the Freeport was officially not part of Switzerland. The buildings have since been patriated, but they and a handful of lesser-known freeports in different parts of Switzerland remain the closest thing to the Cayman Islands that the art world has to offer. It’s a haven where the climate — financial and otherwise — is ideal for high-net-worth individuals and their assets.How much art is stockpiled in the 435,000 square feet of the Geneva Freeport? That’s a tough one. The canton of Geneva, which owns an 86 percent share of the Freeport, does not know, nor does Geneva Free Ports and Warehouses, the company that pays the canton for the right to serve as the Freeport’s landlord. Swiss customs officials presumably know, but they aren’t talking. Suffice it to say, there is wide belief among art dealers, advisers and insurers that there is enough art tucked away here to create one of the world’s great museums.“I doubt you’ve got a piece of paper wide enough to write down all the zeros,” says Nicholas Brett, underwriting director of AXA Art Insurance in London, when asked to guess at the total value of Freeport art. “It’s a huge but unknown number.”The number is about to grow. At the Freeport, construction has begun on a new, 130,000-square-foot warehouse that will specialize in storing art. It is scheduled to open at the end of 2013.In the coming years, collectors and dealers will also have a variety of other high-security, customs-friendly, tax-free storage options around the world. Luxembourg is building a 215,000-square-foot freeport, scheduled to open in 2014 at its airport. In March, construction began on the Beijing Free Port of Culture at Beijing Capital International Airport.There has also been talk of doubling the size of the freeport in Singapore, a gleaming, high-tech operation that is so sleek it’s hard to believe a “Mission: Impossible” sequel hasn’t been filmed there. It opened in 2010, next to Changi airport, and caters to Asian collectors who are ferried in white limos from the tarmac to the warehouse.THIS construction boomlet is a novel way to gauge the art market’s strikingly swift recovery from a precipitous fall in 2008, when sales at auctions, the industry bellwether, shrank in the aftermath of the Great Recession. Global sales in 2011, both at auction and in private deals, were estimated at $64.1 billion, according to Clare McAndrew, an art economist, That total is just shy of the record high of $65.8 billion set in 2007 — and well ahead of the 2009 trough of $39.4 billion.At the high end, some works are fetching prices that far exceed the heights of five years ago, when the phrase “art market bubble” was commonplace. In June, Christie’s sold a 1981 painting by Jean-Michel Basquiat for $20.1 million, a record for the artist at auction and a figure that far surpassed the $14.6 million it sold for five years ago at Sotheby’s. The same month, “Blue Star,” by Joan Miró, sold at Sotheby’s for close to $37 million, more than double the sum it earned at auction in Paris in 2007.In record time, the art market decline of 2009 has given way to new anxieties about overinflated prices. (“How long can the art market walk on water?” read a headline in a July-August issue of The Art Newspaper.) A major reason, Ms. McAndrew says, is the arrival of Chinese buyers in large numbers, as well as buyers from Russia and the Middle East. Then there is the newfound sense among collectors worldwide that art is a smart commodity to buy in the midst of economic turmoil.“People have realized that art is a safe haven asset when other markets are doing poorly,” Ms. McAndrew says. “In general, art holds its value over time, and in some cases it increases.”Granted, some freeport users are people who have been collecting for years, purely out of passion, and suddenly find that pieces they bought decades ago are now worth sums so immense that keeping them at home is a gratuitous risk. But more typical are collectors in need of storage and tax relief because they never intended to display what they had bought.The difference between a room of Picassos and a stack of gold bars isn’t what it used to be. And that bothers people like Michael Findlay, a director at Acquavella Galleries and author of “The Value of Art.”“The art business now attracts people who are parking money, who are speculating and who want social status,” Mr. Findlay says. “The flaw in their thinking is that from a historical perspective, the great private collections were put together by people who bought art because they could afford it and liked it. When these people spent money on art, they considered it spent and they had something to enjoy for the rest of their lives. It was for personal use. The art spent no time at a freeport.”MANY art warehouses are so unobtrusive that you can walk by them and never know it. The Geneva Freeport isn’t one of them. A quarter of a mile away, you can see the name of the place, Ports Francs — which is French for free port — in red letters on the outside of a windowless white building facing a commuter thruway. From a distance, it looks like a multiplex movie theater.Driving up, you expect a checkpoint, armed guards, retina scans, German shepherds and X-ray machines. But none are in sight. There is some fencing and barbed wire, but less than you’d think. This isn’t to say that security here is lax — dealers, movers and collectors describe the place as impregnable, and locks and cameras abound. But nothing about the site says Fort Knox.Unless you notice the Swiss customs officials, who are not particularly obtrusive, this could pass for a large self-storage operation in Queens. It sits about two miles from the center of Geneva, next to a post office and amid a hodgepodge of gray and unremarkable bridges and streets.Media tours of the Freeport are rare, but there have been more in recent years as the government and the company that operates the facility strive to reassure the public that there is nothing mysterious or unscrupulous going on here. In part, this is a hangover of some bad publicity. In 2003, Swiss authorities announced that they would return hundreds of antiquities stolen from excavation sites in Egypt, including two mummies, sarcophagi, masks and statues. Some of the items were reportedly painted in garish colors so they could be smuggled in as cheap souvenirs. The ringleader of this group was eventually sentenced to 35 years in prison.The episode helped to spur some regulatory changes, including a rule that requires tenants to keep an inventory using a specific template. It is hardly a huge change — customs officials were always allowed to ask to see any container they wanted — but experts say the rules were enacted, in part, to counter the Freeport’s undeserved image as a place where anything goes.“The legislative changes were in response to the criticism,” says Eva Stormann, an attorney based in Geneva who specializes in art law. “But much of that was based on a wrong understanding of how the Freeport works. It is a highly reputable place.”On a June afternoon, a tour of the Freeport is given by Florence May and Gilbert Epars, marketing directors for Geneva Free Ports. The first stop is a wine cellar piled high with crates stamped with names like Château Mouton Rothschild, Dom Pérignon and Château Petrus.Art, it turns out, is just one category of valuable stored in these buildings. Things like cigars, Lamborghinis, soap and Porsches show up, too. There is also a silo large enough for 45 tons of grain.Honestly, grain. It’s the last bit of evidence that when the original Freeport here opened back in 1888, it wasn’t for rarefied assets at all. It was designed for agricultural goods, and anything else that can be stored in bulk, and regarded as a place to keep stuff briefly while it traveled from on part of the country to another.But the upside of the ""temporary exemption of taxes and duties for an unlimited period of time,” as it’s called, caught the eye of a more upscale crowd. Wine lovers among them.“There are about three million bottles of wine here,” says Mr. Epars, after doing some quick math in his head.What you won’t see on this tour, weirdly enough, is art. It is all behind dozens of locked doors up and down a series of featureless hallways. The only hint that you stand amid Monets, Rothkos and Warhols — or works by artists of their stature — is a number of discarded frames sitting near a large vault in the basement of one building. That and a wooden crate that, according to a label on its side, held a painting by Jules Olitski, a Russian-born artist who died in 2007.The concentration of so much great art in one place has started to make insurers nervous. The problem is that most art insurance provides what is called “worldwide coverage,” which means that the work is insured wherever it is. But if so much art is packed in a mere 31 acres of terrain, what would happen if disaster struck?“The nightmare scenario is a plane crash, or a fire, or a flood,” says Adam Prideaux, an insurance broker at Blackwall Green in London. “But Freeport authorities are reluctant to give out security information, and they won’t give out information about fire divisions, so we don’t know if a fire could spread. Maybe it wouldn’t, but we have no idea because the Swiss won’t discuss it.”It’s to the point now, Mr. Prideaux adds, that new policies for the Freeport are either cost-prohibitive or impossible to write.“We can’t actually calculate how much we have insured at the Freeport, and at some point, insurers said, ‘My God, we have unlimited coverage and we have no idea how much of that is at the Freeport,’ ” Mr. Prideaux says. “There are insurers who could be so overexposed that in the event of disaster they will be unable to pay.”THE unknown of what’s inside the Geneva Freeport makes it an ideal metaphor for the art market, much of which is shrouded in mystery. Sales at auctions attract attention, but both the value and the volume of private transactions are apparently larger. Perhaps far larger.Ms. McAndrew, the economist, has surveyed dealers and collectors, and estimates that in the United States, private sales make up 70 percent of all transactions measured by dollar value.So while it’s widely known that one of Edvard Munch’s four versions of “The Scream” sold at Sotheby’s in June for nearly $120 million, other megadeals are struck in secret. Or mostly in secret. It’s been widely reported that a buyer or buyers in Qatar — the odds are it was the royal family — spent $250 million for one of “The Card Players,” by Cézanne, which would make it the largest sum ever paid for a work of art.Private deals at the lower end of the market are booming, too. Only three years ago, says Wendy Goldsmith, director of Goldsmith Art Advisory in London, “we’d sit there staring at our phones, willing them to ring.” Now, she describes a conversation with an artist who is “not museum quality,” with eight pieces of newly produced art and a waiting list of 81 people. (“What do you suggest I do?” the artist asked Ms. Goldsmith, a little desperately.)The lines for the marquee contemporary names are even longer.“I bought a Gursky for a client,” Ms. Goldsmith says, referring to Andreas Gursky, whose stunning, large-scale photographs come with stunning, large-scale price tags. “I had to write Gursky a letter about my client’s collection. I had to explain why my client wanted this photograph so much. And this piece cost over $1 million. It was like pledging your first born.”“The machinations are fascinating,” she adds. “They’re also spiraling out of control.”Signs of this uptick are evident at the Freeport. For years, art-related bustle here consisted of trucks being loaded and unloaded, and business people arriving with dealers or advisers to size up a possible purchase. But in recent years, a handful of galleries have sprung up here, and the first belonged to none other than Simon Studer, the dealer who cataloged Picassos in the basement.Mr. Studer’s gallery, which opened here three years ago, is on the third floor of a warehouse, and after some extensive interior decorating, including the installation of heating, it looks like a New York loft. Why the Freeport? The rent is inexpensive when compared with that in downtown Geneva.“And if a person is willing to come to the Freeport, they are serious about buying,” he says. There is not a lot of window-shopping here because there aren’t a lot of windows.His onetime protégée, Sandra Recio, has opened a gallery next door. “This place also has some mystique,” she says. “You tell people you’re at the Freeport and that sounds intriguing.”Mr. Studer, who speaks with a light French accent, walks to the rear of his gallery, where he has set up a cozy little viewing room. Works by Giacometti, Balthus and Modigliani hang on walls, there’s a cowhide rug on the floor and a couple of brown leather Barcelona chairs near an easel.“So you got to look around?” he asks, referring to the tour given the previous day by Ms. May and Mr. Epars. “The place has changed because of the bad reputation from the antiquities stolen from excavations. They want to show that it’s transparent and totally legal.”There is a newfound vigilance among customs officials, he says. A few days earlier, one of them stopped him on the street near the Freeport:“He asked me to open my briefcase and show him what was inside. He asked where I was coming from, where I was going. That was a first.”Asked if he or Ms. Recio has ever seen any art at the Freeport, other than what they sell, they both think for a moment.“I’ve seen taxidermy,” Ms. Recio says. “Animal heads.”“Most of the time, you get an idea of what is behind these doors through your nose,” Mr. Studer says. “You might smell soaps, or carpets.”Leaving the gallery, he walks to the elevator and runs into a father and son who sell cigars — rolled in Costa Rica, they say, and filled with the finest tobacco from around the world.Mr. Studer has an expression on his face that says, “That’s the Freeport for you.”“It’s nothing fancy, nothing sexy,” he says. “It’s just pure business. It’s a very gray, very boring, dark, Swiss place. But when you go inside, you have some surprises.”'"

They are printed verbatim, with only line and stanza breaks added; their titles are the subject headings.You overtook my strideapproaching the lakehouseat Central Park this evening.While the cops stopped youfrom making a spectacle of yourself,to me, I thoughtthere was no greater tribute to beauty,liberation and bold innocence than you.Perhaps it was just the sweltering heatthat prompted you,but you prompted in memy own sweltering heatlonging for the right words to sayat that moment in that silentside by side momentarysplendor of you.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','“I spent an entire day in a canoe with cousin Elin,” he said. “After a day of sweating and grunting and bonding in my life vest, I felt like family. So after a celebratory dinner, it was time to say our goodbyes. I found Elin and went in for a hug. But she went in for the Dutch triple kiss. She sputtered, I froze and our collision was spectacularly awkward.”The tension can be particularly potent with colleagues. The beginnings and endings of meetings with clients are sometimes excruciating, as we wait for someone to set the terms of salutations between individuals who are eager to display their camaraderie but who probably don’t know one another terribly well. To run into someone from work at a party or restaurant is to be suddenly forced to assign status to someone who may exist in your mind only as Guy Who Knows How to Replace the Xerox Machine’s Toner. Head nod? Cheek kiss? Vigorous pelvic wallop?“Social kissing might have evolved as a way for people to inoculate themselves against passion, as well as to demonstrate their ability to rein in or even transcend desire,” said Daniel Akst, the author of “We Have Met the Enemy: Self-Control in an Age of Excess.” Mr. Akst views social kissing as a form of “regulated infidelity” meant to stymie courtship.“Ritual is always useful for channeling desire,” he said. “Think of the cocktail hour.”But in the recent past, the borders of this regulated infidelity would seem to have become more porous or vague. Social media may have played a role. We live in a world in which people regularly “friend” others without so much as a note or reminder, without so much as a “Hi, Sarah, it’s me, Edmund — Linda’s high-strung friend with the horrible overbite.”We can also point an accusing finger at our preoccupation with tinsel and schmoozing.“Everyone’s become so used to celebrity culture, with all its false intimacy and mwah-mwah, that we’ve become confused,” said a British etiquette consultant, William Hanson. “If you kiss me on the first outing, where will we go from there?”Mr. Hanson described proper procedure: “If it’s a man and a woman who are greeting each other, the lady proffers her cheek or cheeks. If she doesn’t want to kiss, she extends her hand. If it’s two women, it’s the senior one who sets the terms.”His dictates make it sound easy. But as it turns out, the world is fraught with exceptions.“Although I have heard of social kissing, I am pretty sure that I have never kissed anyone in public,” said Julia Zanes, a painter in Saxtons River, Vt. “Here in New England, public affection is a public nuisance.”When running into Ms. Zanes socially, I have been moved to greet her merely with a wry smile or with ducklike arm-flapping.Or consider the case of Silvana Nova, a New York City accessories designer born and raised in Canada, who kisses his gay male friends on the lips as greeting. The social milieu of Mr. Nova, who married the critic Craig Seligman three years ago, is heavy on Brooklyn hipsters.“Among our many mixed-sex couple friends in New York, I’ve noticed that the female half usually does a cheek kiss, while the male half usually kisses me on the lips,” Mr. Nova said. “I’m not sure why this is. Sometimes I think these sensitive straight guys — who are not metrosexuals: please! — feel they have to go out of their way to prove they’re not uptight. Sometimes I just think they like to kiss on the lips.”Heterosexual American men kissing their gay brethren on the lips may cause some people to blanch.Mr. Akst: “I guess this is where I get off the train.”Mr. Hanson: “Great that the straight man is that comfortable. But a lot of gay men will read too much into it. As would a woman who he does that to.”But what’s paramount in Mr. Nova’s scenario — and what keeps his straight male friends’ lip-kissing from being bad manners — is that Mr. Nova likes to be kissed on the lips. In their ideal form, greetings are mutually agreed-upon acts that cater to, or at least acknowledge, whichever of the dyad wants the lesser amount of intimacy.For example, when Desiderio from Italy comes to our shores, he should refrain from coating his friends’ and acquaintances’ lips with a thin slipcover of viscous goo. When affectionate Tanya runs into her sociopathic colleague, Tom, at a restaurant, it might seem forward of her to turn her cheek toward his lips; however, if Tanya and Tom are actually friends, then politesse asks that Tom go through the motions of cheek-kissing lest he be deemed churlish.Ideally, the two people greeting each other consider not only the level of intimacy they share, but also their milieu. If, to take an extreme example, they find themselves in an area overrun with Ebola virus, they will want to follow others’ example and adopt the elbow bump.Or, more commonly, they may want to take a cue from Carl Sprague, a film production designer in Stockbridge, Mass. Mr. Sprague views the world’s populations in ascending gradations of intimacy: “London. New York. Los Angeles. Paris. Bohemian Paris. Suburban Paris lycée girls.”But sometimes the indications are murky — sometimes we have the sense that sociopathic Tom is secretly longing for a cheek kiss; sometimes we think that a nice lip smack from Desiderio might be exactly the thwack of excitement that would put this torpid Tuesday afternoon up on its feet.So, we heighten. We give expression to burgeoning sentiment. In which case, we should be prepared to deflate or sidestep any awkwardness that ensues when our ministrations are deemed overeager.“Just laugh it off,” Mr. Hanson said. “Say, ‘Oh, dear — getting ahead of myself’ or something. Don’t say, ‘Oh, I was going to kiss you a second time!’ ”Those who find themselves in the opposite boat — those who find others’ lips to be eely; those who wish that people, like restaurants, came with sanitation letter-grades — should similarly be prepared in the event their level of containment is unmatched. They should try to keep wincing to a minimum.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','“One of the hard parts of making a film like this is that you don’t know how the story ends,” said Evan Osnos, the Beijing correspondent for The New Yorker, who met Ms. Klayman just before she started the project. “If you’re making a film about Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, you do know, and you structure the story accordingly. But if you’re making a film in real time about a guy who is going down an uncharted path, all you can do is hang on for dear life and see where it goes. To Alison’s credit she stayed with it, because she saw a story of real importance.”Ms. Klayman said that among her objectives was to use Mr. Ai’s situation to show that not only are there “people interested in pushing the boundaries in China,” but also that “there are cracks for those people to maneuver in.” Citing his use of Twitter, blogs and other forms of social media to get his political message and artworks out, she added, “I do see China as a society with room for a lot of interesting things to be happening, despite the tough nature of authority.”But she also captures the Chinese state at its most arbitrary and despotic, disregarding the rule of law and international human rights conventions to which it is a signatory. Officials in Shanghai, for example, invite Mr. Ai to build a studio there, then bulldoze it when he falls into disfavor: he responds with a party at the demolition site, serving river crab, whose name is a Mandarin homonym for the “harmony” the government tries to enforce.In perhaps the most extraordinary footage in the film, which Mr. Ai himself supplied, police in Sichuan invade his hotel room in the middle of the night and beat him so severely that he has to undergo surgery in Germany for a cranial hemorrhage. When he complains, they mock him, saying he must have hit himself; and when he tries to file a complaint at a police station there, an episode Ms. Klayman shot until forced to leave, his quixotic effort is thwarted by a Kafkaesque bureaucracy.Such up-close glimpses suggest what happens, when no one is looking, to other dissidents, like the jailed political philosopher and literary critic Liu Xiaobo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010, or the lawyer Chen Guangcheng, held under house arrest until he fled to the American Embassy and became the center of a diplomatic crisis between the United States and China this spring. This month the Chinese government’s claims that one such dissident, Li Wangyang, committed suicide while under police surveillance in a hospital were met with widespread skepticism and demonstrations in Hong Kong.“I didn’t set out with any intention of how I wanted to portray the state,” Ms. Klayman said. “But I do think they wrote their part into the film themselves.”Throughout “Never Sorry” Mr. Ai seems deliberately to blur the lines among his creative work, political efforts and private life. Ms. Klayman shows a project in which the artist, his middle finger extended, is photographed at Tiananmen Square, where in 1989 the People’s Liberation Army slaughtered hundreds of students and others seeking political reform.Even a dinner at an outdoor restaurant in Chengdu, Sichuan, under the watchful eye of police, seems to be staged as an art project. As the film notes, Mr. Ai’s artistic influences include Joseph Beuys and Marcel Duchamp, who specialized in just that sort of thing.“If you ask Ai Weiwei, everything he does is a performance piece, so what you see in the movie is also performance art,” said Zhang Hongtu, a Chinese artist in New York who befriended Mr. Ai during the decade or so he lived in the United States and who appears in the film. “He does everything in a calculated way, with a strategy, and ‘Never Sorry’ captures that.”But even though Mr. Ai’s provocative works and his conflicts with the Communist Party have made him a familiar figure to art world connoisseurs and those who follow events in China, his background and motivation have remained obscure. Ms. Klayman’s film helps to fill in those blanks.Thus “Never Sorry” contains tender scenes of Mr. Ai and his mother, and also shows his devotion to his father, the poet Ai Qing. A major figure in 20th-century Chinese literature, Ai Qing was jailed first by the anti-Communist Kuomintang and then by Mao Zedong in the anti-rightist campaign in 1957, the year Ai Weiwei was born, and was sent off to Xinjiang, in China’s remote far west.“For his first 17 years what did he see?” Ms. Klayman wondered. “He saw his father, an internationally known cultural figure who had hung out with Neruda and studied in Paris, cleaning toilets and being shunned as an enemy of the people. It must have been very strange, though it wasn’t always clear that this is a defining thing about him. Sometimes he didn’t want to talk about it, and sometimes he very much embraced it. So I don’t have a clear-cut answer for that.”As Ms. Klayman herself is quick to admit, her own road to making “Never Sorry” was rather circuitous. Initially she took jobs at a members-only wine bar, as a personal assistant to the Chinese actress Liu Yifei and at the Beijing Olympics’ English-language Web site. But then her roommate, who worked at a Beijing gallery, asked Ms. Klayman, who had just bought a camera, if she was interested in making a video to accompany an exhibition of Mr. Ai’s photographs.“It was sort of like ‘Well, you’re young and eager and underemployed, would you like to give it a try?’ “ Ms. Klayman explained. “I was so game for it, I signed an agreement with the gallery. It was ‘We won’t pay you for this, but you can keep your footage,’ and I figured I’d hang out with this artist for a month.”But after the exhibition opened, in 2009, Ms. Klayman, intrigued by her subject and with few other commitments, kept shooting and shooting. As 2009 turned into 2010, she kept at it, with Mr. Ai’s encouragement and occasional needling.Made essentially on spec, “Never Sorry” faced one final challenge once Ms. Klayman returned to the United States: finding distribution. When the producer Adam Schlesinger, whose credits include the documentary “God Grew Tired of Us,” saw the film, he was smitten, and shepherded it to the Sundance Film Festival, where in January it won a special jury prize. “Considering that it was her first film, and that the story subject was a moving target, it was really impressive,” Mr. Schlesinger said, “and at the same time inspiring and accessible.”Mr. Osnos added, “Other films have been made about Ai Weiwei, but the difference is that Alison was on the ground living here and made a commitment to follow him at the sidewalk level.” He continued, “I’m guessing that this project took over her life a bit, and that made sense to him, because his project has taken over his life.”'"
"'12-07-22,'0','Robert Draper’s story about Priorities USA Action, the pro-Obama super PAC, is the most interesting political story of the week. One takeaway is that Priorities USA really does have a big role in the campaign. The tepid pace of the recovery suggests that Obama can’t run on a “look what we did” platform. He can only persuade Americans that Mitt Romney won’t make things better.As I’ve read about the woes of Priorities USA pitching fastidious left-leaning multimillionaires who turn up their noses at super PACs, I’ve wondered whether Priorities couldn’t go to the highways and byways as its predecessors did and raise significant money from small donors. . . . Would this cannibalize the fund-raising of the Obama campaign and the D.N.C., or could it squeeze additional dollars out of the base? I would donate to Priorities if it asked me — at $100 a shot, not a million. How many others would?Well of course the Democrats are trying to catch up in the super-PAC game. What choice do they have? Turn on your television. Everything is a competition.I note this nugget from Draper’s piece: The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA Action did some polling on Romney. Here’s one thing they found (and place your hand below your jaw, so you don’t hurt yourself as it hits the table): “For example, when Priorities informed a focus group that Romney supported the Ryan budget plan — and thus championed ‘ending Medicare as we know it’ — while also advocating tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, the respondents simply refused to believe any politician would do such a thing.” There’s some word beyond “perverse” for that — a politician benefiting from the fact that his plans and commitments are so radical that voters simply can’t believe he’d pursue them.I met Albrecht Muth and Viola Drath at a small party in the late ’90s or early 2000s. I actually didn’t think they were a pair and asked Viola who she was with. She said, “Albrecht!” I said, “What does Albrecht do?” She said, “Nothing!” How I wish that were true. She was a tragic figure indeed.“To score a big-name dinner guest or a favor from a V.I.P. in Washington, there was no point messing around with official channels or wasting time with midlevel functionaries,” Franklin Foer writes. As a result “there’s an unexpected naïveté among the truly powerful; they assume that anyone who has arrived at their desk has survived the scrutiny of handlers.” Muth seems to have understood this, and thanks to his bizarre story, we, too, have been provided with a very readable lesson in extreme social climbing.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','CARLIN Seeing his standards and integrity was a lot of pressure to live up to. I put that on myself. When he died, stepping into my work has been easier. I don’t feel like I have to live up to him.PRYOR I’m not trying to be him. I’m not great at stand-up. I’m good. It’s going to take a while if I decide I want to be great. For me it’s a job, so I don’t have to teach. Headlining the other night, it was surreal. Everyone was like, “You were great,” and inside I am like, “You paid to see me? Are you kidding?” I did some stuff I don’t think is funny, but no one cared. Some people come because they miss him.Q. Does that make you distrust the audience’s response?PRYOR I don’t trust laughs from other comedians. I trust laughs from audiences.Q. How does a child rebel if her father is a counterculture star?PRYOR I dyed my hair pink when I was 13, and my dad threatened to kick me out of the house. He was like, “There will be no punk rockers here.” I was like, “You just snorted coke off a [prostitute’s chest].”CARLIN My acting out came through drugs and bad boys. At 18 I ended up with a 29-year-old man who was a car mechanic and cocaine dealer and was on probation for federal weapons charges. Within two months he was living in my parents’ house. My parents were like, “At least she’s at home.”Q. Kelly, your dad had a great bit criticizing modern parenting. His prescription: Leave them alone!CARLIN Very laissez-faire. There were few rules. Twice my dad yelled at me. Once, when we lived in [the Los Angeles neighborhood] Venice, he told me to never park my bike in a park because he thought it would get stolen. And before my high school prom, we bought a bunch of coke and someone asked us if we wanted to base cocaine. My dad was buying weed with me. But I told him, and he flipped out.PRYOR Did you enjoy that?CARLIN I wish I had more limits. I ended up in bad relationships. I was doing too much drugs for a teenage girl. I didn’t get my life started until 26 or 27.PRYOR I find that interesting because I had the opposite experience. I think I smoked pot once in high school. My dad was strict. We had to make our own beds. We had to cook, clean. We had to treat people with respect. We had to act right in school. When I was 16, a boy came over, and my dad stood at the top of the stairs with a shotgun and said, “What are your intentions with my daughter?”Q. You both have written works about your fathers that are loving but cleareyed.CARLIN At some point you have to take your parents off the pedestal no matter how many people want to put them on one.PRYOR When I was 13, he went to Hawaii with someone. I wrote him a letter saying you’re a phony.CARLIN For me, it came much later when my mom died. I realized I was grieving very differently. I lost my mother. He lost the love of his life, but there was a lot of baggage in their marriage. It had become more companionship. The next year he met Sally Wade, which was a whirlwind romance. I realized this tight-knit family was a construct in my head. That’s when I started to write my stories. Who am I? What is my story?Q. Dad humor is famously bad. What were your father’s jokes like at home?CARLIN My dad was introverted. He did a lot of characters, voices in the house. He had a goofy sense of humor. I love my dad’s mind, but when he does a goofy face, that is his true nature: the clown.PRYOR My dad was quiet and silly. His idea of being funny was waking us up at 4 a.m. playing the bugle. He was like, “Get up! Get up!” “Where we going?” “Nowhere!”'"
"'12-07-22,'0','CASTING Bradley Cooper in the title role of “The Elephant Man” might seem, to put it mildly, counterintuitive. People magazine’s reigning Sexiest Man Alive as John Merrick, whose name has become synonymous with physical grotesqueness?Like the past stage Merricks, Mr. Cooper, who is best known from the “Hangover” films and who appeared with Julia Roberts on Broadway in a revival of Richard Greenberg’s “Three Days of Rain,” will perform the role free of any disfiguring makeup, using just his voice and body to convey Merrick’s severe deformities. (And that’s plenty, judging from an author’s note in Bernard Pomerance’s published script: “No one with any history of back trouble should attempt the part of Merrick as contorted.”)But when Mr. Cooper — who starred in a 30-minute version of the 1977 play while studying at the Actors Studio — begins performances on Wednesday in a sold-out production at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, he will become just the latest example of memorable Merricks overcoming their genetic advantages.Here are some past Merricks.PHILIP ANGLIM Like most actors who’ve played the role, Mr. Anglim knew a juicy part when he saw it. But unlike the others, he put his money where his mouth was, optioning the rights to the play himself after seeing David Schofield star in it with the British fringe theater company Foco Novo. Mr. Anglim originated the part on Broadway, and many people associate the hallmarks of the character — the twisted torso, the lurching gait, the quavering speech — with his performance onstage and in the subsequent television adaptation. But Mr. Pomerance said Mr. Schofield set the template. “Philip Anglim was unusually good,” he said, “but it goes back to Schofield’s work.”DAVID BOWIE Until Mr. Cooper came along, the choice of Ziggy Stardust as one of Mr. Anglim’s Broadway replacements was probably the most glaring example of unlikely celebrity casting for the part. Mr. Bowie, no stranger to makeup — in concert or in films like “The Hunger” and “Labyrinth” — called the role “undoubtedly the biggest single challenge of my career.”MARK HAMILL In a radical attempt to get out from the shadow of Luke Skywalker, Mr. Hamill also took over the role on Broadway for three weeks of performances. Physical deformity seemed to suit him. He has gone on to provide the voice of Batman’s archrival the Joker in TV shows, video games, toys and even amusement park rides.'"
"'12-07-22,'0','The sweetness of bell peppers — they’re never hot, unlike nearly all of their relatives — is especially pronounced in summer, which is also when you’re most likely to wind up with one that was grown domestically. Even a green pepper — which is unripe — is sweeter when the weather is hot.A good red pepper is the sweetest and most flavorful of the lot — yellow and orange are simply other varieties — but there’s no denying that a multicolored tangle of peppers is a beautiful thing, and that even the relative bitterness of green peppers adds complexity to the mix. In any case, you can use any color pepper you like in any of these recipes.Unless noted, use a pound of peppers in all of them. That’s roughly equivalent to two whole large peppers, three cups sliced or 2 1/2 cups chopped. Core and seed everything. My favorite method is just to cut around the core, standing the pepper up and slicing it like an apple from the outside.One of the most basic and wonderful preparations for bell peppers is roasting; a roasted red pepper with olive oil, capers or anchovies (or all three) remains one of the great, simple joys of this territory. Put whole peppers on a baking sheet lined with foil and roast in a 450-degree oven, or broil, turning the peppers as each side browns, until they have darkened, even blackened, and collapsed. (A hot grill is even better.) Gather the corners of the foil and wrap up the peppers; cool until you can handle them, about 15 minutes, then remove the blackened skin and seeds. (Do this under running water to make it easier; you probably won’t get all the skin off, and that’s O.K.)The recipes are thorough, but far from exhaustive. Peppers combine beautifully with eggs, with vinegar and with eggplant and probably a dozen other ingredients I didn’t have the space to get to.'"

He was 60.The circumstances of his death were in dispute. Cuban officials said the crash, near the eastern city of Bayamo, occurred when the driver lost control and hit a tree, killing Mr. Payá and another Cuban and injuring two passengers, one from Spain, the other from Sweden.But some Cuban dissidents said witnesses saw another vehicle hit Mr. Payá’s, and one of his three children, Rosa Maria Payá, 23, said in a tearful interview that she did not believe that the crash had been an accident.Though the family has struggled financially in recent years and pressure on dissidents has increased, Ms. Payá said, her father never gave up hope that the country could be changed from within.“He just wanted for Cubans to have their rights,” she said. “That’s all he ever wanted.”Mr. Payá, an engineer with strong Roman Catholic convictions, rose to prominence just over a decade ago as the main organizer of the Varela Project, a petition drive calling for a referendum to guarantee freedom of speech and assembly and other human rights.'"

"'12-07-23,'0','Besides Avenue, Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts plan to buy assets in Europe and in some cases already have done so, as have other well-known money managers like Leon Black of Apollo Global Management.Not that Mr. Lasry is expecting a quick turnaround for Europe. “It’s not a three-month bet or a six-month bet,” he said. “It’s a three- to five-year bet.”Last week, renewed worries about Spain’s ability to keep borrowing sent stocks in Europe tumbling and sparked about a 1 percent decline Friday on Wall Street, though the major United States indexes were up slightly for the week. Mr. Lasry and Richard P. Furst, a senior portfolio manager at Avenue who directs the European strategy, say they expect worries about the Continent to keep rattling the markets, creating buying opportunities for the new fund.So far, Mr. Lasry and Mr. Furst have put 25 percent to 30 percent of the fund to work, deploying an additional 5 percent or so each month.“We could invest the whole fund today but you want to average in,” said Mr. Furst. “There will be relief rallies, but when the fear comes back in, we buy.”The two money managers are using the broader fears about Europe to load up on troubled debt of companies in healthier countries in the region. The biggest chunk of the new fund’s assets have been invested in Britain, followed by France, with purchases in Sweden and other northern European nations, as well.They are avoiding Greece, the country where the euro zone crisis began, and the home of one of their more notable mistakes, a losing bet in 2010 on the debt of a Greek casino operator in an earlier European fund. That position has steadily lost value as Greece’s outlook has deteriorated. Mr. Lasry and Mr. Furst are also steering clear of troubled giants like Spain and Italy.Instead, they see opportunity as banks in Europe come under pressure from regulators to shrink their balance sheets and unload debt at deep discounts. Financial institutions also are focusing on home markets, prompting Italian and Spanish banks, for example, to sell off debt from other countries.In Britain, Avenue’s bets include the debt of Punch Taverns as well as Travelodge, a hotel operator burdened by heavy borrowing from an unsuccessful 2006 $1.2 billion buyout by Dubai’s sovereign wealth fund.“Travelodge is a good business but they’re having trouble in the current economic environment,” Mr. Lasry said. Another sizable investment is in Preem, the largest oil refiner in Sweden.In Preem’s case, Avenue bought bonds from holders based in the United States, while Punch’s debt was purchased from British insurance companies. Travelodge’s debt was acquired from banks in Britain, Italy and Ireland.In all three cases, Avenue’s traders benefited because investors were itching to get out of anything European, even though Sweden and Britain aren’t being directly buffeted by the problems in the euro zone and have their own currencies.“Bad things happen in Spain and Greece, and people want to sell bonds in a refiner that’s doing well,” added Mr. Furst. “The perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.”After founding Avenue in 1995, Mr. Lasry initially concentrated on distressed debt of American companies. He invested in Asia after the financial crisis there in the late 1990s, earning big profits when it roared back. He started an earlier European fund in 2004.The companies Avenue aims for in Europe tend to be midsize, with valuations of $250 million to $1 billion. The first European fund has five-year returns with percentages in the high teens annually, according to Avenue.The strategy requires investor patience — and an iron stomach when volatile markets produce roller-coaster returns for Avenue. In 2008, Avenue’s total portfolio dropped about 25 percent as investors fled all kinds of assets amid the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the overall market downturn.When markets recovered in 2009 and big holdings like the Ford bonds soared in value, Avenue’s returns jumped by 66 percent, followed by a 20 percent gain in 2010. Returns dropped 10 percent last year, while Avenue is up 10 percent this year, according to the fund. In all, Avenue has $13 billion under management.Over all, Mr. Lasry’s family and colleagues at the firm have more than $800 million in Avenue funds.“Marc is definitely adventurous,” said David Bonderman, a fellow billionaire who helped found the buyout firm TPG Capital. Mr. Bonderman was Mr. Lasry’s boss when they managed money in the late 1980s for Robert M. Bass, whose family originally made its money in oil before diversifying. “He’s willing to take contrarian risks and he’s willing to act promptly. Avenue doesn’t have a big bureaucracy.”“It’s still somewhat early, but if you have a feeling that Europe and the euro aren’t going to collapse, it’s appealing,” Mr. Bonderman said.“He looks at every dollar he has under management like it’s his own dollar, and that gives him a certain credibility in terms of raising money from investors and keeping them satisfied over the long term,” said Blair W. Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a boutique investment bank.Mr. Effron, who is also Mr. Lasry’s brother-in-law, adds that he is a competitive athlete, especially in basketball and tennis.Mr. Lasry, 52, was born in Morocco and came to the United States as a child. He trained as a lawyer before turning to distressed investing. About once a month, he travels to London, where Avenue has a staff of about 20 that focuses on opportunities in Europe. Over all, the firm employs 275.From 2006 to 2008, one of those employees included Chelsea Clinton, and Mr. Lasry remains close to the Clinton family as well as President Obama. One of Mr. Lasry’s five children recently worked for the White House.While other prominent Wall Streeters like Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, have backed away from the president, and others complain that the White House has used bankers as a piñata, Mr. Lasry is more like the last man standing.Last month, he held a $40,000 a plate fund-raiser for President Obama at Mr. Lasry’s Fifth Avenue home, and later this month he plans to hold another fund-raiser for the president at Nomad, a Manhattan restaurant.Unlike his fellow Masters of the Universe, you won’t find Mr. Lasry spending summers on Raiders Row or other luxurious Hamptons hangouts. He prefers lower-key Westport, Conn.“I’m a value guy,” he joked. “I can’t afford the Hamptons.”As for Europe, he seems happy to wait out the waves of fear, like last week’s anxiety about Spain.“Europe isn’t going away, and the companies aren’t going away,” Mr. Lasry said. “You can never time a bottom. What you can do is a time a cycle and five years from now, people will say, ‘Why didn’t I buy?’ ”'"

"'12-07-23,'0','A couple of weeks ago the Northeast was in the grip of a severe heat wave. As I write this, however, it’s a fairly cool day in , considering that it’s late July. Weather is like that; it fluctuates.And this banal observation may be what dooms us to climate catastrophe, in two ways. On one side, the variability of temperatures from day to day and year to year makes it easy to miss, ignore or obscure the longer-term upward trend. On the other, even a fairly modest rise in average temperatures translates into a much higher frequency of extreme events — like the devastating drought now gripping America’s heartland — that do vast damage.On the first point: Even with the best will in the world, it would be hard for most people to stay focused on the big picture in the face of short-run fluctuations. When the mercury is high and the crops are withering, everyone talks about it, and some make the connection to . But let the days grow a bit cooler and the rains fall, and inevitably people’s attention turns to other matters.Making things much worse, of course, is the role of players who don’t have the best will in the world. Climate change denial is a major industry, lavishly financed by Exxon, the Koch brothers and others with a financial stake in the continued burning of fossil fuels. And exploiting variability is one of the key tricks of that industry’s trade. Applications range from the perennial — “It’s cold outside! was wrong!” — to the constant claims that we’re experiencing global cooling, not warming, because it’s not as hot right now as it was a few years back.How should we think about the relationship between climate change and day-to-day experience? Almost a quarter of a century ago , the scientist who did more than anyone to put climate change on the agenda, suggested the analogy of loaded dice. Imagine, he and his associates suggested, representing the probabilities of a hot, average or cold summer by historical standards as a die with two faces painted red, two white and two blue. By the early 21st century, they predicted, it would be as if four of the faces were red, one white and one blue. Hot summers would become much more frequent, but there would still be cold summers now and then.And so it has proved. As documented in a new paper by Dr. Hansen and others, cold summers by historical standards still happen, but rarely, while hot summers have in fact become roughly twice as prevalent. And 9 of the 10 hottest years on record have occurred since 2000.'"
"'12-07-23,'0','“We need to get to the point where we have a job for every household,” Mr. Foster said. “Right now we have half of that. These are good jobs that would keep people who are living here working here and have a foothold into the middle class.”But there are plenty of skeptics. Environmentalists say the parade of trucks has a dangerous impact on the air in the area, contributing to an already high rate of asthma in children. Labor advocates say a vast majority of the jobs provide just minimum wage, often without benefits.In some warehouses, workers are paid based on how much work they complete, like the number of trucks they empty. In October, a state investigation found that two staffing agencies that supply workers to Wal-Mart distribution centers failed to provide workers with proper information about their wages, making it unclear how much they were earning on the job. The state fined the two staffing agencies more than $1 million.Julie A. Su, the California labor commissioner, has heard many complaints about the industry since taking office last year. But she said investigations were often stymied because so many warehouses use staffing agencies, which classify workers as temporary, even though they may work for years in the same building.There are frequent complaints that workers are told to show up each morning — often with the reminder that the first to arrive will be the most likely to get work — only to be informed that there is no work for them that day. Under state law, in those cases, workers are to be paid for two hours, but many say they rarely are.“There seems to be an unfortunate model of subcontracting used to cut costs and really depress the working conditions,” Ms. Su said. “It really reflects the economy moving to this kind of day-labor system in a way that really can destabilize the economy.”After the state investigation, Warehouse Workers United, a union-backed advocacy group, filed a lawsuit in federal court against the agencies in October, saying workers were “forced to work long hours under oppressive conditions for legally inadequate pay” that was below the state minimum wage of $8 an hour.The criticism has done little to slow the growth so far. As of now, there are more than 400 million square feet of warehouses and distribution centers spread through the Inland Empire, roughly the amount of office space in Midtown Manhattan. Dozens more large buildings are being built on speculation, with investors confident that companies will eagerly come in.For higher-skilled jobs, annual salaries do reach into the middle class, with workers bringing in an average of $46,000. In this area, where unemployment reaches above 15 percent in several cities, such jobs are sorely needed.“Construction is obviously in great trouble, and here is a place where we can just keep adding jobs — it is the only industry adding thousands of jobs,” said John Husing, a local economist who has enthusiastically endorsed the growth of the industry. “You can have people come here and find a robust blue-collar work force eager for employment.”Workers in the warehouses frequently complain that it is difficult to know who is in charge at the distribution centers, where multiple subcontractors operate in the same building and workers receive different pay depending on which agency they work with, although the jobs are almost identical.Limber Herrera, 28, has worked in the logistics industry in the area for more than five years. He now makes $12 an hour emptying shipping containers at a distribution center that processes goods for Wal-Mart. These days, his concerns are less about pay than basic safety at work.“There’s nobody who cares about our health — there’s just pressure to empty cases at a fast pace,” said Mr. Herrera, who is part of a complaint that Warehouse Workers United filed last week with the state. “All the dust we inhale, all the heavy things we have to lift with all our strength and no support, it’s very hard.”Over all, the warehouse and logistics industry accounts for roughly 10 percent of all jobs in the Inland Empire, more than any other private industry. But some economists have pointed out that earnings vary widely, with the median annual salary around $32,000. And even that figure does not take into account the thousands of workers who are employed by staffing agencies making minimum wage.Iddo Benzeevi, the chief executive of Highland Fairview, which owns the 1.8-million-square-foot distribution center leased by Skechers, said that he planned to open several more facilities and that warehouses would increasingly rely on more skilled workers to operate computers.“This is the center for all of the trade in the world,” he said. “You can get to much of the country with a drive of just a few hours.”The Skechers warehouse is filled with machines that use sophisticated technologies to make basic processes move more quickly and often with little human assistance. Skechers executives said they employed 550 to 800 people in the warehouse depending on the season, but they declined to give any information about the kinds of jobs available and the salaries employees receive.Some local critics have said the new center has done little to generate new jobs, since many of them were simply moved from six smaller warehouses the company had operated for several years in Ontario, about 20 miles to the west.“It’s attractive because it’s something that governments can take advantage of now,” said Jordan Levine, the director of economic research at Beacon Economics, a research and consulting firm. “There’s no need to have to recruit an educated work-force base or have a lot of strategy around.”He added: “All that stuff takes time and money and decades to bear fruit. This is far more expedient.”'"
"'12-07-23,'0','“It became very obvious to me when I got there the extent to which sport reflected two competing ideologies between Irish nationalists and Ulster unionists,” Bairner said. “In a society like that, sport was very politicized and could be used to bring people together but more often was used to divide people.”The Olympics today represent a confluence of commercialism, professionalism, capitalism and nationalism.In the United States, nationalism is often eclipsed by a preponderance of professional team sports. International events like the Olympics present an opportunity every four years for Americans to come out of our cocoons and connect with (and take on) the rest of the world.“You are different from most other places partly because the size of the country and the professional sports, which provide the opportunity for fantastic rivalries, but between different franchises and different cities,” Bairner said. “You see the patriotism of Americans at the Olympics and also at the Ryder Cup.”Not everyone shares an enthusiasm for opening ceremonies or the Olympic Games. George Orwell, writing in 1945, described sports at the international level as “mimic warfare.”“I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates good will between the nations, and that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football or cricket, they would have no inclination to meet on the battlefield,” Orwell wrote in “The Sporting Spirit.” “Even if one didn’t know from concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to orgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general principles.”Bairner agrees with that assessment with respect to team sports simulating combat and armies. (A classic example came at the 1992 Games in Barcelona, where the United States figuratively sent in the Marines — the Dream Team — to reclaim its lost basketball glory.)“The minute you put on team sport and wearing the colors of the national team, and they’re seen not as individuals but as these team representatives, I think things do get a bit messier and encourage the kind of rivalries that are not particularly helpful,” Bairner said. Referring to team sports, he added, “They don’t quite fit in with the Olympic spirit; they mess up the Olympic ideal.”In individual sports like wrestling and boxing, Bairner said, “there is that purity.”He added, “Ultimately you’re watching people challenging themselves, challenging others challenging their own bodies — it’s to be admired.”One frequent criticism of the Olympics is that they have become too commercialized. The opening ceremony certainly reflects a commitment by each organizing committee to outperform its predecessor with an unforgettable extravaganza.The template for commercialization, and polarization, of the Games, especially the opening ceremony, unfolded at the Berlin Games in 1936. Hitler saw the pageantry surrounding the Games — and the Games themselves — as a vehicle to promote a hateful ideology.“The Berlin Games were a major turning point where a group of politicians knew they could manipulate these Games for their own political purposes,” Bairner said.One innovation came out of the Berlin Games, and a second was revived. The practice of a torch relay from Greece to the Olympic Games began in 1936. And the idea of lighting an Olympic flame for the duration of the Games was revived by the Berlin organizing committee.But it wasn’t until 1984 and the Los Angeles Games that the profit-making potential of the Olympics was truly tapped.So in light of an evolution toward nationalism, commercialism and one-upmanship, where are the Games headed?Bairner, 60, prefers the quaintness of the 1960 Rome Games, which he watched when he was 9, and the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which he watched when he was 13.“They just seemed simpler, and there was far less hype, far less nationalism and few sports even,” he said. “It seemed the right size.”Bairner sees the Games becoming a corporate Olympics with nationalism giving way to transnational interests, largely as it has in finance and business. His theory is that because major corporations, especially sports merchandising companies, have so many deals with individual athletes, powerful corporate teams could one day replace national teams.“That’s a long way off,” Bairner said, “but that would be a situation in which the people who paid for the Olympics would actually be in position to dictate to the I.O.C. how the Games would be organized. That’s when capitalism would collide with patriotism.”He added: “We do not talk about a bank being solely American or solely British. Sports is one of the few places apart from the battlefield where the idea of national rivalry has been maintained alive. Otherwise, capitalism has managed to say more or less, ‘We’re all in this together.’ ”Ultimately, the question becomes, to be successful, how much do the Olympics need patriotism? Will fans continue to turn out in record numbers to watch a corporate Olympics? There is an inherent danger of being overly nationalistic.“On the other hand,” Bairner said, “nationalism adds to the diversity of the world and makes the world an interesting place.”Which brings me back to the opening ceremony. It represents an emotional element that a corporation cannot replace and commercialization cannot obscure.When the Olympics are held outside the United States, that moment when Team USA emerges and is announced brings out emotion than cannot be replicated at any other time or event.Cynicism softens, disappointment wanes, and for that moment, one embraces one’s country — warts and all.This is a moment and an emotion that no Team Adidas, no Team Reebok, no Team Nike can duplicate. It is a moment Bairner wishes he could experience.As part of Britain, Scotland does not have its own Olympic team. In 2014, the Scottish National Party will hold a referendum on Scottish independence.“If there was a Scottish team in the Olympic Games, I would certainly want to be there,” Bairner said. “I would feel that sense of pride, as well, as the Scottish team marched in.”If the referendum passes and there is an independent Scotland, the government will surely apply to join the Olympic movement.“Assuming a Scottish team is in the Olympics in the next 20 years or so,” Bairner said, ”I’ll probably be there with you, and my chest will be swelling with pride as well.”'"
"'12-07-23,'0','Unhindered by federal background checks or government oversight, the 24-year-old man accused of killing a dozen people inside a movie theater was able to build what the police called a 6,000-round arsenal legally and easily over the Internet, exploiting what critics call a virtual absence of any laws regulating ammunition sales.With a few keystrokes, the suspect, , ordered 3,000 rounds of handgun ammunition, 3,000 rounds for an assault rifle and 350 shells for a 12-gauge shotgun — an amount of firepower that costs roughly $3,000 at the online sites — in the four months before the shooting, according to the police. It was pretty much as easy as ordering a book from .He also bought bulletproof vests and other tactical gear, and a high-capacity “drum magazine” large enough to hold 100 rounds and capable of firing 50 or 60 rounds per minute — a purchase that would have been restricted under proposed legislation that has been stalled in Washington for more than a year.Mr. Holmes, a graduate student in neuroscience with a clean criminal record, was able to buy the ammunition without arousing the slightest notice from law enforcement, because the sellers are not required in most cases to report sales to law enforcement officials, even unusually large purchases. And neither Colorado nor federal law required him to submit to a background check or register his growing purchases, gun policy experts said.A few states like , and , and cities like and , have passed restrictions on ammunition sales, requiring permits for buyers or licenses for sellers, or insisting that dealers track their ammunition sales for law enforcement.But in Colorado, and across much of the , the markets for ammunition — online and in storefronts — are largely unregulated, gun-control advocates say.Law-enforcement officials have refused to say whether Mr. Holmes bought the ammunition from multiple sources or spaced out the purchases over several weeks to avoid drawing attention.But as investigators combed through the contents of his apartment on Sunday — its explosive booby traps now defused — new details began to emerge of his activities in the weeks leading up to the rampage. They sketch a picture of man once captivated by the science of the human mind growing increasingly interested in weapons and how to use them.On June 25, Mr. Holmes e-mailed an application to join the Lead Valley Range, prompting the owner, Glenn Rotkovich, to call back, more than once, to invite him to a mandatory orientation meeting. Nobody ever answered, but Mr. Rotkovich described the voice message as nearly incomprehensible.“It was this very guttural, very heavy bass, deep voice that was rambling incoherently,” Mr. Rotkovich said. “It was bizarre on a good day, freakish on others.”In early July, Mr. Holmes ordered a Blackhawk Urban Assault Vest, a knife and two magazine holders from a Web site called Tactical Gear, according to an order slip provided by the company’s chief executive, Chad Weinman. He chose expedited two-day delivery to his apartment in the eastern Denver suburb of Aurora, where the shootings took place early Friday, just a few miles from Mr. Holmes’s apartment.“I think it conveys a sense of urgency and shows premeditation,” Mr. Weinman said in an interview, adding that the company was “deeply saddened” its gear had apparently been used in a mass killing.Three weeks after that purchase, stunned and bleeding witnesses outside the Century 16 multiplex in Aurora would describe how a man dressed in a black commando-style outfit and a gas mask strode into the theater where they were watching a midnight screening of “The Dark Knight Rises,” tossed some gas-spewing grenades into the packed auditorium and opened fire.A law enforcement official who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue said that local investigators in Aurora believed the gunman’s semiautomatic rifle jammed as he was spraying the theater with bullets, forcing him to switch to a slower weapon. Had the gun not jammed, the official said, many more could have died.The police apprehended Mr. Holmes outside the theater minutes after the shooting, still wearing the body armor. He had four guns with him. A law enforcement official said he also had tablets of Vicodin, a painkiller, in his possession.Chief Daniel Oates of the Aurora police praised the arresting officers on the program “Face the Nation” for noticing that Mr. Holmes’ gear was not quite like that of the other S.W.A.T. officers or he might well have escaped, mistaken for one of the responders.Gun-control groups said the purchases of the ammunition demonstrated how easily anyone could build a veritable arsenal without attracting attention from state or federal law-enforcement officials. Gun groups replied that stricter controls would not make the nation safer, but would only restrict constitutional rights.Only a handful of states and cities have passed any laws requiring that gun dealers keep track of who is buying ammunition.“It’s a wide-open marketplace,” said Tom Mauser, a gun-control advocate in Colorado whose son was killed in the 1999 Columbine shootings. “The Internet has really changed things. You don’t have to show your face. It’s anything goes.”Some top law-enforcement officers were among those calling for more restrictions on ammunition sales.“I have an issue with people being able to buy ammunition and weapons on the Internet,” Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey of the police said on the ABC program “This Week” on Sunday. “I don’t know why people need to have assault weapons. There needs to be reasonable gun control put in place.“And we talk about this constantly, and absolutely nothing happens, because many of our legislators, unfortunately, at the federal level, lack the courage to do anything.”The ammunition and arms Web sites are prolific online. They work like any small hubs of e-commerce, only with warnings to patrons that, under federal laws, they must have clean criminal records and must consult local laws before making their purchases. Buyers can pick up cases of bullets, clips, speed loaders, targets and a wealth of other gear associated with shooting, hunting or target practice.A 1999 bill in Congress aimed at regulating Internet sales of ammunition was never adopted. Democrats in the House and Senate have introduced measures to restrict the sales of large-capacity magazines, but neither measure has gained any traction with the House controlled by Republicans, who tend to be strong supporters of gun rights, and election-year politics shunting politically volatile issues like gun control to the side.“It is a war tool,” Representative , Democrat of New York, said of the 100-round drum that the police say Mr. Holmes purchased online. “They’re meant to kill. They’re meant to kill as many people in as short a period of time.” Ms. McCarthy’s husband was among six people killed in 1993 by a gunman on a commuter train.But after the Colorado shooting, Democrats and Republicans cast doubt on whether tougher laws could have averted the killing, diminishing the political stomach for any immediate changes in gun laws. Gov. of Colorado, a Democrat, told CNN’s that the killer might have built a bomb or found some other lethal device if no assault weapons had been around. And Senator , Republican of , defended people’s rights to own large-quantity ammunition magazines.“The fact of the matter is, there are magazines, 30-round magazines, that are just common all over the place, and you simply can’t keep these weapons out of the hands of sick, demented individuals that want to do harm,” Mr. Johnson said on “Fox News Sunday.” “And when you try and do it, you restrict our freedoms.”To gun groups, such an unfettered marketplace stands as a bulwark of their Second Amendment rights.Dudley Brown, executive director of Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, said there was no need to track sales of ammunition or require ammunition dealers to follow the same strictures as gun dealerships. He said law-abiding sportsmen and target shooters often bought ammunition in bulk to save money, and may keep rounds on their shelves for years. He said they can easily blow through 400 or 500 rounds in one vigorous day at a shooting range.“I call 6,000 rounds of ammunition running low,” he said.'"
"'12-07-23,'0','The Justice Department is now expected to file criminal charges this year against at least one big bank in connection with the rate-rigging scandal, while building cases against other banks and their employees. This is welcome news: prosecuting financial crimes is essential to restoring public trust in the banking system and in the willingness of the authorities to police it.Meanwhile, the furor over how banks fiddled with the , or Libor, for their own advantage is now in the buck-passing phase, as bankers and regulators alike attempt to minimize their role.It is a disturbing and disheartening spectacle. On CNBC last week, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner defended his actions in 2008, when he headed the — a time when the New York Fed knew was reporting false rates but did not stop or expose the misconduct. Mr. Geithner told CNBC he briefed other American regulators and British authorities on his concerns that the Libor process was “flawed and vulnerable to misrepresentation.” But to hear him tell it, the issue was a plumbing problem, not a potentially criminal and certainly improper pattern of rate rigging.The British authorities to whom Mr. Geithner directed his concerns — Mervyn King and Paul Tucker, the governor and deputy governor, respectively, of the — have testified that the New York Fed’s warnings did not set off any alarms because they contained no allegations of wrongdoing and seemed to echo many concerns raised about technical difficulties in setting the rate. But documents released on Friday by the Bank of England suggest that the central bank knew about potential manipulation in 2007.Further investigation will have to settle the who-knew-what-when controversy. For now, the trans-Atlantic back and forth is yet another example of the deplorable state of during the run-up to the financial crisis. It also shows how hard it is to get to the bottom of a controversy when the officials in positions of power now — like Messrs. Geithner, King and Tucker — are the same people who were running things when the misconduct occurred. Going forward, Mr. Geithner should recuse himself from any investigations into the rate rigging, including any inquiries that may be conducted by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a panel of regulators created under the Dodd-Frank law and led by the Treasury secretary himself.And when the time comes to choose a new Treasury secretary — Mr. Geithner has said he does not expect to remain if is re-elected — the next president would do well to look for candidates among the regulators who have distinguished themselves by their willingness to confront the banking system’s manifest problems. One such person is , the chairman of the , which pursued the rate-rigging allegations against Barclays, securing a record fine and referring the matter to the Justice Department for criminal investigation.Equally important, the Libor scandal cannot be reduced to a technocratic issue over how to best set interest rates. Central bankers and other financial officials need to find a replacement for Libor, which is deeply flawed.'"
"'12-07-23,'0','The showdown, which has no end in sight, is being closely watched by corporations and unions across the country because it involves two often uncompromising antagonists — Caterpillar and the International Association of Machinists — that have figured in many high-stakes labor battles.“Caterpillar has been a leader in the past 20 years in taking a hard line,” said Richard Hurd, a professor of industrial relations at Cornell. Last winter, Caterpillar locked out about 450 workers at its locomotive plant in London, Ontario, and then closed the factory after the union rejected its demand to cut wages by 55 percent. In the mid-1990s, the company vanquished the United Automobile Workers after a 17-month strike by 9,000 workers at eight factories; the union surrendered and accepted the company’s concession-filled offer.The machinists have carried out largely successful strikes at Boeing and Lockheed Martin, ultimately winning better raises and benefits for thousands of members.Robert Bruno, a labor relations professor at the University of Illinois, said Caterpillar was trying to drive compensation down to a new floor. “Caterpillar sees this as ‘the new normal,’ while this union local feels you have to draw a line in the sand to hold on,” he said. “Some people are saying the union should be more deferential, more compliant, that it’s a bad time to strike. How can you counter a powerful multinational in this economy?”The current showdown is playing out on a flat stretch along Channahon Road here, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, where 15 strikers stand at the plant entrance during each four-hour picketing shift, with signs saying, “Fighting for Our Children’s Future” and “I Am Solidarity.” The strikers often shout “scab” as replacement workers drive into the factory.Ever since negotiations began in March, Caterpillar has insisted on a wage freeze for its top-tier workers, those employed seven years or more; they average $26 an hour, or $55,000 a year before overtime. For the junior third of the workers who typically earn $12 to $19 an hour, Caterpillar has made no promises but has suggested it might raise their wages based on local market conditions.Caterpillar has offered workers several modest, one-time payments, but is also demanding far higher health care contributions from its workers, up to $1,900 a year more, according to the union. The company had profit of $39,000 per employee last year.Carlos Revilla, the plant’s operations manager, defended the push for a pay freeze, saying the top-tier workers were paid 34 percent above market level.“A competitive and fair wage package is a must,” he said in a statement. “Paying wages well above market levels makes Joliet uncompetitive.”But the union says Caterpillar, the world’s largest producer of earth-moving equipment, is in no way uncompetitive and should be sharing its prosperity with its workers.“A company that earned a record $4.9 billion in 2011 and $1.586 billion in the first quarter of this year should be willing to help the workers who made those profits for them,” said Timothy O’Brien, president of Machinists Local Lodge 851, which represents the strikers. “Caterpillar believes in helping the very rich, but what they’re doing would help eliminate the middle class.”He said the company wants a pay and pension freeze for longtime workers to push them into retirement and replace them with $13-an-hour workers.Michael LeRoy, another labor relations professor at the University of Illinois, said Caterpillar has served as a model in legitimizing tough labor strategies, like take-it-or-leave-it contract offers.Detroit’s automakers, for example, followed Caterpillar’s lead in adopting a two-tier wage system, lengthy contracts and a special health care trust fund for retirees, although “it took a bankruptcy to do it,” said Sean McAlinden, chief economist at the Center for Automotive Research.Rusty Dunn, a Caterpillar spokesman, said the philosophy of paying market-based wages would help Caterpillar “keep competitive when times are bad.”“We think the overall approach will preserve job growth in Illinois and the U.S.,” he said. Caterpillar has added about 6,500 jobs in the United States over the past year.The strikers here exude an unusual defiance and pride, boasting that the hydraulic parts they produce require some of the most exacting specifications in heavy manufacturing.“We make an excellent product here, a product that Caterpillar uses in all its vehicles,” said Mr. Williams, a machinery repairman. “That gives us a leverage that the other plants don’t have.”Yet he admits to feeling financial pain. He receives $150 a week in strike benefits, and he said he did not have the $40 needed for his 11-year-old son to play Little League.The Joliet strikers hope Caterpillar will soon sweeten its offer after concluding that it needs the strikers back to produce vital components.Caterpillar says that is unlikely.“We believe we have exhausted the negotiating process,” Mr. Dunn said. “The primary strategy, going forward, is to run the plant with the contingent work force as long as the work stoppage continues.”He added that Caterpillar’s offer was “competitive, reasonable and fair.”Rose Bain, a striker, grows impatient with such arguments. Earning $15 an hour after two years, she said she could not afford a six-year freeze and did not trust Caterpillar to follow through with the hinted raise for lower-paid workers.“We’re the people who busted our butts to help them make record profits,” she said. “We shouldn’t be treated like this.”'"

"'12-07-23,'0','National Journal said it would ban the use of quotations that had been massaged or manipulated by its sources, joining a growing chorus of news organizations that are objecting to a practice that has become increasingly common in political journalism.In a memorandum to the staff, Ron Fournier, National Journal’s editor in chief, said, “If a public official wants to use NJ as a platform for his/her point of view, the price of admission is a quote that is on-record, unedited and unadulterated.”Quote approval has become accepted in Washington and on the campaign trail, with politicians and candidates often refusing to grant interviews unless they have final say over how their quotations appear in print. The New York Times examined the issue in an article last week, drawing attention to a part of news gathering that journalists had long complained about but felt pressured into accepting.Both the Obama and Romney campaigns routinely demand that reporters consent to quote approval when giving interviews. If the reporters agree, quotations from campaign officials, advisers and candidates’ family members have to be sent to a press aide for the final go-ahead. Quotes sent back to reporters are often edited for style and clarity.If reporters refuse, they are not granted an interview. National Journal is among several news outlets that have said they find quote approval to be troubling, especially now that it has become standard for many politicians.The Times has said that it encourages its reporters to push back against sources who demand quote approval and that it is reviewing how its policies might address the issue. The Washington Examiner said last week that it, too, would not accept interviews granted under the condition of quote approval.Politico’s editor in chief, John Harris, said he advised reporters to resist such conditions for interviews and expressed dismay that political figures were becoming more comfortable avoiding on-the-record interviews.'"
"'12-07-23,'0','Over its 34-year history, the Stockton Arts Commission upheld its mandate to promote the arts to improve the lives of Stockton’s citizens. When the recession began, we lost the public arts administrator, then the commission’s executive director. We took hits like every other city department. And now the “golden goose” arts endowment has been sacrificed. It’s not clear what the commission will be able to do in the wake of the bankruptcy.But the arts aren’t dead in Stockton.The city may not make payroll this month, but local musicians held an impromptu concert and raised $22,000 for the local humane society. Homicides continue in record-breaking numbers, yet residents gather at Victory Park for free summer concerts. Stockton needs a $156 million loan to repair its sewage-treatment center, but the financially stable Stockton Symphony is poised to celebrate its 86th season.Stockton is a gritty, gang-infested, agricultural, artistic anomaly. This is the area that produced the acclaimed novelist Maxine Hong Kingston, the artist Rupert Garcia, the astronaut Jose Hernandez and so many others.I don’t mean to ignore the woes of the city’s retirees, who have already taken cuts in pensions and are about to lose their medical benefits, or be a Pollyanna about our decimated fire and police departments. These cuts affect me, my family and my neighbors. But I cannot lose faith in the arts and education either. Although in tough times they are the first to be cut, they are also what draw people to Stockton; they are the very qualities of life showcased in the city’s promotional brochures featuring colleges, arts groups and cultural events. While police and fire departments protect, arts and education promote and propel. They are not lesser obligations.Every semester, young people — who come from broken homes, are foster children, are homeless, have substance abuse problems or worse — enter my classroom and inspire me. One student, the ex-meth addict, slept on his dealer’s couch, stole cars to buy drugs, lost his family and nearly his life. He pleaded with his probation officer to get him into treatment after slipping back into drugs even after he got out of jail. Treatment enabled him to gain access to college. In college, he found writing, and wrote himself a new chapter.There’s plenty of blame to go around in Stockton. City managers and leaders have been investigated for their poor decisions. Residents can also blame themselves for buying into the hype, buying into the bubble, ignoring the warning signs and being politically apathetic.The bottom line is that we have a chance to make more right in Stockton by remembering — and acknowledging with our votes in the upcoming election — how significant arts and education are to the future of our city. We must refuse to sacrifice more young people like my student to the coming cuts. He earned an “A” in the course and is transferring to a four-year college this fall. I can only hope my thief can find a way to that path.'"
"'12-07-23,'0','Besides Avenue, Blackstone and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts plan to buy assets in Europe and in some cases already have done so, as have other well-known money managers like Leon Black of Apollo Global Management.Not that Mr. Lasry is expecting a quick turnaround for Europe. “It’s not a three-month bet or a six-month bet,” he said. “It’s a three- to five-year bet.”Last week, renewed worries about Spain’s ability to keep borrowing sent stocks in Europe tumbling and sparked about a 1 percent decline Friday on Wall Street, though the major United States indexes were up slightly for the week. Mr. Lasry and Richard P. Furst, a senior portfolio manager at Avenue who directs the European strategy, say they expect worries about the Continent to keep rattling the markets, creating buying opportunities for the new fund.So far, Mr. Lasry and Mr. Furst have put 25 percent to 30 percent of the fund to work, deploying an additional 5 percent or so each month.“We could invest the whole fund today but you want to average in,” said Mr. Furst. “There will be relief rallies, but when the fear comes back in, we buy.”The two money managers are using the broader fears about Europe to load up on troubled debt of companies in healthier countries in the region. The biggest chunk of the new fund’s assets have been invested in Britain, followed by France, with purchases in Sweden and other northern European nations, as well.They are avoiding Greece, the country where the euro zone crisis began, and the home of one of their more notable mistakes, a losing bet in 2010 on the debt of a Greek casino operator in an earlier European fund. That position has steadily lost value as Greece’s outlook has deteriorated. Mr. Lasry and Mr. Furst are also steering clear of troubled giants like Spain and Italy.Instead, they see opportunity as banks in Europe come under pressure from regulators to shrink their balance sheets and unload debt at deep discounts. Financial institutions also are focusing on home markets, prompting Italian and Spanish banks, for example, to sell off debt from other countries.In Britain, Avenue’s bets include the debt of Punch Taverns as well as Travelodge, a hotel operator burdened by heavy borrowing from an unsuccessful 2006 $1.2 billion buyout by Dubai’s sovereign wealth fund.“Travelodge is a good business but they’re having trouble in the current economic environment,” Mr. Lasry said. Another sizable investment is in Preem, the largest oil refiner in Sweden.In Preem’s case, Avenue bought bonds from holders based in the United States, while Punch’s debt was purchased from British insurance companies. Travelodge’s debt was acquired from banks in Britain, Italy and Ireland.In all three cases, Avenue’s traders benefited because investors were itching to get out of anything European, even though Sweden and Britain aren’t being directly buffeted by the problems in the euro zone and have their own currencies.“Bad things happen in Spain and Greece, and people want to sell bonds in a refiner that’s doing well,” added Mr. Furst. “The perceived risk is greater than the actual risk.”After founding Avenue in 1995, Mr. Lasry initially concentrated on distressed debt of American companies. He invested in Asia after the financial crisis there in the late 1990s, earning big profits when it roared back. He started an earlier European fund in 2004.The companies Avenue aims for in Europe tend to be midsize, with valuations of $250 million to $1 billion. The first European fund has five-year returns with percentages in the high teens annually, according to Avenue.The strategy requires investor patience — and an iron stomach when volatile markets produce roller-coaster returns for Avenue. In 2008, Avenue’s total portfolio dropped about 25 percent as investors fled all kinds of assets amid the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the overall market downturn.When markets recovered in 2009 and big holdings like the Ford bonds soared in value, Avenue’s returns jumped by 66 percent, followed by a 20 percent gain in 2010. Returns dropped 10 percent last year, while Avenue is up 10 percent this year, according to the fund. In all, Avenue has $13 billion under management.Over all, Mr. Lasry’s family and colleagues at the firm have more than $800 million in Avenue funds.“Marc is definitely adventurous,” said David Bonderman, a fellow billionaire who helped found the buyout firm TPG Capital. Mr. Bonderman was Mr. Lasry’s boss when they managed money in the late 1980s for Robert M. Bass, whose family originally made its money in oil before diversifying. “He’s willing to take contrarian risks and he’s willing to act promptly. Avenue doesn’t have a big bureaucracy.”“It’s still somewhat early, but if you have a feeling that Europe and the euro aren’t going to collapse, it’s appealing,” Mr. Bonderman said.“He looks at every dollar he has under management like it’s his own dollar, and that gives him a certain credibility in terms of raising money from investors and keeping them satisfied over the long term,” said Blair W. Effron, a co-founder of Centerview Partners, a boutique investment bank.Mr. Effron, who is also Mr. Lasry’s brother-in-law, adds that he is a competitive athlete, especially in basketball and tennis.Mr. Lasry, 52, was born in Morocco and came to the United States as a child. He trained as a lawyer before turning to distressed investing. About once a month, he travels to London, where Avenue has a staff of about 20 that focuses on opportunities in Europe. Over all, the firm employs 275.From 2006 to 2008, one of those employees included Chelsea Clinton, and Mr. Lasry remains close to the Clinton family as well as President Obama. One of Mr. Lasry’s five children recently worked for the White House.While other prominent Wall Streeters like Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, have backed away from the president, and others complain that the White House has used bankers as a piñata, Mr. Lasry is more like the last man standing.Last month, he held a $40,000 a plate fund-raiser for President Obama at Mr. Lasry’s Fifth Avenue home, and later this month he plans to hold another fund-raiser for the president at Nomad, a Manhattan restaurant.Unlike his fellow Masters of the Universe, you won’t find Mr. Lasry spending summers on Raiders Row or other luxurious Hamptons hangouts. He prefers lower-key Westport, Conn.“I’m a value guy,” he joked. “I can’t afford the Hamptons.”As for Europe, he seems happy to wait out the waves of fear, like last week’s anxiety about Spain.“Europe isn’t going away, and the companies aren’t going away,” Mr. Lasry said. “You can never time a bottom. What you can do is a time a cycle and five years from now, people will say, ‘Why didn’t I buy?’ ”'"
"'12-07-23,'0','Forrest S. McCartney, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who played a central role in developing military spy satellites and the MX intercontinental missile system before being appointed head of NASA’s civilian-run Kennedy Space Center not long after the space shuttle Challenger exploded, died Tuesday in a hospice near Cape Canaveral, Fla. He was 81.The cause was cancer, his daughter Worthy McCartney said.General McCartney was given command of the space center 18 months after the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members aboard and leading to the suspension of the shuttle orbiter program. His deployment from the ranks of a largely secret military space program made him the focus of initial apprehension in the parallel civilian space-exploration universe.But historians of NASA generally credit him with rebuilding public confidence in manned space missions, and helping restore the morale of a shaken work force at Cape Canaveral. He directed an extensive review of construction and launching protocols, oversaw the first shuttle launching after the Challenger disaster, and became known as a subtle but relentless defender of Kennedy Space Center turf in the perennial struggle with other NASA power centers, including the Johnson Space Center in Houston, the Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., and NASA headquarters in Washington.Confusion over the chain of command had been identified by investigators as one of the causes of the 1986 disaster. In a 2001 interview with the Kennedy Space Center’s oral history project, General McCartney referred to that problem in describing his efforts to make the Kennedy Space Center’s leaders first among equals in decision making, at least in the matter of launchings.“I just felt strongly that if the wheels came off we would certainly be accountable, and properly so,” he said. That was one of “the things that I tried to turn around: not to be the dominant person, but that we were equal at the table. And whether we roll — that was our decision to make. And that was a constant fight, you know. But I think we wore them down.”'"
"'12-07-23,'0','In an indication of how critical it is for Facebook to get its advertising products right, the company called on Gokul Rajaram, an engineer who once ran Google’s lucrative AdSense engine, to take charge of its own advertising products division. Facebook hired Mr. Rajaram in 2010, when it acquired his start-up, Chai Labs, which had built artificial-intelligence-based algorithms to analyze online data.Part of the challenge is that advertisements, as Mr. Rajaram once put it, should not feel like advertisements. “You would much rather hear a message from your friend than hear a message from a brand,” he said at a conference sponsored by TechCrunch last year.Today, he leads a team of engineers who are rolling out a variety of advertising tricks, including tools that can do what Google does so profitably: reach consumers across the Web.Facebook declined repeated requests for an interview with Mr. Rajaram, and offered no details of its new advertising efforts.Among the most promising of those efforts, from a marketer’s point of view, is Facebook Exchange, which is intended to track the behavior of Facebook users when they are visiting other sites and serve up tailored advertisements when they return to Facebook.Orbitz, the travel company, is among the advertisers that are trying Facebook Exchange. If it sees a consumer looking for, say, a business hotel in New York, Orbitz can place an advertisement for New York hotels on that user’s Facebook page, with the hope that the user will return to the travel site and make the booking. Chris Stevens, senior director of retail for Orbitz, said it was too early to determine the impact on sales.“If it does work, it’s going to be great,” said Karsten Weide, an International Data Corporation analyst who has been skeptical of Facebook’s advertising prospects. “They have to prove advertising on Facebook works.”Another prominent experiment is Facebook’s effort to let marketers reach its users outside of its garden walls. In June, it began showing targeted banner advertisements to Facebook users on the gaming site Zynga. Facebook has declined to say whether or how it plans to expand this tool, which comes closest to rivaling Google’s power to advertise across the Web.“It’s sort of the first step in trying to expand outside of Facebook,” said David Eastman, worldwide digital director at the advertising agency JWT. “This is simply part of Facebook’s strategy to monetize themselves, and is likely the beginning of a series of products coming out in the next six months to a year designed to grow advertising revenue.”Reaching mobile users will have to be an essential part of Facebook’s advertising strategy. Nearly half of Facebook users log in on their tablets or phones, and the company has acknowledged that its most pressing challenge is to figure out how to profit from them. It recently started allowing marketers to buy advertisements only on mobile platforms, which is where many companies, like retailers, are chasing potential customers.“They’re going to have to crack the mobile piece,” Mr. Eastman said.While advertising accounts for more than 85 percent of its revenue, Facebook is also looking for other ways to make money. In June, it announced that it would make it easier for users to buy online goods and services, including monthly subscriptions to video and music streaming services like Spotify, on the Facebook platform. It discontinued its virtual currency, Facebook Credits, which was mainly used to play games, and said it would accept credit card payments in local currencies worldwide. Analysts applauded it as a step toward pleasing Wall Street.As a byproduct of its meteoric rise, Facebook is facing an inevitable hurdle: in the United States, where it makes most of its advertising revenue, it is not drawing new users. The latest numbers from comScore, a market research firm, showed that in May, 158.01 million unique visitors logged on to the network, down slightly from 158.69 million in April. Advertisers, and by extension shareholders, will look closely at whether Facebook can keep those users glued to the site for longer stretches of time.Facebook is still growing in several countries, like Brazil and India, but it makes little to no money in those places.Manuel A. Henriquez, chief executive of the venture capital firm Hercules and an investor in Facebook, called Thursday’s earnings report a test for the company’s chief executive and founder, Mark Zuckerberg, and his management team. “They have the data,” Mr. Henriquez said. “If they can show effectively their ability to monetize domestic subscribers at an increasing rate, they’ll have a lot of legitimacy.”That task falls squarely on the shoulders of Mr. Rajaram’s engineering team, which is charged with writing the algorithms that will show the right advertisements to the right people. Its members often refer to themselves as the Math Men, in contrast to the Mad Men who once ruled the industry, and it helps that Mr. Rajaram, who has degrees in computer science and business, is the son of a high school math teacher.But his challenge is much more than writing the right code. He must also apply Facebook data to marketing in a way that does not alienate users or invite scrutiny in court.Indeed, Facebook hit a legal roadblock in May, when it reached a tentative settlement in a class-action lawsuit over the use of sponsored stories, one of its most effective advertising tools. In the would-be settlement, the company promised to inform users explicitly that their “likes” could be used as endorsements for a brand or page, and that they could opt out. By one estimate, it could cost Facebook $103 million in revenue.'"
"'12-07-23,'0','Eastman Kodak has lost its patent case against Apple and Research in Motion over digital image-preview technology in a ruling that could hurt the company’s efforts to get a high price for its patents.Kodak said it would appeal.The United States International Trade Commission said late last week that it had upheld a judge’s findings that neither Apple nor RIM violated Kodak’s rights in the patent. The commission said it agreed with the judge that the patent claim was invalid. Its reasons will be released once both sides have a chance to redact confidential information.Kodak has been seeking to force Apple and RIM to pay licensing fees and bolster the value of patents Kodak intends to sell. Kodak said in a court filing that Apple owed more than $1 billion in royalties. The dispute has dragged on for about 30 months, almost twice as long as a typical trade commission case.The patent’s validity “has been upheld in previous litigation at the I.T.C., and was affirmed by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office,” Chris Veronda, a spokesman for Kodak, said in a statement. “We are confident that its validity will ultimately be upheld.”Kristin Huguet, a spokeswoman for Apple, said the company had no comment.The patent in the case is in one of two portfolios Kodak is selling, which may be its most valuable assets. One group includes patents for digital-capture technology and the other covers imaging systems and services.'"
"'12-07-23,'0','But on a blustery day when Royal Lytham & St. Annes finally began to play like a brute, Els managed to feed off his frustration and commit to playing more aggressively and hitting more drives off the tees.“When you’ve been around as long as I have, you’ve seen a lot of things happen,” Els said. “And I just felt that the golf course is such, if you just doubt it a little bit, it was going to bite you. There’s too many bunkers, too much trouble, and there was a bit of a breeze. So I felt I was going to hit the shots, and I felt, I still felt I had a chance.”He birdied the 10th, the 12th, the 14th and, most important, the 18th and said he made many putts while thinking of his 9-year-old son Ben, who is autistic and was watching on television.“He loves when I hit golf balls,” Els said. “He’s always there. He comes with me. He loves the flight of the ball and the sound. I knew he was watching today, and I was trying to keep him — because he gets really excited — I wanted to keep him excited today.”Scott, meanwhile, was losing his grip in a final-round collapse that will rank among the most complete at any major.“I had it in my hands with four to go and, you know, managed to hit a poor shot on each of the four closing holes, which costs you on a course like this,” Scott said. “I’m very disappointed.”Disappointment was a common theme Sunday. Tiger Woods, five shots off the lead when the day began, could surely smell an opportunity when Scott started the day with a bogey, a birdie and then another bogey. But he made a triple bogey on the par-4 sixth hole after requiring two shots to get out of a deep greenside bunker that forced him to his knees for the second shot. It was Woods’s first triple bogey in a major championship since the 2003 British Open, and he never recovered. He finished in a tie for third with his fellow American Brandt Snedeker with a 277.Graeme McDowell of Northern Ireland, who played in the final pairing with Scott, also made frequent visits to the sand and other undesirable locations. Three shots behind Scott after eight holes, he faded badly and ended up with a 75 and a share of fifth place at two under with Luke Donald, the Englishman who is ranked No. 1 in the world.It is an apt reflection of golf’s current instability at the top that Donald still has not won a major championship. Els’s victory maintained a remarkable streak: he is the 16th different man in a row to win a major. And what will also stir debate is that he is the third man in the last four major championships to win with a longer-shafted putter.Els switched to a belly putter last season despite years of criticizing their use as contrary to the spirit of the game. “As long as it’s legal, I’ll keep cheating like the rest of them,” he said last year.Scott’s switch to a long putter last season has been critical to his renaissance, too, but it did not keep him from faltering at Lytham. He bogeyed 15 after hitting into a greenside bunker. He then missed a 3-foot par putt at 16. Before long, Els was generating a roar by making a 20-foot putt for birdie on 18, and Scott was misjudging his 6-iron approach shot on the par-4 17th, knocking it into thick rough to the front left of the green.Looking back on it, it all comes down to the shot into 17,” Scott said. “That’s the one that I look at and am most disappointed about.”He made a third straight bogey, then hit a 3-wood off the 18th tee instead of a long iron or driver. It ended up bouncing into a fairway bunker. He then blasted onto the fairway and hit his approach shot 8 feet from the hole. The line on his par putt looked quite straight, but there are subtle undulations on Lytham’s greens.As it missed, Scott said, “Wow,” and slowly sank into a crouch, his head twisting away from the hole. But it surely will not be quite that easy for Scott to block out what happened on the final four holes.“Well, look, it may not have sunk in yet, so I don’t know,” Scott said. “Hopefully, I can let it go really quick and get on what I plan to do next week and get ready for my next tournament. We’ll see. I don’t know. I’ve never really been in this position, so I’ll have to wait and see how I feel when I wake up tomorrow.”Els, subdued in victory at first, was soon in a more festive mood: drinking toasts out of the claret jug at his Lytham hotel before heading to a car with the jug still in hand for the trip back to London to celebrate with his wife, Liezl, and their two children.“I’ve been there before; I’ve blown majors before and golf tournaments before,” Els said of Scott. “I just hope he doesn’t take it as hard as I did.”'"
"'12-07-23,'0','AURORA, Colo. — President Obama came to this city on Sunday to meet with survivors of the shooting rampage at a movie theater last week, visiting the victims and their families and leading the country in mourning the 12 people killed in the attack.“Even in the darkest of days, life continues and people are strong,” Mr. Obama said. He described sharing hugs, tears and laughs as he heard stories about loved ones lost and acts of heroism.“I come to them not so much as president as I do as a father and as a husband,” he said.Across the city, residents gathered at makeshift memorials to grieve as a community while condolences poured in from near and far, from Hollywood to the Vatican. As the families of victims struggled with their loss, new details emerged about the shooting suspect, James E. Holmes, and what happened when a gunman fired into a crowded theater during a midnight premiere of “The Dark Knight Rises” on Friday.The carnage could have been worse, but one of Mr. Holmes’s weapons, a high-powered semiautomatic rifle, jammed during the shooting, a law enforcement official, who requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the issue, said Sunday.Police Chief Dan Oates of Aurora said that while they were making progress in the case, the investigation would take time.“We’re focusing on how he got the materials that he got that were used in the shooting, that were used in the apartment,” he said in an interview on CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “We’re focusing on anyone who knew him and statements he may have made. We’re building a case to show that this was a deliberative process by a very intelligent man who wanted to do this.”The police believe that Mr. Holmes began planning his rampage for months, when he began acquiring the materials that he would use in both the shooting and to rig his apartment.There were also clues as to how Mr. Holmes might have paid for the weapons and other materials he acquired. He was receiving a $26,000 stipend, in monthly installments of $2,166, for a National Institutes of Health neuroscience training grant for the graduate program he was enrolled in at the University of Colorado-Denver Anschutz Medical Campus, a spokeswoman said. Mr. Holmes withdrew from the program last month without explanation, the university said.Mr. Holmes was being held in solitary confinement at an Aurora jail, awaiting his arraignment Monday morning.Mr. Obama never mentioned Mr. Holmes by name during his remarks, instead referring to “the perpetrator of this evil act.”“In the end, after he has felt the full force of our justice system, what will be remembered are the good people who were impacted by this tragedy,” Mr. Obama said.The president focused his remarks on the “remarkable” stories he was told.“Most of the conversation was filled with memory,” Mr. Obama said. “It was an opportunity for families to describe how wonderful their brother or their son or daughter was, and the lives that they had touched and the dreams that they had held for the future.”He told the story of one girl he met, Allie Young, 19, who was shot in the neck. She survived, Mr. Obama said, because her 21-year-old friend, Stephanie, lay by her side and stanched her bleeding even as shots continued to ring out.“Allie told Stephanie she needed to run. Stephanie refused to go,” the president said. “Because of Stephanie’s timely actions, I just had a conversation with Allie downstairs and she is going to be fine.”The president spoke at the University of Colorado Medical Center, where 23 of the victims from the shooting were treated. By the time he arrived on Sunday, one was dead, 12 had been released, leaving 10 patients: 7 still in critical condition and 3 in good condition, a hospital spokesman said.The president, along with his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, suspended all campaigning for the weekend. Mr. Romney, speaking at a fund-raiser in San Fransisco Sunday night, praised Mr. Obama’s decision to travel to Aurora.Condolences poured into the small Colorado city from across the country and around the world. Pope Benedict XVI added his condolences during his Sunday morning blessing.“I was deeply shocked by the senseless violence,” he said.In Aurora, hundreds of people gathered throughout the day around a growing memorial across the street from the theater. A collection of teddy bears, flowers, posters, candles and notes steadily grew as friends, families and strangers gathered, seeking solace in community.In the evening, thousands of people, including families of the victims, members of the military and elected officials, attended a prayer vigil held at the Aurora Municipal CenterSeveral young people wearing Batman T-shirts lined up and held a sign that read, “Like the Dark Knight we will rise again.”“His story was that we’re all capable of rising above tragedy and being great heroes, and that’s the message we’re trying to portray,” said Kronda Seibert, 26, who was wearing one of the T-shirts.On top of a small hill overlooking the memorial by the theater, Greg Zanis erected 12 white crosses in honor of each of the dead.It was a familiar task for Mr. Zanis. After the Columbine High School shooting more than a decade ago, he delivered 15 crosses to Littleton, Colo., for those who had died. Mr. Zanis, who builds electric cars for a living, has made it a weekend hobby to build and deliver crosses to people around the country who have experienced tragedy. He said he had received calls asking him to bring crosses to Aurora, so he constructed them Saturday morning and then made the 16-hour drive from his home in Aurora, Ill.Lori Furman, 53, laid a bouquet of gladiolus on the memorial Sunday morning when she visited with her husband, Ray. Both wore black ribbons that they got at church earlier in the morning.“It’s been a hard summer,” Ms. Furman said. “We had friends, acquaintances who lost their homes in the fire. Now this.”Standing next to the memorial, Jeannie Donelson removed her sunglasses and dried her eyes with a scrunched tissue. This tragedy was close to home. One of the boys who died was a friend of her niece and nephew. The 6-year-old victim was related to a friend of her niece’s.“I guess just to be able to say goodbye,” Ms. Donelson, 49, said of why she visited the memorial. “Bring some closure.”Moses Kalemba and his wife, Theopista, arrived from New Hampshire hours after the shooting for a wedding on Sunday. “I wouldn’t say we felt obligated,” Mr. Kalemba said of their visit to the memorial. “We just felt it was the right thing to do. I think this kind of tragedy is one of those things that really gets to you.”Residents who had been displaced by the threat of explosives in Mr. Holmes’s apartment were looking to return to their normal routines.Lugging his work uniform and a shopping bag with leftover chicken and cheesecake, Jimmy Davis said the end was in sight, literally, as he strode toward his small apartment building early Sunday after spending two nights in a nearby motel.“I feel like a hurricane victim or something,” he said. “But now I am going home, turning on the air-conditioner and chilling out.”Dmitri Shchekochikhin, 27, an international fellow and researcher from Moscow who is studying heart and kidney disease at the same university Mr. Holmes had attended, was not so fortunate. He lived in Mr. Holmes’s building and on Sunday was allowed only to recover some essentials: two cellphones, a computer, a thumb drive, a pair of shoes and a bag of clothes.Unshaven and seeming agitated, Mr. Shchekochikhin, who has been staying with friends, said he took only his passport, wallet and plane tickets with him after the police instructed him to evacuate in the early hours of Friday.“I had finished a big project and then drank a bottle of dry, red wine and fell asleep,” he said. Several hours later, the police banged on his door.'"

"'12-07-24,'0','Rosneft already claims the largest proven oil reserves of a listed company, though other, nonpublic state companies such as Saudi Aramco have far more.The company’s production of 2.4 million barrels per day now surpasses BP’s output of 2.3 million, including its portion from TNK-BP, and Exxon Mobil’s level of 2.2 million. If Rosneft acquires BP’s stake in TNK-BP, its daily output would rise to 3.3 million barrels per day — more than the country of Iraq and well ahead of other public companies.“Rosneft believes that an acquisition of BP’s interest in TNK-BP would be in the best interest of both Rosneft’s and BP’s shareholders and would lead to further development of TNK-BP,” Rosneft said in a statement. Rosneft said it approached BP only after BP had announced interest from another potential buyer in June.For its part, BP said it “welcomed today’s announcement by Rosneft of its interest in commencing negotiations.”BP is also negotiating a possible sale to its Russian partners, a group of Soviet-born billionaires that include Len Blavatnik, who lives in New York, and two Russian-based partners. But BP will be hard pressed to turn down the state company’s bid, in no small part because of the presence of Mr. Sechin, who was deputy prime minister until May.Mr. Sechin declined to be interviewed. But his recent actions seem to signal a desire on the part of the Kremlin to work with Western companies to more fully develop Russia’s oil and gas resources while also ensuring that the government retains control over the assets.For BP, the Russian joint venture has provided a gusher of cash, generating $19 billion over nearly a decade. But BP and its Russian partners have clashed repeatedly over whether and how to expand. And last year, the Russian partners, including the oligarch Mikhail Fridman, successfully blocked a separate deal that BP had struck with Rosneft to explore Russia’s Arctic waters.That maneuver embarrassed Mr. Putin, who had publicly championed the BP-Rosneft alliance.BP, oil analysts say, wants to sell its TNK-BP stake in part as a means to divorce from its partners and make a new alliance with Mr. Sechin, who is said to be an opponent of Mr. Fridman.Any sale of BP’s stake in TNK-BP is at least three months away, the period that BP must, under its shareholder agreement, negotiate on the buyout offer from its current partners. Further muddying any possible deal are allegations of fraud from a former TNK-BP employee against the company’s management, which emerged Tuesday in a London court.The former director of logistics accused one of the Russian shareholders, German Khan, who is also a manager, of funneling hundreds of millions of dollars in bribes to Russian officials in the guise of subcontracts. TNK-BP lawyers denied the allegation as wholly unsubstantiated, Bloomberg News reported.Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank, suggested in a research report last week that the oil sector would be partly nationalized in Mr. Putin’s third term, with state control rising to more than 50 percent from 33 percent today.The appointment of Mr. Sechin, a longtime aide to Mr. Putin, to the chief executive position at Rosneft telegraphed the government’s intentions, the report suggested.Thane Gustafson, senior director of research for Eurasia energy at IHS, said that an acquisition of TNK-BP could help Rosneft gain valuable expertise in techniques to extract oil from shale fields, which have driven a boom in American oil and gas production but have been barely tapped in Russia.Mr. Sechin, with one foot in the world of intelligence services and the other in business, is positioned like no other official in Russia to orchestrate a major overhaul of the oil industry — with Rosneft, as has so often been the case, the principal beneficiary. Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, in an interview in 2005, blamed Mr. Sechin for his arrest and the dismantlement of his company, Yukos, and its absorption into Rosneft.“There is no question that Sechin has proven himself loyal and competent,” Mr. Gustafson said.Kremlinologists say Mr. Sechin leads a faction of former military and security service veterans known as the “siloviki,” or men of power, who are skeptical of close partnership with the United States. He has, though, negotiated deals with Western companies, including Exxon Mobil, to explore for oil in the Russian sector of the Arctic Ocean.Mr. Putin hired Mr. Sechin as an aide in his office in the St. Petersburg city administration in 1993, when Mr. Putin was a deputy mayor. The two former spies have worked together since, through a succession of jobs including at the F.S.B., the successor agency to the K.G.B., where Mr. Putin was director in the late 1990s.Over the years, Mr. Sechin has handled both delicate and personal matters for his boss. When Mr. Putin’s wife, Lyudmila, was in a car accident in 1994 and had to be taken to the hospital, she told a journalist later, she called Mr. Sechin to take care of the Putins’ daughter Katya because Mr. Putin was busy with work.Mr. Sechin is a contentious figure for foreign investors, though he is said to be far more gregarious and easygoing in private than at public functions.William F. Browder, the chief executive of Hermitage Capital and formerly the largest portfolio investor in the Russian stock market, was expelled from Russia in 2005 after advocating for greater transparency at state-controlled energy companies such as Gazprom and Surgutneftegaz.Mr. Browder blamed Mr. Sechin for arranging this expulsion by designating him a national security threat, ineligible for a visa.The purchase of the BP stake in TNK-BP would catapult Mr. Sechin, who served in the Angolan civil war in the Soviet military intelligence service, or the G.R.U., into the ranks of the most important figures in the world of oil, with a thumb on the scale of prices.Generally, Western oil companies have been eager to strike deals with him despite the unpredictable nature of dealings with the Russian government. One senior Western oil company executive, who requested anonymity to preserve business relationships with the Russians, recalled a meeting where Mr. Sechin said flatly that foreigners investing in Russian oil shouldn’t expect a game of cricket.“You have to remember, this is Russia,” he recalled Mr. Sechin telling him. “There are different rules.”'"

"'12-07-24,'0','With its hereditary links to the M-16, the signature weapon of the Vietnam War and, until recent years, the principal rifle used by American infantry units, weapons like the AR-15 were tightly restricted under a 1994 law known as the assault weapons ban. The law expired in 2004.But weapons experts said that in a closed, crowded setting like a movie theater, any of the weapons could have been extremely deadly, even in the hands of an inexperienced or inaccurate gunman.If anything, the experts said, a shotgun in that situation might have been the most lethal, since every shell can spray a half-dozen or more pellets, each capable of killing or maiming a person. Twelve-gauge shotguns often fire five shells, and sometimes more, before needing to be reloaded.“Shotguns are a very good antipersonnel weapon at close range,” said John C. Cerar, the former commander of the firearms and tactics section for the New York Police Department.“With that kind of crowd, he didn’t have to be Annie Oakley,” Mr. Cerar said. “He could have closed his eyes and killed a lot of people.”Mr. Holmes purchased all of his weapons legally, law enforcement officials said. In the four months before the shootings, he also bought 3,000 rounds of handgun ammunition, 3,000 rounds for a semiautomatic rifle and 350 shells for a 12-guage shotgun, all over the Internet.The original AR-15 was produced by ArmaLite, which sold the design to Colt Manufacturing. Colt marketed a fully automatic version to the military as the M-16, and civilian semiautomatic versions under the trademark AR-15. In recent years, the Pentagon has been replacing the M-16 with smaller M-4 carbines.Semiautomatic rifles fire just one round with each squeeze of the trigger, while automatic weapons can fire continuously until the trigger is released. Fully automatic weapons are not widely available on the civilian market in the United States.Smith & Wesson is one of many firearms manufacturers to produce a version of the AR-15, marketing more than a dozen models that range in price from about $700 to $2,000.The weapon is popular among collectors, military veterans and target shooters who say it is easy to handle and can be modified in numerous ways. Some soldiers call it “a Barbie doll for men” because it has a wide range of accessories and replacement parts, including different styles of barrels, stocks, magazines and scopes.The M&P15 also comes in a variety of models that fire different sizes of ammunition, from .22-caliber to .30-caliber rounds. The rifle used in Aurora fired .223-caliber ammunition, law enforcement officials said.Those rounds — similar to the ammunition used in American M-16 and M-4 rifles — are smaller than the rounds fired by Afghan insurgents wielding Kalashnikov rifles, but pack far more power than .22-caliber rounds, even though they are only a hair’s-width larger in circumference.Law enforcement officials said the 12-gauge shotgun used by Mr. Holmes was a Remington 870. The gun, which can be purchased for around $400, requires the user to pump a handle underneath the barrel to chamber new cartridges after each shot.The handgun was a Glock .40-caliber semiautomatic pistol, the officials said. The weapon is similar to the 9-millimeter handgun made famous in gangster films and rap music. The 9-millimeter has also been adopted by many police forces that had used .38-caliber revolvers and felt that they were being outgunned by criminals.The .40-caliber Glock, versions of which sell for about $400, has become increasingly popular partly because its larger round makes it potentially more deadly than a 9-millimeter, Mr. Cerar and other experts said. Yet it has less recoil and is thus easier to handle than a .45-caliber handgun.The pistols typically come with magazines capable of holding 13 to 17 cartridges.Pistols are less accurate than rifles at longer distances and are widely considered harder to use because they cannot be braced against the shoulder. But in close quarters, they are plenty lethal.'"
"'12-07-24,'0','Bachmann’s concept of Christian love brims with hate, and she has a deep satchel of stones to throw. From what kind of messiah did she learn that?Over recent days she has drawn attention for the letter that she and four other Republican lawmakers sent to federal intelligence and security agencies last month. It expressed fears that the Muslim Brotherhood might be infiltrating the government, and it mentioned Abedin. She’s Muslim, after all.My aim here isn’t to re-litigate Bachmann’s crimes against reason and decency, all widely documented.It’s to wonder why we accept her descriptions of herself, and in turn describe her, as a deeply religious woman. That grants too much credence to her particular, peculiar and highly selective definition of piety. And it offends the many admirable people of faith whose understanding and practice of religion aren’t, like hers, confrontational and small-minded.Bachmann is an evangelical, and has spoken rhapsodically about the experience of being born again. After that moment, she said, “I absolutely understood sin, and I wanted no part of it.” She plunged into politics nonetheless.We routinely place her in the “religious right,” a phrase that frustrates me, tidily linking a certain set of political beliefs with profound devotion. We talk much less frequently of any “religious left,” and that disparity implies that a seriously faithful person is most likely to land on just one end of the political spectrum.Tell that to the Nuns on the Bus, who rolled across the country last month focusing on social welfare and expressing alarm about the impact that cuts in federal spending might have on struggling Americans. Their politics line up more neatly with liberal than conservative policies, but the nuns reflect a Catholicism no less true or widespread than that of the bishops carrying on about gay marriage and .Speaking of gay marriage, both the Reform and Conservative branches of Judaism in this country have embraced it, and the Episcopal Church in the has developed a special blessing for same-sex couples. Leaders of these denominations would tell you not that they’re flouting Judeo-Christian tradition but that they’re doing full justice to their faiths, which hinge on more than reflexive fidelity to chosen passages from ancient writings. They hinge on the human intellect and its ability to filter timeless values through modern understanding.Because he’s a social liberal, , the Newark mayor, is seldom mentioned in terms of religion, but it turns out that he’s made a study of the Bible, as well as other sacred texts, and given considerable thought to faith. On his Facebook page a few months ago, he mused thusly:“Before you speak to me about your religion, first show it to me in how you treat other people. Before you tell me how much you love your God, show me in how much you love all His children.”I know many progressive, big-hearted Christians who rise to that challenge, and it’s wrong for a single Christian label — without asterisk or annotation — to be attached both to them and to the likes of Bachmann.So maybe it’s time for annotations. Most of us distinguish, rightly, between Muslim extremists and other followers of Islam. Perhaps we should start noting the difference between Christians of real compassion and those of exclusionary spite.Bachmann’s on to something: dangerous fundamentalists have indeed set up camp deep inside the capital. She can find one in her office. She need only look in the mirror.'"
"'12-07-24,'0','The suspect in Aurora, Colo., had no criminal record. A background check would not have prevented him from obtaining guns. Whatever his mental state was, he was determined to shoot people and would have devised a strategy regardless of the type of gun. Thus, limiting rounds, styles of guns and so forth is not enough.We need to work toward the repeal of the Second Amendment, period. Americans sick and tired of the tyranny of guns must stop looking to the failed gun control lobby for answers. We must create a culture of nonviolence and disarmament, which includes enticing noble men and women to serve in law enforcement: brave souls who would promise to carry only nonlethal defense instruments.Political slogs are worth it — but only when they unabashedly confront the evil at hand, like racism and sexism. The evil we face is guns, designed not for hunting or sportsmanship but to take human life. The gun control lobby has always blinked in the face of that evil. Slogging alongside it is a waste of precious time, and a gift to gun worshipers.In light of the tragic mass killing in Aurora, I think it’s time for the people of the United States to seriously consider repealing the Second Amendment and replacing it with the following:“Individual United States citizens have the right to bear arms for the purposes of self-defense, hunting or recreation. Persons who have been convicted of a felony or who are known to be mentally ill may not possess firearms or other weapons. The United States government and its agencies are responsible for regulating the sale and distribution of firearms and other weapons in all states and territories; the United States government and its agencies may also regulate and limit the types of firearms and other weapons that individuals may possess.”One more question about Friday’s tragedy. Where was the Department of Homeland Security?In an airport an 82-year-old woman boarding a flight is patted down and asked to remove her shoes, and her purse-size sewing case with two-inch scissors is impounded on grounds that she might use it to threaten the pilot.In Colorado, a 24-year-old man orders 6,000 rounds of ammunition, four guns and explosives, and no one asks any questions.The motives of the suspect, James E. Holmes, are not known and probably aren’t political, but they might have been. So where was the Department of Homeland Security? Did it know about these purchases, and if not, why not? And if so, why weren’t questions raised? Possibly he didn’t fit the profile of a terrorist like the elderly woman?Re “Don’t Jump to Conclusions About the Killer” (Sunday Review, July 22):Dave Cullen says the “loner” tag might be applied too quickly to James Holmes, the man accused of the Colorado movie theater shooting. Mass killers are more likely to be depressed than social loners, he says.The association of violence with so-called loners risks denigrating the very idea of personal independence by stigmatizing nonconforming lifestyles.Depicting killers as loners detached from society can even become a form of scapegoating, whereby the social mainstream projects onto the loner shortcomings of its own.The writer is an associate professor of sociology at College of the Holy Cross.'"
"'12-07-24,'0','“The president said if you pass the stimulus, unemployment would never go above 8 percent,” said Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 House Republican. “We’ve had a 41-month experience that that is not true and hasn’t been effective. One thing Republicans have always said is that they want a form of accountability.”Under the Democratic plan, tax rates on earnings over $250,000 would snap back to 36 percent and 39.6 percent, the rates paid during the Clinton presidency, from 33 percent and 35 percent. It would also allow the estate tax rate to jump to 55 percent on the value of inheritances over $1 million per individual, $2 million per couple. The current rate is 35 percent on estates over $5 million, $10 million a couple.The Senate Democratic plan for the estate tax actually takes a bigger piece of qualifying estates than the proposal by President Obama, who wanted a 45 percent rate on inheritances of about $3.5 million, or $7 million per couple. It could cause as many political headaches for some moderate Democrats as the income tax expirations.Between the income tax expirations, the estate tax provision and a business investment provision that Democrats would limit to small businesses, the Democratic plan would raise almost $82 billion more in taxes in 2013 than the Republican version. But the Democrats’ claim to fiscal prudence may be undermined by their decision to maintain the stimulus law’s tax breaks, which would cut those savings down to $55 billion.Republican tax aides say the vast majority of the benefits Democrats are seeking to preserve are not tax cuts but checks written by the Internal Revenue Service and sent to the working poor. Given the huge increase in government aid, like food stamps and unemployment benefits, letting some assistance lapse makes sense, they say.N. Gregory Mankiw, a former Bush White House economic aide and an adviser to Mitt Romney, said that a typical family in the lowest 20 percent of the income scale now receives $3 in government benefits for every $1 earned. Even the middle 20 percent receives slightly more in government largess than it pays in taxes, he said.[Mr. Mankiw subsequently noted on his blog that  the data he used, from the Congressional Budget Office, includes state and  local benefits as well as federal benefits, but reflects only federal taxes.  He said correcting this inconsistency might change his conclusions, but that   the CBO does not provide the data to know for sure.]“What happened to the failed stimulus being ‘targeted, timely and temporary?’ ” asked Antonia Ferrier, a spokeswoman for Senate Finance Committee Republicans. “With our economy as weak as it is, stopping the president’s massive tax increase on nearly a million small businesses and then overhauling our burdensome tax code is how we’ll get America moving again. The same can’t be said for keeping the expanded stimulus spending through the tax code.”At issue are four measures from the stimulus law. One reduced the eligibility threshold to $3,000 in earned income for the child tax credit. Without it, the threshold will jump to $13,300 next year, costing nearly nine million families about $7.6 billion, an average of $854 a family, according to the liberal group Citizens for Tax Justice. But the hit could be considerably larger. Currently, a family with one full-time minimum wage earner and two children receives a total child tax credit of $1,812, almost equal to the full $2,000 credit middle-income families with two children receive, said David Harris, president of the Children’s Research and Education Institute. If the stimulus provision lapses, that family’s credit would drop to $267, a $1,545 loss.The stimulus also enlarged the earned income credit for families with three or more children, reduced the “marriage penalty” on working poor couples by starting the earned income credit phaseout at a higher level for married earners, and expanded the middle-class tax deduction for higher-education tuition. The 2009 American Opportunity Tax Credit expanded the tax break for tuition, fees and educational expenses to $2,500 from about $1,800, and doubled the length of eligibility to four years of school from two. It also made the first $1,000 of the tuition credit refundable, meaning that a family without enough federal income tax liability could get a check from the I.R.S. to offset higher education costs.In all, the Republican plan would extend tax cuts for 2.7 million affluent families while allowing tax breaks to expire for 13 million on the bottom of the income spectrum, tax analysts say. An impact analysis released Monday by Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation said a permanent extension of all the Bush-era tax cuts would cut taxes on households with more than $1 million of annual income by $74,505 next year. The Democratic proposal would cut taxes for those same households by $7,055.'"
"'12-07-24,'0','Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Investors, said that the “first domino” fell in Asia, amid concerns about the fiscal and monetary policy in China and whether that country was done with interest rate cuts. In the United States, earnings were not encouraging and gross domestic product was forecast to be lower than the previous number, Mr. Orlando added.“There were no pockets of good news,” he said.On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 101.11 points, or 0.8 percent, to close at 12,721.46, after trading down nearly 240 points early. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 12.14 points or 0.9 percent, to 1,350.52, while the Nasdaq composite index lost 35.15 points, or 1.2 percent to close at 2,890.15.In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50 index declined 2.6 percent. The Spanish IBEX lost 1.1 percent, the DAX in Germany fell 3.2 percent and the CAC 40 in France declined by 2.9 percent.Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading, said it was hard, amid trading dominated by computers, to pinpoint what had made Wall Street trim its losses. “The sellers came out early,” he said.But even if the indexes had closed higher, Mr. Saluzzi said, “I would not say it is a victory for the bulls. There is certainly a lot of bad news out there.”In the bond market, the increased demand for the United States securities sent the price of the 10-year Treasury note up 6/32, to 102 27/32, while its yield fell to 1.44 percent, from 1.46 percent late Friday. Earlier on Monday, the 10-year note hit a record low of 1.40 percent. Other maturities, including the 30-year bond, also touched record lows.Bruce McCain, the chief investment strategist of Key Private Bank, said that the markets were sending a “flight to quality” message, and with “Europe again melting down,” the focus was on safety and preservation.“In general, most of our conversations with clients are focused on preserving principal,” he said.As money shifted into Treasury securities, investors sold off euros for dollars. The euro fell to $1.2134 on Monday, from $1.2156 late Friday.“With the severe fundamental problems in the European markets and slowing in U.S., China and the rest of the world, this is not the time to take heroic risks,” Mr. McCain said. “We have seen a waning of the optimism in the market.”He noted that corporate earnings in the United States had generally been beating expectations but that forecasts had been revised lower. “There is not a whole lot to stem the tide,” he said.Citing the “rising uncertainty regarding the outcome of the euro area debt crisis,” Moody’s cut the outlook late Monday for the triple-A credit of Germany, Luxembourg and the Netherlands to negative from stable.Earlier, Italy said its short-selling ban would be imposed for a week on all types of stocks, while Spain said its ban would last three months. The Spanish regulating agency said that “the situation of extreme volatility across the European markets could interfere with their smooth functioning and the normal course of their activities.”In short-selling, investors sell borrowed shares at one price and hope to repay them with shares they subsequently buy at a lower price. The tactic has been blamed for accelerating market plunges in past crises — as when American regulators in the September 2008 financial crisis temporarily banned short sales of financial stocks.Last August, Spain was one of four euro countries — with Italy, France and Belgium — that temporarily banned short sales of financial stocks. Spain’s ban lasted until February, and when it was lifted bank shares initially fell. But prices stabilized as Spanish banks were at least temporarily buoyed by a program of cheap three-year loans that the European Central Bank provided at the time.'"
"'12-07-24,'0','Asked whether Syria was finally acknowledging that it had chemical weapons, Mr. Makdissi repeated roughly the same response, but began it by saying that any stock of unconventional weapons or chemical weapons “if they exist” would not be used domestically, but would be used against foreign intervention.But the attempt at verbal sleight of hand did little to conceal what appeared to be Syria’s intent, experts and Western diplomats said.“Look, any talk about any use of any kind of a weapon like that in this situation is horrific and chilling,” said Victoria Nuland, a State Department spokeswoman. “The Syrian regime has a responsibility to the world, has a responsibility first and foremost to its own citizens to protect and safeguard those weapons. And that kind of loose talk just speaks to the kind of regime that we’re talking about.”For outside experts, any remarks about chemical weapons meant that Syria calculated the value of reminding anyone weighing any direct military intervention just what it could hit them with.“The thing about W.M.D. is that they are useless unless the other side knows you have them,” said Joseph Holliday, an Iraq war veteran who tracks the opposition Free Syrian Army for the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. “So despite the fact that the regime has not been open about its weapons program, it has to make it clear to neighbors that it has the capability, so it has to be relatively public.”Analysts dismissed the idea that any part of what Mr. Makdissi said, including the second statement, was anything less than calculated. The statements, coupled with recent information that Syria has been moving its chemical weapons around the country, were part of the calculation, said Randa Slim, an adjunct research fellow and Syria expert at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute based in Washington.Syria is simultaneously trying to break its international isolation and to make the United States, Turkey and Israel, among others, rethink any offensive action they might be contemplating against it, she said. “The chemical weapons remain one of the Syrian regime’s strongest few trump cards, and they are threatening to use it in order to improve their rapidly weakening negotiating position.”In ruling out their domestic use, Mr. Makdissi said Syria was facing “gang warfare” in its main cities where the weapons could not be used. Fierce street fighting continued in Syria’s largest city, Aleppo, for a fifth day on Monday, while government troops maintained a mopping-up operation in and around Damascus.Over the past four decades, Syria has amassed huge supplies of mustard gas, sarin nerve agent and cyanide, according to unclassified reports by the Central Intelligence Agency.In a report to Congress covering last year, the C.I.A., referring to chemical weapons, said, “Syria has had a C.W. program for many years and has a stockpile of C.W. agents, which can be delivered by aerial bombs, ballistic missiles, and artillery rockets. We assess that Syria remains dependent on foreign sources for key elements of its C.W. program, including precursor chemicals.”In a similar report for 2006, the C.I.A. said Syria’s arsenal included “the nerve agent sarin, which can be delivered by aircraft or ballistic missile.” The report also said that Syria “is developing the more toxic and persistent nerve agent VX.”Syria has long left deliberately ambiguous what exactly it possesses in terms of chemical weapons, with government leaders only rarely discussing them. A United Nations diplomat said that in a meeting this month with Kofi Annan, the special envoy for Syria and former United Nations secretary general, President Bashar al-Assad had also said that any chemical weapons were stored in a safe place.Mr. Assad also told Mr. Annan that they would not be used except in the case of foreign invasion, the diplomat said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the diplomatic delicacy of the topic. The Syrian leader had said that the weapons had not been mixed yet, so that anyone who captured them would have to know how to combine them. The weapons are considered “binary,” meaning that they do not become lethal until they are mixed.Israel employs a similar ambiguity about its nuclear arsenal — usually stating it will not be the first to deploy nuclear weapons in the Middle East — which is believed to have inspired the Syrian stance. Syria and Israel are also among only eight countries in the world who have not agreed to the convention to eliminate chemical weapons that went into effect in 1997. (Israel has signed it but not ratified it.)Leonard S. Spector, deputy director of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute in California, said the Syrian spokesman’s comments were paradoxically both menacing and reassuring.“It’s a mixed message,” Mr. Spector said in a telephone interview. “One side of the message is fist-shaking, a warning of retaliation if there’s an invasion. The other side seems to be an attempt to be responsible.”'"

"'12-07-25,'1','LONDON — The Internet is heralded as a convenience for shoppers, and often it is. But sometimes, the same technology turns into a noose or a nuisance.That is what Andrew Kendall learned when he tried to buy tickets to see fencing and badminton at the 2012 Olympics. He had no choice but to shop online. But because he splits his time between here and Sydney, Australia, he did not want to have the tickets sent to either of his homes.That left him no choice but to pick them up at two different places. He traveled to the Olympic site to get the tickets he bought in Britain and made his way across the city to Paddington, where he claimed another set of his tickets that his mother in Australia had bought.When he arrived at the will-call center run by CoSport, a New Jersey-based company that distributes Olympic tickets for the United States, Australia, Canada, Norway and Sweden, he found a line about 100 deep outside.After an hour, he emerged from a lobby at the City of Westminster College where about 10 CoSport employees at tables were checking identification and handing out envelopes with tickets, transit passes and cover letters. In all, he consumed most of a day to do something he said should have taken a few minutes.'"
"'12-07-25,'1','With his wife, Katherine, and two young sons, he lives downtown himself and evangelizes about it to any visitor. Last fall he started what will be an annual conference in Roanoke, CityWorks (X)po, billed as exploring “big ideas for small cities.”“People think this is too good to be true,” said Chris Morrill, the city manager. “You have this developer who knows the finances, knows the law, knows how to do these historic renovations and is really committed to the community. It’s real.”Mr. Morrill added: “When folks from other communities come in here and I show them some of the stuff that’s Ed’s doing, they’re like, ‘How can we clone this guy and bring him back to our community?’ ”Mr. Walker’s conference is intended to share his blueprint for urban redevelopment, a field known as placemaking; he will study it at Harvard’s Graduate School of Design this year, with a prestigious Loeb fellowship. But many towns already have their own version of Ed Walker, said Bruce Katz, a vice president at the Brookings Institution and founding director of the Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program, which focuses on cities. “This is happening across the country,” Mr. Katz said.“What you’re seeing is a group of vanguard developers and vanguard businesspeople who basically spot a trend and then double down or triple down with their own resources” to buy property cheap, collaborating with like-minded leaders “on the placemaking agenda,” he said.Examples abound: Mr. Katz pointed to changes in Buffalo and Detroit and plans by Tony Hsieh, the Zappos tycoon, to remake Las Vegas. “It has been one or two people in particular cities taking the risk,” he said.“There’s a profit motive for sure, but these are people committed to place,” Mr. Katz added. “This is no longer an idea or an aspiration. It’s an out-and-out trend.”In Roanoke, it started in 2002, when Mr. Walker began redeveloping Kirk Avenue. His first major residential renovation opened downtown in 2006, with million-dollar condominiums.Old-guard Roanokers were quickly convinced that downtown was livable when Mr. Walker sold one of the first to Warner Dalhouse, a retired bank chairman, and his wife, Barbara, who use it as a Southern pied-à-terre. At 4,800 square feet, it is larger than their lake house nearby. “We wanted it to look like a New York loft, and it does,” Mr. Dalhouse said.Mr. Walker’s company converted an old cotton mill and a department store into apartments, some at the low end of market rates and some at the top. The next units will be in a former ice house on the Roanoke River, where the city’s first waterfront restaurant will open.Last year, after a $20 million renovation, the company reopened the Patrick Henry, once one of Roanoke’s grandest hotels; its disrepair had taken a toll on civic pride. Now it once again has an elegant lobby, complete with a bar. Some of its 132 apartments are leased by a nearby nursing school for its students.The building also houses the Music Place, an FM radio station that Mr. Walker bought last year just before it was forced to change formats. With its mix of indie, country and folk — and thrice-weekly interviews with community leaders — it fit with his notion to give Roanoke the feel of, as he grinningly puts it, a funky college town.The radio station is just breaking even. The conference lost money, but Mr. Walker will hold it again — it “succeeded on a human level,” he said. Otherwise, he is adamant that his projects must serve the bottom line.He is keen to talk financing — Virginia has generous tax credits for historic renovation, so he helped get a landmark designation for the Wasena neighborhood, where his river project is — in hopes that it will teach others to follow in his footsteps as social entrepreneurs. “Roanoke is a really good small-city laboratory,” he said.Mayor David Bowers praised Mr. Walker but said the city still had economic, educational and tourism challenges. “We’re not the destination that we should be,” he said.Even downtown, all is not rosy. Studio Roanoke, a nonprofit black box theater, closed this month because of a lack of money. (“It’s not even bare bones,” Melora Kordos, its artistic director, told The Roanoke Times. “We’re just a couple of femurs.”) And there are other signs of struggle, especially in areas that ring the city center, like southeast Roanoke.Jason Garnett, a former projectionist and theater manager who programs Shadowbox, the movie night at Kirk Avenue Music Hall, makes ends meet with a job as an audio-visual coordinator at a local college.“I can’t afford to live downtown,” said Mr. Garnett, a 36-year-old father of two. Still, he and his friends are committed to staying, starting even more community-run art spaces. “We’re trying to make Roanoke cool,” he said.There are indications that it is working. Since 2009, 25 restaurants have opened across 10 blocks downtown, many serving farm-to-table fare, bolstered by a long-running farmer’s market. A glossy monthly devoted to the art scene, Via Noke Magazine, began publishing in June. There is an adult kickball league. It adds up to the kind of do-it-yourself creative change that Mr. Walker, a sometime skateboarder whose ethos is more Joe Strummer than Jane Jacobs, advocates.For Mr. Morrill, the city manager, the developments have already had an impact on the town’s psyche. “Roanoke has this inferiority complex,” he said. “People would say, ‘We could’ve been Charlotte if we’d had a bigger airport, or Greensboro or Asheville.’ And Ed helped them realize, Roanoke is a pretty good place.”He added: “People aren’t talking about what we’re not anymore. Now they’re talking about what we are. And that’s a huge shift.”'"
"'12-07-25,'1','Yet Mr. Barofsky goes on to say that he did not really think that Mr. Allison was threatening him; in fact, Mr. Allison “was, in a very Washington way, sincerely trying to be helpful.” This introductory episode not only sets the book’s tone, but it also embodies the contradictions and inconsistencies throughout Mr. Barofsky’s account.He writes early on that “I had no idea that the U.S. government had been captured by the banks,” and at another point describes his strategy to use the press to get the attention of Congress, and by extension an obstreperous Treasury: “Our message was simple: Treasury’s desperate attempt to bail out Wall Street was setting the country up for potentially catastrophic losses.” Yet despite such repeated condemnations of the decision-making process in both the Bush and Obama administrations, Mr. Barofsky never really concedes that the predicted losses did not occur.He refers throughout to the $700 billion bailout, never clarifying that less than $300 billion of that amount went out the door by the time TARP expired; that not a penny went to big banks during the Obama administration; and that those banks repaid taxpayers with interest.As ugly and flawed as the rescue process was, and as galling as Wall Street’s revived bravado and bonuses can be to most Americans, the fact remains that an economic collapse was averted, and that Main Street is recovering: slowly, but typically so for recessions brought on by credit crises. As Europe’s crisis persists for a fourth year, commentators around the globe have suggested that the Continent should have followed America’s example.To the extent that Mr. Barofsky acknowledges that neither big losses nor big fraud cases occurred, he credits the anti-fraud measures he pressed Treasury to include in programs and contracts. Yet his book is a chronicle of complaints that Treasury undercut, blindsided and ignored him. Perhaps the biggest criticism of Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner suggested by Mr. Barofsky’s account is that Mr. Geithner should have been a lot more conciliatory toward this zealous inspector general, if only to avoid becoming the biggest villain in Mr. Barofsky’s morality tale.Mr. Geithner does not fully enter the story until its midpoint. The headline grabber is a recounting of an October 2009 meeting at which Mr. Geithner erupts when Mr. Barofsky tells him that TARP’s unpopularity and the public’s perception of Treasury as subservient to big banks is because of Mr. Geithner’s lack of transparency about the department’s dealings.“ ‘Neil, I have been the most [expletive] transparent secretary of the Treasury in this country’s entire [expletive] history!’ he boomed, moving forward in his chair. ‘No one has ever made the banks disclose the type of [expletive] that I made them disclose after the stress tests. No one!’ ”Mr. Barofsky’s book adds little of substance to the mini-library on the worst financial crisis since the Depression, which includes “In Fed We Trust,” by David Wessel of The Wall Street Journal; “Too Big to Fail,” by Andrew Ross Sorkin of The New York Times; and another insider account, “On the Brink,” by Henry M. Paulson Jr., Treasury secretary in the Bush administration.Mr. Barofsky the ex-prosecutor talks of fighting fraud and “Wall Street criminals” and styles his office as a law enforcement agency, complete with guns and badges. Yet the reader should not expect Eliot Ness. Within a week of starting work in December 2008, Mr. Barofsky has fights that are mainly of the bureaucratic type as old as Washington. He grouses for page after page about being left out of the loop as arcane policies are developed, consigned to a basement office that literally stinks. What scofflaws he takes credit for helping to nab are far from Wall Street: an Alabama-based bank, a Tennessee man with a $10 million Ponzi scheme, a San Diego mortgage telemarketer.Mr. Barofsky, now a senior fellow at New York University School of Law, does a good job of describing the complex financial products at the core of the crisis. And he does open windows into how Washington works, though not always those he intended.For instance, like so many actors in the capital, Mr. Barofsky develops backdoor relationships with the offices of friendly Republican lawmakers like Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Representative Darrell Issa of California, leaking information back and forth to shape news coverage. Then he wonders why Treasury keeps him in the dark?Mr. Barofsky justifiably spends time on Treasury’s failure to get banks to stem home foreclosures. But he charges that Treasury helped give birth to the Tea Party “by rolling out a hurried and poorly thought-out mortgage modification program,” when what actually spawned that movement was conservatives’ opposition to the very idea of bailing out troubled homeowners, which Mr. Barofsky so favors.That his book is being released now, amid the presidential campaign, reflects perhaps the biggest contradiction of all: If Treasury has been making policies exclusively “by Wall Street for Wall Street,” as Mr. Barofsky says, why then has a once friendly Wall Street turned so hostile to President Obama’s re-election?'"
"'12-07-25,'1','In a conference call with analysts, Apple executives blamed economic weakness in Europe, Australia, Brazil and other countries for some of the shortfall in iPhone sales. But the company also said that the widespread chatter about whatever smartphone it will sell next was a significant factor.“We’re reading the same rumors and speculation you are about a new iPhone,” said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer.In the past, Apple has felt the pain of delayed iPhone purchases most acutely in the summer quarter that ends in late September, but it can also start before then. “We’re seeing it earlier than ever,” said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, who predicted Apple would sell 29 million iPhones, rather than the 26 million it ended up reporting.It is possible Apple is losing some business to other smartphones, most likely devices running Google’s Android operating system, which have built a substantial following. But Apple is still expected to gain market share this year. Apple’s share among smartphone users in the United States is expected to reach 31 percent in 2012, up from 30 percent last year, according to eMarketer, a firm that compiles data from technology research firms.Rob Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners, said the iPhone was increasingly evolving into a business that has two quarters of gigantic sales, followed by two weaker ones, in which customers wait patiently for a new model. But Mr. Cihra said it would be far more worrisome if customers did not show so much enthusiasm about Apple’s next move.“That’s the price of having an incredibly popular consumer product,” he said.Timothy D. Cook, Apple’s chief executive, said there was not much Apple could do about the phenomenon beyond trying to keep its plans secret. “I’m glad people want the next thing,” he said. “I’m not going to put any energy into trying to get people to stop speculating.”The newest pillar of Apple’s business, the iPad, has started to take some of the pressure off the iPhone to dazzle investors every quarter. For the fiscal third quarter ended June 30, Apple said it sold 17 million iPads, bringing in revenue of $9.17 billion, compared with nine million iPads and $6.05 billion in revenue a year ago.Those sales got a lift from a new version of the iPad with a higher-resolution display that Apple introduced in March. The iPad now accounts for 26 percent of Apple’s total revenue.Mr. Cook added that Apple would release the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mountain Lion, on Wednesday.Apple reported net income of $8.82 billion, or $9.32 a share, up from $7.31 billion, or $7.79 a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue was $35.02 billion compared with $28.57 billion a year earlier.The figures were above the $8.68 a share in profit and $34 billion in revenue that Apple had previously forecast for the quarter. But they fell well short of the estimates of Wall Street analysts, who typically take Apple’s own forecasts with a grain of salt because of the company’s long history of underpromising and overdelivering on its financial performance.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected Apple to report earnings of $10.36 a share and $37.18 billion in revenue.But even the growth of the iPad still has not come close to dislodging the iPhone’s importance to Apple. It accounted for 46 percent of the company’s revenue in the quarter, and, according to Mr. Cihra’s estimates, about 60 percent of its profits.Apple said it expects to report overall revenue of about $34 billion and earnings of $7.65 a share for the current quarter.'"

"'12-07-25,'1','CAIRO — President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt named a prime minister on Tuesday, plucking from relative obscurity the irrigation minister from the country’s interim government, according to the official Middle East News Agency.The new prime minister is Hesham Qandil, who is known as a religious Muslim but is not a member of the Muslim Brotherhood. A technocrat who headed the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation under the interim cabinet appointed by the Egyptian military, Mr. Qandil is an American-educated engineer who is comfortable working with international agencies. At age 50, he is one of the youngest prime ministers in the country’s modern history.Although he has generally not been in the public eye, Mr. Qandil came to prominence briefly in June when a subordinate, a section head in his ministry, climbed out on an eighth-floor ledge of the ministry’s building and threatened to commit suicide. Mr. Qandil went to the scene, spoke quietly to the man on the ledge and persuaded him to come back inside the building. Exactly what he said to the man was not revealed, giving Mr. Qandil a reputation for discretion as well.He will need considerable skill to assemble a cabinet to replace the current one, appointed by the military after the fall of President Hosni Mubarak.His selection came a week after a deadline that Mr. Morsi, a former Muslim Brotherhood activist, had set for himself to name a cabinet. So far, no other members of a new government have been announced, and government ministries remain under the control of figures from the Mubarak era.The delay in announcing a prime minister led commentators to suggest that Mr. Morsi was having difficulty forming the kind of national unity government that he had promised voters. There may also be problems satisfying military leaders, who are expected to want to retain control of the security ministries.'"
"'12-07-25,'1','One tabloid journalist, who insisted on anonymity because of concern for his job, lamented what he called the end of the “anything goes” era. “Before, it was a case of ‘Don’t tell me how you get it, just get it,’ ” he said. “Now things are looked at differently.”With the announcement of charges on Tuesday, prosecutors have shown a new willingness to pursue criminal cases against editors and reporters accused of seeking to gather information through means that were for years winked at as unsavory but tolerable, at least for Britain: paying the police and public figures for scoops, and hacking into cellphone voice messages of politicians, celebrities and other people in the news for the salacious gossip that is the currency of mass-circulation dailies.Mr. Coulson and Ms. Brooks, both former editors of The News of the World, and the six others charged on Tuesday face possible prison terms of up to two years if convicted. All eight have vigorously denied the charges, with some suggesting that they are the victims of public and political hysteria, and have vowed to fight the indictments in court.Few in Britain have not been shocked by the revelations that have tumbled out of the scandal in the past year: not just the industrial-scale phone hacking, but also checkbook journalism that is alleged to have included payments rising into the tens of thousands of dollars to public officials, including police and prison officers, and a cover-up that prosecutors say persisted long after the heat of public anger was focused on the miscreants. Together, prosecutors say, it is a tally of wrongdoing that is likely to yield many more criminal cases in the months ahead.Media critics say the legacy of the “yellow journalism” of turn-of-the-20th-century America has migrated in recent decades to Fleet Street, the traditional home in London of many of Britain’s most powerful papers. Many editors and reporters nurtured in that culture have migrated abroad, some of them to Murdoch-owned papers in America, and elsewhere, taking their no-holds-barred attitudes with them.Some critics say Mr. Murdoch’s London tabloids, and The News of the World, and rivals here that compete for the same scoop-hungry readership of millions, have set a grim and degrading standard of journalism that will not be missed.But that style of journalism has its defenders, including influential voices who have warned that the opprobrium now focused on the tabloids, and on Mr. Murdoch personally, carries its own risk of excess. In newspaper columns, and in testimony at the public inquiry presided over by Lord Justice Sir Brian Leveson, they have argued against imposing statutory restraints to quiet the tabloids and protect secrets — personal, political and corporate — that only an irreverent press is likely to ferret out.One who has taken this view is Ken Clarke, a Conservative who is justice minister in Mr. Cameron’s cabinet. At the Leveson inquiry last month, he provoked condemnation by warning of the “chilling effect” of some of the testimony before the panel, and said new statutory controls on the press were not necessary.Chris Blackhurst, editor of The Independent, a left-of-center paper that escaped taint during the scandal, took a similar view. In an interview, he called the criminal charges “a shaming day for British journalism,” but defended some of the tabloids’ practices, saying that in some cases lawbreaking by journalists was defensible. “The Independent hasn’t hacked anyone’s phone, but there might be a case where we felt that we had to,” he said.Besides shaking Mr. Murdoch’s global empire to its core, the British scandal has forced News Corporation to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs, out-of-court settlements and payoffs to employees who have been laid off, Mr. Murdoch testified this year before the Leveson panel.And that price, analysts say, is likely to exceed a billion dollars as lawsuits and settlements proliferate. Alison Levitt, chief legal adviser at the Crown Prosecution Service, traced the scope of what lies ahead with a broad account on Tuesday of the number of confirmed victims of the phone hacking — more than 600, by the prosecutors’ count.Sue Akers, the senior officer overseeing the police investigations, told the Leveson inquiry on Monday that the police had notified 2,615 people that they may have been targets of the voice-mail interceptions. So far, only about 40 of those known to have been victims of the practice have settled their lawsuits against the Murdoch papers, with at least one of the settlements exceeding $1 million.Among the well-known figures given by Ms. Levitt as having been targeted in the phone hacking were and ; and his former wife, Heather Mills; the actresses and Sadie Frost; and Wayne Rooney, perhaps Britain’s best-known professional soccer player.The sensitivity among prosecutors to the political context of the phone hacking was suggested by the emphasis that Ms. Levitt, outlining the criminal charges, gave to the case of , a 13-year-old schoolgirl who disappeared in 2002 and was found murdered. Police have said her cellphone was hacked when she was the subject of a police hunt.The episode prompted Ms. Brooks’s resignation and led Mr. Murdoch to apologize personally to Milly’s parents — and to offer a settlement that was reported at the time to run into several million dollars. It also precipitated a parliamentary inquiry, and the decision by Mr. Cameron to impanel the Leveson hearings.Six of the eight people charged are accused of involvement in the hacking of the schoolgirl’s phone. In addition to Ms. Brooks and Mr. Coulson, they included three others who worked in senior newsroom positions at The News of the World: Stuart Kuttner, a former managing editor; , another senior editor; and , the paper’s longtime chief reporter. Also on the “Dowler list” is , a private investigator. Two other News of the World editors who were charged in the phone hacking, but not in the Dowler case, were and .'"
"'12-07-25,'1','YOU can make any soup with water instead of stock, but the soups that drive you wild usually have a beautiful stock as their base. This is doubly true of bouillabaisse, which should start with a stock so delicious that you can barely imagine improving on it.That’s easy to produce, actually. The hard part is finding the ingredients, because over the years we’ve seen two changes that have made that task more challenging: the near disappearance of the fishmonger and the pre-filleting of fish. Not only is it difficult to find someone to ask for fish bones, it’s difficult to find someone who even has them.But there are tricks. One is to grab them when you see them, and make the stock incrementally, which is not a big deal. Another is to use shrimp shells, which work beautifully. A third is to accumulate (or beg) lobster bodies, which make fantastic stock. In any case, you combine whatever you have with some aromatics (thyme branches, onion, celery, carrot, garlic, peppercorns) add water and simmer for 15 to 30 minutes. Cool, strain and freeze if you like.Earlier this summer, I found a fish market that would give me or anyone else free lobster bodies, practically a life-changing event. I quickly made a vat of stock (six bodies, a gallon of water), followed by a risotto. (Risotto with lobster stock is killer.)From then on, every time I bought fish, I squirreled away a little piece in the freezer: one squid, the belly flap of a striped bass fillet, a piece of halibut, a lobster claw and so on. The day I decided to slay some people with kindness, I defrosted those bits and my stock and headed to the fish market, where I bought mussels, clams and a couple of scallops for a bouillabaisse.'"

"'12-07-26,'1','“They repeatedly say that they have additional tools to use, but they haven’t done it,” said Tim Duy, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon. “That leads one to believe that they’re not particularly confident in the tools that they have.”The concerns are focused on the most aggressive option available to the Fed, a further expansion of its investment portfolio. They fall into two broad categories: Is the Fed disrupting markets by removing assets from circulation? And, in reducing interest rates, is the Fed pulling on a rubber band that could snap back quickly and painfully, sending those same rates soaring with disruptive consequences?In part because of those concerns, Fed officials have said that they want to be sure of the need for additional action before they decide to make the attempt.“I don’t think they should be launched lightly,” Mr. Bernanke said of asset purchases at a June news conference. “There should be some conviction that they’re needed.”Mr. Bernanke controls the Fed’s decision-making process, but he is unlikely to act without the support of a significant majority of the 11 other officials who hold votes on the committee. The resolute opposition of one, Jeffrey M. Lacker, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, is unlikely to make a difference. But more moderate officials, including Sandra Pianalto, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, also have stopped short of clear support for new actions in recent speeches, citing uncertainty about the economy and concern about the costs.Some Wall Street analysts have concluded that the Fed is unlikely to act before its September meeting, once it has seen data on job creation in July and August.The Fed already is engaged in a huge campaign to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers. It has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and it has said that it expects to maintain that policy at least until late 2014. To put further pressure on long-term rates, it has acquired almost $3 trillion of mortgage-backed securities and longer-term Treasury securities — an effort that it has already said will continue until the end of this year.The purchases drive down interest rates by reducing the supply of assets like long-term Treasury securities. Scarcity raises prices, meaning that investors are accepting a lower rate of return. It also pushes some investors to move their money into other assets, with much the same effect of lowering rates.The policies, along with a weak economy that has reduced demand for loans, have helped to push a wide range of borrowing costs to the lowest levels on record.In addition to the low level of mortgage rates, investors effectively are paying the federal government for the privilege of financing the national debt.Borrowing costs for companies with good credit fell to an average of 3.04 percent Wednesday, the lowest level on record, according to an index compiled by Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Rates have dropped 22 percent this year.The Fed’s efforts also have pumped up the stock market and held down the cost of American exports by pushing down the value of the dollar.The extent of economic benefits from these lower rates remains a subject of considerable debate, but the basic mechanics are clear enough.Lower mortgage rates, for example, encourage people to buy homes, allow them to afford more expensive homes and let existing homeowners refinance. The benefits do not directly reach homeowners who are underwater or borrowers who cannot qualify for loans. But the Obama administration estimates that refinancing alone has saved homeowners some $27.7 billion over the last three years.Companies also have taken advantage. The industrial conglomerate United Technologies in May staged the largest bond sale since the recession, raising $9.8 billion to finance its purchase of the aerospace firm Goodrich. The brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev raised $7.5 billion in mid-July toward its purchase of Grupo Modelo.But corporate bonds also highlight the difficulties confronting the Fed.The increase in total borrowing has been modest. Issuance of domestic corporate bonds increased by 2 percent in the first half of 2012, as compared with the first six months of 2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.The Fed’s ability to reduce the cost of government debt has only partly translated to the private sector. Rates on corporate debt have fallen much more slowly than on Treasuries, more than doubling the difference between corporate and government interest rates before the recession.Mortgage rates remain similarly elevated in comparison to Treasuries, although some Fed officials say they believe this could be addressed by purchasing mortgage securities. The Fed is forbidden by law from purchasing corporate debt.The disappointing reduction in rates, and the muted response to those lower rates, may be seen as a reason for the Fed to increase the scale of its efforts.But some economists are concerned about the possibility that additional purchases will impede the use of Treasuries as a kind of global currency.“By reducing the supply of Treasury bonds, the economy is deprived of extremely safe and liquid assets,” the Northwestern University economists Arvind Krishnamurthy and Annette Vissing-Jorgensen wrote Tuesday. They suggested that the Fed should buy mortgage securities with money raised by selling Treasuries.The Fed also does not want to own such a large share of Treasuries that the volume of buying and selling becomes too small to produce reliable prices.'"
"'12-07-26,'1','The statements, which prompted groups like the National Organization for Marriage to call Mr. Cathy a corporate hero, echo an ethos the company has never hidden.In early 2011, a Chick-fil-A restaurant in Pennsylvania donated food to a marriage seminar conducted by one of that state’s most outspoken groups against homosexuality. Advocates on both sides weighed in, and students at some universities began trying to get the chain removed from campuses.Equality Matters, an online investigative organization dedicated to gay and lesbian issues, last year obtained tax records that showed that the company’s operators, its WinShape Foundation and the Cathy family had given millions of dollars to groups whose work includes defeating same-sex marriage initiatives and providing therapy intended to change people’s sexual orientation.So Mr. Cathy’s statements might have passed without much notice except that Carly McGehee, a New Yorker, decided to stage a same-sex kiss-in on Aug. 3, urging gays and lesbians to show up at the company’s 1,600 restaurants around the country in protest.That moved Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, to declare Aug. 1 as Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day. His call to action, which he posted on Facebook last week, garnered such a response that it tripped the site’s spam filters, and the page was taken down briefly on Tuesday.Rick Santorum, the former Republican presidential candidate, has now jumped in. On Wednesday, he rallied his 200,000 Twitter followers: “With two of my boys, Enjoying chick-in-strips and an awesome peach shake at Chick-fil-A. See you here next Wednesday!”This week, Alderman Proco Moreno of Chicago said he would not move forward on land-use legislation that the company needs to open a second restaurant in that city, and on Friday, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston sent a letter telling Mr. Cathy that his company was not welcome there.The Jim Henson Company, which created toys for the chain, will not offer any more Muppets. On Friday, it said Lisa Henson, the chief executive officer, supported same-sex marriage and would donate money that the company had received from Chick-fil-A to the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.About the same time, Chick-fil-A posted signs announcing a “voluntary recall” of all Jim Henson’s Creature Shop Puppet Kids Meal toys, citing reports that some children’s fingers had gotten stuck in the holes of the puppets. Last week, Mr. Cathy said in a statement that his company would “leave the policy debate over same-sex marriage to the government and political arena.”People aligned with the Cathy family’s position have said they have visited the chain more frequently since its involvement in the issue became more widely known last year. Others, like Jeff Graham, the executive director of the gay rights group Georgia Equality, say they are not sure this protest will be any more successful than previous efforts, which fizzled.Mr. Graham said he was more interested in encouraging the company to write a corporate anti-discrimination policy that includes gays and lesbians.And he does not know, he said, if he will show up for the kiss-in. If he does, he certainly will not order a sandwich.“Frankly, I’m a vegetarian, and it’s been 20 years since I ate there,” he said.'"
"'12-07-26,'1','WASHINGTON — The State Department on Wednesday released its latest sober diagnosis of human rights abuses in China, along with some gentle encouragement to Beijing to do better.“Our message to the Chinese government is, you’ve made progress on the economic front,” Michael H. Posner, the assistant secretary for democracy, human rights and labor, said at a briefing. “This is the moment to open up the space to allow people to dissent, to question government actions, and to do so without fear of retribution.”Mr. Posner was reporting on the latest session of an annual human rights dialogue with China, which took place this week in Washington and included representatives from American and Chinese government agencies. During the meetings, he said, the State Department addressed China’s abuses of free expression on the Internet and in public, its persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, and its inhumane labor practices, among other human rights issues. For their part, Chinese officials raised concerns about the United States’ record on human rights, particularly in areas of discrimination and prison conditions.“The point that we made, which I feel very confident and proud to make, is that we have human rights issues in the United States, but we also have a very strong system to respond to them,” Mr. Posner said, citing access to legal representation for all citizens, a free press and a “robust” culture of political engagement.The meetings took place about two months after the arrival in New York of Chen Guangcheng, the Chinese dissident who sought refuge at the American Embassy in Beijing, setting off frenzied negotiations with the Chinese, who finally allowed him to leave the country after he left the embassy to be treated at a Beijing hospital.Mr. Posner said the United States continued to push China to allow legal representation for members of Mr. Chen’s family, including his nephew, who has been arrested and charged with voluntary manslaughter.'"
"'12-07-26,'1','The secretary and Mr. Brown emphasized that the new system would be a hedge against natural disasters like flooding, earthquakes or sea level rise that could collapse crucial levees and disrupt water supplies. Mr. Salazar said the water system was “at constant risk of failure.” Mr. Brown added: “We know there are a couple of big issues, earthquakes and climate change. And this facility is absolutely essential to deal with both of them.”Northern California legislators objected. “This rush to construction without the benefit of science is going to do irreparable harm, to Northern California in particular,” Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat from the Bay Area, said.The plan to move forward was announced at a news conference in Sacramento, about 35 miles from this small town at the northern edge of the delta where the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers meet.The local marshland ecosystem has suffered, in the words of one area environmentalist, a “biological meltdown” after 150 years of levee building and ever-increasing water withdrawals.Repairing the ecosystem, where fresh and salt water, overwhelmed by agricultural runoff and invasive species, push against each other in a perpetual dance, has been made a political priority. Officially, it is as important as assuring the viability of water deliveries through one of two major water arteries for Southern California. The other is the Colorado River.For decades, advocates for fish, for cities and for farmers have been trying to agree on a plan to manage the water flowing through the delta. The Bay Delta Conservation Plan has been fraught from the beginning, and its plans widely criticized.With the announcement Wednesday, state and federal leaders sidestepped most of the specifics that could create controversy: operational details like how much water would go through the pipes and when, scientific goals for recovery of endangered and threatened fish, and even economic assessment of whether the benefits would outweigh the costs.The management of the new apparatus would spring from a hybrid of agencies; documents released by the state last week described a “decision tree” to ensure that science was a main element of operational decisions.Many scientists believe that delivering the water that powerful agricultural interests say they need — one-quarter of the Sacramento River’s annual average flow of 22 million acre-feet — would further harm the battered populations of smelt, sturgeon, salmon and steelhead.The failure to solve this dilemma has been the catalyst for some willingness to compromise, since most of the stakeholders agree that the current situation is untenable. Decisions in recent years by the federal Fish and Wildlife Service and the courts to ensure there is enough water for fish have led to water delivery cutbacks in drought years.“We live in a world of uncertainty, where we never really know what we are getting,” said Jeff Kightlinger, the general manager of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which serves 19 million residents from San Diego to the northern and eastern reaches of Los Angeles. “We’ve been fighting every year, but every year we lose water and every year the fish get worse. Nobody is getting what they want right now.”Although Ann Nothoff, California advocacy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, is troubled by the lack of detail in the proposal, she believes, “The status quo is unacceptable.”Some scientists and engineers have argued that, despite improvements, the current system exacerbates the destruction of fish by degrading their habitat.David Hayes, the deputy interior secretary, said that the breakthrough in the talks about the delta was that “water contractors had been insisting that there be a guarantee of a specific” amount of water deliveries. “The regulatory agencies said: ‘We can’t guarantee that.’ And they” — the contractors — “stepped back and agreed to that.”“We’re glad to see that decisions are being made,” said James M. Beck, the general manager of the Kern County Water Agency, which serves some of the most powerful agribusinesses in the state. “What we really need,” he added, “is some detailed specific information” about how much water stakeholders are entitled to, and how much they will have to pay for it.Construction of the system is expected to take at least a decade, even after all the required environmental and engineering studies are complete. Those who consume water will have to cover the cost of construction; buying land and creating new habitat will fall to the government.One coalition centered on the small-scale farmers within the delta rejects the idea that the new project is necessary. It worries that the clear Sacramento River water it now relies on will be replaced with tidal residues from the San Francisco Bay.“This is a transfer of wealth,” said Rogene Reynolds, a small farmer in Stockton. “Because water is wealth.”'"
"'12-07-26,'1','Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, raised its 2012 profit forecast on Wednesday and said the global economy was slowly improving amid pockets of weakness.The outlook came after Caterpillar posted a quarterly profit that exceeded Wall Street forecasts because of higher sales of bulldozers, marine engines and mining trucks.Caterpillar’s sales rose 31 percent in North America, the area of strongest growth for the company, executives said in a conference call with investors.Business for many customers has not returned to prerecession levels, but aging equipment is forcing them to invest in new machines, a boon for Caterpillar.“Contractors, even if they’re doing the same amount of work as before, just have to buy new machines,” Caterpillar’s chief financial officer, Ed Rapp, said in an interview. “That’s a factor that we’re definitely seeing in our numbers.”The company raised its annual earnings forecast by a dime a share but beat second-quarter expectations by 26 cents. Still, analysts cautioned that Caterpillar faced challenges.'"
"'12-07-26,'1','The wartime spokesman for Slobodan Milosevic’s party will be sworn in as prime minister of Serbia on Thursday, officials said, stoking international concerns that Serbia will abandon its European path and return to the nationalism of the past.The newly designated prime minister, Ivica Dacic, leads the Socialist Party, which was once led by Mr. Milosevic, who was overthrown in a revolution in 2000 and died in jail in 2006 while being tried for crimes against humanity. The party’s comeback follows the victory of Tomislav Nikolic, another former archnationalist, in the presidential election in May. A member of the populist Serbian Progressive Party, Mr. Nikolic unseated the incumbent, Boris Tadic, who was celebrated in Washington and Brussels but was tarred at home by accusations of cronyism and corruption.Although Mr. Dacic and Mr. Nikolic say they have left nationalism behind and have embraced the European Union, the new coalition government will need to convince skeptics that it does not intend to forsake the West for closer ties with Moscow. Mr. Nikolic once said that Serbia would be better off as a province of Russia than as a member of the European Union.Like much of Europe, Serbia faces economic challenges, including 25 percent unemployment, rising inflation, a weak currency and woefully low incomes for workers. A headline published online last week by B92, a Serbian broadcaster, lamented that “10,000 Serbian Children Eat Only One Meal Per Day.”While top economic posts in the new government are to be held by supporters of free-market economics, some voices in the coalition have been calling for radical steps like breaking with the International Monetary Fund, which froze a $1.2 billion precautionary loan to Serbia in February over concerns about overspending and spiraling public debt. Rather than adopt harsh austerity, some analysts say, the new government may seek a loan from Russia.Mr. Dacic has also indicated that he will fire the governor of the central bank if it keeps raising interest rates. The bank’s tight monetary policy is calculated to rein in inflation, but the new government fears it may be choking off growth. Beyond economic problems, there are also concerns in Brussels and Washington that a new government made up of former Milosevic allies will undermine regional reconciliation in the Balkans.'"
"'12-07-26,'1','Boeing reported second-quarter earnings on Wednesday that topped analyst estimates, and it raised its profit forecast for the second time this year.The gains reflected a surge in aircraft deliveries, led by the company’s most profitable models, the 777 and the 737. Boeing said it was also starting to build its new 787 Dreamliner jets without having to make changes after the assembly line, avoiding the costly problems that had slowed the product for years.Analysts said Boeing appeared to be on track this year to pass Airbus as the world’s top producer of commercial airplanes. Boeing said Wednesday that it expected to deliver 585 to 600 planes this year. Airbus, which passed Boeing in deliveries in 2003 and has led ever since, has projected its total at 570 this year.Boeing said it also benefited from stronger-than-expected results from its military business. Military revenue rose by 7 percent despite tighter military budgets in the United States and other countries.Robert Stallard, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, wrote in a note to clients that “no mistakes” helped Boeing record the earnings increase, particularly on the commercial aircraft side. He also cited the gains in the military business, where, he wrote, “expectations have been understandably low.”'"
"'12-07-26,'1','But Facebook can present challenges to businesses of all sizes. Some consumers do not feel safe buying directly from a Facebook storefront, said Krista Garcia, a social commerce analyst with a market research firm, eMarketer. And business owners should be aware that they do not own their Facebook pages — Facebook does, and it can change the appearance and rules whenever it wants.GETTING STARTED It’s easy for a small business to open a Facebook storefront by creating a page in the business’s name, loading photos of the product and adding shopping functions. Because Facebook storefronts can look generic, small businesses have to find ways to differentiate themselves, said Jay Bean, chief executive of an online marketing firm, OrangeSoda.Customizing a page is done by installing applications that enable customers to do things like shop, enter contests or see a menu. Apps are available from Facebook and outside vendors, or they can be custom-developed.Payvment’s tools let businesses create a storefront with a shopping cart and promotions like discounts and coupons.USE YOUR PERSONALITY Unlike larger businesses, small businesses can build on their personal relationships to end users, said Wendy Tan-White, chief executive of Moonfruit, which builds and supports e-commerce Web sites. She advises using a cover image for a business’s page that relates not only to the product or service but to customers, too.On the Got What It Cakes storefront, for example, the cover photo shows the owner, Ms. Miller, in her home, with baby photos on the wall behind her and several cakes scattered about the sitting room; the smaller-profile photo is the company logo.Many of Ms. Miller’s customers are busy mothers like her, and she communicates frequently with them on Facebook. “I am a local, one-person business but I have 5,000 fans,” she said.Ms. Miller gives the kinds of tips her customers might get from a friend, like what to do with leftover chocolate cake batter: “Put some butter on your griddle and make pancakes with it.”POST, PIN AND TAG To attract fans and friends, a storefront needs to be dynamic, with frequent posts — status updates and photos. Tagging people in a photo may cause the photo to show up on the tagged person’s page, where friends (and often friends’ friends) can see it.Deann Kump, founder of TuTu Cute, which sells hair accessories and clothing for mothers, babies and toddlers, hosts a monthly photo contest on her page.“If someone posts a photo of their daughter wearing one of my products and tags it, their friends will wonder, ‘What is TuTu Cute?’ and go to my page,” she said.Mrs. Kump opened on Facebook last December and about half of her sales occur on the site.Ms. Tan-White of Moonfruit suggested that a business give customers incentives to spread the word, offering a discount if they tag its product in a photo. Facebook’s “pin” feature allows users to pin a post, which might be a product of the week or a special discount and pushes the post to the top of a business’s page.FOCUS ON COMMUNITY Magical Moments Modeling made TuTu Cute a “boutique of the month” on its Facebook page in April so friends of both pages could see it. And Mrs. Kump often promotes the work of children’s photographers she likes; they in turn promote her accessories.Patrick Skoff, a painter who sells 90 percent of his paintings on Facebook, said some visitors to his page might have been hesitant about buying until they saw the comments and “likes” on new and sold paintings.“They see all the likes and think, ‘Oh, I better buy that before someone else does,’ ” Mr. Skoff said.In July he painted 10 paintings a day for 10 days and sold all of them through Facebook.Darren Gann, co-owner of the Baby Grocery Store, started his Facebook storefront in February (he also has a kiosk in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte). Thirty-five percent of his sales come through Facebook, and Mr. Gann gives lots of help and advice to his customers. “They communicate with us there about everything, from asking about a shipment to what do we recommend for a gluten-free 9-month-old.""Heather Logrippo opened a Facebook storefront in 2009 for We’ve Labels, which sells clothing labels. She routinely goes to the Facebook pages where her customers spend time, like those for quilters or knitters.“I log on as We’ve Labels and start interacting with people, writing things like: ‘That’s a beautiful scarf you’ve knitted,’ ” she said. Those knitters and quilters will often click on the We’ve Labels page out of curiosity.OFFER OPTIONS While some small businesses sell only through Facebook, others maintain separate Web sites or have bricks-and-mortar outlets, because not all consumers feel comfortable using their credit card information on the site.Ashley Gall, owner of Méli Jewelry, which sells jewelry she designs and makes, said buying on Facebook was still too new for many of her customers — 15 percent of her sales happen there — so she also sells on Etsy, Indie Fashion Marketplace and her own Web site.Most of Mandie Miller’s customers order on Facebook and pay when she delivers the cake or when they pick it up. Yet she still maintains a Web site of her own.“I do a lot of wedding cakes, and it’s the moms and dads of brides usually paying and they often want to go to a regular business Web site. I also have grandmothers in their 80s and 90s that come to my cake tastings,” she said. “They aren’t on Facebook.”'"
"'12-07-26,'1','It’s all useful and a bit magical — if you own more than one Apple device. Clearly, the company wants to keep you a happy prisoner inside its beautiful walled garden.So what’s the value for these new syncing apps? Well, if phone apps cost $1 or $2, and computer shareware $20 or $30, then these new apps are probably worth about $7.The new Notification Center is also modeled on an iPhone/iPad feature. It’s a dark gray panel that slides onto the screen when you drag two fingers onto your trackpad (or click a menu-bar button). Here are all the nags, messages and alerts that your programs have issued, consolidated into one tidy, customizable list: today’s appointments, incoming messages, software updates, Twitter updates and so on.They tie into Mountain Lion’s new alert system, in which each incoming alert bubble slides quietly into the corner of your screen. It’s like a butler who tiptoes into your room with lunch, sees that you’re busy, and sets the tray down on the side table before quietly withdrawing.But being bombarded with bubbles would be a big bummer. So the Mail app’s new V.I.P. feature lets you designate certain people whose messages you never want to miss — your spouse, your boss, the cable guy. You can set it up so that alert bubbles appear only when those people write. That’s so smart. Notification Center: easily worth $3.50.Dictation has come to the Mac, too. When you double-tap the Fn button on your keyboard, you can speak to type.It’s exactly the same recognition technology as the iPhone’s. So it requires no voice training and no special microphone, but it requires an Internet connection. And the accuracy is not quite what you see in the Martin Scorsese Apple commercials for Siri. Still, dictation fast and useful, to the tune of $5.75.The new Share button is a keeper, too. It pops up everywhere — in shortcut menus, window edges, programs like Safari and Preview, and so on.Its pop-up menu lets you transmit whatever you’re looking at: a photo, document, link, video, file. You can post something to Twitter, send it as an e-mail or text message, post a photo or video to Flickr or Vimeo, send a file wirelessly to another Mac and so on. All without having to open a special app or load a certain Web page. (In a free update this fall, Facebook will appear in the Share menu, too.)This Share menu is a clever step-saver that you’ll use often. It’s easily worth $10.Maybe the most routine-changing enhancement is Power Nap, a feature for Apple’s latest hard-driveless laptops. It lets the laptop update Internet data even while it’s closed and asleep.Once an hour, it wakes itself — without activating any fans or lights — long enough to check for mail, download updates, run backups. When you wake the laptop later, you’ll be delighted to find that it’s completely up to date, with new e-mail waiting and all of your iCloud programs (Notes, Reminders, Calendar and so on) freshly synced.Apple says that the battery hit is very slight. But if you’re concerned, you can tell Power Nap not to kick in except when the laptop is plugged in. Awesome. Worth $11.Messages, the former iChat chat program, has been enhanced to handle iMessages, which are basically Internet-borne text messages that cost you nothing. Whenever you converse with fellow iCloud members — whether they’re on Macs, iPhones or iPads — the conversation appears simultaneously on all of your gadgets (and theirs). Start a chat on your phone when you’re out and about, and you’ll find its transcript in progress in Messages on your Mac. It’s freaky, somewhat confusing, but worth $3.35.AirPlay mirroring requires an Apple TV ($100), but lets you perform a real miracle: With one click, you can send whatever is on your Mac’s screen — sound and picture — to your TV. Wirelessly.AirPlay, already on iPhones and iPads, is even more useful on the Mac. You can send photo slide shows to the big screen. Or present lessons to a class. Or play online videos, including services like Hulu that aren’t available on the Apple TV alone.And for boardroom PowerPoint pitches, you can carry the tiny Apple TV instead of a $1,500 projector. A great feature, worth $12.87 — probably more to frequent PowerPointers.Not everything is a step forward, however. Apple has tried to refine last-year’s baffling AutoSave feature. It has restored the “Save As” and “Revert to Save” functions; alas, the result is almost more confusing than before. Worse, only a few programs incorporate this system — so you’re stuck with having to learn two ways to save files. Subtract $3.25.Apple’s continued push to bring multitouch gestures from the iPad to the Mac’s trackpad isn’t wholly convincing, either. You swipe upward with three fingers to open the Mission Control app, spread four fingers to view the desktop, swipe sideways with four fingers to move between full-screen apps ... you’re going to remember all this? I’m deducting $1.77 for that well-intentioned silliness.Keep in mind, too, that Mountain Lion is available exclusively as a download. This time, Apple isn’t even selling the software on a USB stick as a fallback. That’s a big “tough rocks” to people who don’t have high-speed Internet (yes, they still exist). Subtract $1.20.Finally, I found the usual assortment of minor first-release bugs. Apple confirmed them and says they’ll be exterminated shortly. That’s a 35-cent penalty.So by my highly scientific accounting, Mountain Lion costs $20 but nets $46.90 worth of enhancements. And that’s not even counting the other 170 features: the Preview app (now lets you fill in checkboxes and blanks in PDF forms), Gatekeeper (blocks evil software), new screen saver slide shows, the unified address bar/search bar in Safari, the scroll bars that fatten up as your cursor approaches, and so on.Over all, then, Mountain Lion is a gentle, thoughtful upgrade. All 200 new features? No, not really. But 10 that you’ll use every day? For $20?'"

"'12-07-27,'1','“Apple doesn’t have to own a social network,” , Apple’s chief executive, said at a recent technology conference. “But does Apple need to be social? Yes.”Twitter and Apple have already been working together. Recently, Apple has tightly sewn Twitter features into its software for phones, tablets and computers, while, behind the scenes, Twitter has put more resources into managing its relationship with Apple.Though an investment in Twitter would not be a big financial move for Apple by any stretch — it has $117 billion in liquid investments, and it quietly agreed to buy a mobile security company for $356 million on Friday — it would be one of Mr. Cook’s most important strategic decisions as chief executive. And it would be an uncommon arrangement for Apple, which tends to buy small start-ups that are then absorbed into the company.But such a deal would give Apple more access to Twitter’s deep understanding of the social Web, and pave the way for closer Twitter integration into Apple’s products.Twitter has grown quickly, amassing more than 140 million monthly active users who generate a vast stream of short messages about their lives, the news and everything else. An Apple investment would give it the glow of a close relationship with a technology icon, and would instantly bolster its valuation, which, like that of other start-ups, has languished in the wake of Facebook’s lackluster market debut. In fact, word of the talks comes at a time when some are asking whether expectations for the potential of social media companies have gotten out of hand, and shares of Facebook, and other companies have wilted.But Twitter does not need Apple’s cash. Earlier this year, Dick Costolo, Twitter’s chief executive, said the company had “truckloads of money in the bank.”The truckloads, according to people familiar with the matter, add up to more than $600 million in cash on hand. This comes from the $1 billion in financing it has raised over the years and, more recently, from a healthy flow of advertising revenue.Regardless, Twitter is widely expected to pursue a public offering within the next couple of years, whether or not it agrees to deals with investors like Apple.Apple and Twitter are logical partners in some ways. Unlike Facebook or Google, Twitter has no plans to compete with Apple in the phone business or elsewhere. And as Apple has found, social is just not in its DNA.“Those guys are a great partner,” Mr. Costolo said of Apple in a recent interview. “We think of them as a company that our company looks up to.” Mr. Costolo would not discuss any potential investments or anything else related to the company’s relationship with Apple.Spokesmen for both Apple and Twitter said on Friday that their companies did not comment on rumors.If an investment were to happen, Twitter’s chief financial officer, Ali Rowghani, would be instrumental in cementing the deal. Mr. Rowghani joined Twitter in early 2010 after nine years at Pixar Animation Studios, where he worked directly with , Apple’s co-founder.Ties between Apple and Twitter are strengthening at a time of great uncertainty in the mobile market. Battle lines that seemed clear just a year ago are rapidly blurring as companies push into new areas of the market and clash with former allies.Facebook, the world’s largest social network, is said to be working on developing its own phone or core software for phones. Similarly, Google acquired Motorola Mobility last year and is now in the business of building phones.The jumbled landscape reflects the rising significance of mobile, as more consumers neglect their desktops in favor of computing that fits in their pockets. Eager to win on such a critical battleground, technology giants are rushing to control both hardware and software on mobile devices.The turf wars have fortified alliances and pushed companies to choose sides. Apple’s dealings with Twitter, for instance, began after its relationship with Facebook soured. In 2010, the company was eager to integrate its Ping service with Facebook, but discussions broke down. Mr. Jobs, the Apple chief executive who died last year, told the technology news site AllThingsD that Facebook had demanded “onerous terms that we could not agree to.”Apple, which had spent months preparing to hook Facebook into iOS, its mobile operating system, swiftly reworked it for Twitter. One former Twitter employee, who described Twitter as the “lucky mistress” in this chain of events, said the partnership was essentially “handed to Twitter on a silver platter.” Ping, in the end, never caught on with users.For Twitter, the union has proved fruitful. The mobile integration, introduced in late 2011, made it easy for and users to sling photos, maps and other media directly to Twitter. So far they have generated some 10 billion tweets. And, in recent months, Apple has also incorporated Twitter features into its operating system for computers as well as its advertising service.The relationship with Apple is so prized at Twitter that the company assigned a vice president, Kevin Thau, to work with Apple full time, according to an Apple employee who asked not to be named.Apple’s relationship with Facebook has started to thaw. Last month, the company said it would add Facebook features to the next version of its mobile operating system. Still, the two companies are wary of each other. Facebook, which recently began its own “App Center” and is intent on bulking up its mobile revenue, is likely to continue to bump up against Apple.Analysts are concerned that Apple may fall behind in mobile software because of increasing competition and a lack of social features. And as Apple has shown, software and content can make or break hardware sales.“Content was a key pillar in the success of the iPhone,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. He noted that consumer loyalty to the iTunes library, which many used to store their music collections, helped lift early sales of the phone. “Down the road, social engagement may dictate how consumers spend,” Mr. Hilwa said.'"

"'12-07-27,'1','Does a certain hedge fund capital have a going problem?Greenwich officials have commissioned a study on the role that the sophisticated investment pools, private equity firms and the financial services industry in general has on the local economy.The town's hedge fund universe lost a major star last month when ESL Investments, the $9 billion private investment fund of Edward Lampert, packed its bags for Miami, a destination with no state income tax and a lower corporate tax than Connecticut.""We're not taking these people for granted,"" First Selectman Peter Tesei said Thursday. ""It's easy to vilify (them) based upon an image.""Tesei's comments came during the biweekly meeting of the Board of Selectmen, where he announced that a volunteer economic advisory committee that reports to his office will conduct a broad analysis of the impact financial services companies have on Greenwich and report its findings by the fall.Among the committee's 10 members is Greenwich Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Marcia O'Kane and Paul Settelmeyer, who represents the town on the South Western Regional Planning Agency.""We feel that it is an important undertaking because the town is dependent on it,"" Tesei, the town's chief elected official, said of the financial services industry.Hedge funds, which invest in stocks, commodity futures, options and emerging market debt, are complex investment pools that cater to high-net-worth individuals.Lampert, the force behind the Sears and Kmart merger, is currently the 367th richest person in the world, with a net worth of $3.1 billion, according to Forbes.com.Representatives of is hedge fund declined to say what precipitated the firm's exodus from Connecticut or how many people it employed at its 200 Greenwich Ave. headquarters when it revealed it was relocating.Tesei acknowledged that the loss of ESL Investments set the wheels in motion for the town conduct an analysis of its own.""What does that mean for Greenwich?"" Tesei said. ""What does that mean for the state?""In other business, the selectmen voted unanimously to go back to two-way traffic on New Lebanon Avenue in Byram after experimenting with a one-way traffic pattern for 90 days that was widely panned by residents of the neighborhood.Byram Neighborhood Association Chairman Michael Bocchino criticized the town's conduct of the trial and what he characterized as a lack of communication by the Department of Public Works about changes to the street and signage.""With all that, the community is completely and utterly frustrated that the town's Department of Public Works missed the boat on all these items,"" Bocchino said. ""We the people of Byram deserve a little bit more, as does the town of Greenwich.""Jim Michael, the town's chief engineer, agreed that the road should be returned to two-way traffic in what he called a ""compromise.""Michael noted that New Lebanon Avenue is being repaved and will get new sidewalks and granite curbing. There will be eight on-street parking spaces on New Lebanon Avenue, in addition to 21 on William Street, which intersects it.The Board of Selectmen also received an update from Ian MacMillan, the town's harbor master, who said it would cost $2 million to $2.5 million to dredge the mouth of the Mianus River and $8 million to $10 million to dredge Greenwich Harbor, based on new figures from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.""If we're able to recover our harbors, that would be stunning, just stunning,"" MacMillan said.The selectmen also discussed the framework of a 10-year lease extension with Abilis, which was formerly known as ARC of Greenwich, to maintain a group home on the Pomerance property in Cos Cob.There is a ongoing debate on whether the renewal of the $1-per-year lease requires the approval of the Representative Town Meeting.Town Attorney John Wayne Fox told that selectmen that any time town property is conveyed, final authority rests with the RTM.But Town Administrator John Crary suggested that the renewal is automatic so long as there are no changes to the terms of the lease and Abilis wants to remain on the property, which it does.""Personally speaking, I think it's an excellent use of the facility,"" Tesei said. ""I think it's a wonderful organization.""The selectmen, who are expected to take up formal language of the lease renewal at their Aug. 9 meeting, voted 2-1 to refer the item to the Planning and Zoning Commission for municipal improvement review.Selectman Drew Marzullo cast the lone dissenting vote, saying that Abilis serves a valuable purpose for the community and shouldn't have to go through a protracted renewal process and red tape.""This is a waste of time, in my opinion,"" Marzullo said. ""I don't think they should have to go through this process.""'"

"'12-07-27,'1','JERUSALEM — Miriam Ben-Porat, the first woman to serve as a justice on Israel’s Supreme Court and to hold the post of state comptroller, the government’s watchdog, died on Thursday at her home in Jerusalem. She was 94.Her death was confirmed by a spokeswoman for the Israeli courts administration.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described Mrs. Ben-Porat as “a trailblazer” who “sanctified the values of integrity and transparency.”Mrs. Ben-Porat began working at Israel’s Ministry of Justice soon after the establishment of the state in 1948. Within two years she was promoted to deputy to the state attorney. After serving as a judge and president of the district court, she was appointed a permanent justice of the Supreme Court in 1977. She retired from the bench in 1988.In the decade that followed, as the state comptroller, Mrs. Ben-Porat, charged with auditing government agencies and their affiliates, aggressively exposed government failings. Her role earned her widespread public respect and national prominence.In one report, she chastised the government for flaws in its planning for absorbing the first waves of Soviet Jews who immigrated in the early 1990s. In another, she warned of an impending water shortage because of what she described as a quarter of a century of irresponsible mismanagement by the water authorities. That led to the dismissal of the water commissioner.During the Persian Gulf war, as Iraqi missiles rained down on Israel, Mrs. Ben-Porat found that many of the gas masks that the military had distributed to the population would have been largely ineffective in a gas attack.'"
"'12-07-27,'1','All off-season, the Brooklyn Nets have tried to position themselves as the Knicks’ equals. The Nets’ logo and image were remodeled. Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, boasted that the Nets would be the team to win an N.B.A. championship for New York. General Manager Billy King and Coach Avery Johnson said Deron Williams and Joe Johnson formed the best backcourt in the league.A few weeks ago, as if driving home the point, Brett Yormark, the Nets’ chief executive officer, made a request to N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern for Brooklyn’s first home game in a major professional league since the Dodgers left in 1957: Give us the Knicks.The N.B.A. granted Brooklyn’s wish. In the shiny new Barclays Center — with images of Williams’s face to invite fans — the Nets will host the Knicks on national television Nov. 1.“We encourage the league to give us the most dramatic game possible and I think the league agreed,” Yormark said as the N.B.A. released its schedule for the 2012-13 season Thursday night. “I don’t think there is any game bigger than Nets-Knicks on opening night in Brooklyn. I’m looking forward to it. People are going to be talking about this game until it happens.”The Knicks’ home opener will be Nov. 2 against the Miami Heat, the N.B.A.’s defending champions.

"'12-07-27,'1','“Senator McCain is a tremendous leader in the Republican conference as well as a trusted adviser to me on a number of critical matters, including national security and fiscal issues,” Mr. McConnell said. “Being on the same side of these recent battles has not only strengthened our friendship, but it’s helped clarify the broader debate.”This latest John McCain has emerged in the aftermath of a stinging loss in the 2008 presidential campaign to a man he considered to have a very thin résumé compared with his decades of military and public service, a loss that left him bitter about politics and the news media — a group he once jokingly referred to as his political base.Now, after nearly three years of sniping from the sidelines, Mr. McCain is a polestar on nearly every major issue consuming the Senate, from a cybersecurity bill to the debate over to an investigation into national security leaks and the fight to head off $500 billion in Pentagon cuts. He is arguably the most active senator in a frequently sleepy chamber.Often these days, he actually smiles.“It took me three years of feeling sorry for myself,” Mr. McCain said to a group of reporters this week as he held court outside the polished doors of a waiting senators-only elevator, taking questions as he does daily on the major topics of the day, be it the budget, the Arab Spring, postal reform or the reshuffling of in and Guam.Mr. McCain was in all of his McCain-ness recently on the Senate floor, where he derided a group of House Republicans for suggesting that a top aide to , Huma Abedin, was connected to the Muslim Brotherhood.Next week, he will roll through a series of East Coast cities, holding town-hall-style meetings to speak out against planned cuts to the Pentagon that resulted from last year’s debt-ceiling deal, another core fight in which he is front and center.In some ways it seems as if Mr. McCain remains unable to reconcile the rightward lurch he took two years ago with his clear desire to continue to put his stamp on myriad issues — at times bridging partisan divides — to burnish his legacy.For instance, on campaign finance — an issue he was so personally associated with that his name was tied to the legislation that Mr. McConnell fought at the Supreme Court — Mr. McCain has been unwilling to work with Democrats on new bills to force more disclosure of the names of wealthy donors.“I’ve been disappointed,” said Senator of , the No. 2 Senate Democrat. “I was hoping John would carry that forward, but so far with the Disclosure Act and other things we’ve got on the floor he has not joined us. I just hope he goes back to his roots.”Many of Mr. McCain’s other interests align neatly with the big issues of the day, particularly the debate over the role of the in conflicts in the — in which he has largely been a staunch critic of the Obama administration — and the planned Pentagon cuts.The pattern is similar to that of other unsuccessful presidential candidates, like Senator of , who publicly sulked for a few years before becoming a major player on and other issues.“I just think a lot of it has to do with the agenda,” Mr. McCain said of his re-emergence, in an impromptu interview with several reporters. “After I lost, I knew that the best way to get over it was to get active.” (Mr. McCain, who disputed some coverage of him by during the 2008 campaign, has a policy of not speaking directly to reporters from The Times.)Senator , the Democrat and Armed Services Committee chairman who is working with Mr. McCain on a way to avoid Pentagon cuts, said that Mr. McCain was a “key spokesman” on the issue.“It’s all relative around here in terms of partisanship,” Mr. Levin said. “Inside his party he stands shoulders above in terms of being willing to deviate from the grip of an antitax pledge.”Mr. McCain is also a very useful advocate for his party in an election year. He provides credibility on military issues and can employ his rhetorical gifts on the Sunday talk shows (where he has appeared more than any other member of Congress this year, according to a tally by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call) to promote the party view in a way that Mr. McConnell and others cannot.“He loves his job,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of and a longtime friend and ally of Mr. McCain’s. “He’s the template for someone in the future who runs for president and falls short. He didn’t take his ball and go home. I am just very proud of him. He’s very, very involved in all the things that really matter around here.”'"
"'12-07-27,'1','That action plan is to be developed by October.Citing schools that show declining enrollments and increasing numbers of students with special needs, Michael Mulgrew, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, said the conditions showed that the city’s strategies for opening and closing schools had done “harm to individual student education.”“If they know it’s happening, and they have done it for years, and they have done nothing to stop it — they have exacerbated it, actually — and if they are letting it happen, then in my belief, they are doing it on purpose and it is reckless,” said Mr. Mulgrew, citing the study done for the city several years ago by the Parthenon Group.The union pointed to figures from Herbert H. Lehman High School in the Bronx, which was slated to close and reopen in September, but whose situation is now in flux. There, enrollment fell to 3,593 students last year, from 4,120 in 2005-6, while, in the same period, the population of special education students rose to 751, from 606.Marc Sternberg, a deputy chancellor in the city Education Department, tied the issue to the city’s commitment over the last 18 months to providing a wider group of parents with choices on the schools their children can attend — a process he said also addressed Mr. King’s concerns about the mix of special needs students.He said the Parthenon Group had also showed that some schools, with equal proportions of students with special needs as those that were underperforming, had in fact succeeded — “knocked the cover off the ball,” he said — because of things like leadership, effective teachers and strong academic programs.Mr. Sternberg said any suggestion that the city purposefully sabotaged certain schools was wrong.“I would say that the work we have done, to close failing schools and open new schools, has been more of a service to families in New York City than I could possibly hope to describe,” he said.'"

It was written as a safeguard against a government that might become so centralized and so powerful that it would pose a threat to the freedom of the citizenry and the Republic.To have a détente over the Second Amendment, the liberals have a lot more compromising to do.It is hard to avoid the real meaning of the text of the Second Amendment to the Constitution: The founding fathers were insisting on an inexorable connection between the right to bear arms and participation in a “well-regulated” military organization. If they had intended anything different the amendment would simply read, “The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.” It doesn’t.This, of course, points to a modern conundrum for everyone, liberal and conservative alike: The founding fathers were revolutionaries. They wanted to preserve the ultimate safeguard of armed rebellion, a political technique that they themselves had made very effective use of and that they saw as critical to maintaining the legitimacy of democratic government.As such, organized armed forces not under the complete control of the government were not only acceptable to them, but also desirable. But in modern terms, acceptance of that principle would turn the United States into a country that would make the never-ending conflict in Iraq look like a large paintball game. No one on either side of the political divide wants to face that truth, and so they avoid the obvious conclusion: the Second Amendment needs to be amended.Craig R. Whitney is right when he calls on us to seek common ground in the debate over gun rights. But I disagree that a ban on AR-15s and bulk ammunition purchases would be a “nonstarter” because Americans like shooting sports as recreation.The Second Amendment does not say, “Shooting sports, being a desirable form of recreation to a tiny percentage of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear semiautomatic assault rifles, shall not be infringed.”'"

"'12-07-27,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan — The Afghan president released a sweeping set of proposed reforms late Thursday, including a number aimed at stemming the government’s endemic corruption; the proposals touched every ministry, the attorney general’s office and the Supreme Court.The document, which the president’s spokesman Aimal Faizi described in a Twitter message as a “decree on administrative reforms,” is similar to an executive order and in theory must be complied with by all organs of government. However, Parliament can review it, and many of the provisions are vague, leaving unclear the timetable for compliance and how some of the measures would be financed.One backdrop for the decree was the discontent of donor countries over the government’s failure to stem widespread corruption, nepotism and contract profiteering. At an international conference in Tokyo this month about funding for Afghanistan in the years to come, many countries said their continued financial support was contingent on progress on corruption.“The first intent is to satisfy donors’ demands, which are multiple and not fully reflected in the Tokyo Conference document,” said Candace Rondeaux, the head of the Kabul office of the International Crisis Group, an independent nongovernmental organization aimed at preventing and resolving conflicts.Different countries have long had varying levels of tolerance for corruption, and they have different laws governing foreign aid. Afghanistan’s Supreme Court, judiciary and attorney general’s office have been areas of concern for many donors here.'"
"'12-07-27,'1','Anyone who planned on the first calendar winced at the second. The sprint turned into a distance race. A year with a 10-week primary, followed by an 11-week runoff and then five months to prepare for and run in a general election became something else — a five-month primary, a nine-week runoff and then only three months for the general election.The delay gave oxygen to candidates like Ted Cruz and stole momentum from others, like David Dewhurst, who had a big advantage going into what was supposed to be a quick primary at the beginning of the year. That race — the Republican primary for United States Senate — became a tossup worthy of national attention instead of a more provincial race between a sitting lieutenant governor and a pack of relative pipsqueaks.That story repeats as you work through the other three dozen races on the primary ballots. Everyone is exhausted. They’re out of money. The outcomes of the elections and the political fortunes of the candidates are not necessarily what everyone expected last November and December — when the political players were ramping up for the races.Much is at stake, but you can’t tell that from looking at the voters. Turnout was better than expected but still disappointingly low in the first round, when 11.7 percent of those who were of voting age cast ballots. Runoffs ordinarily draw fewer than half as many voters as the elections they follow.Most Texans are not engaged, either because they have more pressing things to do or because they have tuned out of politics or because the campaigns and candidates are not talking about things that matter to them. Whatever the reason, the primary was a niche election of interest to only one voter in every nine.What might have been? In March, the Republican presidential nomination was still in play and the opinions of Texas Republicans would have been consequential in a national race.That’s not the case in general elections, and it’s not usually the case in primaries, which tend to settle before they reach us. But the 2008 Democratic contest made it to Texas and increased turnout in both primaries — voters do love a noisy competition — and the combined primary turnout that year was 23.9 percent.Texas might have changed the outcome in the presidential race. The results in any number of state races might have been different. And more people would have voted.The campaigns and candidates are exhausted, but they volunteered for this. Voters did not, and most have apparently moved on, handing their choices to the tiny part of the public that will vote no matter when you hold an election — even at the end of July.'"
"'12-07-27,'1','3M, the maker of Post-its and Scotch tape, said on Thursday that it managed a slim increase in second-quarter earnings as cost-cutting offset a revenue shortfall.The company, based in St. Paul, posted net income of $1.17 billion, or $1.66 a share, compared with $1.16 billion, or $1.60 a share, in the period a year earlier.Revenue fell 2 percent, to $7.53 billion. A strong dollar diluted the value of international sales. For instance, an 11 percent increase in sales in Latin America and Canada was almost entirely erased when sales in local currency were translated to dollars.Analysts expected net income of $1.65 a share on revenue of $7.79 billion, according to FactSet.Besides popular household products, 3M makes a diverse range of office products and items, including stethoscopes and adjustable desk-mounting devices for computer monitors. Excluding the currency impact, sales rose in every division except for display and graphics, which has shown continued weakness because of slumping sales of films for LCD televisions. That unit also makes stop signs and overhead projectors.Sales in 3M’s biggest segment, industrial and transportation, rose 4.2 percent. But when exchange rates were factored in, sales fell 0.6 percent.3M maintained its full-year earnings forecast. It expects to earn $6.35 to $6.50 a share, compared with $5.96 a share in 2011. It expects sales to fall by 3 percent because of continued strength in the dollar, implying sales of $28.72 billion. Excluding that effect, 3M predicts sales will rise 2 percent to 5 percent.'"
"'12-07-27,'1','Poets House, a quarter-century old this year, is a word lover’s dream come true. Housed in a duplex facing the Hudson in Lower Manhattan, and free to the public, it offers a light-filled poetry library of 50,000 volumes and a solid program of readings. It also organizes exhibitions, two of which, devoted to the institution’s founders, the poet Stanley Kunitz (1905-2006) and the arts administrator Elizabeth Kray (1916-87), are now on view.“Bettissima: Treasures from the Elizabeth Kray Archives” is made up mostly of manuscripts, including a treasurable handwritten description by Kray of Marianne Moore, along with letters from the likes of W. H. Auden, Elizabeth Bishop and E. E. Cummings. By contrast the Kunitz show, “A Poet’s Circle,” consists almost entirely of paintings and sculptures.Kunitz, who was married to the painter Elise Asher, is on record as saying that he liked the company of artists and poets better than that of poets alone, “who tend to be rather surly and withdrawn.” A photocopy of the guest list for a 1967 dinner party he gave, which brought Mark Rothko, Jack Tworkov, John Ashbery and Robert Lowell to the same table, attests to that preference. So does a sampling of work installed among the stacks of the Poets House library by various artists he knew.It includes a large, late, lavender abstract painting by Tworkov; a depiction, by Janice Biala, of the Kunitz seasonal home in Provincetown, Mass.; one of Saul Steinberg’s architectural fantasias in ink and gouache; and a small, subtle, easy-to-miss relief by Jeanne Reynal made from stone chips embedded in a sheet of concrete, like pebbles in beach sand.The featured presence, though, is Philip Guston, who forges a direct art-poetry link in several drawings and paintings that quote from Kunitz poems, including these lines from “The Mound Builders”: “What’s best in me lives underground/rooting and digging, and itching for wings.” At Poets House artists and poets alike take flight, helping one another gain altitude.'"
"'12-07-27,'1','“The overarching concern over the last week or so has been that the euro zone is slowly melting into the Mediterranean,” said Art Hogan, managing director of Lazard Capital Markets in New York. “To have Draghi come out and say, listen, we are keeping this together,” he said, will add support.“Remember, though, that the E.C.B. can’t do this alone,” Mr. Hogan said. “He’s going to have to have support from Germany and we’ll see if that’s forthcoming.”Hopes that the Federal Reserve will bolster efforts to stimulate a flagging economy, maybe with a decision to do so as early as at its rate-setting meeting next week, soothed concerns about the economy and offset the impact of what investors describe as a “mixed” corporate earnings season.In a reassuring sign on the economy, the number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell last week to near a four-year low, the government said, a hopeful indication for a labor market that has shown signs of weakness.Shares in Sprint Nextel jumped 20 percent after the company posted earnings. Net operating revenue rose to $8.8 billion from $8.3 billion. Analysts expected $8.727 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.With around two-fifths of S.&P. 500 companies reporting earnings as of Wednesday, 65 percent have beaten Wall Street’s profit estimates. However, three in five companies missed revenue estimates, with many pointing to a weakening global economy.Earlier, European markets made even bigger advances than New York, with the Spanish Ibex 35 index soaring 6.1 percent. The Italian FTSE MIB index jumped 5.6 percent and the CAC 40 in France gained 4.1 percent.Troubled sovereign bonds also made a recovery, with the yield on the 10-year Spanish note narrowing to 6.828 percent and the Italian to 6.009 percent.“Finally, the markets have forced the E.C.B. and the euro group leaders to begin to make statements that the market really wants to hear,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.“Yes, he’s said before that the euro is irreversible, but today he says it’s irreversible and we will make it irreversible,” said Mr. Cardillo.'"
"'12-07-27,'1','Also on Thursday, a European official said that Greece could count on the continued support of the as long as it met neglected commitments to its international creditors under its latest bailout.In the three years that the euro zone crisis has festered, there have been numerous occasions when European officials unveiled policy responses and market optimism soon evaporated. Earlier this year, Mr. Draghi himself said that the worst of the crisis seemed to be over, after the central bank flooded banks with low-cost . But the mood soon turned sour again.Mr. Draghi did not specify the actions that policy makers might take, but the Spanish government and the have all but begged the European Central Bank to resume buying bonds as a way to clamp down on the turmoil plaguing financial markets.Traders have increasingly pinned their hopes on intervention by the bank and the as the economic outlook in both the United States and Europe has weakened. Past asset-buying programs by central banks, like the European Central Bank’s decision to buy Spanish and Italian bonds last fall, have helped stop precipitous market declines. But the bank has not bought bonds in the troubled countries for months.Economists cautioned that Mr. Draghi was probably still reluctant to effectively begin financing European governments because of the uproar it would cause in , where public opinion is firmly against bailing out countries seen as irresponsible.“I have no doubt that the E.C.B. will save the euro area from collapse,” said Charles Wyplosz, a professor of economics at the Graduate Institute in . “The problem is that they are operating in a difficult political environment with general German hostility. They can only move at the tipping point or close to the tipping point.”Besides spiking bond rates, doubts are building about Greece’s ability to meet its bailout conditions, with Willem Buiter, a economist, saying there is a 90 percent probability that Greece will leave the euro zone in the next 12 to 18 months.In , , the president of the , insisted that Greece would not be isolated if it pushed through stalled economic reforms demanded by its foreign creditors — the commission, E.C.B. and International Monetary Fund. “The key word is deliver, deliver, deliver,” Mr. Barroso said after talks with Prime Minister .He called for greater solidarity across the bloc. “All in the euro zone must come together to support our currency. Some have not realized that we are in the same boat,” Mr. Barroso said, adding: “My message to Greeks is that they are not alone. We will stand by them.”Strategists are worried that each new instance of intervention seems to provide less relief than the last. This is because central banks have not been successful in addressing the underlying problems in Europe’s weaker economies, which are growing worse with each passing month.In recent days Spain’s long-term borrowing costs had risen to nearly 7.7 percent, a level that would eventually make it impossible for the country to finance itself and would set off a chain of events that could destroy the common currency, with grave consequences for the global economy. The yield, or interest rate that bond buyers demand, plunged to 6.8 percent for Spanish 10-year bonds on Thursday, and dropped to 6 percent for Italy. That may have been his intent.Ken Wattret, an analyst at the French bank , said in a note that Mr. Draghi’s comments might be “merely a threat to act, designed to put some two-way risk back into markets.”But traders will eventually try to test the central bank’s resolve. So strong words by Mr. Draghi will probably be effective over the long term only if the bank officially declares that it will not tolerate market interest rates on European government debt above specified levels, and is willing to spend as much as needed to cap them.The Swiss National Bank has used similar declarations to keep its currency from appreciating too much. But such a promise would require a willingness by the E.C.B. to effectively print money, a strategy that would outrage many Germans.“The more credible the commitment, the less likely the market will test it,” Jacques Cailloux, an economist at Nomura, said in a note Thursday. But he added, “This is easier said than done.”Vocal dissent from someone like Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank and an influential member of the European Central Bank governing council, might convey the impression that policy makers are divided and undercut their credibility. Mr. Weidmann has said many times that he believes large purchases of government bonds would violate a ban on using the bank to finance governments.In response, Mr. Draghi said Thursday that the European Central Bank would stay within its mandate, which requires the bank to defend price stability above all else. But he added that if government borrowing costs interfered with the central bank’s ability to influence interest rates, its main tool for controlling inflation, “they come within our mandate.”Mr. Draghi has noted in recent weeks that the bank’s mandate also requires it to fight , a ruinous decline in prices, as well as inflation. That is seen as also opening the door to huge bond purchases.The bank has intervened sporadically in government bond markets since 2010 but has not bought any government bonds since March and only relatively modest amounts since Mr. Draghi took office in November.Speculation that the European Central Bank would resume its purchases intensified after it cut its benchmark interest rate earlier this month to a record low of 0.75 percent. The cut does not appear to have lowered borrowing costs for business and consumers in countries like Italy and Spain that need it most. As a result, analysts say, the bank will need to reach for other monetary policy tools to restore the flow of , and ultimately to preserve the common currency.The bank’s governing council holds its monthly monetary policy meeting next Thursday.Mujtaba Rahman, an analyst at the Eurasia Group who covers Europe, said that Mr. Draghi would probably agree to large bond purchases only if several conditions were met. These would include guarantees from euro zone members that they would cover any losses and measures to ensure that Spain and Italy continue efforts to make their economies function more efficiently.Mr. Rahman agreed that Mr. Draghi would ultimately do what it took to save the euro, partly because its failure would mean the end of the European Central Bank as an organization. “If the euro disintegrates, they are all out of work,” Mr. Rahman said in an e-mail. “So, there is a preservation instinct at play here also.”In the markets, taking more risk was at play on Thursday for the first time in days. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 211.88 points, or 1.67 percent, to 12,887.93. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index gained 22.13 points, or 1.65 percent, to 1,360.02. The Nasdaq composite index rose 39.01 points, or 1.37 percent, to 2,893.25.In Europe, the Spanish Ibex 35 index soared 6.1 percent and the Italian FTSE MIB index jumped 5.6 percent. The CAC 40 in gained 4.1 percent.In the bond market, the price of the ’s 10-year note fell 12/32, to 102 27/32, while its yield rose to 1.44 percent, from 1.40 percent late Wednesday.'"
"'12-07-27,'1','Company spokesmen noted slumping economic activity, particularly in Europe, as a primary reason for declines in prices and sales. But they stressed that several long-term projects should assure the company’s future, including an agreement with Rosneft to develop oil reserves in Western Siberia and a planned expansion of petrochemical production in the Gulf of Mexico region.“Despite global economic uncertainty, we continue to invest throughout the business cycle, taking a long-term view of resource development,” said Rex Tillerson, Exxon Mobil’s chairman and chief executive.There were some bright spots for the Texas-based company. Refinery profits increased by 14 percent, while net income for the chemical manufacturing business improved by 21 percent. Both units benefited from the lower gas and oil prices, the vital feedstocks for refining and chemical production.But independent analysts viewed the results mostly with disappointment.“Production growth remains fleeting for them,” said Brian Youngberg, a senior energy analyst at Edward Jones. “The XTO acquisition has not benefited them yet, but I think it can in the future.” Mr. Youngberg predicted that Exxon Mobil’s production volumes would improve by next year with the ramping up of new oil and gas production projects in Canada and off the coasts of Nigeria and Angola.In contrast, Royal Dutch Shell, which is based in The Hague, reported higher production of oil and gas but said that profits for the quarter declined by 13 percent from the similar period in 2011, to $5.7 billion.“Our profits have fallen with energy prices, but our growth strategy is delivering to the bottom line,” said Shell’s chief executive, Peter Voser, who pointed to low North American gas prices and weaker oil prices as reasons for the quarterly decline.Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec in London, said that Shell’s reported earnings were “dreadful” and well below what analysts expected. He said that the disappointing results were an indication that Shell was having difficulty controlling costs of materials and contractors. He said costs in the industry were going up 15 percent a year.“They are facing a tsunami of costs, crucifying margins,” he said.Keeping expenses under control is critical for Shell because it is in the midst of one of the largest capital spending programs in the oil industry as it tries to ensure future oil and gas flows and revenue streams. The company is spending $32 billion this year on projects like the giant Pearl gas-to-liquids plant in Qatar, which converts huge volumes of natural gas to fuels like diesel. It is also making major investments in liquefied natural gas projects in Australia and hopes soon to begin exploration drilling for oil off Alaska after years spent securing permits.Mr. Joyner noted that Shell’s cash flow in the quarter of $9.5 billion, excluding movements in working capital, was less than the combined $10.9 billion in capital investment and dividend distributions that it reported.The company said it had made $1.8 billion in asset sales during the period, which helped cover its capital costs.Shell said that it produced 3.1 million barrels a day of oil equivalent in the quarter. That was a 2 percent increase over the similar period in 2011.The company, which is one of the leading producers of natural gas, is looking for a way to participate in the giant new gas discoveries off East Africa. It recently dropped out of the bidding to acquire Cove Energy, a small British company that has a stake in a discovery off Mozambique.Shell is also working on what could be major investments in North American gas. The company, in partnership with Korea Gas, Mitsubishi Oil and PetroChina, is examining the feasibility of building a liquefied natural gas export plant near Kitimat, British Columbia. Shell has a 40 percent share of the project. In addition, Shell is studying the possibility of building major gas operations in the United States, where it is already a major investor.Shell is also well positioned in China, the other world-leading energy consumer along with the United States. On Wednesday the company announced an extension of its showcase China onshore gas joint venture, known as Changbei, with CNPC, China’s largest oil company.'"

"'12-07-28,'0','Having moved up in weight class since the Beijing Olympics, Nikpah is ranked 13th by the World Taekwondo Federation in the men’s 68-kilogram category, or 150 pounds.Nikpah was born two years before the Taliban took power in 1989. His family — ethnic Hazaras, a minority community that suffered discrimination under the Taliban — had to escape to Iran, where Nikpah grew up among fellow Afghan exiles and discovered taekwondo.His family returned to Afghanistan in 2004. At age 21 in Beijing, Nikpah not only competed in his first Olympics, he took home a medal. He is tall, fit and blessed with movie-star looks. Even his haircut is popular with young men eager to imitate their hero. For a nation synonymous with the destruction of war, he is a welcome face of a new Afghanistan.“We are the young generation and can introduce our country to the world through the sports,” he said one morning at the Kabul home he shares with his family, a gift from President Hamid Karzai for his showing in Beijing.Expectations are high in London. “He will definitely medal,” said Usman Dildar, an Afghan member of the London Organizing Committee who runs a large taekwondo studio in London. “What color? Inshallah, we’re hoping for gold.”Nikpah’s celebrity aside, the Munir Ahmad Taekwondo Association Club in Kabul seems spartan compared with the facilities used by most Olympic athletes. Gym equipment lies at one end of a rectangular room. With a military precision, Nikpah kicked, struck and blocked across the interlocking red and blue floor mats as his coach, Mohammed Bashir Tareki, looked on.The Afghan National Olympic Committee pays its athletes about $21 a month. Nikpah runs an electronics business with two partners to make ends meet.“We don’t have enough facilities to do the training in our country,” he said. “I just use what we have.”Despite the lack of resources, taekwondo has blossomed in Afghanistan, partly because of Nikpah’s stardom, and also because of the popularity of the sport in neighboring Iran, which has about 4,000 taekwondo gyms. Today in Afghanistan, about 500 clubs are active. Taekwondo is a key way to provide young Afghans with options outside of the criminal world, said Mirwais Bahawi, acting secretary general of the Afghanistan Taekwondo Foundation.In Nikpah’s lifetime, Afghanistan has hardly figured at the Olympics. It sent just two athletes to Atlanta in 1996, during Taliban rule, before the International Olympic Committee expelled it in 1999 because of its treatment of women. Afghan athletes returned to the Games in Athens in 2004 with a team of five, including two women. In Beijing, Nikpah was one of four Afghan athletes.“We can’t provide everything they want right now,” Bahawi said. “And they are not always thinking about the things we don’t have.”The taekwondo foundation has received training and equipment from its counterpart in South Korea, the birthplace of the sport. In late May, Nikpah traveled there for training before heading to London this month.The day before he left for South Korea, Nikpah was on a Kabul sidewalk outside a supermarket. Passers-by recognized him, offering smiles and pats on the back. Two women, clad in blue burqas, approached him politely. He basked in their attention with a delighted smile, and put a hand over his heart in the traditional gesture of thanks and respect.Does he feel pressure not to let his compatriots down? “Yes, of course, I feel 100 percent responsible for the people,” he said. “It’s the support of the people who give me energy, and I hope to make them happy.”'"

"'12-07-28,'0','BEIJING — A Chinese appeals court on Friday threw out a fraud conviction against a human rights activist who has fought on behalf of people evicted from their homes, but it upheld a separate conviction against her for causing a disturbance, her lawyers said.A lower court had ruled that the activist, Ni Yulan, and her husband, Dong Jiqin, acted in an unruly way when they failed to pay for their stay at a hotel — where they had been detained by the police — and mistreated staff members. It also ruled that Ms. Ni had received money through deceit.One of her lawyers, Cheng Hai, said the higher court, the Beijing First Intermediate Court, had rescinded the fraud conviction and reduced Ms. Ni’s prison sentence by two months to two years and six months after the person who gave Ms. Ni the money told the court it was a donation.“We consider it a success,” said Dong Qianyong, another lawyer for Ms. Ni.Public disturbance convictions against the couple remain, and Dong Jiqin’s two-year sentence handed down by the lower court stands, Mr. Cheng said.Mr. Cheng said he planned to appeal again for Ms. Ni’s release.Ms. Ni, who received a law degree from the China University of Political Science and Law, is not as well known internationally as some Chinese dissidents, but she has been the target of “sustained police persecution” for the past decade, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, an organization based in Hong Kong.She had been jailed twice before, first in 2002 and again in 2008 for “obstructing official business” when she tried to use her legal expertise to help neighbors in the capital’s Xicheng district who were fighting eviction. During her detention in 2002, she said, she was kicked and beaten for 15 hours, leaving her unable to walk. She now uses a wheelchair.Ms. Ni and her supporters say she is being punished for her years of activism, especially her advocacy on behalf of people forced from their homes to make way for the real estate developments that remade Beijing for the 2008 Olympics.In early 2011, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., then the American ambassador to China, visited Ms. Ni to show support for her. After her earlier sentencing this year, the current American ambassador, Gary Locke, urged Beijing to release her.'"

"'12-07-28,'0','“Apple doesn’t have to own a social network,” , Apple’s chief executive, said at a recent technology conference. “But does Apple need to be social? Yes.”Twitter and Apple have already been working together. Recently, Apple has tightly sewn Twitter features into its software for phones, tablets and computers, while, behind the scenes, Twitter has put more resources into managing its relationship with Apple.Though an investment in Twitter would not be a big financial move for Apple by any stretch — it has $117 billion in liquid investments, and it quietly agreed to buy a mobile security company for $356 million on Friday — it would be one of Mr. Cook’s most important strategic decisions as chief executive. And it would be an uncommon arrangement for Apple, which tends to buy small start-ups that are then absorbed into the company.But such a deal would give Apple more access to Twitter’s deep understanding of the social Web, and pave the way for closer Twitter integration into Apple’s products.Twitter has grown quickly, amassing more than 140 million monthly active users who generate a vast stream of short messages about their lives, the news and everything else. An Apple investment would give it the glow of a close relationship with a technology icon, and would instantly bolster its valuation, which, like that of other start-ups, has languished in the wake of Facebook’s lackluster market debut. In fact, word of the talks comes at a time when some are asking whether expectations for the potential of social media companies have gotten out of hand, and shares of Facebook, and other companies have wilted.But Twitter does not need Apple’s cash. Earlier this year, Dick Costolo, Twitter’s chief executive, said the company had “truckloads of money in the bank.”The truckloads, according to people familiar with the matter, add up to more than $600 million in cash on hand. This comes from the $1 billion in financing it has raised over the years and, more recently, from a healthy flow of advertising revenue.Regardless, Twitter is widely expected to pursue a public offering within the next couple of years, whether or not it agrees to deals with investors like Apple.Apple and Twitter are logical partners in some ways. Unlike Facebook or Google, Twitter has no plans to compete with Apple in the phone business or elsewhere. And as Apple has found, social is just not in its DNA.“Those guys are a great partner,” Mr. Costolo said of Apple in a recent interview. “We think of them as a company that our company looks up to.” Mr. Costolo would not discuss any potential investments or anything else related to the company’s relationship with Apple.Spokesmen for both Apple and Twitter said on Friday that their companies did not comment on rumors.If an investment were to happen, Twitter’s chief financial officer, Ali Rowghani, would be instrumental in cementing the deal. Mr. Rowghani joined Twitter in early 2010 after nine years at Pixar Animation Studios, where he worked directly with , Apple’s co-founder.Ties between Apple and Twitter are strengthening at a time of great uncertainty in the mobile market. Battle lines that seemed clear just a year ago are rapidly blurring as companies push into new areas of the market and clash with former allies.Facebook, the world’s largest social network, is said to be working on developing its own phone or core software for phones. Similarly, Google acquired Motorola Mobility last year and is now in the business of building phones.The jumbled landscape reflects the rising significance of mobile, as more consumers neglect their desktops in favor of computing that fits in their pockets. Eager to win on such a critical battleground, technology giants are rushing to control both hardware and software on mobile devices.The turf wars have fortified alliances and pushed companies to choose sides. Apple’s dealings with Twitter, for instance, began after its relationship with Facebook soured. In 2010, the company was eager to integrate its Ping service with Facebook, but discussions broke down. Mr. Jobs, the Apple chief executive who died last year, told the technology news site AllThingsD that Facebook had demanded “onerous terms that we could not agree to.”Apple, which had spent months preparing to hook Facebook into iOS, its mobile operating system, swiftly reworked it for Twitter. One former Twitter employee, who described Twitter as the “lucky mistress” in this chain of events, said the partnership was essentially “handed to Twitter on a silver platter.” Ping, in the end, never caught on with users.For Twitter, the union has proved fruitful. The mobile integration, introduced in late 2011, made it easy for and users to sling photos, maps and other media directly to Twitter. So far they have generated some 10 billion tweets. And, in recent months, Apple has also incorporated Twitter features into its operating system for computers as well as its advertising service.The relationship with Apple is so prized at Twitter that the company assigned a vice president, Kevin Thau, to work with Apple full time, according to an Apple employee who asked not to be named.Apple’s relationship with Facebook has started to thaw. Last month, the company said it would add Facebook features to the next version of its mobile operating system. Still, the two companies are wary of each other. Facebook, which recently began its own “App Center” and is intent on bulking up its mobile revenue, is likely to continue to bump up against Apple.Analysts are concerned that Apple may fall behind in mobile software because of increasing competition and a lack of social features. And as Apple has shown, software and content can make or break hardware sales.“Content was a key pillar in the success of the iPhone,” said Al Hilwa, an analyst at IDC. He noted that consumer loyalty to the iTunes library, which many used to store their music collections, helped lift early sales of the phone. “Down the road, social engagement may dictate how consumers spend,” Mr. Hilwa said.'"
"'12-07-28,'0','“For future deals that are pitched as social deals,” he explained, “they’re not going to pay up. The multiples are going to be far, far lower.”The issues facing each tumbling company are slightly different. But they all have the problem of selling something — imaginary tractors, Internet films, discount deals or, in Facebook’s case, someone “liking” a product — that is not quite real and perhaps less than essential.“The gleam has come off the word ‘social,’ ” said Ben Schachter, an Internet analyst with the Macquarie Group. “The ground is now shifting underneath these companies’ feet at a speed that we didn’t see even in the late 1990s.”Groupon and Netflix have been in the investor doghouse for a while, while with Facebook there seems simple regret that its grandest ambitions might not be reached (“The jury is in: Facebook is not and will not be a second ,” the research group IDC said).With Zynga, however, there was a sudden sense that building a blue-chip business from virtual goods might be virtually impossible.“Shocking,” Mr. Schachter wrote in his report after Zynga revealed in its earnings report on Wednesday that it might make less than half of what it had hoped to earn this year from its more obsessive players who pay actual money for virtual goods like tractors — its only real source of income. Increasingly, gamers want to play on the run, and Zynga’s mobile games are not a runaway success.For all the pain that stockholders of Zynga and the other companies must feel, it is not yet March 2000, when all tech stocks went into free fall. The old-line companies, including Google, and Apple, are doing fine.But the questions about whether the chief executives and other early investors in some once-hot companies might have been a little too eager to cash in are already beginning, just as they did 12 years ago.Early investors in Facebook increased their participation in the public offering at the last minute by more than 80 million shares, netting them nearly a billion dollars more than the shares would have fetched Friday on the open market. ( , Facebook’s founder, was not among those increasing their allotment.) Zynga’s founder, Mark Pincus, sold 16 million shares in an unusual secondary offering four months after the December public offering. He and other executives got $12 a share in those more optimistic times, four times the price on Friday.Mr. Pincus was asked about those sales on Wednesday during the analyst conference call by the BTIG analyst Richard Greenfield. “I wanted to see whether he felt bad about it,” Mr. Greenfield said later. Mr. Pincus did not address the point.If investors were battered and Wall Street was alarmed, Silicon Valley was unfazed.The downward slide in public valuations would have an effect on private valuations, venture capitalists said, but it would be manageable.Some of the biggest venture capital firms have raised giant funds in recent months. New Enterprise Associates announced this week, for instance, that it raised $2.6 billion for its latest fund — the second largest in venture history. Valuations, particularly those at the later stage, have tightened a bit, but plenty of younger start-ups are still raising seed capital at lofty valuations.“Venture capitalists tend to think long term,” said Peter Barris, NEA managing general partner. “The daily ups and downs in the stock market you’ve got to take with a grain of salt when you’re looking at new investments and what they might be worth years from now.”One blessing and one problem with investing in tech companies is that the pace of their development has increased. A start-up’s initial sprint can be exciting, but it can also make it difficult to pinpoint when growth will start to decelerate. “Companies can grow into their markets faster than ever before but that means they can reach saturation faster than ever before,” said Roelof Botha, a partner at Sequoia Capital.Two years ago, Sequoia was approached by secondary market shareholders who wanted to sell Facebook shares at a $25 billion valuation. Sequoia declined because it doesn’t like being a passive shareholder and “we asked ourselves if we could generate a really healthy return for our investors and we couldn’t find the conviction,” Mr. Botha said. One concern was the slowdown of Facebook user growth in developed markets. That worry resurfaced again this week.In what has become a common refrain, many venture capitalists say Silicon Valley is rich with investment opportunities, because the world of 2012 is vastly different from the dot-com era. As the argument goes, it has never been easier to create a global start-up out of the box. The number of people connected to the Web is unprecedented. And so on.In other words, the bubble will not pop, because this time it is different.In an e-mail sent to founders last month, Paul Graham, the co-founder of Y Combinator, an influential start-up incubator, warned of possible headwinds. But Friday he said in effect not to worry — at least not yet.“It’s too early to notice any effect on valuations,” Mr. Graham said. “Personally though, I have a lot of confidence in Facebook. I expect this is just a random fluctuation.”'"

Turkey does not deny this tragedy. Our intention is to attain a just memory through an impartial and fair dialogue that will ultimately normalize Turkish-Armenian relations.As for the present, Mr. Akcam somehow misinterprets Turkey’s call for human rights, security and freedom across our region. He ignores the principled and values-based approach of the Turkish government since the inception of the events in the Arab world.Turkey has made every effort to help our neighbors meet the demands of their people regardless of their ethnic, religious or sectarian background. We have always emphasized that the Arab Spring will go nowhere if power should be yet again monopolized and the needs and expectations of minorities disregarded.Remember that at a time when the future developments in Egypt were still unclear, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in a public speech in Cairo, underlined the principle of secularism as central to a functioning democracy.'"
"'12-07-28,'0','A little rain fell, but it hardly mattered. Queen Elizabeth II was there, after co-starring with a tuxedoed Daniel Craig, also known as James Bond, in a witty video in which she appears to parachute from a helicopter (in fact, she entered the park the usual way). Looking mystified at times — the ceremony was pitched to a generation different from hers — she presided over a bevy of lesser royals and Prime Minister David Cameron.The first lady, Michelle Obama, was in the audience to cheer on the United States athletes, who, it must be said, did a lot of cheering for themselves anyway during the athletes’ procession. And Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, was there, too, although he was practically Public Enemy No. 1 around here after he appeared to question the British capacity for enthusiasm, something only Britons are allowed to do.One of the biggest secrets of the night — who would light the Olympic caldron — was revealed at the end of the 3-hour-45-minute show, when seven teenage athletes took over from the British rower Steve Redgrave, who carried the torch into the stadium.  The ceremony, conceived and directed by the filmmaker Danny Boyle, was two years in the making. As is the case almost every Olympics, much of the speculation around it centered on how Britain could possibly surpass the previous summer host, China. In 2008, Beijing used its awe-inspiring opening extravaganza to proclaim in no uncertain terms that it was here, it was rich, and the world better get used to it.But outdoing anyone else, particularly the new superpower China, was not the point for a country that can never hope to re-create the glory days of its empire. Mr. Cameron, the prime minister, said this week that London’s are “not a state-run Games — it is a people-run Games,” and Boris Johnson, the London mayor, noted sharply that Britain was not planning to “spend our defense budget” on “pyrotechnics” but would take pride in being “understated but confident.”That the Olympics come at a time of deep economic malaise, with Britain teetering on the edge of a double-dip recession, the government cutting billions of dollars from public spending, and Europe lurching from crisis to crisis, made the scene a bit surreal, even defiant in the face of so much adversity.The crowd in the stadium sat in a bubble of excitement. In the wider park, volunteers have been behaving with an enthusiasm that seems bewilderingly un-British. But out in the rest of the country, critics have been questioning the expense, the ubiquitously heavy-handed security apparatus, and the rampant commercialism of the Games.In The Guardian, the columnist Marina Hyde said government officials appeared to be rashly depending on the Olympics, which cost an estimated £9.3 billion (or $14.6 billion), to save the country’s struggling economy virtually single-handedly.Referring to a British track-and-field star, Ms. Hyde wrote that according to the government’s thinking, “Jessica Ennis winning gold is no longer merely a sporting aspiration but something that would cause a massive and immediate recalibration of the balance of payments.”The final cost, or benefit, of the Games will never really be known. But for now, the fact that things went smoothly on Friday was in itself a minor cause for celebration.Mr. Boyle said he did not want to seem extravagant, particularly in a time of economic trouble, as he was given the daunting task of trying to find a way for Britain to account for itself in this difficult moment in its long history. The country has always eagerly celebrated its past: its military victories, its kings and queens, its glorious cultural and intellectual achievements. But it has a harder time celebrating its present.A quixotic exercise in self-branding, during which the then-Labour government thought to unite the country by coming up with what it called a British “statement of values,” devolved into near-farce a few years ago when the public greeted it with ridicule rather than enthusiasm. The Times of London mischievously sponsored a motto-writing contest; the winner was “No Motto Please, We’re British.”The ceremony seemed to reflect that view, too, suggesting that the thing that is most British about the British is their anarchic spirit and their ability to laugh at themselves. It is hard to imagine, for instance, the Chinese including, as the British did, a clip of the comic actor Rowan Atkinson inserted into the opening scene from “Chariots of Fire,” shoving the other runners out of the way (and ending with a rude noise paying tribute to British lavatorial humor).The ceremony, too, reflected the deeply left-leaning sensibilities of Mr. Boyle. It pointedly included trade union members among a parade of people celebrating political agitators from the past, a parade that also included suffragists, Afro-Caribbean immigrants who fought for minority rights, and the Jarrow hunger marchers, who protested against unemployment in 1936.It would not be lost on Mr. Boyle that unions have suffered in Britain in recent years, particularly at the hands of the Conservative Party, led by Mr. Cameron. But he devised the ceremony, he said, with no political interference.That proved highly irritating to at least one politician, Aiden Burley, a Conservative member of Parliament, who denounced on Twitter what he referred to as the ceremony’s “leftie multicultural” content.“The most leftie opening ceremony I have ever seen — more than Beijing, the capital of a communist state!” he posted grumpily.Who knows how the country will feel when the Olympics are over? But when the British athletes entered the stadium at the end of the procession of countries, they did so to a recording of David Bowie, a quintessential British oddity and supreme self-reinventor. “We can be heroes,” the song goes, “just for one day.”'"
"'12-07-28,'0','Chevron said on Friday that profit fell 7 percent in the second quarter as oil prices weakened. The company also said that oil and gas output would fall short this year, but margins were strong for the smaller refining business.Like its larger rival Exxon Mobil, Chevron faced weak prices for natural gas. But Chevron is far less reliant on it, with just 5 percent of its reserves in North American gas, compared with 18 percent for Exxon.Profits at Exxon fell short of expectations on Thursday as oil and gas output sagged and its chemical unit faced weak margins.Chevron’s second-quarter oil and gas production fell to 2.62 million barrels of oil equivalent a day from 2.69 million barrels a day a year earlier. It also surprised investors by saying it would fall short of its 2012 target of 2.68 million barrels a day.George L. Kirkland, the vice chairman who also runs Chevron’s production arm, attributed that to a shutdown of its Frade field in Brazil after a spill there, third-quarter maintenance work at the 300,000-barrel-per-day Tengizchevroil plant in Kazakhstan and a delay to the start-up of its $10 billion Angola LNG project.'"

Third were Martin Fleisher, Mike Kamil, Zia Mahmood, Chip Martel, Michael Rosenberg and Chris Willenken.Usually when you play well, luck isn’t far behind. But sometimes a little luck will propel you into doing well. The diagramed deal came from the winning team’s first match on the last day.At the other table North opened one club, after which the auction cruised smoothly into the laydown six-club contract.The given auction was by Diamond (South) and Moss (North), who were not an experienced partnership. One diamond indicated 11 to 15 points with at least a doubleton diamond. (One club would have promised 16-plus points.) Four diamonds was Roman Key Card Blackwood for clubs, the reply showing two key cards (two aces, or one ace and the trump king) and the trump queen.However, after South signed off in six clubs, East gambled with a lead-directing double for diamonds, the first suit bid by the dummy. Now South, thinking there was a likelihood of a diamond ruff, converted to six no-trump.Here, though, there were only 11 top tricks: two spades, two hearts, two diamonds and five clubs. But the defense was not easy. When West led the diamond ten, East had to play low, letting South take the trick. And if declarer crossed to dummy and led the second diamond, East had to play low again to defeat the slam.'"
"'12-07-28,'0','“Who says women are not capable of changing the world?” With those words, Diao Chan, a beautiful young courtesan and the central character of “Feng Yi Ting,” a 2004 opera by the Chinese composer Guo Wenjing, steels herself to her fate. Embroiled in the machinations of her godfather — a minister unseen during the opera, who plots to topple a corrupt regime in the Han court of China about A.D. 220 — Diao accepts the role of seductress, pitting the ruthless warlord Dong Zhuo against his godson, the ambitious Gen. Lu Bu.That Diao is as much a complicit accomplice as a means to an end becomes clear soon enough during “Feng Yi Ting,” which was presented in its New York premiere at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater on Thursday evening, as part of the Lincoln Center Festival. Cajoling Lu to kill Dong as a matter of personal vengeance, Diao sings, “I would rather be a broken piece of jade than an intact clay tile.” (The tale, derived from one of China’s great classical novels, is based on historical sources, although Diao may have been a fictional invention.)Still, Diao, onstage for most of the work’s 45-minute duration, unquestionably is a heroine of a sort. And the work done by Shen Tiemei, the distinguished and striking Sichuan soprano who portrayed Diao during the opera’s premiere at the Spoleto Festival USA in June, and again here, is nothing if not heroic.In his beguiling score Mr. Guo deftly fuses Chinese and Western classical styles. The distinctive sounds of four Chinese instruments — pipa (a lute), dizi (a flute), erhu (a fiddle) and sheng (a mouth organ) — blend with those of a Western chamber group: here, the Ensemble ACJW, potently conducted by Ken Lam. Much of the instrumental music rises and falls in singing cadences; more than once, though, Mr. Guo shows off an impressive assimilation of film-noir moodiness and jazzy swing.Ms. Shen sings in the traditional pinched, nasal style of Chinese opera, her voice rising and falling with an oboe’s penetrating tone and an erhu’s haunting slur. Physically, she embodies Diao in a perfectly pitched balance of archetypal gesture and relatable characterization. Jiang Qihu, the countertenor who portrays Lu in his few, brief scenes, is more a clarinet; a rounder warble and less pointed projection make his character’s agitation credible.The production, by the director Atom Egoyan and the scenic designer Derek McLane, provides an ingenious and resplendent complement to Mr. Guo’s fusion. Video designed by Tsang Kin-Wah, projected on a rear scrim, shows the characters in oversize detail and at angles invisible on the stage. The resourceful use of miniatures and lighting make for striking processions of shadowy figures.'"
"'12-07-28,'0','Negotiators at the United Nations failed to meet a Friday deadline to complete a new treaty aimed at regulating the estimated $60 billion global arms trade business, as major weapons exporting nations, including the United States, said more time was needed to finalize an agreement.The negotiators adjourned after having met for the past four weeks with the goal of completing an agreement that proponents said would have severely restricted the cross-border flow of weapons and ammunition that has helped to fuel armed conflicts and mass killings around the world. Approval by all 193 members of the United Nations was required.“There is no consensus and the meeting is over,” said Ewen Buchanan, a spokesman for the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs, which sponsored the negotiation conference on the treaty.Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who had beseeched the members to reach an agreement, said in a statement, “The conference’s inability to conclude its work on this much-awaited A.T.T., despite years of effort of member states and civil society from many countries, is a setback.” He was referring to the official name of the pact, the Arms Trade Treaty. Diplomats said the next step was likely to be further negotiations and a vote at the next session of the United Nations General Assembly in a couple of months.Treaty supporters, led by activist groups such as Amnesty International and Oxfam America, expressed anger at the failure after early bouts of optimism that a draft of the treaty circulated this week would satisfy American concerns, notably its possible infringement on the Second Amendment right to bear arms — an especially delicate issue during a presidential election year in the United States.'"

They fired into the air during the rescue but more as a show of force to intimidate the jihadists, rather than as part of a firefight, he said.Both journalists were escorted back across the border to Turkey.Mr. Oerlemans is a freelancer with the British agency Panos Pictures.

His relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, which dates to their days as young consultants in Boston, is being scrutinized for signs of warmth or cooling, and everything said — and unsaid — will be carefully parsed.The fund-raiser may be an especially delicate situation for Mr. Romney because of the attendance of Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate who has pledged to spend some $100 million this election to help defeat President Obama, as well as elect Republicans. Though Mr. Adelson first supported Newt Gingrich during the early nominating contests because of his strong support for Israel, he has since thrown his support behind Mr. Romney. Mr. Adelson and his wife recently gave $5 million to a pro-Romney “super PAC.”Mr. Romney seems to be taking pains to keep the fund-raiser under wraps. Typically, a small pool of reporters is allowed into fund-raisers held in public locations, in order to provide a written report on Mr. Romney’s remarks. Though there have been a few occasions when the campaign has tried to limit access — citing an especially small venue or the fact that Mr. Romney was not giving formal remarks — this is the first time that a public fund-raiser has been closed without any explanation.'"

"'12-07-29,'0','Francona accomplished a lot with those players, and respected and trusted them so much that it may have cost him his job. You wonder if Valentine will have the same chance to establish his identity.His team is 36-27 in all games not started by Josh Beckett or Jon Lester. If you knew that before the season — and knew nothing else — you would expect the Red Sox to be well above .500. Yet they are 14-24 in the Beckett and Lester starts. The aces have been anything but.Lester lugged a 5.46 earned run average into Saturday after allowing 11 earned runs in his previous start. No Boston pitcher had surrendered that many since Doug Bird in 1983. When asked Saturday why Lester, a two-time All-Star, has been so different this season, Valentine tried sarcasm.“Got to be the manager he’s pitching for,” he said, and then explained that Lester was feeling so strong that he was trying too hard to overpower hitters.Lester was better Saturday, allowing four runs and four hits in six innings. Two runs came on a homer by Jayson Nix, just over the fence in right.“Getting the ball down, locating, all the things I’ve been preaching all along, just making those adjustments, and it carried through the whole game,” Lester said. “I gave up four hits — pretty happy with that. Fly ball to right that’s a homer, that’s kind of the nature of the beast here, playing at Yankee Stadium. I’m real, real pleased with how I threw the ball.”Crawford watched it all from the dugout, despite his strong career numbers against C. C. Sabathia (22 for 69, or .319) and those cozy dimensions in right. Valentine mentioned both factors before the game.“That’s a tough decision,” he said. “That’s why I get paid the big bucks.”What Valentine meant was that sitting Crawford was a decision made above him. He recently started Crawford six games in a row, but heard about it from his bosses.“I did a manager no-no thing,” Valentine said. “I went against what I was told to do. Never to be done again.”A reporter told Valentine he did not seem wild about the idea.“Yeah, I’m wild,” Valentine said. He chirped a bit — he’s wild, see? — and continued: “I’d like to have Carl every day. I’d like to have all my good players every day. But I understand the situation better now than I did then.”Valentine said Crawford was not supposed to play more than four days in a row. With opposing right-handers lined up for the next four days, Valentine said, Saturday was Crawford’s time to rest.This is what happens when a manager has little job security and a team fools itself into thinking it might make a playoff push. The Red Sox need to give themselves the best chance to win — every day — if they hope to make a serious run down the stretch. Valentine knows that, and probably senses his job may depend on it. Yet Crawford was benched.General Manager Ben Cherington did not sign Crawford; his predecessor, Theo Epstein, pushed for that $142 million investment. But he needs to let Valentine use Crawford the way he wants, or let Crawford get reconstructive surgery.Not playing, Crawford said, is “more embarrassing than anything,” because he wants to keep going until his elbow gives out. To Crawford, it is only a matter of time. After missing the first half of the season, he said, the elbow hurts every day he plays.Crawford said his doctor had told him he needed an operation, which he said would sideline him for six months. By that timetable, Crawford would be ready for the start of spring training if he has the procedure now.“The later I wait to get it done, the more time I’m going to miss,” Crawford said, adding later, “I can’t keep playing with the ligament in my elbow like that.”In time, Valentine said, Crawford will build his pain tolerance and play every day. That is the program, anyway, whether Valentine believes in it or not.'"
"'12-07-29,'0','Some strategists say this could be an early sign of the market’s gradual shift back toward big stocks after years of favoring small-company and even international equities.“Large caps may finally be having their day in the sun,” said Jack A. Ablin, chief investment officer at Harris Private Bank.Mr. Ablin added that while equities are still slogging through a rough patch, a number of factors are weighing in the favor of large-cap stocks in general right now. “One is their stability,” he said, “but there’s also their dividends.”The 50 megacap stocks, most of which pay dividends, have an average yield of 2.2 percent, which compares favorably with the 1.6 percent average payout of small-company stocks and the 1.5 percent yield on 10-year Treasury notes.The recent turmoil in Europe may be indirectly helping the megacaps in other ways. For starters, as global investors have been fleeing the euro, they’ve been driving money into dollar-denominated assets like Treasuries. That has bolstered the value of the dollar, which is up 13 percent since April 2011.“Basically, people have been looking to escape Europe, and those who want to keep their money in equities are probably seeking the safer shores of megacaps in the United States,” said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at S.& P. Capital IQ.The strengthening dollar has also focused American investors’ attention back on the domestic market. When the dollar was falling for much of the last decade, Americans could make money on their foreign investments simply through the currency fluctuation.From January 2002 to April 2011, the dollar lost 39 percent of its value against a basket of foreign currencies. During that stretch, European stocks sank 6.5 percent when measured in the local currency. But because of the sinking dollar, Americans actually saw their European shares soar 61 percent.Now that the dollar has reversed course and is gaining ground, American investors have less desire to invest abroad and more reason to keep their money in domestic shares.But aren’t megacap stocks also exposed to foreign markets?Yes. The average large company generates more than 46 percent of its revenue abroad, versus just 31 percent for small companies, according to S.& P.Yet megacaps have generally done well anyway. “Bigger businesses, in particular since the financial crisis, have clearly proven to be more adaptable than a lot of people thought,” said Keith Trauner, co-portfolio manager of the GoodHaven Fund, which invests in a mix of big and small stocks. “They’ve been able to reduce costs and adjust their expense structure better than most people would have imagined.”Mr. Trauner’s fund has beaten 75 percent of its peers in the last year, thanks in part to big stakes in megacaps like Microsoft and Wal-Mart. He added that some investors were probably still overlooking this group because many megacaps were “dead money” for more than a decade.From 2000 through 2010, for instance, Microsoft lost 4.6 percent while Wal-Mart sank 1 percent, both annualized.Wallace Weitz, president of the Weitz Funds, said, “I’ve been doing this for more than 40 years, yet it still surprises me that people look away from good companies because they ‘haven’t done anything’ for a long time.”That’s exactly where value-minded investors ought to be looking for attractively priced shares, he said.MEGACAP stocks, which in 2000 had a frothy price-to-earnings ratio of 33, are now trading at 13 times estimated earnings. By comparison, shares of medium-size companies have an average P/E ratio of 16, while the figure for small companies is nearly 20.“It’s a question of what risk you want to take,” said Pat W. Dorsey, president and director of research and strategy at Sanibel Captiva Investment Advisers. Investors fearful of stocks with any European exposure may be wary of megacaps. But in such times, skittish investors are also prone to punish stocks with high P/E ratios.Mr. Dorsey says many megacap are cheaply priced — and they appeal to him. “I would prefer to take less valuation risk,” he said.'"
"'12-07-29,'0','I have been thinking about such matters lately because of the comedian Sarah Silverman’s remark on a TV talk show that she didn’t want to have a child of her own and preferred to adopt for fear of passing on her depression. Much as I sympathize with Ms. Silverman’s trepidations (assuming they were meant to be taken seriously), I think they suggest the undue influence we assign to genetic determinability. This is a fairly recent phenomenon, one that can be accounted for by the latest pendulum swing in the nature versus nurture debate.The 1950s and ’60s saw a consuming belief in the importance of environmental factors in the shaping of personality; this led to such handy but reductive concepts as the “schizophrenogenic” mother and Bruno Bettelheim’s theory that withholding mothers caused autism. Now, with greater knowledge of how our brains work, we live under the tyranny of the biological. Where once we feared the input of our own unwitting selves, we now fear the imprint of our chemically ordained destinies.So how heritable is depression? There is no single genetic marker for it; current research shows that multiple genes probably contribute simultaneously to its chances of being transmitted. Research is hard in this area because we can’t perform the perfect experiment — separating identical twins at birth and raising them in different homes to see which get depressed and which don’t. Scientists can, however, compare identical twins (conceived from the same egg and sperm) with fraternal twins (conceived from different eggs and sperm) and see how they differ. Such twin studies have recently concluded that the heritability of depression is about 40 percent.This may sound fairly high, until you realize that heritability refers only to an underlying risk of depression, not to depression itself. “It’s not Mendelian genetics,” observes Dr. Andres San Martin, a New York City psychopharmacologist. “Causality is a result of interaction,” he asserts, shaped by “multiple factors on multiple levels.”Probably the most basic error we make is in trying to frame the puzzle of how human character evolves in stark oppositional terms — nature or nurture — rather than seeing it as an inextricable mix of things. Dr. Robert Klitzman, a professor of clinical psychiatry and director of the master’s program in bioethics at Columbia University, observes that “people misunderstand genetics.” “They want to read genetic tests as black and white,” he adds. “Doctors see it much more like predicting the weather.”Dr. Klitzman points out that people find genes a handy receptacle for blame in what he calls a high-stakes “responsibility game.” We want to know, in other words, if it’s our fault or not our fault — or perhaps our mother’s fault. If it’s your genes, you’re not culpable, and what a relief that is. When Prozac emerged, the biological notion of depression gained traction and the stigma about the disease correspondingly went down. So there are lots of incentives to link psychological disorders to genetic factors, even if it means overstating or blurring reality.Though science has made rapid advances in the culling of genetic information, it is rare for a common disease to be attributable to one gene; Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia are among the few examples. In other instances, even when a gene has been isolated (as is the case with Alzheimer’s), the gene doesn’t begin to account for all cases of those diseases. You can have the mutation and not get the disease, or get it and not have the mutation. It’s all in the intertwining of nature and nurture. Researchers, for example, have reported that the combination of the monoamine oxidase A gene, dubbed “the warrior gene,” and a background of childhood abuse may help explain instances of aggressiveness and antisocial behavior.Biology is not destiny: a child born of any parent (depressed or not depressed), has about a 16.5 percent (one in six) chance of experiencing a depressive episode during his or her lifetime. Depression is not a single phenomenon, which makes it all the more difficult to figure out the cause.What’s clear is that for most people, depression appears to be more a result of environment and experience than of one’s inherent nature, which means that “upbringing,” to use an old-fashioned word, still matters. If you do things halfway right and there are no unforeseen traumatic occurrences, like crucial losses or undue stresses, chances are good — better than 50-50 — that the child of a depressed parent will grow up to be a nondepressed adult. That statistic would never persuade me to opt out of the experience of bringing a child of my own into the world. If anything, Zoë has been more of an antidepressant than the best cocktail of meds that I’ve been offered.Until more compelling genetic information becomes available, it seems that the best we can do is to keep our children’s predispositions in mind while focusing on the pieces of the developmental puzzle over which we can exert control. (This includes being attuned to your child’s nature, especially when it differs from your own.)Betwixt my lurches into the dark, I gave my daughter a lot of love, which my own parents weren’t capable of doing (a fact I take to be at the root of my own depression, given that neither of them was depressed). These days, Zoë’s no longer the bright-eyed early riser she was as an infant, and she’s got her share of problems, just like the rest of us. But, so far a lifelong case of the blues does not appear to be one of them.'"

"'12-07-29,'0','“Look, Dad! I just counted! I have 49 mosquito bites on my forehead alone!”This trip, even more than most backpacking slogs, was a reminder that we humans are mere bricks in a vast natural cathedral. As we tumbled in snow pits, as rain fell on us, we mused that we’re not landlords of our planet, or even its prime tenants. We’re just guests.In short, the wilderness humbled us, and that’s why it is indispensable.In our modern society, we have structured the world to obey us; we can often use a keyboard or remote to alter our surroundings. Yet all this gadgetry focused on our comfort doesn’t always leave us more content or grounded. It is striking how often people who are feeling bewildered or troubled seek remedy in the wilderness. That’s the point of the best-selling new book “Wild,” by Cheryl Strayed, about how she escaped from heroin and grief over her mother’s death by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.“Wild” is a terrific yarn, opening with a moment in which Strayed loses one precious hiking boot over a precipice — and then angrily hurls the other after it. Over time, the forests tame her, providing free therapy and the setting for her maturation. Strayed’s book has been successful, largely by word of mouth, partly because it reflects a truth we recognize.For decades, youth programs have found benefit in sending troubled adolescents to drink from wilderness streams and lap up truths about themselves. Outward Bound takes a similar path, for everyone from at-risk kids to returning veterans to corporate executives.Perhaps wilderness is an antidote to our postindustrial self-absorption. It’s a place to be deflated, humbled and awed all at once. It’s a window into a world larger than ourselves, one that doesn’t respond to a remote. It’s an Olympiad for all of us.Yet, increasingly, it’s for only a tiny minority of us. Getting lost in the wild used to be routine for generations raised on hunting and fishing, yet those pastimes are becoming less common. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service reports that the number of Americans who fish dropped by 15 percent between 1996 and 2006. In that same period, the number of hunters dropped by just over 10 percent.Likewise, the number of backcountry campers in our national parks has fallen by nearly 30 percent since 1979.Look, trudging uphill through mosquito swarms isn’t for everyone. But unplugging long enough to encounter nature is less scary and more fortifying than people may expect. My daughter and I were never in any danger and eventually muddled through all 200 miles of our hike. After 10 exhausting, exhilarating days, we emerged from the woods — and my daughter was promptly telling her brothers tales of snow and misadventure that had them yearning for frostbite.To guarantee wilderness in the long run, we first need to ensure a constituency for it. Environmentalists focus on preserving wilderness, because that’s the immediate priority, but they perhaps should be as energetic at getting young people to interact with it. We need more Americans working through their challenges, like Cheryl Strayed, by hurling boots off precipices. We need more schools and universities to offer classes on the wild, in the wild — with extra credit for students who get lost.'"
"'12-07-29,'0','No one has chased Phelps more doggedly than Lochte, who, after losing to him in both individual medleys in Beijing, spent the next four years decreasing his sugar and fat intake and just as drastically increasing his mileage in the pool and his muscle.As Lochte moved to catch and pass Phelps, Phelps hardly committed to intense training in the two years after his performance in Beijing. Such a career turn was not only predictable but also the main argument people made in trying to persuade him to retire after his historic romp in 2008. What other mountain could Phelps find the motivation to climb?He had the hubris to believe that he could freeze the clock, especially in the 400 I.M., an event in which he had not competed in an international final since Beijing.The events that Phelps swims are among the hardest, and with every passing year, his body’s rebellion grew harder to ignore. He has spoken of not recovering as well between sets, workouts, seasons. Mark Spitz was 22 when he retired, and it was not coincidence that many of the top swimmers throughout history left the sport well before they approached their 30s. It is hard physically, mentally and emotionally to remain buoyant.Phelps’s London Games debut — the first of seven events he is expected to compete in here — was his worst showing in an Olympic final since a fifth-place finish in the 200 butterfly at the Sydney Games in 2000. He was 15 years old then, and so callow he forgot to tie his suit before one of his races. When Phelps spoke last week of wanting to recapture his teenage self from those Games, he meant the fun, not the finish.Phelps, 27, entered Saturday night’s final at the London Aquatics Centre as the most seasoned competitor in the history of the event. The owner of the world record since August 2002, he was the two-time defending Olympic champion. With a victory, Phelps would have become the first male swimmer to win an event in three consecutive Olympics.But he is not out of chances. He is also the two-time defending champion in the 200-meter individual medley — a race in which he will again face Lochte — as well as the 100-meter butterfly and the 200-meter butterfly.From the opening butterfly leg on Saturday, Phelps could not keep pace with Lochte, his decade-long rival, an ominous sign given that Phelps is the fastest butterfly swimmer in history. And in the final 100 he failed to catch two other swimmers: Thiago Pereira, who finished second to give Brazil its first medal in the event since 1984, and Kosuke Hagino, the top qualifier for the final, who was trying to become Japan’s first Olympic champion in the event.That Phelps lost to athletes from countries with no recent history of success in the event is further evidence of his ripple effect. On his way to becoming the greatest swimmer ever, Phelps became the current that has carried all swimmers further than they once believed possible.Phelps’s performance blindsided his longtime coach, Bob Bowman, who did not see it coming even after Phelps barely made the final in eighth place, with a swim that was over four seconds slower than his preliminary result in Beijing.“I expected in the 4:06, 4:07 range,” Bowman said of Phelps, who was clocked in 4 minutes 9.28 seconds, well off the 4:03.84 he recorded in the 2008 Olympic final. Lochte’s winning time was 4:05.18, a personal best.After pulling himself out of the water, Phelps walked across the deck without looking back. “It’s frustrating,” he said during a short interview with reporters. “I was under 4:10 twice in the last month and a half.” He added: “It’s pretty upsetting. I think the biggest thing now is trying to get past this and move forward.”When the results on the scoreboard became final, Lochte did not beat his breast, let loose a primal scream or raise his arms like a heavyweight after delivering the knockout punch. “I think I’m in kind of shock,” he said. Ninety minutes later, the wonder had not been wiped from his face.He had taken off the white baseball cap that he put on immediately after his race. Lochte, who turns 28 on Friday, said it was an early birthday gift from his younger brother Devon.Some people were quick to read into Phelps’s failure to congratulate Lochte in the water or on the deck and quicker to point out that he never mentioned Lochte’s victory in his postrace comments. If Phelps was being less than gracious, Lochte was not aware of it. He said Phelps approached him in the warm-down area and congratulated him on keeping alive the United States’ winning streak in the event. The last time a non-American won the men’s 400 individual medley was 1992, when Lochte was turning 8.“A lot of people say Michael is inhuman,” Lochte said. “But you know what? He’s just like all of us. He just trains harder, and he knows how to win. That’s what you have to learn.”'"
"'12-07-29,'0','Mr. Umanov added: “When we had to announce that we played some other camp and we lost, everyone would cheer. They had Sunday town meetings, where you had 150 9- to 15-year-olds, and some kind of big issue would be put up for debate or just discussion, like gay rights or the death penalty.”Given their upbringings, fitting in at Camp Thoreau wasn’t difficult for either child. Ms. Mitchell-Marell described her parents, Patricia J. Mitchell and David M. Marell of Glenford, N.Y., as sophisticated and “back-to-the-land hippies” who had spent time together on a commune before establishing the family home near Woodstock, N.Y.Mr. Umanov, an only child, was raised in Lower Manhattan by his parents, Barbara A. Kleiner and Matt D. Umanov, and spent part of his youth working and hanging out at his father’s Bleecker Street guitar shop, where he met Patti Smith and Richard Gere.That night at Botanica, Ms. Mitchell-Marell recalled, she had been won over by what she described as Mr. Umanov’s “chill, shy, sweet, laid-back” demeanor and by what she considered to be a rarity of rarities among men: he knew how to listen and asked questions in a “very sensitive and aware way.”He found her playful sense of humor endearing. Instead of saying “that’s amazing,” she might substitute a made-up word and say something like, “that’s amazo,” or say “radicchio” for “ridiculous.” (To describe something as delicious, she might say it “suffers from phenomonitis.”)They didn’t exchange a kiss that first evening, but he got her phone number. A day or two later, he called and invited her to dinner at Frankie’s 457, a restaurant in Brooklyn, where they hit it off again. It took seeing each other twice a week or so for a couple of months, however, for Mr. Umanov to reveal to Ms. Mitchell-Marell something he had hidden about himself, something he had privately worried might poison their budding romance: a devotion to heavy metal music.“When a lot of people think of metal, they think AC/DC, Guns N’ Roses,” said Mr. Umanov, who had played in a band called Oblivion while at the University of Michigan. There are different kinds of metal, he said, and some of it is “extreme and underground and brutal: guys screaming at the top of their lungs, and aggressive guitar and drums. Abrasive and fast stuff. So it’s not something you lead with on the first date.”“He sat me down and was like, ‘I have something to tell you,’ ” said Ms. Mitchell-Marell, who is partial to Aretha Franklin, Bob Dylan and Dolly Parton and regarded metal as a genre that had gone the way of giant shoulder pads and big hair. “Working on pure stereotype, I regarded heavy metal as ‘hard core.” It was the music of choice for people who were angry, hostile and outcasts.He had done well to hold back this piece of information; by the time they had that conversation, “I knew he wasn’t any of those things,” she said.Over the next two years, all was not perfect. She was feeling somewhat put off by Mr. Umanov’s schedule, which at the time included working as a Web project manager at Atlantic Records while simultaneously trying to get the two businesses in which he is now a partner —a blog about the heavy-metal genre and Blast Beat, a business in Brooklyn that sells advertising on heavy metal Web sites — off the ground.“I’m the kind of person who wants to hang out a lot,” said Ms. Mitchell-Marell, who is the undergraduate academic adviser for New York University’s politics and international relations department in Manhattan. “I’ve always had best friends and a sister. Not that I can’t be alone, but I love being in a twosome.”“She was expecting more than I was able or willing to give, because of work,” he said.To help resolve the rift, the couple called upon the communication skills that had been helped, in part, by the Sunday town meetings at camp. It was the idea of being respectful of the other person even in the midst of vehement disagreement.Mr. Umanov said he came to recognize that “a lot of it was me coming to terms with the fact that that’s how a real, loving, rewarding relationship is conducted. You put a lot of time toward it. And also Emily figuring out that it’s O.K. if Ben has his own space. It’s not a reflection of our relationship.”Once he got his businesses going, he quit Atlantic Records, which also meant that he could now work from home. In turn, she came to recognize that she didn’t need to be around him every single minute. She also knew that this relationship was solid, not like others she’d had, which she had walked away from. “We were a great couple 99 percent of the time,” she said.It also helped that they moved in together in 2010, sharing an apartment near the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, which at least initially sparked conversations about marriage. When those conversations became dormant, Ms. Mitchell-Marell said she was not terribly concerned. He was only 28, she reasoned.Then one December day in 2011, while walking near the canal, Mr. Umanov put the subject back on the front burner: he proposed.With that, Ms. Mitchell-Marell took charge of planning the wedding, making sure to create something that would closely reflect the couple’s sensibilities. “I always knew I wanted to be married in the backyard,” she said of the plan they presented to hold the event behind her parents’ house in Glenford, a green, semirural setting with stone walls and a small pond.The music was left to the Umanovs. “Ben’s dad picked the band,” Ms. Mitchell-Marell said, “and barbecue, because Ben likes barbecue, and the Whitesnake song for the metal friends.”Their ceremony on the evening of July 14 was led by Rabbi Jonathan Kligler, and took place under a wedding canopy. It included a star of David necklace that had belonged to the groom’s maternal grandmother, his maternal grandfather’s prayer shawl and a vest the bride’s paternal grandfather had worn when he immigrated to the United States from Eastern Europe.In homage to the hippy ethos fostered by Camp Thoreau, the bride and her sister were barefoot during the ceremony, as their 200 guests enjoyed the warm breeze that blew through the property. The group was then welcomed into a large reception tent nearby, where a live band played a set that mixed the Rolling Stones’ “Wild Horses” with Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5” and Whitesnake’s “Here I Go Again.”The couple’s parents and their friends mixed with the couple’s college and camp friends. There was also a small contingent of men from the heavy metal industry — musicians, guys who worked at record labels, Web masters of heavy metal sites — dressed in suits, thus making them inconspicuous.“I love the metal community,” Ms. Mitchell-Marell said. “They’ve been so welcoming to me. My first conceptions were misconceptions.”As the night progressed, 40 or so guests, about 10 of them Camp Thoreau veterans, according to the bride, shed their shoes and sat, chairs forming a circle within a circle around a campfire near the pond. Mr. Umanov’s steel-string Martin acoustic guitar materialized, and was passed around and played as the guests sang songs by The Band, Pink Floyd, Simon and Garfunkel and other tunes popular at camp.“It was cozy,” Ms. Mitchell-Marell said. “We were sitting close together, lounging on each other, and it brought back the spirit of camp. Especially if you live in New York, things like this never happen.”'"
"'12-07-29,'0','Having addressed Paul’s “crime of principle,” Trumbo follows Abbey’s novel closely: Burns gets locked up then busts himself and two Indians out of jail, heading for the hills on his coquettish horse, Whiskey. The film’s second half tracks Burns’s evasion of his pursuers and his encounter with a nemesis both inevitable and ludicrous. Trumbo shows a clear sense of location and landscape, including as his title page a hand-drawn map of the cowboy’s intended route, via the Sangre de Cristo and Manzano Mountains, into Mexico.Armed with a map, a great script, and a first-rate cast — he was playing Burns himself — Mr. Douglas seemingly had nothing to worry about. Yet on May 4, 1961, from the Western Skies Hotel in Albuquerque, with production already under way, he wrote a troubled letter. It was addressed to Mr. Gary Cooper, Beverly Hills.“Dear Coop,” he wrote. “When for years you’ve had affection for a guy and you find it suddenly turning to resentment, you begin to think it deserves some comment.” He went on to say, “Put yourself in my spot. I’m doing a picture that should have been done by only one guy. I know it — my entire company knows it. Start with the title — The Last Hero. Now whom does that fit — me? Hell, no!”Mr. Douglas complained to Cooper that his director, David Miller, was uncommunicative and focused on realism. The only direction Miller had given was, “try and play this the way Gary Cooper would.” Even worse had been Abbey’s arrival on set. Mr. Douglas reported that he’d driven to meet Abbey at the Albuquerque airport: “Fifty guys step off the plane but I spot him immediately — why? He looks like Gary Cooper. To make matters worse, when I meet him, he talks like Cooper!”For a moment it sounds as if Mr. Douglas the producer was angling for Cooper to take over the lead. But this was impossible. Cooper was terminally ill and would die nine days later. Certainly Mr. Douglas knew this when he wrote he wanted to follow in Cooper’s footsteps throughout the shoot: “I know now that at best I will come remotely close. But more important — I do know also that just trying to be you will make a better me.”Such heartfelt words acknowledged that outside help would not be forthcoming. It is the message of the film as well. Abbey’s presence looms over the film — both Burns and Paul contain aspects of his character — but did he really look like Cooper? To a certain extent. Did he really visit the set? Recalling Abbey after his death in 1989, Mr. Douglas wrote, “I never met Mr. Abbey, but we wrote to each other several times.”Which was it? Does it matter? Either way, the story of Abbey’s visit gave Mr. Douglas an opportunity to write a fan letter, and to prepare for a role he felt his mentor could have better played. As the pressmen conclude in “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,” the other great western made that year: If confronted with two conflicting versions, “print the legend.”Before the shoot Byrna put out a release emphasizing Miller’s realism: nonactors would be cast, a genuine painter would play Paul’s wife, the sets would showcase her work. It was all for naught: professional actors — Gena Rowlands, Walter Matthau, George Kennedy — were used instead. “The Brave Cowboy,” shot as “The Last Hero,” was released in 1962 as “Lonely Are the Brave” — elegantly photographed, theatrical rather than “natural,” exuberantly acted, deftly paced. There is no greater western, and certainly no more tragic one. Despite his doubts Mr. Douglas personified Burns, flouting cinematic rules by doing his own stunts and co-starring with an animal, a high spot of his career.It’s hard to imagine a film so radical, or so pessimistic, being made today. Though a Korean War hero, Burns refuses to carry ID or listen to reason. He disrespects the power company by cutting its barbed-wire fences; the county jail, by breaking out; the sheriff, whose manhunt he eludes; the military-industrial complex, whose helicopter he shoots down; and us, the viewers, who — when the lights go up or the DVD ends — return to a life played mainly by the rules. Remarkable for a low-budget western, “Lonely Are the Brave” poses uneasy questions about the idea, and value, of heroism. Do Paul’s principles justify abandoning his wife and child? Where does Burns’s extraordinary journey lead?'"
"'12-07-29,'0','I am the mother of two young boys. My nannies do the work that I know I could not do, since I work outside the home. What is important is the love and care my nannies give to my boys, as do the women in your article. If children cry and tug when their nannies leave (as mine do), that is exactly what a parent should want to see. I want my children to want their caregivers to stay. That is the only way I can leave. I could not imagine cutting my nannies from family pictures; they are as much members of our family as anyone related by blood.I once cared for a boy on the Upper East Side. My pale skin stood out in a sea of color on those park benches. I was told by one employer that she was grateful I was white. I smiled grimly, but inwardly I cringed. The photos show it all — the paucity of white skin, the missing surnames and the absence of a straight-on portrait of a single nanny. The pictures are about the women’s relation to their employers’ children. Domestic workers are employees, and should be treated with respect. Don’t expect “love.” This piece may make privileged women who hire out their parenting feel good, but without critical pieces of the whole picture, it’s a false reassurance.WHAT IS THE REAL MEANING OF ‘FANUTE’?I was thrilled to see my Rap Genius persona, SameOldShawn, appear in your article on misheard song lyrics. But Rap Genius does not, as you claim, assume that “every rap lyric has a meaning” that “should be unearthed.” The site strives only to annotate lyrics that would not be obvious to the casual listener. Our explanations include anecdotes of the tune’s creation, relationships to other songs, pop-culture or literary references, etc. This is why the site has attracted artists like Nas, RZA, A.G. and Jean Grae to annotate their own lyrics. Thanks for the mention — and don’t worry, we’re always here to correct the lyrics to “Ghetto Qu’ran” as well.My first impression of a story entitled “Why Can’t the Bronx Be Like Brooklyn?” is that it’s always worth thinking about people in the Bronx who don’t want it to be Brooklyn, and even people in Brooklyn who don’t like what they think Brooklyn is becoming. Beyond that, I think this is a problem of form. In journalism, if your neighborhood isn’t being populated with cool shops and young, single people, it’s a ghetto suffering from decades of societal neglect. If it actually is being populated by all the pretty people, it’s an enclave that we worry is losing its sense of identity. . . . The question of how different areas of a city develop or don’t is an interesting one. I just don’t like the assumption that everyone wants areas to develop the same way. A lot of us just want things like safety and decent schools not to be considered luxury goods.Please don’t gentrify the Bronx! We’re not yearning! There should be at least one affordable place to raise children in this great city of ours.Robert Moses couldn’t imagine that the very people he had consigned to the rubble of the burned-out South Bronx could have the vision, the ingenuity, the gumption and the persistence to rebuild. But that’s what happened and is continuing to happen. Grass-roots organizations like Nos Quedamos, Banana Kelly and the Mid Bronx Desperados resisted efforts to displace residents. . . . Other organizations, from the Bronx Clean Air Coalition to the Bronx Council for Environmental Quality to Friends of Brook Park have labored to improve our quality of life with new parks and greenways and cleaner air and water. The Bronx River Alliance rescued a river; the Harlem River Working Group intends to rescue another.'"
"'12-07-29,'0','Many a weekend bicycle rider has had the same unsettling experience: You ask a friend to ride with you along some scenic, low-impact route. You show up wearing shorts, Sambas and a T-shirt, and he shows up dressed for an Olympic time trial. On his torso is a very tight shirt slashed with a half-dozen garish colors and logos irrelevant to him. His helmet, decorated with flames or stripes or both, is equipped with a rearview mirror. A rubber straw dangles around his neck like a fur stole, through which he can drink fluids from a container on his back. And then there are the spandex leg-­enclosures. These have patches of yellow on either flank, giving the impression that your friend is wearing chaps. Yellow-and-black spandex chaps.All this for a 10-mile ride on a bike path.If you can identify with the more casually dressed biker described above, or if you want to go biking but have been scared away by the sport’s cult of gear and equipment, then your bible has been written. Grant Petersen’s “Just Ride” is a wonderfully sane, down to earth and frequently funny guide to riding, maintaining, fixing and enjoying your bicycle. That so much common sense will be considered revelatory, even revolutionary, is a testament to how loony the bike world has become.Petersen opens with this salvo: “My main goal with this book is to point out what I see as bike racing’s bad influence on bicycles, equipment and attitudes, and then undo it.” And he goes on to prove, conclusively, that most of what ails the world of cycling comes from nonprofessional riders pretending, or being bullied into pretending, that they’re professionals. The solution, he says, is to emulate kids and other “Unracers” — people who bike for fun and not profit.The accepted orthodoxies are upended, one after another. Petersen is skeptical of special biking shoes. He is pro-kickstand, pro-mud-flap. He thinks a wide, comfortable saddle is O.K. He doesn’t see why anyone needs more than eight gears. He thinks fragile carbon-fiber bikes and ­super-narrow tires are impractical for just about everyone (“Getting paid to ride them is the only good reason I can think of to ride that kind of bike”). He has nuanced thoughts on helmets (he wears his at night but not during the day) and reminds us that biking is “lousy all-around exercise” and shouldn’t be considered a stand-alone regimen. But most satisfying is his takedown of the tight-shirt, ­spandex-shorts phenomenon. “In its need for special clothing,” he writes, “bicycle riding is less like scuba diving and more like a pickup basketball game.” A regular cotton T-shirt and a pair of shorts will ventilate better, he says, and if you’re not trying to shave seconds off a world record, the microscopic aerodynamic advantages of tight synthetic clothing just don’t apply to you.Coming from just anyone, this kind of thinking wouldn’t carry much weight. But Petersen raced for six years, then worked at Bridgestone, Japan’s largest bike maker, as a designer and marketer. When the company closed its American office, he opened his own shop, Rivendell Bicycle Works, in Walnut Creek, Calif. It would seem, then, that Petersen, as the ultimate insider, would be the first guy to push expensive racing gear on every would-be enthusiast to walk into his shop.But with this book, he’s trying to bring biking back to a state of moderation and rationality. If you like the gear, he’s fine with that, and if you don’t agree with all his advice, no problem. But he makes the case that at its core, biking should be a simple, democratic, sometimes ludicrously enjoyable means of getting around. “No matter how much your bike costs,” he says, “unless you use it to make a living, it is a toy, and it should be fun.” Amen.'"
"'12-07-29,'0','The oldest work on display is a deadpan photographic diptych from 1971, in which Mr. Wegman and a woman mimic fishing and ice-skating in his studio. The latest is one of his so-called postcard paintings from this year, in which one or more tourist postcards blossom into a fantastical oil-painted scene. (In this case a picturesque lake becomes a flooded house.)In between come photographs of dogs, costumed or blending into the landscape; totemic alphabets made from photographs of plants and leaves; and all manner of paintings, drawings and collages. The museum is also screening Mr. Wegman’s short film, “The Hardly Boys in Hardly Gold” (1995), a detective saga based on the Hardy Boys and shot in and around Loon Lake, in which dogs play all the roles.The show has been in the works since 2009, when Kevin Salatino, until recently the museum’s director, moved here from Los Angeles. (He now directs the art collections at the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, Calif.) Mr. Wegman’s Los Angeles dealer, Marc Selwyn, mentioned that the artist spent summers here and suggested the two collaborate on a show.Mr. Salatino’s plan was to exhibit the early conceptual work. But when he and Diana K. Tuite, a curator at the museum, began visiting Mr. Wegman at his studio in Chelsea, the idea of a “nature-centric” show emerged, Mr. Salatino said. “I realized that this was an aspect of the work that had never really been thought through thematically before,” he added. “But it weaves its way through everything, even the early conceptual work.”Inevitably the show also became autobiographical, and the catalog is essentially an artist’s book. Part field guide, part memoir, it’s filled with Mr. Wegman’s youthful artwork and family photographs, as well as an essay about his early aesthetic tastes, back when he was making watercolors of his dog in the woods, painting American Indian alphabets using pigment extracted from berries, and admiring the sensuous brushwork in the Breck Girl ads.“So many people would be inclined to suppress the naïveté of their worldview,” Ms. Tuite said. “But in Bill’s case he wears it so proudly, almost so much so that it is kind of a conceptual move in and of itself.”In person Mr. Wegman, who seems kindly and dryly humorous at once, also affects a certain degree of naïveté. For one so famous he’s surprisingly self-effacing, quick to compliment others and to claim he doesn’t know much about anything. He also loves reminiscing about his childhood. In an interview in his studio, as the dogs snored on a couch, he talked about his first trip to Maine in 1958. Then 14, he had driven up from East Longmeadow, the small Massachusetts quarry town where he grew up, with slightly older boys to fish in the Rangeley Lakes. “It took really a long time to get up here,” he recalled. “Then we hit a rock.” They were rescued by the proprietor of a lake club, who put them up in one of his log cabins for a week while the car was being fixed. “It was a very memorable trip,” Mr. Wegman said.Years later, in 1979, halfway through his second marriage, and just as his large color Polaroids of Man Ray were starting to bring him fortune and fame, he returned to Rangeley with a new fishing buddy, and rented a cabin at another camp, York’s. Before long he had bought the cabin, the tennis court and, by 1989, the main lodge itself. Today, this is where he lives part-time, with Christine Burgin, his wife of 17 years; their children, Atlas, 17, and Lola, 14; and the dogs of course. The lodge’s main room still looks much as it did in the ’70s, he said, with a looming fireplace, light fixtures made from birch branches, and taxidermied bison, moose, elk and caribou heads on the walls. Every surface seems to be packed with sporting equipment, memorabilia, artwork and books. His studio occupies a third of the building.York’s is where he found his way back to representational painting, in the mid-1980s, after Man Ray’s death. “I loved painting,” he said. “That’s why I went to art school. But soon after I got to art school I stopped, because painting was dead in the ’60s.” At first he was so self-conscious that he painted on the back of the canvas. But soon he was working fluently, in a variety of styles, including cartoonish caricature and brushily expressionistic figuration.York’s was also the place where, in 1987, Mr. Wegman made his first photograph of his second Weimaraner, the slinky, almond-eyed Fay Ray, by a brook in a Wonder Woman mask. A few years on it also played a pivotal role in his romance with Ms. Burgin, then an art dealer in SoHo.Soon after they began dating, the couple traveled to Maine so that Mr. Wegman could work on his “Field Guide to North America and Other Places,” an edition of 20 unique artists’ books, several of which are included in the current show. Packaged in a plywood box and wrapped in a piece of Buffalo plaid blanket, sort of like an L. L. Bean take on the Duchampian valise, each contains about 20 loose double-sided pages of photographs, collages and multimedia works on materials like paper, bark and felt, creating a gentle parody of centuries of nature writing. Mr. Wegman made his first postcard painting for these books, and almost every one includes a photograph of a half-naked Ms. Burgin, brandishing a toy tomahawk as she runs into the woods.Mr. Wegman said her help was crucial: “I was making lots of pictures. I had things all over the place. She would help make it neat, so I wouldn’t get too flummoxed.” (She now oversees his projects, alongside her own business.)Ms. Burgin saw the project as a field guide to Mr. Wegman, who “has a million ideas a minute” and “things going in every direction,” she said. The guide, she added, “was a key to Bill in some way, like a key in a map, and I think this show is too.”During the ’90s, as they were having children, Mr. Wegman focused much of his energy on children’s books, featuring Fay and her descendants. The woods and the town of Rangeley often served as his set. Now, four generations of Weimaraners and one generation of Wegmans later, he continues to find inspiration in the locale — and so do his dogs. In Maine, he said, they behave quite differently from the way they do in the city. “In New York you can call them or have someone drop something, and you can get a surprised look,” he said. “But here you get a waft of some scent that makes them really open up in a different way. They kind of lead with their noses.”One might say that Mr. Wegman does too. He’s now working on a series of postcard paintings on wood, which he started here last year. Although he’s not quite sure what to make of them yet, “Maine is a place where I’m willing to try anything,” he said. “Things emerge in a very unique way up here.”'"
"'12-07-29,'0','“I went to Florida, and that’s where I first got sick, at the Holy Land.”“O.K.,” Cox scribbled, and then looked up. “What’s that?”“It’s an amusement park out there, but it has Jerusalem, it has Noah’s Ark, they did the play the Passion . . .”“Now there’s another spot for me and my baby to go!” Cox said. They laughed.Cox doesn’t know oak trees, but she knows how to talk to people. She knows when to ask if someone cannot afford insulin, or is not taking insulin, or is not keeping the insulin cold, or cannot keep the insulin cold because there is no electricity or refrigerator. Not having health insurance is a huge problem in Mississippi, but it isn’t the only one. “So you good with doing your medicines?” Wells made a guilty face. “You oxygen-dependent?” She was.Wells worked at a Jackson hospital as a certified nursing assistant for five years before she started getting sick with asthma-related illnesses. No one wanted a nurse who needed an oxygen tank, she said, so now she was trying to work a handful of hours a week at a Christian community center. “I stayed in Illinois for 25 years,” she said. “I didn’t really have asthma symptoms till I came down here.”“There’s something in the house that’s triggering it,” Cox said. “I bet you need to get tested for mold.” She made a note. The house was old, the rug thick, the air damp. “And I’m putting a little check mark down here that you got the basic light, gas and water. Your major problem is the asthma.”Cox tilted her head. “Have you been taught how to manage your congestive heart failure? Because you should have a scale.” She looked around the house gamely, as if she believed a scale might pop out from behind the TV.“You need a scale, and you need to do a weight every morning. Because if you get on a scale and there’s a three-pound difference from one day to the next, you’re starting to retain fluid. I see that your legs are already swollen.”Cox explained why people retain fluid. She then asked whether Wells had checked her blood pressure; her emergency-room chart indicated it had been 212 over 100, which is stroke level. Concerned about Wells’s sodium intake, she asked her how many sodas she was drinking, and told her that some juice has a lot of sodium in it too. “Knowledge is power, O.K.?” Cox said gently. “Cause you’re 40, and you’re oxygen-dependent. We don’t want you goin’ on a date with an oxygen tank!” Wells laughed again.Cox said she would try to find a company that would test the house for toxins, and she made an appointment for Wells to visit a medical clinic that HealthConnect operates. Wells got up, the oxygen tube dragging behind her, and walked Cox to the door. Cox paused at one of the photographs on the wall. “You got a beautiful family!” Cox said. She focused on a slim woman. “Now, is that Mama?”“That’s Grandma,” Wells said. “She was 95 when she passed. I moved down here to help her out.”One of the people responsible for HealthConnect’s holistic, intensely personal approach is Dr. Aaron Shirley, who three years ago found inspiration for health care reform in an unlikely place: the primary health care system created in the 1980s in the Islamic Republic of Iran. The main issue in Iran back then was “disparities in health between its urban and rural populations,” he told me recently. “In the U.S., these disparities exist. The Iranian model eliminated the geographic disparities, so why couldn’t this same approach be used for racial and geographic disparities in the U.S.?”Shirley created HealthConnect in 2010 because — and, in part, to prove to others that — poor people in Mississippi still have health problems, even if they have Medicaid or health insurance, even if there are clinics in their communities, even if they get home health services. They don’t get better, and the diseases born of poverty and obesity are not prevented; thousands of people frequent emergency rooms for illnesses that could have been tackled by primary care. They need something more.Shirley is a civil rights-era hero who for a long time was the only black pediatrician in the state, the type of activist who, he says, wasn’t necessarily of the “nonviolent persuasion” and who, upon hearing that the local Klan was headed to his home, would warn the Police Department that both his boys knew how to shoot. He was the first black resident at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and, in the 1960s, worked at the state’s first community health center, in the Mississippi Delta. He did things that don’t end up in history books, too, like build wells for poor blacks when they didn’t have clean drinking water and travel through the countryside treating malnourished babies. In 1993, the MacArthur Foundation identified him as a “health care leader” when it gave him one of its “genius” awards.Shirley, now 79, spends his days at the Jackson Medical Mall. For decades, the site was an actual mall, with a and a Gayfers, but the area around it began to decline in the 1980s as middle-class families fled to suburbs nearby. Historic downtown Jackson emptied out altogether, and today Capitol Street, the bustling shopping avenue that boycotted in 1962, looks shuttered and ghostly. The mall, just five minutes from downtown, was well on its way to the same fate, so in the mid-1990s Shirley and others created the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation to buy it and turn it into a center offering various health services for the poor.Since then, Shirley has observed up close what so many Mississippians point out: millions of dollars pour into the state every year — both public and private funds — but the lives of Mississippians do not improve. “I’ve been coming here for 40 years,” he told me recently, referring to the Mississippi Delta, “and nothing has changed.”In 2008, Shirley was introduced to a consultant named James Miller by a public health professor at Jackson State University, Mohammad Shahbazi. Miller and his wife live in , Miss., where they and other family members run a consulting firm and other businesses. In 2004, Miller learned about Iran’s primary-care health system during a meeting in with a delegation from the Iranian government. But it wasn’t until 2007, when a struggling hospital hired Miller’s firm to conduct an assessment of its operations, that Miller fully grasped the extent of Mississippi’s health care crisis — and recognized how much it resembled prerevolutionary Iran.“When the Iranian system was developed in the 1980s, there were no doctors in rural Iran,” Miller says. “And this is similar to the problem in the delta today.”The Iranian reforms were relatively inexpensive to implement there. It was the early ’80s, just after the Ayatollah Khomeini’s return and the Iranian revolution, which had promised the country’s rural villagers the kind of social justice that had been lacking under the shah. At the time, more than half the population lived outside major cities, in or around more than 60,000 villages. The Iranians built “health houses” to minister to 1,500 people who lived within at most an hour’s walking distance. Each house is a 1,000-square-foot hut equipped with examination rooms and sleeping quarters and staffed by community health workers — one man and one or more women who have been given basic training in . They advise on and family planning, take blood pressure, keep track of who needs prenatal care, provide and monitor environmental conditions like water quality. Crucially, in order to gain trust, the health workers come from the villages they serve.People who become very sick, or require surgical procedures, are referred up through a single, multitiered system: from health house to rural health center to district hospital. The integrated nature of the system is what makes it unique. Today, 17,000 health houses serve 23 million rural Iranians. Health disparities between rural and urban Iranians have narrowed; the Iranians have reduced rural by 75 percent and lowered the birthrate. Iran’s reforms won praise from the , which has long advocated preventive, primary care.To Miller, the model’s great appeal was its simplicity. He approached several academic institutions in Mississippi and told them what he’d learned. Most people looked at him as if he were nuts. The United States and Iran haven’t been on good terms since the hostage crisis in 1979. It is not a country Americans tend to think of collaborating with. But Miller, who loves Persian history and doesn’t disguise his desire to see the and Iran mend their fences, spoke to Gail Harrison, a public-health professor at She suggested he call a former student of hers: Mohammad Shahbazi, who was not only Iranian but also a professor at Jackson State University, a historically black college right in Mississippi.Shahbazi moved to the United States in the 1980s for graduate work in cultural and became fascinated by its health care problems. He recognized the similarities between the conditions in Mississippi and those in Iran, where he grew up as a member of a nomadic tribe, the Qashqai, that was discriminated against under the shah. “We were considered the wild, smelly nomads,” he says. He decided that Mississippi offered the best opportunity for his work on social determinants of health, and settled into a between-worlds existence in Jackson, where he is neither black nor white but privy to racial slights and resentments from both sides. “I consider myself bleached black,” he says.After joining Jackson State’s public health program, he often wanted to discuss Iran’s health care reforms in wider policy circles, but feared doing so in the post-9/11 climate. Shahbazi, who is animated and friendly and tends to make jokes like “we don’t have pharmacologists, we have harm­acologists,” was once pulled aside by a federal agent at an airport because he thought Shahbazi was on a most-wanted terrorist list. When the agent showed Shahbazi the list, Shahbazi exclaimed, “But I am not Shabaz Mohammad of , I am Mohammad Shahbazi of Iran!”Shahbazi suggested that he and Miller approach Shirley. He arranged for the two men to visit Shiraz, Iran, and meet some of the people responsible for creating and administering the country’s health houses. The two groups decided to establish an official academic partnership between Shiraz University and Jackson State, and Shirley returned to Mississippi a convert. Later that year, several Iranian doctors and administrators and their wives made their own trip to Mississippi. They were surprised by what they saw: “This is America?” they asked. In 2010, the Iranians returned for a month, calculating how many health houses Mississippi would need, as they had done in Iran. Shahbazi began work on a program at Jackson State for the training of community health workers. Using resources from the Medical Mall Foundation, Shirley started HealthConnect to show how interventionist, door-to-door community health workers might save hospitals money and began the process of putting health houses in Jackson schools. Eventually they hope to build the Mississippi Community Health House Network, a pilot version of their project, in the Mississippi Delta.“We are not saying just trust us,” Shahbazi says. “We are saying give us $10 to $20 million and three years; we’ll implement 15 health houses in the delta, and we will prove two things: We will show you that we are changing the health outcomes, and we will show we can reduce the cost of health care in the state.”Mississippi has some of the worst health statistics in the country. A Mississippi black man’s life expectancy is lower than the average American’s life expectancy was in 1960. Sixty-nine percent of adult Mississippians are obese or overweight, and a quarter of the state’s households don’t have access to decent, healthful food. Adequate grocery stores can be 30 miles away. In one of the country’s most fertile regions, people sometimes have to shop for their groceries at the gas station. Consequently, Mississippians are dying from , , congestive heart failure and asthma. Shirley points out that in the 1960s people starved, and today they die from food.The state has the highest rate of teen births in the nation. Currently there is one clinic in Mississippi, and Gov. Phil Bryant, a former deputy sheriff, is working hard to render it inoperable. Until this year, schools taught abstinence. In the United States, the black infant mortality rate is more than twice that of white infants, so Mississippi, which is 37 percent black, has huge neonatal intensive care units. Caring for the thousands of (weighing between one and four pounds) costs millions of dollars. According to Dr. Glen Graves of the University of Mississippi Medical Center, these tiny, deprived babies grow up to be plagued with chronic illnesses.calls the Deep South “the epicenter of the epidemic in the United States, with more people living and dying of AIDS than in any region in the country.” Blacks in Mississippi are dying from AIDS at a rate 64 percent higher than the nation’s average. In the delta, which stretches north and west of Jackson and is home to 560,000 people, H.I.V./AIDS is an immense but silent crisis. The state Department of Health estimates that half of H.I.V.-positive Mississippians currently don’t receive treatment.Many delta hospitals complain that their emergency rooms are overrun with nonpaying patients. Dr. James Keeton, the vice chancellor for health affairs at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, says that 14 percent of the center’s patients are uninsured, or “self-pay,” and the hospital recovers only a small part of what they owe. “Now, I say to you as a businessperson: How would you like to work at an auto company and give away . . . cars before even opening your doors?”Of the state’s population of nearly three million, 550,000 are uninsured. At the moment, Governor Bryant is claiming that the state might not accept federal money to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. But even if it does, there won’t be enough doctors to see all the Mississippians who need them; the state has 176 doctors per 100,000 people, the lowest such number in the country.Sixty years ago, Mississippi, the country’s poorest and most racially divided state, was “the standard by which this nation’s commitment to social justice would be measured,” the historian John Dittmer wrote. Talk to those in Mississippi’s health care community, and they all whisper the same thing: It’s not rocket science; we all know what needs to be done. In short, as one Mississippian put it to me, “hand-to-hand combat” — hiring folks whose sole job is to ameliorate the problems in poor people’s lives — and a tremendous amount of money could change the situation. But the political will does not exist. So the status quo endures: generations of people who can’t afford fresh , and who don’t understand that when a doctor says take this pill three times a day, he doesn’t mean all at once.In May, Shirley, Shahbazi and a black pediatrician named Eva Henderson-Camara piled into Shahbazi’s car and headed to the delta to talk to two nurses at a small hospital in Belzoni, more than an hour north of Jackson. The first thing you notice on entering the delta, especially when you’re expecting to find poverty, is that you don’t see many people. The farms are vast and empty. So much of the area is bucolic and sun-dappled that it doesn’t seem poor. When I said as much to Claudia Cox about Mississippi in general, she replied sternly: “That’s because poverty in America doesn’t look like what y’all think. It used to be bare feet, now it’s Nikes. If I miss two months of work because I get sick, well, guess what? I’m in poverty. This is the new poverty.” Yet in delta towns like Louise and Midnight, the poverty is impossible to miss: desolate commercial streets in the shadow of a rotting mill, shotgun houses wilting on one side of railroad tracks, houses almost buried under possessions on the porch and in the yard.Henderson-Camara, now 60, grew up on the plantation her grandfather owned. Children at the time worked much of the school year as part of the sharecropper system, which lasted until the ’70s, as corporations bought and mechanized the farms. (“Imagine waking up every morning and this is all you see,” Henderson-Camara said, looking out the window at the flat fields stretching to the sky. “And you think, Should I shoot myself now or later?”) Thousands of displaced workers found jobs at the Jockey factory, or the Schwinn plant, or on catfish farms, but those shut down in the early ’90s. Henderson-Camara got out by winning a scholarship for a fifth year of high school at . Today she lives in Jackson and works in HealthConnect’s medical clinic.In Belzoni, everyone sat down at a rectangular table, and the director of nursing, Dee Ann Brown, recounted the hospital’s troubles: emergency-room readmissions, obesity, inadequate . Shirley then explained the role of community health workers and asked Brown if she thought that service might be helpful.“What you are describing is home health, isn’t it?” Brown said.Home-health agencies dispatch nurses to do clinical work in patients’ homes. But they are not obligated to take your phone calls at midnight or steer you away from eating fried food — and you have to have insurance to get their care. Often for-profit services, they are also the hedge funds of the health care community: potentially lucrative, largely unregulated, producing bad results as often as good. Sanjay Basu, a physician and policy expert at the , says that while he has seen some remarkable and devoted home-health agencies, “if you’re in it for a buck, you could have a terrible home agency and make a ton of money.” Many towns in the delta have them — yet the delta’s problems persist. Why? Shirley offered that the hospitals need a third party trained to discern what exactly will help a patient, and that party must come from the patient’s world: talk the same, share similar fears and frustrations and life experiences.“Most home-health nurses build great relationships with their patients,” Brown said.“But there’s a lot of distrust,” Henderson-Camara said, leaning forward. “We don’t trust people who don’t look like us. Having grown up in a very segregated community, I know this for a fact. You may think that you’re in with that patient, but when you walk out that door, they will laugh and say, ‘I just told her that so she’ll stop asking me questions.’ But if you live in that community and sister Edna tells you something, you say, ‘Now, Edna,’ and she will say, ‘O.K., you got me.’ And she’ll tell you the truth. People do not trust people who do not look like them.”“I don’t feel that’s a problem here,” said Brown, who happens to be white. “I may be way smoozed.”The friction between them highlighted a problem beyond a distrust of outsiders: the fractured nature of American health care. It was easy to dismiss, or misconstrue, the health-house network as just another addition to a market glutted with for-profit businesses and nonprofit services looking to patch up the holes in — or take advantage of — the health care system. What Shirley and his colleagues saw the need for was something holistic and aggressive that would take root in the community, get into homes and alter the course of future generations, before obesity, say, or diabetes sets in. The Iranian system they admire is a preventive health care system. American health care is not preventive, and it’s not a system.The practice of community health workers going door to door has been applied everywhere from to . According to Carl H. Rush of the Institute of Health Policy, in the United States, community health workers have been used on a small scale for decades. More recently, he says, hospitals around the country are realizing the potential for community health workers to lower their costs.The Iranian health houses, too, resemble the original mission of America’s community health centers. When Dr. H. Jack Geiger founded the country’s first federally qualified health center in 1967 in Mound Bayou, a small town in the delta, the goal was to confront the many aspects of people’s lives that were contributing to their ill health. “We built wells and privies and housing and started a 500-acre vegetable farm,” says Geiger, whose work was inspired by what he saw in in the late ’50s, “and that probably had a bigger impact on the health of the population than what we were doing as doctors. The indigenous people we trained were among the most useful people on staff.”Today there are 8,300 centers serving 20 million people throughout the country. Over the years, however, community health centers, needing to compete in the marketplace, have evolved into more conventional medical businesses, focused on the delivery of personal health services rather than the social and environmental determinants of overall health.To help them return to the original mission, the Affordable Care Act will give $11 billion to community health centers, a sum that will double the numbers and capacity of centers nationwide. “It would be effective if community health centers were given the budget to return to the interventions that characterized almost all of the first health centers of the 1960s and 1970s,” Geiger says. “Every health care provider in this country is under pressure, because of the incentives in the system, to churn out patients as fast as you can, because you get paid for visits. That just doesn’t work for people with the kind of complex problems you probably saw in Mississippi. You can’t fix these problems in 10 minutes.”Shirley says he believes that the problems of the American poor — living conditions, deficient education, harmful behaviors and the lack of family support and access to healthful lifestyles — demand house calls. This approach was used by groups in and , N.J., profiled by Atul Gawande in The New Yorker last year, which identified the worst offenders of emergency-room readmission and deployed social workers and nurses to figure out the myriad sources of ill health. What was clear above all else from Gawande’s account is that what these people needed was constant attention. Because one stumble — an unpaid electricity bill, for example — can lead to cascading health setbacks.The Iranian model goes a step further by making the community health workers responsible for their villagers’ well-being from birth. It’s an approach very much at odds with the American ethos of self-reliance. But in Iran, the seeming intrusiveness is required, according to Dr. Kamel Shadpour, one of the architects of the Iranian system. “If you go to one of these community health workers and ask him or her how many people they cover, they won’t tell you around 2,000,” Shadpour says. “They will tell you exactly 1,829 people. If you take out the family file with the No. 62, he or she will know which family that is, and she will tell you that the father is this old, and they have five children, their ages, their vaccinations, how they were doing family planning, everything.”The Iranian model also differs from many others because of its integrated delivery network: the way a patient is referred up through a chain of hospitals according to their needs. “The overall system is the key,” says Miller, the Oxford consultant, “not just community health workers.”The American government has been moving toward more comprehensive solutions. The Affordable Care Act has created “accountable care organizations” that include doctors, social workers, nurses and pharmacists working together to serve patients. Since May, also as part of health care reform, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced more than 100 multimillion-dollar grants to organizations that proposed new ways to prevent illness and save money. Its Innovation Center awarded grants to a large number of experimental programs that involve community health workers.“There’s a renewed interest in them, in part because of the nation’s increased focus on prevention,” says Dr. Richard J. Gilfillan, the director of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation. “Eighty-four percent of our health care dollar is spent on managing people with chronic conditions. . . . We know preventing obesity can help prevent other illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and kidney disease — so how can we prevent these conditions from occurring in the first place? Likely not with more procedures and X-rays. Some of the winners’ programs harken back to the way health care was delivered long ago. The things we learn by going into someone’s home tell us so much about the patient’s life and how they manage their own diseases.”One morning last spring, Shirley took me to see one of his new health-house facilities at Blackburn Middle School, which is on the edge of Jackson State University’s campus and across the street from where Shirley grew up. Walking with him through the neighborhood, or stopping in with him at the Penguin, a nice restaurant on the Jackson State campus, is like being with the mayor. Over lunch, the people who came to shake his hand included the state’s new director of Medicaid and the president of the Mississippi .Shirley reasoned that opening health houses in the schools was a natural way to gain access to families. Many public schools in Mississippi don’t have full-time nurses, and Blackburn Middle School is attended almost entirely by students who live in poverty, so it welcomed the chance to have health care on the premises.One community health worker on the staff at Blackburn was Tiara, a single mother on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families I first met almost nine months earlier. A not-so-obvious benefit of training community health workers is that doing so creates jobs for unemployed people; advanced degrees are unnecessary. In our first interview, Tiara told me how much she loved her job. At Blackburn, she seemed quieter as we talked about how she counseled young girls about sex. “As someone who had a child at 17, I am so against it,” she told us. (She is now 22.) “You have so much potential.”As a HealthConnect employee, Tiara also made house calls before being transferred to work in the school. Her life is a kind of full-time HealthConnect anyway. “I had” — she said, counting — “six people in my apartment last night. Because they don’t have electricity. And one was a real bad diabetic who can’t see how to pull her insulin, can’t see anything.”These are the sorts of stories you hear repeatedly in Mississippi. During five days driving around with Cox, I saw what health workers were up against, and what they were capable of. Cox comes from a middle-class family, the product of a stable home. She went to college, became a funeral director and then decided to go to nursing school, using public assistance to make her way through it. Cox had worked as a nurse for 20 years — Shirley and the Central Mississippi Medical Center decided to use licensed nurses at HealthConnect until their community health workers are trained — and she could intuit that a patient’s life might be crumbling in surprising ways.There was Regina Huggins, who had been in the hospital 20 times in eight months since her . She was a smoker with who lacked energy and had lost 50 pounds. One of the reasons she kept calling ambulances to go to the E.R. seemed to be that she had no transportation; she couldn’t even afford a taxi. She did not qualify for Medicaid. Without insurance, she couldn’t get an oxygen tank or inhalers or fill her . She had $300,000 in medical bills.There was Mamie Marshall, who was dying of bone in the back room of her house. None of her doctors had put her in , and she said she had been told that no one could do anything for her. She was a licensed beautician and had worked for Packard Electric, a subsidiary of , and as a public-school bus driver and as a nanny. “I worked,” she said.And there were Carolyn Brewster and Melvin McGee, 29-year-olds whose baby, Justin, was born prematurely, most likely because Brewster had high blood pressure and . Both Brewster and McGee have learning disabilities, but they had jobs and had earnestly embraced parenthood, paying $450 a month for a two-room apartment in a motel-like apartment complex where everyone seemed to be under 30. When we called on them, Cox decided to take Brewster’s blood pressure and discovered that it was 149 over 100. Brewster wasn’t doing anything to reduce it except taking vinegar, a common home remedy. Cox made an appointment for her at the medical clinic later that day, told her how to catch the bus and which pharmacy to go to and emphasized that she needed to go right away. “You are only 29, and you are going to end up on ,” she said.On our way out, Cox said she wanted to stop by to see Tiara, who lives in the same apartment complex. She had just had her second child.Shirley, Shahbazi and Miller haven’t had an easy time getting large-scale financing for their health-house network. They enlisted a Mississippi congressman, Bennie Thompson, to write a letter to , the secretary of Health and Human Services. They applied for (but did not receive) one of those grants awarded by the Innovation Center; Jack Geiger wrote the recommendation letter. They talked it up in Mississippi.The three men — and many Mississippians I spoke to — complain that a lot of federal and grant money goes to research, not actual services. “The delta people have been studied to death,” Shirley says. Also, as they point out, funding rarely goes to entire systems. But the group is hoping that the idea of Iranian-style health houses in the United States might inspire good will between the two countries.“If they can get the resources, then why not give it a try?” said Shadpour, the architect of the Iranian system, when I called him in Tehran. “The situation is not worse than Iran. To the contrary, it is much better in many ways. The infrastructure is there.”Until someone finances the pilot for 15 health houses, Shirley will establish them in 11 schools — where there are already rooms, electricity, water. To keep the houses running, Shirley says, they are staffed with certified nurse practitioners whose services can be billed to Medicaid. “So the revenue that the nurse generates will go to paying her and the community health workers, too. We say, ‘O.K., how much money is already out there?’“The only outside money that we’ve gotten to contribute to our project has been $75,000 from United Healthcare, the insurance company, because they see the potential to save them money,” he continued.His methods are scrappy and scattershot, but Shirley is used to working around the system. After 60 years, perhaps the main reason he’s turning to an Iranian model is because, unlike everything else in Mississippi, it worked. In one year, HealthConnect cut the rate of readmissions to the Central Mississippi Medical Center by 15 percent.Meanwhile, Miller is trying to find yet another way to generate money. With support from Jackson State doctors and advice from their counterparts at Shiraz University, he has begun discussing the idea of Americans and Iranians working together to implement the Iranian model in other needy countries. He hopes that a major international aid project might be a way to get financing for Mississippi.A few weeks after her first visit, Claudia Cox returned to Vonda Wells’s house. Wells, who is now 41, hadn’t returned to the emergency room, but she seemed sadder. She hadn’t been paid the $5 a day she was supposed to get for working at the Christian community center, but despite doing all her paperwork and leaving messages for her caseworker, she had not heard back.And because Medicaid limits the number of doctor visits in a year, she couldn’t see one now.“How you going to follow up with your pulmonologist and cardiologist?” Cox asked.“I had to cancel,” Wells said. “I already have a bill in there for $240 I have to pay.”She couldn’t keep up with her medicines. “Medicaid can’t pay for it, and I can’t pay for the medicines, not at $90 a pop,” she said. “I try to wean myself off of medicine. If I feel good, I don’t take them.”But Wells spoke of positive things. Her 19-year-old daughter, who played in the next room with Wells’s grandchild, was talented enough to be a fashion designer, she said. Her youngest daughter, 16, wanted to join the military “to see the world.” Her mother helped out with the bills at times. And her uncle had offered to come by and do some repairs, rip up the carpet, fix the kitchen. In many ways, Wells was rare among Cox’s patients: she still had family.In fact, the house had been her grandmother’s, and she had spent some of her childhood there. She was lucky to have a rent-free home full of so many memories. But Wells would have to wait to learn whether that house was giving her asthma problems.“We couldn’t find anybody to examine the house” that was affordable, Cox said. “It was $1,300 for one day — just to test. Just to come out here and pull a couple of pieces from the attic.”'"

"'12-07-30,'0','Schiller, a former New York Times executive who resigned last year from NPR amid controversy, quickly became the corporate symbol of anger about tape-delaying sports and the opening ceremony. And she isn’t even in the sports division.To a degree, she wasn’t wrong. Complaining about tape delay is an Olympic sport in its way.But the fans aren’t wrong either in their dislike of tape delay, a vestige of 1960s Olympic television production pioneered by ABC’s Roone Arledge.It has been an effective tool for all Olympic networks, which have rationalized its use with this mantra: we hold the marquee sports until prime time to harvest the highest rating and optimize our advertising so we can afford our ever-increasing rights fees.But fans long upset with tape delay have reason to keep complaining. Major sports are always televised live. Why not the Olympics? And with the tools available to NBC — multiple networks and the Internet — an all-live Olympics is possible.And in a digital age, aggrieved fans can take to social media to protest in a way that was never available until recently. And yet, even in a digital age, NBC’s Olympic economics are still based largely on prime time — and the returns so far from London are stellar: 40.7 million viewers for the opening ceremony and 28.7 million for the first night of competition Saturday. Are all those who hate tape delay not watching or are they reluctant parts of the audience, knowing there’s no other way to watch the Games?Still, NBC cannot fully savor the success, at least not yet. By streaming all sports live to an audience more ravenous than ever for video content on computers, iPads and smartphones, NBC might have believed it had found a complaint cure-all. If no streams were held until the events aired on tape in prime time, how could anyone complain about delay? If fans absolutely had to see Michael Phelps swim live, they could see it. Up to 40 live streams are available at once. Such a fetching bonanza sounds ideal, doesn’t it?But people want what they want when they want it — and they don’t want the video to freeze, skip, pixelate or buffer excessively. Some who wanted to watch Phelps race Ryan Lochte live (many hours before they raced, on delay, on NBC) were disappointed when the live streams seized up as if hexed by an NBC rival.Twitter has lit up with similar complaints — some satisfied customers have tweeted, too — from fans who don’t want to hear that the trouble might be on their end: their broadband service’s bandwidth; the age of their computers and mobile devices; thunderstorms; the number of people in an apartment building also streaming; or interference in the ionosphere from Ryan Seacrest’s Freedom Tower-size pompadour.NBC did nothing to caution fans that any of these problems might arise or that they might have an imperfect experience. Those helpful advisories should have been posted on nbcolympics.com next to where users sign in to access video. Perhaps nobody should have anticipated perfection; this is a huge undertaking that probably could not have been tested by millions of users to mimic the actual experience once the Games began.“We’re enjoying tremendous success with our digital offerings,” Greg Hughes, a spokesman for the NBC Sports Group, said by telephone from London. “And yes, there have been some difficulties. Some on our end; some on the users’ end. And we’re working around the clock to give everyone a good digital experience. A small number of complaints, relative to the huge number of users, is a very positive early sign.”Early returns indicate that streaming is extremely popular. On Saturday, the first day of competition, there were 7 million live streams, up from 1.6 million on the comparable day in Beijing. Total videos streamed through Saturday, including highlights and replays, stand at 13.2 million, compared with 5.2 million in Beijing.NBC’s live streaming strategy contains a wrinkle that was bound to ruffle some fans. In marquee sports like swimming, diving and gymnastics, the live feed runs once, with no replays available, until it has run in a packaged, delayed form on NBC. Indeed, it is not available to replay online until the network’s West Coast prime time show ends.Behind that strategy rests old-world Arledgeism: save your best for prime time, an instruction that has been followed slavishly as network rights for the Olympics have soared to the $1.18 billion NBC is paying to televise the London Games.While NBC took a big step into 21st century digital realities by letting everything stream live, it isn’t carrying everything, including the marquee events, live on TV. The belief is that viewership might diminish if your best events are seen too early on TV.In a compelling column posted Sunday on buzzmachine.com, Jeff Jarvis wrote: “I can easily imagine people watching the Phelps defeat live tweeting their heads off telling their friends to watch it in prime time.” He added: “The problem for NBC as for other media is that it is trying to preserve old business models in a new reality. To experiment with alternatives when billions are at stake is risky. But so is not experimenting and not learning when millions of your viewers can complain about you on Twitter.”'"
"'12-07-30,'0','On Israel, Mr. Panetta said, “My view is that they have not made any decisions with regards to Iran, and they continue to support the international effort to bring pressure against Iran to pull back from their efforts to develop their nuclear capability.”He declared that Israel and the international community were united in the view that economic sanctions on Iran were effective, and he declined to comment on Mr. Netanyahu’s remarks on Sunday to Mr. Romney that the sanctions were not working.Mr. Panetta also declined to comment on a remark by Dan Senor, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, that if Israel acted against Iran on its own, Mr. Romney “would respect that decision.”“I’m just not going to get into that game of commenting on what candidates do,” Mr. Panetta said. “As secretary of defense, I have a responsibility to defend the security of our country, and in order to do that I have to have the support of both Democrats and Republicans.”He did acknowledge Israel’s right to act on its own. “We respect their sovereignty and their ability to make decisions with their own security,” he said, repeating a standard administration stance. But he did not tie the administration’s respect for Israel’s sovereignty directly to a possible Israeli attack on Iran.On Syria, Mr. Panetta told reporters that helicopter gunship attacks on civilians in the city of Aleppo by President Bashar al-Assad’s government were “another tragic example of the kind of indiscriminate violence that the Assad regime has committed against its own people” and that “it ultimately will be a nail in Assad’s coffin.” He offered no details, but said the United States was working with countries in the region to try to secure Syria’s large stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. The Obama administration says it is not providing direct military aid to the Syrian opposition.In Tunisia — where the Arab Spring revolts began when a fruit vendor set himself on fire in December 2010 to protest police harassment and the lack of economic opportunities — Mr. Panetta will meet with President Moncef Marzouki and Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali, and start talks on American military support in the volatile region. “They have concerns about how to deal with Al Qaeda,” Mr. Panetta said.He will also visit Jordan and Egypt. Administration officials continue to prod Egypt’s military to hand over authority to a civilian government. The transition has been chaotic, and the Pentagon, which has close ties to Egypt’s generals, has been central in the so-far unsuccessful effort to persuade the military to give up its political powers. “We strongly support an orderly, peaceful, legitimate transition to a democratic system of government,” he said.'"

"'12-07-30,'0','In the four years since Cisco Systems made an initial strategic investment of about $10 million here, financing the beginnings of business-service outsourcing to Palestinian companies, supporting training programs and drawing in other international partners, the sector is said to have grown from less than 1 percent of the Palestinian economy to more than 5 percent today — albeit of an economy whose total output is estimated at a modest $5 billion to $6 billion.For all the enthusiasm and talk of an emerging “ecosystem” from Palestinians newly proficient in the industry’s international argot, the technologists of Ramallah must still grapple with some of the challenges that confront the wider Palestinian economy and society, most notably the continued absence of the long-envisaged Palestinian state.A World Bank report issued last week said that while the Palestinian Authority had made steady progress toward building the institutions required by a future state, the economy was currently not strong enough to support such a state, and remained too dependent on foreign aid. The report said it was critical for the Palestinian Authority to increase trade, spur private-sector growth and integrate the territory into the world economy as much as possible.Experts and business leaders say that the main resource the Palestinians have to work with is their young, well-educated, entrepreneurial-minded population. But there is a need, they say, to overcome the image the world has of the territory as a volatile conflict zone where people ride to work on camels.Though outsourcing contracts are the mainstay of the industry here, the model that the Palestinian infotech sector looks to is not India’s, with its immense population, but more that of Israel. “Innovation, creativity, being ahead of the curve” is the goal, said Tareq Maayah, 45, the chief executive of Exalt Technologies, “rather than relying on a huge quantity of basic skills.”Like Israel, the Palestinians want a resilient tech sector that can be a politics-free zone. “The occupation is frustrating,” Mr. Maayah observed, “but Israelis and Palestinians have been working with each other in the worst of times.”He said that Exalt handles outsourcing contracts from multinational companies operating in Israel and from some local companies as well. “Now we are producers and we sell to Israel, as opposed to just being consumers,” Mr. Maayah said. “It’s the start of a better balance in the economic relationship.”Others noted that Israel has built a thriving technology sector even as it fought several wars in recent years.There is no shortage of prospective employees; rather the opposite. About 2,000 Palestinians graduate from local universities each year in technical subjects, one-third to one-half of them women, but only about 30 percent of them find work in the local industry.The Palestinian I.T. Association of Companies lists 125 members, about three-quarters of them based in the West Bank and the rest in Gaza, which is run by the militant group Hamas, not the Fatah-led Palestinian Authority. The entrepreneurs acknowledge that the industry is still in its infancy, with one estimating total outsourcing revenue at just $6 million a year. But they say it can be an attractive option for Israel-based firms because of its proximity, cultural familiarity, the talent of Palestinian engineers and their loyalty to their companies.Sam Husseini runs LionHeart, a company that operates a training program with an Israeli partner to teach Palestinian entrepreneurs marketing skills. Two chief executives — Husni Abu Samrah of MobiStine, a start-up that designs health care applications in Arabic, and Saeed Zeidan of Ultimit, which develops software and does consulting work — each said they learned a lot from the training program, especially about what the industry still needs to thrive.“The main thing is exposure,” Mr. Zeidan said. “We do not have exposure for the international market.”Even so, Yahya al-Salqan, chief executive of Jaffa.Net, a software developer, said the regional market offered great promise. He observed that the Palestinian tech sector was uniquely placed in a “sandwich” between Israel’s so-called Silicon Wadi, less than an hour’s drive away on the Mediterranean coast, and what he called a huge emerging demand for technology services in Arab countries.Mr. Salqan worked in Silicon Valley in California early in his career, and then returned home about 15 years ago to found Jaffa.Net, with one branch in Ramallah and another in Nablus in the northern West Bank. Jaffa.Net is working on mobile banking applications, and it will soon open an office in the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar.Many people here viewed Cisco’s arrival in 2008 as a turning point for the industry. It started by offering a year’s research and development financing to companies in Ramallah, and then began hiring Palestinian engineers on regular outsourcing contracts. More recently, it invested $5 million in Sadara Ventures, said to be the first venture capital fund focusing on the Palestinian territories.Holding face-to-face meetings with Israel-based customers and investors is not always easy, despite the short distances. Mr. Husseini of LionHeart said his company had held meetings at Biankini Beach on the Dead Sea, south of Jericho, not because of the resort setting but because it was accessible to people from either side of the Israeli security cordon.Zika Abzuk, Cisco’s senior manager for corporate affairs in Israel, related one instance when she and a team of Israeli employees was stuck on one side of a closed military checkpoint near Jericho while 16 Palestinian entrepreneurs they had hoped to confer with were stuck on the other. In the end, they held their meeting on neutral ground: a Bedouin-style reception tent at a gas station near the checkpoint.'"
"'12-07-30,'0','A few significant rulings in favor of one side or the other, industry and patent experts say, could shape the competitive landscape in smartphones and a sister industry, tablet computers. Court decisions, they say, can provide the basis for negotiating the terms and cost of licensing and cross-licensing of patents — or for keeping certain patented features exclusive to one company.“Once you determine who is the genuine innovator, and in what technologies on the product, you reset the playing field,” said Kevin G. Rivette, a Silicon Valley patent consultant and former vice president for intellectual property strategy for I.B.M.But to bring a real shift in the marketplace, Mr. Rivette added, one side must have “strong patents, not incremental ones.”That issue is much debated, and litigated, in the smartphone arena.Apple scored some points in June. Judge Lucy H. Koh, who will also preside over the jury trial that begins this week, issued a preliminary injunction against Samsung, ordering it to stop selling its Galaxy Nexus smartphone in the United States.Judge Koh found that Samsung had infringed on an Apple patent for a “universal interface,” which broadly describes crucial ingredients found in Siri, Apple’s question-answering application (though the patent itself was filed by Apple before it acquired Siri in 2010).But the power of smartphone patents in general suffered a blow in another federal court in June.Richard A. Posner, a prominent federal appeals court judge in Chicago, dismissed a case involving Apple and Google’s Motorola Mobility subsidiary. In his “pox on both of your houses” ruling, Judge Posner ridiculed Apple’s broad claims for its user-experience patents and Motorola’s claim that Apple should pay it a rich royalty on its basic communications patents. Both companies are appealing that ruling.Fierce patent battles in new industries have been the rule for more than a century, from the steam engine to semiconductors. The lessons of history are decidedly mixed.Sometimes, patent warriors can hold off rivals for years, as the Wright brothers did in the airplane business — though the cost in time, money and innovative energy diverted was daunting even then. In 1912, Wilbur Wright wrote, “When we think what we might have accomplished if we had been able to devote this time to experiments, we are very sad.”In smartphones, some analysts say, the sheer number of patents and the speed of innovation in product development undermine the power of patents. Because a smartphone combines many communications and computing technologies, as many as 250,000 patents may touch the device, according to estimates by RPX, a patent licensing company.“You necessarily litigate individual patents, but there are thousands of patents behind the ones in court,” said Mark A. Lemley, a patent expert at the Stanford Law School. “That complexity and the speed of innovation may well make it easier to invent around the patent system in smartphones.”Indeed, for its new Galaxy models, Samsung developed an alternative to one of the Apple-patented features cited in this week’s trial.One of Apple’s many patents on user-experience programming covers its “rubberbanding” or “bounce” feature — when a user pulls a finger from the top of the touch screen to the bottom, the digital page bounces. On the new Samsung phone, the same finger stroke brings a blue glow at the bottom of the screen, not a bounce.“There is no single killer patent in this lawsuit,” said Florian Mueller, a patent analyst and blogger. “Apple cannot deal a knockout blow to Samsung.”Trial briefs filed last week lay out the narrative and some of the details that Apple and Samsung plan to present in court.Apple asserts that Samsung made “a deliberate decision to copy” the iPhone and iPad, in both product design and software that creates the user experience. The unredacted version of Apple’s filing quotes internal Samsung documents saying that its smartphone design “looked like it copied the iPhone too much” and that “innovation is needed.” Another analysis done for Samsung concluded that the icons on its phone were “too iPhone-like” and were “strongly associated with the iPhone UI,” or user interface.In its brief, Samsung contends Apple is using patents to try to “stifle legitimate competition and limit consumer choice to maintain its historically exorbitant profits.”Samsung cites internal Apple documents and deposition testimony to conclude that Apple borrowed its ideas from others, especially Sony. Apple, according to Samsung, was clearly innovative in refining the ideas of others, but it was not the original inventor.Samsung, quoting its own documents, said it had touch-screen phones in development before the iPhone was introduced in January 2007, pointing to the Samsung F700 model. (The F700 had a touch screen, but also a pullout keyboard underneath.)According to Samsung, the corporate documents Apple quotes in its brief come from “benchmarking” sessions conducted by Samsung, a standard industry practice.“Apple,” the Samsung brief observed, citing deposition testimony, “also assembled an ‘Android war room,’ where its employees can study Android products.”'"
"'12-07-30,'0','How would Don Quixote behave if he were a cat? Would he hiss at windmills?“Skippyjon Jones,” the latest family musical in Theatreworks USA’s Free Summer Theater Program, suggests an answer. The title character, a Siamese cat, may not share all Quixote’s qualities, but he does have an impossible dream: to be a Chihuahua. Not just any Chihuahua, but a swashbuckling, sword-fighting, romantically noble one.Adapted from Judy Schachner’s picture book of the same title (she’s written and illustrated an entire series about her hero’s trans-species exploits), “Skippyjon Jones” follows her story closely: Skippyjon (Austen Nash Boone), always pretending to be something else, decides that his big ears and head are more Chihuahualike than Siamese. Costuming himself as the dashing dog El Skippito Friskito, he enters his closet, where he seemingly travels to another land.Narnia it’s not: Skippyjon finds himself in Mexico, where Los Chimichangos (José Restrepo, Veronica Reyes, Gabrielle Ruiz and Graham Stevens), a band of Chihuahuas, believe that he’s the magical dog a prophecy said would save them from Alfredo Buzzito (also Mr. Restrepo), the giant terrorizing bee who steals all their beans.At this point adults may fear that they’re about to be trapped in an hourlong Taco Bell commercial. But “Skippyjon Jones” offers far more rewards, even if it does involve Chihuahuas with exaggerated Spanish accents. Kevin Del Aguila, who wrote the book and lyrics, has added a little feminism to the plot. Here the Chihuahua Rosalita (Ms. Ruiz) longs to be allowed to play fetch like her male peers. She also suspects that El Skippito is a cheat-o: Why does he seem averse to doggy delights like sniffing behinds and drinking from the toilet? (Funny, one of my cats does both. Is she a closet Chihuahua?)Mr. Del Aguila’s witty lyrics — Skippyjon and his siblings are taught to “just say no” to catnip — are well matched by Eli Bolin’s multitextured score. Mr. Bolin, who composes for “Sesame Street,” offers plenty of Latin influences, but he also knows how to write energized, upbeat melodies.Directed by Peter Flynn, the young actors nimbly portray multiple roles — and species. And, refreshingly, this is one family entertainment where you don’t have to root for either cats or dogs. Only that greedy insect gets a bad rep.'"

"'12-07-30,'0','If Sunday’s performance further emphasized to the wider world of sports that the United States team is not made up of typical Olympians, so did what happened afterward. The United States won by 27 points in a game France kept close for all of one quarter, and yet N.B.A. All-Star after N.B.A. All-Star lamented the sluggish start, which resulted from an  atypical foulfest.Lest anyone forget the star power on the United States roster, the players waited some 45 minutes to emerge from their locker room, many clad in sweats and wearing sunglasses indoors. Perhaps that resulted from a deep, philosophical discussion of international basketball rules. Perhaps they later compared the hugs they received from Michelle Obama after the game. Or perhaps the team watched “Eat Pray Love.”Regardless, for a team that entered the Olympics with an undersize roster that looked, if not vulnerable, then beatable under the right circumstances, Sunday marked another assumed test that really was no test at all. The United States will next play Tunisia, another member of Group A, on Tuesday night.Jerry Colangelo, the chairman of USA Basketball, predicted this type of performance, if not in so many words. As spring turned to summer, he seemed to lose a post player from his roster pool every other week. Out went Dwight Howard. Out went Blake Griffin. And Chris Bosh. And LaMarcus Aldridge. The United States could have fielded a frontcourt with its injured forwards and centers.For weeks, Colangelo answered question after question about players who could no longer help him, about a team supposedly weak inside. In USA Basketball’s two final exhibition games in Spain, Colangelo insisted this squad was deeper, more athletic and more experienced than the 2008 version, which captured the gold medal in Beijing.While a rematch with Spain in the gold medal contest would continue to test the theory of whether the United States can triumph with one center on its roster, Colangelo’s appraisal seems less like wishful thinking with each lopsided win.“I like this team,” Colangelo said. “I like this team a lot.”In the post, one pleasant surprise for Coach Mike Krzyzewski was Kevin Love. In recent days, Colangelo criticized Love’s passive play in five exhibition games, although the truth is, Love did not play all that much.Against France, Love played 14 minutes, 2 more than Kobe Bryant. Love scored 14 points, too, 4 more than Bryant. This happened in part because of foul trouble, in part because the United States trampled France, but regardless, it represented progress.“Every guy is here for a reason,” said James, already in mid-Olympic coach-speak form. “It’s great,” he added, that Love is “able to come off the bench and give us a great spark.”“We’re going to need him.”The more games this United States team has played, the more its players seem to have settled into their roles. Durant: unstoppable scorer impossible to defend behind the shorter international 3-point line. Paul: engine for transition offense, distributor extraordinaire. Davis: fan favorite in mop-up duty.James’s role, though, remains more difficult to describe, mainly because it contains so many facets, such nuance. Krzyzewski asked James in 2008 to call out defensive signals, to direct the Americans on the less glamorous, most important end of the floor.In 2012, James still performs such duties without complaint, but on Sunday, as on most days, he also guarded centers and power forwards, ran the offense like a point forward and cheered his teammates from the bench. He did everything but fill cups with sports drink and hand them out.James finished with 9 points, 8 assists and 5 rebounds, numbers that failed to fully explain his impact. He took fewer shots than Love, the 10th man.In the end, James did not need to score. Not with all the dunks.'"
"'12-07-30,'0','LONDON — Another athlete has been thrown out of the Olympics for making disparaging remarks on Twitter. On Monday, the Swiss Olympic delegation said that it had sent home Michel Morganella, a soccer player, for making insulting remarks about South Koreans after the South Korean soccer team beat the Swiss, 2-1, on Sunday.In a statement, Gian Gilli, the head of the Swiss Olympic delegation, said that Morganella, 23, had “said something insulting and discriminatory” about the South Korean soccer team. “We condemn these remarks,” he said, adding that they “contradict the Olympic Charter.”In a separate statement, Morganella said that he had “made a huge mistake” by sending the Twitter message after the game and that he was “truly sorry for the people in South Korea, for footballers, but also for the Swiss delegation and the Swiss football in general.”Morganella’s message has been removed from his Twitter account, though Swiss news media quoted a message in French slang that expressed hostility to South Koreans and questioned their intelligence.Last week, a Greek triple jumper was thrown off the team for posting a derogatory comment on Twitter about African immigrants in Greece. The athlete, Paraskevi Papahristou, 23, posted the comment in Greek on July 22, and it was resent on Twitter over 100 times.The expulsions highlight the growing tension around the use of social media by athletes. Some groups like the United States Olympic Committee have established guidelines and training, while the International Olympic Committee has said that “posting, blogs and tweets should at all times conform to the Olympic spirit and fundamental principles of Olympism as contained in the Olympic Charter, be dignified and in good taste, and not contain vulgar or obscene words or images.”'"

"'12-07-31,'0','Bulgaria is perched precariously between Serbia, crisis-afflicted Greece and a rising regional power in Turkey, its next-door neighbor to the southeast. A member of NATO as well as the European Union, it has been working, with the help of its Western partners, to overcome a legacy of corruption and organized crime.The country has a sizable indigenous Muslim population, estimated at 10 percent, mostly ethnic Turks but also Slavic Muslims and immigrants from the Middle East. “Bulgaria has a Muslim minority. We have many Arabs who came to the country and we don’t want them to feel stigmatized in any way or form because of this act,” Nickolay Mladenov, Bulgaria’s foreign minister, said in an interview.“This is a quiet country,” Mr. Mladenov added, “and we would like to keep it quiet.”The country’s commitments and international presence have changed in recent years, reflecting its new partnerships. Bulgaria had soldiers stationed in Iraq and still has about 600 troops among the NATO force in Afghanistan. Mr. Mladenov has tried to engage Bulgaria in the Arab Spring; in May, members of the Syrian opposition met in Bulgaria.In a flurry of activity after the bombing, Bulgarian officials quickly released video of the bomber waiting outside the arrivals gate of the airport. But that has been replaced by stillness, as investigators wait for the bomber’s DNA and fingerprints to be run through international databases. Mr. Mladenov dismissed criticism of the slow pace of the investigation. “Let’s give the people working on this enough space to do their work,” he said.The country’s prime minister, Boyko Borissov, said last week that the attack was the work of an “exceptionally experienced” group of conspirators. Many of the statements made by officials here seem aimed at deflecting criticism at home over the investigation.“The more time passes the slimmer the chances are that they will be able to identify the attacker,” said Mihail Mikov, a member of Parliament for the opposition Socialist Party. “If they don’t find out who the bomber was within 10 or 15 days, I don’t believe this will happen,” Mr. Mikov said.Tsvetan Tsvetanov, Bulgaria’s interior minister, said in an interview that investigators were further along than they could publicly discuss without jeopardizing new leads. “It’s very important when you talk to the public that you say something where you have evidence and proof, and not just go and give opinions,” he said.Mr. Tsvetanov said that the bomber had been in Bulgaria for 20 days before the attack, and that that investigators had learned where the fake Michigan driver’s license belonging to the suicide bomber had been made. (“Outside the region,” he said.) “We also have suggestions about the groups who might have organized such a terrorist act but they can’t be mentioned publicly until the investigation is over,” Mr. Tsvetanov said.When the bombing took place, top Bulgarian officials were at a news conference in response to a European Commission report that said its progress in combating organized crime and corruption was “not yet sustainable and irreversible.” The special prosecutor and special court likely to handle the terrorism case began operations only on Jan. 1 of this year.“From my perspective, no one was really seeing terrorism as particularly a field which was going to be active,” said Katia Hristova-Valtcheva, head of the cabinet at the Ministry of Justice.The former head of the National Intelligence Service, Lt. Gen. Kircho Kirov, said he was not surprised by the attack. “In the last five or six years, we have had very concrete information that organizations like Hezbollah and structures connected to Al Qaeda as well as some individuals were ready to prepare attacks,” General Kirov said.In January, before he left the service, there was “very concrete information about attacks against Israeli tourists,” General Kirov said. “We organized measures to prevent them.” The winter tourist season passed without incident. The summer season did not.'"
"'12-07-31,'0','Mr. Cuomo’s office said there had been a conversation with Mr. Perez, but disputed his recollection; it said Mr. Cuomo told Mr. Perez that Mr. Valle, the chief counsel, could not represent the agency because he would probably have to testify.“Perez was distressed at Valle’s disqualification as counsel,” Mr. Bamberger said.Sharon L. McCarthy, a Manhattan lawyer who was recruited by Mr. Cuomo to take charge of the investigation of the State Police, said: “I conducted the investigation in a way that witnesses felt comfortable bringing their lawyers. I did not ever discourage anyone from bringing their lawyer.” She also said she found it unlikely that Mr. Cuomo did so either, and she recalled most witnesses’ appearing with lawyers.The dispute emerged as Mr. Cuomo faced scrutiny for his handling of a separate State Police inquiry in 2007. His aides recently shielded documents related to that investigation from public view in the state archives, after reporters sought to examine them.It also brought attention to what is certain to be a closely scrutinized chapter in Mr. Cuomo’s biography as his national reputation grows: his tenure as attorney general, when he took on politically sensitive inquiries that at times involved his political rivals.The issue came to light in the last week when reporters for The Times and The Times Union of Albany obtained copies of sworn testimony by Mr. Valle, who served for two decades as the chief counsel of the State Police.Mr. Valle testified that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, had discouraged agency officials from bringing lawyers to the investigation, and then repeated the claim in a memorandum to the office of David A. Paterson, who was then the governor. Neither Ms. McCarthy nor Governor Paterson’s office followed up on the claim.Details of the testimony, which was given on Dec. 30, 2008, also raise questions about the investigation itself, which was meant to examine political interference at the State Police, and whether Mr. Cuomo’s office produced a thorough report of its findings.Seemingly relevant information appears to have been left out of Mr. Cuomo’s final report — specifically details of a reputed effort by the Paterson administration to remove at least 10 white troopers who were members of the governor’s security detail and replace them with black or Latino troopers, leading to an extraordinary standoff with State Police officials, who viewed doing that as illegal and inviting a discrimination lawsuit.In addition, when Mr. Valle was interviewed by investigators, he was never asked about the more than five years he spent as chief police counsel during the administration of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the current governor’s father.Mr. Valle, known as an aggressive defender of the often-embattled State Police force, has been one of the few public officials who is regularly critical of Mr. Cuomo.“In 33 years of practice as a prosecutor, assistant attorney general and chief counsel to the State Police, I never heard of a prosecutor threatening that if witnesses retained a lawyer, it would be held against them,” Mr. Valle said.“I do not need to inform you of Glenn Valle’s hostility to the A.G. and his office, which is well documented in the press,” he said.Mr. Valle also outlined the accusation in a Dec. 30, 2008, memorandum to Peter J. Kiernan, who served as counsel to Governor Paterson. Mr. Kiernan said that he did not remember receiving the memo but that he had heard similar claims.“I don’t think they were ever truly directed at Attorney General Cuomo, but rather somebody working in the attorney general’s office,” he said, but he dismissed the reports as hearsay.Legal experts said if the claim about Mr. Cuomo were proven true, it would amount to a violation of legal ethics, but it is unlikely to result in further consequences for him.Another former State Police superintendent, Preston Felton, who retired in early 2008, said he had been told by a number of people about the reputed conversation between Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Perez. He also said he was not surprised that the claim, and other details in Mr. Valle’s testimony, were left out of the report. Mr. Felton ended up invoking the Fifth Amendment in the inquiry, and was cited for an ethics violation in an earlier inquiry.“It’s the way politicians operate,” Mr. Felton said. “They’re going to cover their own. They have a code that’s all their own. And obviously, during it, I was made aware Cuomo was telling people, if you come in with a lawyer, you’re guilty.”From the beginning, the investigation was an oddity — it was initiated at the request of Mr. Paterson, who suggested there was a rogue political unit working inside the State Police. Mr. Felton called the whole investigation a “witch hunt.”Mr. Bamberger said the attorney general’s office “conducted literally hundreds of interviews of state employees, as well as private employees, and representation of counsel was a well-established, respected right, and virtually without exception in four years, every witness in a significant matter had counsel representation.”'"
"'12-07-31,'0','Despite their rampant public displays of support — in mid-May, the new offensive line coach Dave DeGuglielmo vowed that Hunter would start “until they ship him out of this building or until they shoot me dead in my office” — the Jets were all the while seeking a potential upgrade.At last check, DeGuglielmo is alive (and spouting colorful language at his charges). And as Jeff Otah, Hunter’s potential competition, misses practice after practice with an ailing knee that threatens to jeopardize his trade from the Carolina Panthers, Hunter is dominating the repetitions at his position, impressing Coach Rex Ryan with his grasp of the new system. “There’s no doubt,” Ryan said.The criticism, the trade rumors, the speculation about his job security — Hunter heard it all. And, he added, it does not bother him. At least not as much as it once did or as it still could.“It made me tougher, that’s for sure,” he said. “It made me tough.”From Hunter’s perspective, his 2011 season, in which he yielded 11 sacks and committed 11 penalties, was not as terrible as is perceived; for neutralizing Cameron Wake of Miami in Week 6, Hunter was awarded a game ball. But, he said, “When I had bad games, they were bad.”Week 1 against Dallas, on the Jets’ first offensive play, DeMarcus Ware trampled Hunter and pummeled Mark Sanchez for a sack. Week 2 against Jacksonville, Hunter committed two penalties for 25 yards. Week 15 against Philadelphia, Hunter had two false-start penalties and allowed two sacks.As the scrutiny intensified, Hunter coped by asking teammates for advice. He sought out Sanchez, the backup quarterback Mark Brunell and D’Brickashaw Ferguson, who struggled his first two seasons at left tackle.“Aside from being my teammate, Wayne’s my friend,” Ferguson said. “I helped him any way I could.”Hunter also consulted with Sara Hickmann, the team psychologist.“Usually in the past, I would have held it in,” Hunter said. “I took a different approach this time. As cliché as it sounds, we’re people, too. You feel it.”Speaking with friends and his former coaches, Hunter never complained, even as the pressure of replacing the longtime stalwart Damien Woody weighed on him.“I know it wasn’t easy for him, but he accepted it,” said Mike Cavanaugh, Hunter’s position coach at the University of Hawaii. “Wayne thinks — like I do — that his best football is still ahead of him.”Hunter, 31, approached this off-season with the zeal and focus that he revealed at Radford, when he took the SAT one Saturday morning instead of attending a football function. He analyzed videotape of all his games.His self-evaluation led him to conclude that he needed to improve his lateral quickness, his change of direction, his reaction time. So he called a friend, Kenny Patton, a former teammate at Hawaii who now works as a personal trainer.“One of the first things he said was ‘I’m real hungry,’ ” Patton said. “He wanted to become a better athlete.”Over 12 intense sessions, held in broiling heat and stifling humidity, Patton tailored workouts specific to the demands of an N.F.L. offensive lineman: quick bursts, up-tempo hurdle drills, plyometrics. Hunter sweated through three or four T-shirts every workout.By the end, his agility had improved, Patton said. So had his conditioning.“They want to get the person that they saw in the playoffs in 2010 — they want to get that Wayne,” Hunter said, referring to his starting turn after Woody was injured. “It’s here. It’s definitely here. I just have to be more consistent.”At the end of those drills with Patton at Radford, Hunter would not leave immediately. He waited for the next generation of Radford linemen to finish its workouts and, in his distinctive baritone (“Wayne’s got that radio voice,” Cavanaugh said), regaled the group with stories of life in the N.F.L.They talked about athletic accomplishments and scholarly pursuits. His speeches were riveting, Patton said. The students sat rapt. They were listening to someone just like them. They were listening to an underdog.A spate of hamstring and groin injuries — to wide receivers Jeremy Kerley, Chaz Schilens and Santonio Holmes and cornerback Darrelle Revis — prompted Rex Ryan to add an additional 10 minutes of stretching and warm-ups to the beginning of practice. Ryan was so leery of more muscle tightness that he canceled the Jets’ two-minute offense Monday. ... Revis took part in practice after sitting out drills Sunday.'"
"'12-07-31,'0','Dan Cathy, the president and chief operating officer of Chick-fil-A, the fast-food chain based in Atlanta, recently dragged his company into the middle of the same-sex marriage debate. He told one interviewer that the country is “inviting God’s judgment on our nation when we shake our fist at him and say, ‘We know better than you as to what constitutes a marriage.’ ” Antigay remarks like these are offensive. But they are not a reason to kick the company out of town, as the officials in Boston and Chicago have threatened to do.Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York City has the correct take on the matter. Mr. Cathy and his family have long supported efforts to deny same-sex couples the right to marry. Mr. Bloomberg worked hard for marriage equality in New York State. But, said Mr. Bloomberg, “You can’t have a test for what the owners’ personal views are before you decide to give a permit to do something in the city.”Other officials were considerably less sensitive to the fact that controversial, even hurtful, political views are protected by the First Amendment. One Chicago alderman unwisely threatened to try to use his powers over city businesses to shut out future Chick-fil-A franchises.Speaker Christine Quinn of the New York City Council also overreached when she sent a letter, on Council stationery, calling for the president of New York University to “sever your relationship” with a Chick-fil-A eatery on campus. “Let me be clear,” she wrote, “I do not want establishments in my city that hold such discriminatory views.”As a gay woman who recently got married, Ms. Quinn’s anger about Mr. Cathy’s comments is understandable. And she stressed on Monday that the letter was “solely my own opinion.” But, as a powerful city leader and a leading candidate for mayor, she and others in city governments should take care not to be seen muscling aside businesses whose owners don’t agree with their views. That won’t work, especially in a city as big, diverse and opinionated as New York.'"
"'12-07-31,'0','With an I.R.A. account of $20 million to $101 million, the tax savings would be more than a few pennies.The I.R.A. also allows Mr. Romney to diversify his large holdings tax-free, avoiding the 15 percent tax on capital gains that would otherwise apply. His financial disclosure further reveals that his I.R.A. freed him from paying currently the 35 percent income tax on hundreds of thousands of dollars of interest income each year.Given the extraordinary size of his I.R.A., we have to presume that Mr. Romney valued the assets he put in his retirement account at far less than he would have sold them for. Otherwise it is quite a trick to turn contributions that are limited to $30,000 to $50,000 a year into the $20 million to $101 million he now has there. But we cannot be certain; his meager disclosure of tax records and financial information does not indicate what kind of assets were put into the I.R.A.Mr. Romney’s Cayman Islands and Bermuda corporations also probably allowed him to avoid limitations on deductions for investment expenditures that would otherwise apply. So we don’t need any more tax returns to know that Mr. Romney is an Olympic-level athlete at the tax avoidance game. Rich people don’t send their money to Bermuda or the Cayman Islands for the weather.Moreover, we have no clue whether Mr. Romney paid any gift tax on transfers, now valued at $100 million, to a trust he set up in 1995 for the benefit of his five sons. Until this year, the federal gift tax had a lifetime exemption of $1 million, and it taxed gifts in excess of that amount at rates between 29 and 44 percent. A gift of $100 million to one’s children could, therefore, require paying a tax of as much as $29 million to $44 million.But every good tax professional knows that gift tax returns are rarely audited, except after the transferor’s death. And normally the I.R.S. cannot challenge such a return after three years from its filing. But if the values of the gifts were not properly appraised and disclosed on Mr. Romney’s gift tax returns, a challenge may still be possible. If he did not file any gift tax return, he would still be liable for the tax, plus interest and penalties.Based on his aggressive tax planning, revealed in the 2010 returns he has released and his approval of a notably dicey tax avoidance strategy in 1994 when he headed the audit committee of the board of Marriott International, my bet is that — if Mr. Romney filed a gift tax return for these transfers at all — he put a low or even zero value on the gifts, certainly a small fraction of the price at which he would have sold the transferred assets to an unrelated party. Otherwise, he should be happy to release his gift tax returns. According to a partner at Mr. Romney’s trustee’s law firm, valuing carried interests, such as Mr. Romney’s interests in the private equity company Bain Capital, at zero for gift tax purposes was common advice given to clients like Mr. Romney in the 1990s and early 2000s.If detected, undervaluing large gifts to one’s children could provoke large penalties from the I.R.S. These are the kinds of tax penalties that even multinational corporations try to avoid because they fear how the public would react to the adverse publicity that would inevitably follow.To settle these questions, Mr. Romney should release his gift tax returns, or other documents showing how he valued his transfers to his family’s trust and to his I.R.A., and at least three additional years of income tax returns.No one should begrudge Mr. Romney or his family the wealth they have earned. But if he has not paid the taxes that apply to transfers of such wealth, this should concern us all. After all, who do you think pays for the shortfall?'"
"'12-07-31,'0','But the relationship still has a tinderbox quality, riven by differences over C.I.A. drone strikes in Pakistan’s tribal belt, the Afghan war and, most contentiously, the Haqqani network. The arguments are well worn: American officials say the Pakistani military’s spy agency is covertly aiding the insurgents; Pakistani officials deny the accusation and contend the Obama administration is deflecting attention from its own failings in Afghanistan.But a new boldness from the Haqqanis that aims at mass American casualties, combined with simmering political tension, has reduced the room for ambiguity between the two countries. Inside the administration, it is a commonly held view that the United States is “one major attack” away from unilateral action against Pakistan — diplomatically or perhaps even militarily, one senior official said.“If 50 U.S. troops were blown to smithereens by the Haqqanis, or they penetrated the U.S. Embassy in and killed several diplomats — that would be the game changer,” he said.American officials recently considered what that could mean. Days after the Salerno attack, the White House held a series of interagency meetings to weigh its options in the event of a major success by the Haqqanis against American troops.Salerno had come uncomfortably close. Although just two Americans were killed, the attackers had penetrated the defenses of a major base to within yards of a dining hall used by hundreds of soldiers.The meetings yielded a list of about 30 possible responses, according to a senior official who was briefed on the deliberations — everything from withdrawing the Islamabad ambassador, to a flurry of intensified on Haqqani targets in Pakistan’s tribal belt, to American or Afghan commando raids on Haqqani hide-outs in the same area.“We looked at the A to Z of how to get the Pakistanis’ attention,” the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity, as did other American and Pakistani officials interviewed about the issue.Yet there were no easy answers. Officials concluded that most options ran the risk of setting off a wider conflict with Pakistan’s nuclear-armed military. “It came down to the fact that there wasn’t much we could do,” the official said. Other senior officials confirmed the broad details of his account; many noted that most contingency plans are never transformed into actions.At the heart of the conundrum is the Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, or ISI, and its new chief, General Islam.He is a largely unknown quantity in Washington, and much of this week’s trip is likely to focus on relationship building with American officials, including the director of the C.I.A., . But the tone has already been set by Congress: in the past month, both the House and the Senate have passed bills that urge Secretary of State to designate the Haqqani network a “foreign terrorist organization.”“The Haqqani network is engaged in a reign of terror,” said Representative Mike Rogers, a Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. “Now is the time for action, not simply paperwork and talk.”The Haqqanis’ formidable reputation comes from a series of “swarm” attacks that have struck at American efforts to ensure a smooth and public transition of power to President by the end of 2014. Since 2008, Haqqani suicide attackers have struck the Indian Embassy, five-star hotels and restaurants and, last September, the headquarters of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and the American Embassy.The headlines created by such violence are disproportionate to their military significance: Haqqani operations account for one-tenth of the attacks on ISAF troops, and perhaps 15 percent of casualties, senior American officials estimate. Other countries do not even consider the Haqqanis to be the most dangerous group sheltering in Pakistan, a mantle usually awarded to the more ideologically driven , which was behind the 2008 attacks in , .Yet their success is rooted in the sanctuary enjoyed by Haqqani leadership in North Waziristan, where, at the very least, they are unmolested by the Pakistani military.That relationship stretches to the anti-Soviet resistance of the 1980s, when the ISI funneled C.I.A. money and weapons to Haqqani fighters. The Pakistani agency continued to send funds during the 1990s, according to a new report by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point.Today, the ISI admits that it maintains regular contact with the Haqqanis, but denies providing operational support. “Doesn’t the C.I.A. have contacts with the people it is fighting?” said a senior ISI official. “In intelligence work, you need to ingress to find out what the other side is doing.”American and other Western officials, citing intelligence reports, say the ISI and the Haqqanis do more than just talk. Pakistani intelligence allows Haqqani operatives to run legitimate businesses in Pakistan, facilitates their travel to Persian Gulf states, and has continued to donate money. Senior Haqqani figures own houses in the capital, Islamabad, where their relatives live unmolested.A Pakistani expert on organized crime, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Said Jan ’Abd al-Salam, a Haqqani supporter listed as a terrorist financier by the American government, lived in Islamabad’s upmarket F7 neighborhood for periods of 2008 and 2009. A Western diplomat said he had seen credible reports that the group’s leader, , dined openly in a city center restaurant this year.But, officials and some analysts caution, such links do not amount to ISI support for attacks on Americans. They may point to something more subtle: a containment policy that is devised to prevent Haqqani violence inside Pakistan, all the while providing a strategic card to help influence the future of Afghanistan.“We think the Haqqani network has an ongoing relationship with the ISI,” a senior Obama administration official said. “But I am not convinced there is a command-and-control relationship between the ISI and those attacks.”One difficulty in determining the truth is the fragmentary nature of Western intelligence: a mosaic of satellite images, intercepted phone calls and human intelligence. “It’s like on the other side of that door there’s a party going on,” said the senior administration official, pointing to his office door. “You’re trying to find out what’s going on by peeping through the keyhole, or holding a glass to the door. But you only get pieces.”In many ways, the Haqqanis are their own masters. Although they pledge allegiance to the Afghan Taliban, they enjoy financial autonomy thanks to a tribal crime empire based on extortion, kidnapping and smuggling. They draw operational support from other groups sheltering in Waziristan, including .In that sense, several officials said, the ISI may be serving the Haqqani agenda more than the other way around. “Their interests are not always aligned,” said an American intelligence official who tracks the Haqqanis closely.American efforts to kill Haqqani leaders with C.I.A. drone strikes in Waziristan and Afghanistan have met with little success, two senior officials said, partly because Sirajuddin Haqqani surrounds himself with civilians — often women and children — at his base in the town of Miram Shah.The United States has long pressured Pakistan to attack the Haqqanis in North Waziristan, but the military says its forces are overstretched. “It’s not that we are unwilling to go against them; we just don’t have the resources,” the ISI official said.But after the Salerno attack in June, the army chief, , privately told American officials he would launch a three-phase military operation against the Haqqanis over the coming 12 months.Most American officials, however, say they are not counting on that promise. One remarked with a sardonic touch, “This is the most delayed campaign in the history of modern warfare.”'"
"'12-07-31,'0','LONDON — Another athlete has been thrown out of the Olympics for making disparaging remarks on Twitter. On Monday, the Swiss Olympic delegation said that it had sent home Michel Morganella, a soccer player, for making insulting remarks about South Koreans after the South Korean soccer team beat the Swiss, 2-1, on Sunday.In a statement, Gian Gilli, the head of the Swiss Olympic delegation, said that Morganella, 23, had “said something insulting and discriminatory” about the South Korean soccer team. “We condemn these remarks,” he said, adding that they “contradict the Olympic Charter.”In a separate statement, Morganella said that he had “made a huge mistake” by sending the Twitter message after the game and that he was “truly sorry for the people in South Korea, for footballers, but also for the Swiss delegation and the Swiss football in general.”Morganella’s message has been removed from his Twitter account, though Swiss news media quoted a message in French slang that expressed hostility to South Koreans and questioned their intelligence.Last week, a Greek triple jumper was thrown off the team for posting a derogatory comment on Twitter about African immigrants in Greece. The athlete, Paraskevi Papahristou, 23, posted the comment in Greek on July 22, and it was resent on Twitter over 100 times.The expulsions highlight the growing tension around the use of social media by athletes. Some groups like the United States Olympic Committee have established guidelines and training, while the International Olympic Committee has said that “posting, blogs and tweets should at all times conform to the Olympic spirit and fundamental principles of Olympism as contained in the Olympic Charter, be dignified and in good taste, and not contain vulgar or obscene words or images.”'"
"'12-07-31,'0','“That’s pretty unbelievable,” David Sharpe, a Canadian swimmer, said of Ye’s finishing kick on Saturday, in which she covered her final 50 meters in 28.93, faster than Lochte’s 29.10. “No one really understands how that happened.”Ye swam her final 100 meters of the 400 I.M. in 58.68 seconds. Lochte was only three-hundredths of a second faster. No one could immediately remember a woman closing faster than 61 seconds.“Interesting,” said , an American with 12 Olympic medals.“Insane,” said Stephanie Rice of , the 2008 Olympic champion and former world-record holder in the 400 I.M. “Fifty-eight is out of control.”Lochte made a cordial joke about being outkicked. On Monday, , who finished fourth in the men’s 400 I.M., smiled at a question about Ye’s closing speed and said: “She almost outswam me, too. We were all pretty shocked. It’s pretty impressive that she went that fast.”No swimmers accused Ye, who is 5 feet 8 inches and weighs 141 pounds, of using illicit substances to fuel her kick. Medalists and, at random, other athletes are tested at the Games.But John Leonard, an American who is executive director of the World Swimming Coaches Association and has long voiced suspicions of doping in , told The Guardian on Monday that he found Ye’s performance “disturbing.”Caitlin Leverenz, an American who finished third in Ye’s heat in the 200 on Monday, said: “The Chinese have had a history in the past of doping, so I don’t think people are crazy to point fingers, but I don’t think that’s my job to do right now. I’m just trying to do my best.”Frank Busch, national team director for USA Swimming, was more gracious, calling Ye’s final 100 meters on Saturday “more than remarkable, phenomenal.”Was he concerned that what Ye had done was not legitimate?“I would never go there,” Busch said.Instead, he mentioned Bolt of , who had seldom run 100 meters before the 2008 Beijing Games but shattered records in the 100, the 200 and the 4x100-meter relay. There must be room left, Busch suggested, for success built solely on talent, coaching, ambition and the wonder of youth.“These kids work really hard,” he said. “I don’t know what the Chinese are doing. But I don’t think anybody saw Usain Bolt running that fast in 2008.There are times you have phenoms coming up that surprise you with what they can do.”Busch did not mention her name, but Janet Evans was once one of those phenoms. At the 1988 Olympics, Evans, then 17, outswam even the East Germans and won three gold medals. She was fully embraced, while Ye faces public skepticism. Many will find that unfair. Perhaps it is.Yet China has brought uncertainty upon itself. Ye has never tested positive for banned substances. But in the 1980s and ’90s, according to news accounts, more than 50 Chinese swimmers did. Seven were caught by a surprise test at the 1994 Asian Games in , . One swimmer, Yuan Yuan, was caught with 13 vials of human at the 1998 world championships in , Australia.There has long been debate about whether doping in China was state-sponsored or directed by individual coaches. A former chief doctor for the Chinese gymnastics team told The Sydney Morning Herald last week that in the 1980s, it was state-sponsored.Some say embarrassment over doping scandals led China to scrutinize its athletes more carefully. In any case, the dominance of China’s female swimmers in the mid-1990s has ebbed. China won only one gold medal in swimming at each of the past two Olympics, including the 2008 Beijing Games.Already, it has won two in London. This follows a recent report by the official Xinhua News Agency that in March, a 16-year-old swimmer named Li Zhesi, a former relay champion, tested positive for the blood-boosting drug . Though Ye’s achievement may once have brought only commemoration, it now comes with questions.According to state-run news outlets, Chinese coaches and athletes have taken an oath to remain clean. Some athletes are even said to be avoiding meat, fearing it might be tainted with a banned substance, clenbuterol.“There’s absolutely no problem with doping,” Ye said Monday in translated remarks. “The Chinese team has always had a firm policy about antidoping.”Ye began swimming at 7 and was placed in a sports school in Hangzhou in eastern China. By 14 she began making national and international waves. Last year, Ye won a world title in the 200 I.M. She has also trained in Australia, where Chinese swimmers say they are free from grinding monotony.“In China, we are always used to just train, train, train, study, study, study and get some rest,” said Lu Ying, who won a silver medal Sunday in the women’s 100 butterfly. “Our way of thinking has many limits. And we are bound by them. But in Australia, I can be invited to a barbecue or a breakfast. In China that never happens.”Ye has repeatedly said hard work, not a banned substance, has made her a champion. “If the coach asks me to practice 10,000 meters,” she told The Beijing Morning News, “I would never be lazy to swim 9,900 meters instead.”'"
"'12-07-31,'0','WASHINGTON — At a time of widespread discontent among American expatriates over voting complications, taxation and access to financial institutions, a bill being introduced in Congress on Tuesday would create a presidential commission to take a sweeping look at how the federal government serves those abroad.“Right now, there’s no systemic focus on issues dealing with Americans abroad, and their numbers just keep growing,” said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, the New York Democrat co-sponsoring the legislation.Ms. Maloney, chairwoman of the Americans Abroad Caucus in Congress, said the level of concern she had been hearing from expatriates was “the worst I’ve ever seen it.”The growing pressures on American expatriates stem largely from two events: the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which led to new United States Treasury Department regulations aimed at cracking down on money laundering and on the use of the international banking system by terrorist groups; and the financial crisis of recent years, which similarly brought a crackdown on Americans exploiting banking secrecy in countries like Switzerland to avoid paying taxes.But as a result, and with the Internal Revenue Service devoting substantially more resources to its overseas operations than before, many ordinary expatriates say tax filing has become onerous and many banks are wary of doing business with them.'"
