"'11-12-01,'0','On the unofficial first day of the 2011 free-agent season, the Knicks’ focus seemed to be squarely on 2012.Knicks officials made the requisite calls Wednesday, contacting the agents for Caron Butler, Grant Hill, Kwame Brown, Shannon Brown, Shawne Williams and Jared Jeffries, among others. But their efforts may be hampered by the franchise’s fixation on Chris Paul and the free-agent class of 2012.According to agents who spoke with the Knicks, the team is determined to sign players to one-year deals to maintain salary-cap flexibility next summer, when Paul, Deron Williams and Dwight Howard may become free agents.It was not clear whether the Knicks might veer from that posture to acquire a top-tier free agent, like Butler.The Knicks prefer to trade for Paul, the New Orleans Hornets’ star guard, but they do not have the assets to complete a deal. They also might not have the salary-cap room to sign him next summer. If the cap remains flat, as expected, the Knicks could have as little as $13 million available. Paul will be eligible for a deal starting at $17.4 million.If the Knicks are determined to make room for Paul, they may have to dump Toney Douglas and Iman Shumpert next July. They would also have to avoid signing anyone to more than a one-year contract, knocking them out of the running for the top free agents.The cap-hoarding approach mirrors the Knicks’ stance in 2008 and 2009, when they were saving room for the class of 2010. That strategy netted them Amar’e Stoudemire, Raymond Felton and, indirectly, Carmelo Anthony.'"
"'11-12-01,'0','Steve Phillips’s tenure as general manager of the Mets was marked by his feud with Manager Bobby Valentine. A few years ago, he would have been challenged to say anything good about Valentine.But on Wednesday, Phillips conceded that the bitter battles between the two were largely his own fault and said he regretted how they had affected people’s perceptions of Valentine.“For the longest time I put it all on Bobby,” Phillips said of Valentine, who agreed Tuesday to become the Boston Red Sox’ manager. “In the end I felt like I had won because I stuck around longer than Bobby did. But I let my stuff get in the way of our relationship, and I think that fed into the perception people have of Bobby. It’s too bad, because he’s really not like that at all.”Phillips and Valentine began as allies when working in the Mets’ minor league system in the mid-1990s. Valentine became manager of the Mets in the 1996 season, and Phillips was promoted to general manager in 1997.“I learned more from Bobby than anyone else I ever came across in baseball,” said Phillips, now a commentator with SiriusXM Radio.But after the 1998 season, the relationship fractured in a power dispute, and from then on the two never got along. When Valentine was fired after the 2002 season, Phillips remained as general manager for another half season.'"
"'11-12-01,'0','The last financial crisis was supposed to have killed off financial engineering. And for the most part, it certainly seems to have turned excess leverage and overly complex borrowing structures into a pariah. But Western authorities have embraced them with gusto.Recent responses to the mess in Europe provide the latest examples. The European Financial Stability Facility plans to employ a design that mimics credit derivatives to help the fund get a bigger bang for its buck, even after European leaders publicly criticized the private sector for using them. But with the future of the euro zone uncertain, engineering can’t make up for investor skepticism. The fund may raise just 700 billion euros, barely a third of the most optimistic earlier estimates.Greece’s bailout, meanwhile, offers a sleight of hand that would make investment bankers proud. The current package secures a manageable interest rate for the country, but only by forcing it to invest a portion in bonds that are safer than its own.Many policy responses since the bust have been built with tools used during the heady bull-market days. In 2007, Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, wanted to relieve banks of problems caused by structured investment vehicles by creating a Super-SIV to mop them up. It never got off the ground.Later efforts to help banks offload risky assets or finance new deals — the Public-Private Investment Program, for example — required elaborate architecture and large doses of debt. They ended up being much smaller than initially described.'"
"'11-12-01,'0','Dienst + Dotter, late of East 69th Street and Sag Harbor, has spread out its mostly Scandinavian, mostly 18th-century, thunderously expensive antiques in a new 3,600-square-foot space on Lafayette Street.The pieces here reflect the rarefied appetites of the store’s owner, Jill Dienst, who has worked in the department of European painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; at Didier Aaron, the antiques store; and for Jacques Grange, the interior designer. (Ms. Dienst’s 13-year-old daughter, Emma, is the “dotter” of the store’s name.)You’ll find midcentury original production pieces here, too, like the Danish sconces for $5,850 a pair, above left, and the 1940s makeup mirrors by Poul Henningsen, $3,200 each. The circa-1790 Gustavian sideboard sitting under them, priced at $12,400, has its original paint, and the baroque/rococo chairs on either side, $9,400 for the pair (“they are transitional pieces, which is fun,” Ms. Dienst said), have atmospherically decayed seat cushions.While this reporter gasped for air, Ms. Dienst said soothingly, “I can find you a chair for $500 or $50,000,” and then she explained the pricing calculus used by high-end dealers like her. The highest prices, she said, might be found on pieces like the sideboard, which are in pristine condition because they were kept in one family. The next level, she said, might be a piece that had been painted many times over the years and then scraped down to its original wood, in a process known as dry-scraping.“Sometimes you find the original paint, sometimes you don’t,” Ms. Dienst said. “Then you have to decide, as a dealer, if you paint it as it might have been or leave it as is.” The former practice can bring the price way down, she said. “Though you’re still getting an 18th-century original, not something ‘in the Gustavian style.’ That’s an important distinction.”So what is $500 here? Simple slat-backed 19th-century Gustavian-style chairs start at that price.'"
"'11-12-01,'0','The situation in Philadelphia has echoes across the orchestra world. The New York Philharmonic has $23 million in unfunded pensions. The Milwaukee Symphony has to provide nearly $1 million extra a year to stay abreast of its obligations. The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra recently persuaded a donor to plug a $10 million hole in the fund’s financing.Musicians are retiring and claiming their promised benefits at a time when donors themselves are contending with shrinking fortunes and competing claims on their largess.The struggle in the relatively protected orchestra world reflects a trend elsewhere in American life: the gradual disappearance of a guaranteed, set amount of money for retirees every month, often replaced by 401(k)-type investment plans in which employees contribute to their own individual retirement accounts and take whatever the markets dish out, good or bad.Officials of the Philadelphia Orchestra say they simply had no choice. Mario Mestichelli, the orchestra’s chief financial officer, said that before declaring bankruptcy he had tried to create a five-year financial plan without cutting the pension plans, but major donors shot it down.“It could not be funded by this community,” the orchestra’s lead bankruptcy counsel, Lawrence G. McMichael, said in court on Monday. He told the bankruptcy judge, Eric L. Frank of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, that eliminating the existing plans would save the orchestra $43 million over the next five years.The move is also a bet by the orchestra’s board and managers that it can keep and attract the highest level of instrumentalists. But musicians say that will be difficult without top-tier pay and benefits.The orchestra has a defined-benefit pension plan: that is, the musicians are promised a set amount per year on retirement, depending on how many years they have played onstage, regardless of how well the investments made by the orchestra’s pension fund have performed.And with interest rates unexpectedly low and the stock market making unpredictable swings, many defined-benefit pension funds are having trouble meeting their obligations. Some orchestras have already tried to hold down their costs since the mid-1990s by and freezing their in-house pension plans and shifting to a large multiemployer plan, in which the benefits are smaller and the risks and costs spread over a much bigger group.This plan, the American Federation of Musicians and Employers Pension Fund, is administered jointly by the national musicians’ union and some 7,000 employers. They include major orchestras, record labels and film studios. Even orchestras whose permanent employees are not covered by this fund, valued at about $1.7 billion and claiming about 50,000 members, contribute for substitute and temporary players.The Philadelphia Orchestra’s retirees receive pensions from both sources: the orchestra’s own funds, frozen in 2004, and the federation fund. From the day of its filing for bankruptcy protection last April the orchestra’s board and management made clear that the cost of these funds was a key reason it was seeking protection in the courts.On Monday the bankruptcy judge approved the orchestra’s request to let a federal agency, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, take over its frozen pension plans, one for orchestra and one for staff members. The government guarantees up to $54,000 a year to retirees in plans that it has taken over. But some of the Philadelphia Orchestra musicians are entitled to far than that. Preliminary estimates by the government suggest that the musicians all together will lose benefits worth a little more than $3 million in today’s dollars.The agreement for the government takeover and for the withdrawal from the federation plan was reached in confidential mediation sessions in October, led by the chief judge of the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Stephen Raslavich. The Philadelphia musicians’ union local agreed after protracted negotiations to switch to a version of a 401(k) plan from their defined-benefit plans.But the deal set off a new battle.Normally, when an employer decides to pull out of a multiemployer pension plan, the law calls for it to pay what is called its “withdrawal liability”: its share of any shortfall in the pool on the date of withdrawal. The fund’s trustees say the Philadelphia Orchestra owes it $35 million. (On Monday, Mr. McMichael argued that a different measure of liability should be used, which would put the trustees’ claim at only $1 million.) .Now the multiemployer plan’s trustees say the Philadelphia Orchestra is using bankruptcy to dodge its legal responsibilities to the fund.“The more employers that withdraw, the worse it is for the fund,” said William Moriarty, a retired trumpeter who serves on the fund’s board. If the Philadelphia Orchestra doesn’t pay its bill, the $35 million must be covered by the other employers, he said.The fund is already in a precarious state, having lost so much in the financial turmoil of 2008 that it was required by law to take emergency measures, including requiring bigger contributions from employers and temporarily reducing the accrual of benefits.Those steps, Mr. Moriarty said, were already restoring the plan’s solvency, but the Philadelphia Orchestra’s efforts to avoid its bill is undermining the efforts.Ms. Borda, of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, said Philadelphia’s strategy “makes us ask very serious questions about our participation as we take a long-term look at the health of our institutions.”The impact of the move is unclear. “Nobody can really say what the effect will be on other orchestras,” said Peter Pastreich, the executive director of the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra in San Francisco. “I would be unhappy if Philadelphia dropped their burden on us.”Ms. Vulgamore said the national pension fund with employers has not made it clear what impact Philadelphia’s withdrawal would have on other orchestras.Mr. Moriarty and the other fund trustees argue that the Philadelphia Orchestra should use part of its $120 million endowment to pay at least part of the pension fund withdrawal penalty.The orchestra has responded that its endowment cannot be touched, because all the money has been designated by donors for other uses.That prompted a legal skirmish with the fund, which has hired a public relations firm, Sitrick & Company, to help make its case, and received a grant from the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to cover its legal bills. Lawyers for the fund say they have identified at least $10 million in donations that the orchestra has wrongly defined as “designated” and thus not available for pensions.At the hearing on Monday the orchestra’s chief financial officer, Mr. Mestichelli, confirmed that he had asked some big donors to postpone designated donations, giving freely available cash while the orchestra was in bankruptcy. Mr. Mestichelli said he had then spent all of that money, as he contended was legal.Hank Goldsmith, the lead lawyer for the pension fund, argued that Mr. Mestichelli had not properly separated the designated donations from its general use funds.“I’m going to use a word you probably don’t want to hear,” Judge Frank said to Mr. Mestichelli. “Was it commingled money?”Mr. Mestichelli responded that he had in fact put both types of money into the same bank account. But he said that he had still tracked each type separately.Judge Frank asked the orchestra to produce more bank statements and adjourned the matter to next week.'"
"'11-12-01,'0','Industry analysts said the agreement was reached now because demand for new planes had soared and both the company and the union had a strong interest in making sure that production was not disrupted, a prospect that could send sales to Boeing’s rival, Airbus.Officials with the machinists’ union said that they were pleased with the new contract and would urge the N.L.R.B. to drop its case against Boeing once union members ratified the contract.“If this agreement is ratified, we will engage the government in discussion and inform them that our issues with the Boeing Company are behind us,” said Tom Wroblewski, president of Machinists Union District Lodge 751, which represents 28,000 Boeing workers in the Puget Sound area.Lafe E. Solomon, the labor board’s acting general counsel, who brought the case against Boeing, called Wednesday’s agreement “a very significant and hopeful development.” He added that if it was ratified, “we will be in discussions with the parties about the next steps in the process.”While it’s up to the labor board whether to drop the case, the union’s newfound embrace of Boeing could heavily influence the board’s course.Industry analysts said the proposed contract was unusually generous and aimed to put a definitive end to a fractious era during which the machinists went on strike five times since 1977, including a 58-day strike in 2008 that cost Boeing $1.8 billion. With its huge order backlog, its plans to ramp up production and fierce competition from Airbus, Boeing seemed eager to solidify a new contract that would ensure years of labor peace — especially when some customers had threatened to give orders to Airbus if there were more strikes.Under the tentative agreement, the workers would receive annual wage increases of 2 percent, cost-of-living adjustments, a productivity incentive program intended to pay bonuses of 2 to 4 percent and a ratification bonus of $5,000 for each member.Workers will pay more for their health insurance, but at a time when many companies are pushing to replace traditional pensions with less costly 401(k) plans, Boeing agreed to a more generous pension formula and to guarantee that new hires would continue to receive traditional pensions.Mr. Wroblewski said an especially important aspect of the agreement was its job security provisions, which he called “precedent setting.” He said the contract would “secure thousands of jobs while raising machinists’ pay and pensions.”“Hopefully it also signals the start of a new relationship that can both meet our members’ expectations for good jobs, while giving Boeing the stability and productivity it needs to succeed,” he said.“If our employees ratify a new agreement, building the 737 Max in Renton will secure a long and prosperous future there, as well as at other sites in the Puget Sound area and in Portland, Ore., where 737 parts are built,” he said.Several other states, including Texas and South Carolina, had vied to win the 737 Max production.Scott Hamilton, managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Issaquah, Wash., said the new agreement was good for virtually everyone. “Boeing wins in that it has four more years of production stability,” he said. “It doesn’t have the pain and agony of a potential strike. It also wins in that it certainly appears that the N.L.R.B. case will go away.”“The union wins in that it will have the new 737 Max in Renton and job security,” Mr. Hamilton added. “Boeing’s customers win because they don’t have the potential of a strike disruption. I don’t see any loser, other than the other states that were salivating to build the Max.”'"
"'11-12-01,'0','Sometimes, owners have no choice. The Small Business Administration’s 7(a) loan program, for example, “requires that if there is collateral available to make a fully secured loan, the bank lender has an obligation to get it as collateral,” said Steven J. Smits, associate administrator for the office of capital access at the S.B.A. Many lenders require owners to show that they are serious by putting up cash — often from home equity loans. “The standard in the industry is lenders want skin in the game,” Mr. Smits said, “and 20 percent is a safe rule of thumb.”These days, however, the drop in home prices means that fewer owners have the home equity option. And while there is no way to determine the precise numbers, that drop has undoubtedly restricted the ability of owners to obtain financing to start, expand or maintain a business.“The biggest problem is that revenues of the great majority of small businesses have gone down from between 10 percent and 70 percent,” said George Cloutier, founder of American Management Services, an Orlando, Fla., consulting firm that specializes in financial turnarounds for small and midsize companies. “In normal times, there would be a movement to use home equity to shore up losses and sagging sales. The problem that has occurred is that no one’s doing home equity loans, especially on marginal cases where the owner’s business is in trouble.”Some worry about the impact this inability to raise capital and start businesses and hire employees might have on the economy; others wonder whether it ever makes sense to demand this level of commitment from entrepreneurs.“Most start-ups in the U.S. economy are not suitable for venture capital finance,” said David T. Robinson, a professor of finance at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke. “So it’s probably the best system we’ve got. But it’s certainly an inefficient system, because if I have a great idea but no home, and you have a lot of home equity but no ideas,” the two sides are out of luck.For many entrepreneurs, risking the house demonstrates a passion to succeed. Zalmi Duchman, 31, took a $100,000 home equity loan on his Surfside, Fla., condo and in 2006 used $5,000 of it to start the Fresh Diet, a gourmet meal-delivery service. (He used the rest for living expenses while building the business.)About 18 months later he took out an additional $200,000 to match with a $900,000 S.B.A. loan that he used to buy a competitor with operations in Miami and New York. “I don’t think I would have gotten the S.B.A. loan without my condo,” said Mr. Duchman, who expects the Fresh Diet to bring in $30 million in revenue this year. “I wouldn’t have grown the way I did.”Others see taking money out of the house as excessively risky. Philip Patrick, founder of PharmaStrat, a pharmaceutical consulting firm in Flemington, N.J., started his company in 2002 with $5,000 and says he has had a profit since its first quarter.This year, he sold his business, which had annual revenue of $5 million, without ever having borrowed against his house. “I think some entrepreneurs, when looking for money, pitch that as a positive: ‘Look how much faith I have! I’m betting down to the last nickel!’ ” he said. “But I think that’s a negative. I don’t want to invest in someone who’s down to the last nickel.”Betting the house can be especially uncomfortable for the spouses and families of entrepreneurs. After Rick Sanchez lost his job at a film postproduction house in 2006, he and his wife, Tara Zucker, decided to take $55,000 from a home equity line of credit to buy equipment and start their own postproduction business.Post Haste Media of North Hollywood, Calif., did well at first, and they were able to pay off half the loan. Then, in 2008, the economy declined and they had to take out more money. “For me, it was an exciting prospect, though it was scary,” said Mr. Sanchez, 58. “For my wife, it was a lot more difficult. She’s a lot more conservative with money and worries a lot more about it than I do. It took a lot of working on those issues between the two of us.” When they paid off the loan in 2010, Mr. Sanchez said, “it was a great relief.”Not every loan has a happy ending. In 2001, Linda Frakes, of Cumming, Ga., decided to buy a franchise in the Curves health club chain. By 2004, she owned eight. But Curves began to fall out of favor, and in 2005, Ms. Frakes refinanced her home twice to take out $155,000 in home equity and invest it in keeping the franchises running while she tried to sell them. “I was having trouble making payroll,” she said.Ms. Frakes wound up selling her franchises for far less than the $150,000 to 200,000 she had expected to get for each of them. She eventually closed two locations and sold the remaining six in three sales for a total of $500,000. At the end, she was left with $80,000 in cash.Laden with about $250,000 in business-related credit card debt on which she was paying $4,000 a month, a $3,500 mortgage payment, and little income, Ms. Frakes held on for about six months before she stopped making mortgage payments in spring 2008. She declared bankruptcy and then lost her home in late 2009. “I explained to my son the 15-year-old’s version of bankruptcy, and his only question was, ‘Are we going to have enough money for food?’ ”Now 56, Ms. Frakes wrote a book about her experience and today owns Health Fairs Onsite, a company that puts on health fairs at corporate locations nationwide. It is 100 percent bootstrapped. “I don’t have any credit, you know?” she said.'"
"'11-12-01,'0','On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada and the Swiss National Bank, trying to bolster financial markets as the euro zone grinds on, announced that they would reduce by about half the cost of a program under which banks in foreign countries could borrow dollars from their own central banks, which in turn get those dollars from the Fed. The banks also said that would be available until February 2013, extending a previous deadline of August 2012.The move is intended to free up liquidity and ensure that European banks have funds during the sovereign debt crisis. But some analysts saw it as a stop-gap measure to avoid a looming crisis that some compared to that set off by the collapse of in 2008.“What it does do is take off some of the pressure from this boiling pot,” Mr. White said.As the exuberance set in and funding pressures appeared to ease, bond prices fell, commodity prices rallied and financial shares soared as investors bought shares on the hope that the central banks had smoothed the way for Europe to take more forceful action in advance of a European summit meeting Dec. 9. The jump in was also an extension of the turmoil and volatility that have characterized global markets for more than a year.It was unclear even after Wednesday’s move whether banks would loosen up lending or whether the market enthusiasm would last.Some noted sharp gains in equities in previous trading sessions have often failed to carry through, as European leaders had tried many times over the last two years to stave off a deterioration in the debt crisis. A recent attempt was on Oct. 27, when the broader market as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rallied 4 percent on the hope that a new European plan could solve its problems. But it failed to sustain its gains.That rally was one of eight times that the S.& P. had spiked up at least 4 percent since the end of 2008, while in the same period it experienced 10 declines of that size.In addition, a summit meeting in July caused a global stock rally that collapsed in the subsequent days, with the S.& P. eventually sinking to its lowest level for the year.Analysts were skeptical about whether Wednesday’s market enthusiasm would endure, and they also warned that the central banks’ move addressed only some symptoms of the euro zone financial crisis. Stanley A. , chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said the coordinated action on Wednesday signaled that the problem had reached a crisis point, and that the central banks recognized there was a “lot of danger” in letting the current situation continue.Steve Blitz, the senior economist for ITG Investment Research, said the central banks “are going to do what they can to ring-fence the European financials’ problems and keep them inside Europe.”“They are trying to prevent them from seizing up global liquidity and capital flows and impacting banks and financial institutions throughout the world,” he said.The S.& P. 500-stock index closed up 51.77 points, or 4.33 percent, at 1,246.96. The Dow was up 4.24 percent, to 12,045.68, and pushed into positive territory for the year and for the month of November.

"'11-12-01,'0','LONDON — A 31-year-old woman has been arrested as part of the investigation into voice mail hacking at Rupert Murdoch’s now-defunct News of the World, police officials said Wednesday.The woman was accused of “conspiracy to intercept voice mail messages,” according to a statement from Scotland Yard. She was arrested early on Wednesday and held at a police station in Northumbria, in northeast England.She is the 17th person to be arrested since police opened a comprehensive inquiry into accusations that the newspaper had hacked the messages of almost 6,000 celebrities and newsworthy figures between 2001 and 2009 in search of scoops.The scandal has seen Mr. Murdoch and his son James called before Parliament; two of Britain’s top police officers have been forced to resign; and the Prime Minister David Cameron questioned over his hiring of a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his spokesman. Mr. Coulson was among those arrested.Scotland Yard declined to identify the woman, or to provide further information, but the BBC and other British news media named her as Bethany Usher, a former News of the World reporter who is currently a lecturer in journalism at Teesside University. Ms. Usher did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.The police announced last week that they had made the first arrest in a connected investigation into computer hacking. A 52-year-old man was detained on the outskirts of London on suspicion of unspecified offenses involving computer misuse and invasion of privacy. He has not been identified by name, but was granted bail until December.'"
"'11-12-01,'0','Mr. Coulson, who resigned from his job as chief spokesman for Prime Minister David Cameron in January, and Mrs. Brooks, who resigned in July from her job as chief executive of News International, the British newspaper arm of the Murdoch empire, have both been arrested on suspicion of phone hacking, or illegally intercepting voice mail messages. Mrs. Brooks, whom Mr. McMullan called “the archcriminal,” is also suspected of making illegal payments to the police.Both have repeatedly denied the allegations, and neither has yet been charged.Nothing that Mr. McMullan said was particularly surprising; anyone following the phone hacking scandal that engulfed News International and its parent, the News Corporation, over the summer is now more than familiar with outrageous tales of tabloid malfeasance. What was startling was that Mr. McMullan, who left his job in 2001, eagerly confessed to so much and on such a scale — no one else has done it quite this way — and that he maintained that none of it was wrong.Most people from the tabloid world have reacted to the revelations in the manner of Renault when discussing gambling in “Casablanca,” saying they are “shocked, shocked.” But Mr. McMullan veered so far in the other direction that at times he sounded like a satirist’s rendition of an amoral tabloid hack.Underhanded reporting techniques are not shocking at all, he said, particularly in light of how often he and his colleagues risked their lives in search of the truth.As examples of the dangers of his job, he described having cocaine-laced marijuana forced on him by knife-wielding drug dealers in a sting operation; being attacked by a crowd of murderous asylum seekers; and, in his “Brad the teenage rent boy” guise, sprinting through a convent dressed only in underpants to escape the pedophile priest he had successfully entrapped.“Phone hacking is a perfectly acceptable tool, given the sacrifices we make, if all we’re trying to do is get to the truth,” Mr. McMullan said, asking whether “we really want to live in a world where the only people who can do the hacking are MI5 and MI6.”No, he said, we do not.“For a brief period of about 20 years, we have actually lived in a free society where we can hack back,” he said.Journalists in Britain have traditionally justified shady practices by arguing that they are in “the public interest.” Asked by an inquiry lawyer how he would define that, Mr. McMullan said that the public interest is what the public is interested in.“I think the public is clever enough to decide the ethics of what it wants in its own newspapers,” he said. Referring to articles about Charlotte Church, a singer who told the inquiry this week of her distress at her family’s treatment by the tabloids, he said, “If they don’t like what you have written about Charlotte Church’s father having a three-in-a-bed with cocaine, then they won’t read it.”For all that, Mr. McMullan said that The News of the World had come to rely too much on outsiders to do work that could have easily been done by reporters, like conducting surveillance on potentially adulterous athletes. Also, he said, some of the investigators were incompetent.The year he became deputy features editor, he said, the department had a budget of £ 3.1 million — more than $4.5 million — to pay sources, buy stories and hire outsiders to find addresses, medical records and other information. “That was the joy of working for Murdoch,” he said. “They had that big pot of money.”Mr. McMullan, who now owns a pub and does occasional freelance work, spoke nostalgically of his tabloid career, seven years of it spent at The News of the World. He loved spiriting exclusive sources away “and hiding them from other journalists,” he said, as when he “spent two weeks locked in a hotel room with Princess Diana’s gym instructor in Amsterdam.”He also liked jumping in one of The News of the World’s stable of 12 cars and speeding away in pursuit of famous targets.“I absolutely loved giving chase to celebrities,” he said. “How many jobs can you have car chases in? Before Diana died, it was such good fun.” (Some celebrities liked it, too, he said. Brad Pitt “had a very positive attitude” about being pursued by crazed journalists in cars.)Mr. McMullan had brought along some illustrative materials, including a photograph of his surveillance van. He also briefly displayed a topless photograph of Carla Bruni-Sarkozy in The News of the World, apparently as a way to show how easy it is to obtain racy photographs.“That’s the president of France’s wife,” he said.“It’s a little early in the day for that, Mr. McMullan,” the inquiry lawyer said.Many witnesses at the Leveson Inquiry, especially victims of the tabloids, have called for a law to protect citizens from news media intrusion. Mr. McMullan said he thought that privacy was “evil,” in that it helps criminals cover up their misdeeds.Using a Britishism for “pedophile,” he said, “Privacy is for pedos.”'"
"'11-12-01,'0','Some experts on Iran cautioned against allowing international opprobrium for the Tehran leadership to build to the point where Iran might abandon caution. “Let’s hope the crisis does not spiral out of control,” Ervand Abrahamian, an Iranian-born historian at the , said in an e-mailed response to questions about the embassy assault.The embassy intrusion came against a backdrop of what Iran experts have called an increasingly bitter rift between factions of the Iranian leadership over a variety of issues, including the nuclear dispute with the West. Some expressed concern that a harsh Western response to the attack could embolden the militant faction associated with Ayatollah , the supreme leader, including men who control fiercely political paramilitary units like the Republican Guards and the , in their power struggle with , the president.Mr. Abrahamian said that the Khamenei faction may have decided to strike at Britain after events in recent months that many in Iran have seen as part of a covert plan to destroy Iran’s nuclear aspirations. These events, he said, included the assassination of three nuclear scientists, computer-based sabotage of uranium enrichment centrifuges and a devastating explosion at a military base west of Tehran a few weeks ago that killed the general who pioneered Iran’s missile development.With no American or Israeli Embassy in Tehran, Mr. Abrahamian said, British diplomatic installations might have been seen as “obvious targets” — all the more so, he suggested, after Britain’s decision last month, in response to a report by the raising new concerns about the possible military applications of the nuclear program, to order all Britain-based and financial institutions to cease trading with Iran’s .“Some sectors of the Iranian government — especially the Republican Guards — would have known about the impending attack on the embassy compound and would have turned a blind eye,” he said.Britain’s response was announced to a restive House of Commons 24 hours after scores of protesters stormed the sprawling British Embassy compound in the heart of Tehran and a diplomatic residential enclave in the Alborz hills of Tehran.Although all of Britain’s diplomats and local Iranian employees were accounted for by nightfall on Tuesday, many news media accounts of the attack in Britain raised the specter of the tumultuous, 444-day occupation of the United States Embassy in the Iranian capital that began the spiral of Iran’s estrangement more than 30 years ago.Mr. Hague waited until all of Britain’s diplomats were out of Iran before announcing the closing of the London and Tehran embassies, and giving the House of Commons his own outraged account of the assault. Calling it “a breach of international responsibilities of which any nation should be ashamed,” he set an unusually tight deadline of 48 hours for the Iranian Embassy in London’s upscale Kensington neighborhood to be closed and for all Iranian diplomats to vacate the country.Brushing aside an Iranian Foreign Ministry apology on Tuesday disavowing the attack, Mr. Hague identified the protesters as members of the Basij, an extremist youth militia and a shock force often unleashed by militant elements in Tehran’s religious hierarchy to suppress street protests or attack opponents. “We should be clear from the outset that this is an organization controlled by elements of the Iranian regime,” he said.Television images on Tuesday showed scores of intruders who had forced their way into the British Embassy shouting, “Death to !” They were burning Union Jacks torn from flagstaffs and tossing sheaves of purloined documents out of windows.Mr. Hague said the intruders had set fire to the embassy’s main office building, destroyed furniture, stolen the staff’s personal possessions, and gone on to “vandalize and loot” the ambassador’s residence and other staff accommodations before Iranian police officers escorted them outside.Mr. Hague excoriated the Tehran government. He acknowledged growing tensions between Britain and Iran over the nuclear issue, saying that Britain had been foremost among advocates of tightened international sanctions after the report released Nov. 8 by the International Atomic Energy Agency, which expressed, as Mr. Hague noted, “deep and increasing concern” about the Iranian nuclear program and its “possible military dimensions.”“But we should be absolutely clear that no difficulty in relations can ever excuse in any way or under any circumstances the failure to protect diplomatic staff and diplomatic premises,” he said. “Iran is a country where opposition leaders are under house arrest, more than 500 people have been executed so far this year, and where genuine protest is ruthlessly stamped on. The idea that the Iranian authorities could not have protected our embassy or that this could have taken place without some degree of regime consent is fanciful.”'"
"'11-12-01,'0','That’s a good opener for a house shaken by the offensive remarks and behavior of Mr. Galliano, who was fired in February. Surely a couture house derives its mystery and staying power from the knowledge of making things.It’s obvious from “Dior Couture” that Mr. Demarchelier loves taking pictures of beautiful women, but his photos almost always have an extra quality: he also understands how clothes should look on the body.Raised in northern France, Mr. Demarchelier, 68, first picked up a camera as a teenager. “I took portraits of my friends,” he recalled in his Manhattan studio. “When I was a bit older, maybe 19 or 20, I moved to Paris, and I worked in a lab doing prints.” By chance, he wound up being the photographer for a modeling school. “Most of the girls came from the countryside,” he said. “We cut their hair, we taught them to walk and dress.”At the time, he knew little about fashion. He explained: “You had nothing to compare yourself with. Now you have the Internet, you see what’s going on all over the world. I was thinking about having a job and making some money to live. So after a year at this modeling school, I felt a bit stuck. I stopped and went to assist for some people in Paris.”Soon he was working for himself, taking pictures for French Elle (children’s clothes at first) and then Marie Claire. But, again, he felt a bit stuck and decided to visit New York, planning to stay six months. He stayed 35 years. His first assignments were for Glamour and Seventeen. “When I worked for Seventeen, they had a private jet,” he recalled. “When I was working in France, we had a little car, all freezing, in winter. Suddenly, I go to America and we have a private jet, and I think, That’s it! Amazing, no?”SUCH experience can’t easily be duplicated. Among the prettiest photos in the book are those of early Dior outfits, including the two Saint Laurents. “You could wear those clothes today,” Mr. Demarchelier said, looking at a simple black cocktail dress from 1959 by Saint Laurent.For a series of outdoor photos made immediately after Mr. Galliano’s fall 2010 couture show (the theme was flowers), he told the models to imagine a garden party. The results look like richly pigmented paintings. Later in the book, he shows a model in a 1947 shirtwaist dress with tiny pin-tucks and a small veiled hat on the beach at Deauville — “a very Lartigue picture,” he said with a rumpled laugh.Yes, Lartigue was a big influence on him. He turned the page to a 1947 coat that, against the northern sky, was all silhouette. “How chic is that?” he said.Mr. Demarchelier, a master of lighting, makes his methods sound very easy. When questioned a bit further, he said: “I like to make it easy. I always say to young photographers, ‘Have a good time when you work. If you’re stressed, it’s not normal when you’re doing fashion work.’ See, I like to play when I work.”'"
"'11-12-01,'0','That is, how when we men go off in hunter-gatherer mode to forage for clothes to clad our frames, we so often gravitate to the same larger-than-life avatars of manhood we looked to as boys — either real (Paul Newman) or imagined (Paul Bunyan). Paul Mitchell? Paul Volcker? Paul the Apostle? Not so much. It’s enough to suggest that the only text men’s designers and retailers need read is “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.”The latest hero to catch fire, so to speak, is a perfect example: the old-fashioned mountaineer, in the mold of the great Edmund Hillary. Now, before you go racing to the new REI shop in SoHo, hold your huskies. Authenticity is not really the goal. As any of the staff of REI could tell you, a metal-spiked pair of Yaktrax will be no help on a Manhattan sidewalk (and might get you thrown out of any establishment where distressed floors are not the look). But this fall the fashion Sherpas have come out with a host of more base-camp-friendly garments that still qualify as totally Hillarious.Just consider the wealth of Scandinavian-patterned sweaters available this fall: Burberry, Ralph Lauren, Oliver Spencer, J. Crew, Topman — even the defiant futurist Raf Simons. Peruse the October journal entry of the online retailer Mr Porter devoted to the great outdoors, complete with a style valentine to the early alpinist George Mallory. Click around the Web site of Duluth Pack (established in Duluth, Minn., 1882) to see some of the backpack’s earliest, purest forms.Or check out Danner Boots’ new Stumptown line, which recreates the company’s classic hiking boots with a more pliable sole and less bulky look. Since making its debut in August, the Stumptown line is already sold in more than 50 stores in the United States and has been picked up across Europe and Asia.“It’s really a global phenomenon,” said Matt Schneider, the manager of the Stumptown brand, made in Portland, Ore. “We’ve been selling these styles in Japan for about 30 years, and recently more and more Americans started asking for them.” (He also said he has been amazed by the demand for the colorful optional boot laces the company offers.)The mountaineering look still has some of its most ardent fans in Japan. Junya Watanabe fashioned Scandinavian patterns into some of this fall’s smartest-looking (and best-selling) jackets. And similar patterns are splashed across the hats, scarves and socks made by a Japanese label named (no joke) White Mountaineering. How to show off those fetching knee-high wool socks? With the tweed knee breeches that Oliver Spencer made this season, of course.'"

"'11-12-02,'0','The results are in: San Francisco voters have trouble with ranked-choice elections.Despite a $300,000 educational campaign leading up to last month’s elections, including a new smiley-face mascot, publicity events, and advertising on buses and in newspapers, only one-third of voters on Nov. 8 filled out all three choices in all three races, according to an analysis released this week by the University of San Francisco.Under the city’s system, voters were asked to rank their top three choices for mayor, sheriff and district attorney.Perhaps the analysis’ most troubling finding is that 9 percent of voters, mostly in Chinatown and southeastern neighborhoods like the Bayview, marked only one choice for each office, either because they considered only one candidate suitable or because they did not know how to fill out their ballot correctly.“Some people just prefer to rank one,” said Corey Cook, a political science professor at the university who wrote the report with David Latterman. “But the geographic component suggests it’s more systematic.”Although Edwin M. Lee did not receive a majority of first-place votes, he became the city’s first elected Chinese-American mayor based on the ranked-choice system, which was first used in San Francisco in 2004.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','Texas lawmakers have worked in recent years to keep children in their homes or with relatives instead of moving them to foster care. In Judge Byrne’s 126th Judicial District Civil Court chambers in Austin, the goal is to reunite children with their families. But in many cases, like that of the pregnant mother she saw in November, it does not work.“The thought that that’s even appropriate is staggering to me, that we’ve got another child on the way and Mom and Dad can’t even take care of these,” Judge Byrne said. (Judge Byrne is a donor to The Texas Tribune.)The foster-care system is overwhelmed, and Child Protective Services, like most state agencies, was hit with severe cuts during the 2011 legislative session.Financing to prevent child abuse was slashed 44 percent. And because the Legislative Budget Board did not increase money for caseload growth or to support family services or relative caregivers, the agency will continue to operate on a budget designed in 2009. Shelters and facilities that care for children and provide services like domestic-violence prevention are struggling to find ways to serve more families with far fewer dollars.The Austin Children’s Shelter receives about 30 percent of its money from the state and relies on private donations and grants to make up the rest.The number of teenagers in the shelter’s emergency program has risen 23 percent since 2010, and the number of teenagers in the shelter has grown by 27 percent. More people are also staying longer, including two children who have stayed for two years.Kelly White, the shelter’s chief executive, said it has seen a surge in the number of children who require serious treatment.“We’re doing everything we can to not have it affect care,” said Ms. White, who has laid off two employees. “Some things we’ve done to save money we realized were not good for kids, so we’re having to figure out other ways to do that.”Ms. White said the larger number of older youths coming in is most likely a result of the economy. “All of those things create the fertile ground that can create more abuse situations,” she said.The average stay has nearly doubled, to 62 days in 2011 from 32 days in 2008. And many youths who have aged out of foster care end up back in the shelter, Ms. White said, often because they cannot find jobs.In Austin, SafePlace, which provides services to victims of domestic violence and to children accompanied by family members, has seen the number of people who have children in the Child Protective Services system increase to 60 percent.“I don’t think that a bad economy causes violence,” said Julia Spann, executive director of SafePlace. “The precursors are already there, and then you add all the stressors and it gets worse. Then it’s harder to get help, and for shelters it’s harder because people don’t even have the means to leave the shelter because they can’t get jobs.”To keep children in foster programs connected with their families or communities, the Department of Family and Protective Services is working on a plan to restructure how the state pays for foster care so that children can stay close to home and quickly move out of the system into permanent homes.The program, which will award a contract in 2012, aims to help children who bounce around between multiple foster homes, as was the case with one Austin Children’s Shelter client who had lived in 32 foster homes by the time he was 16.Although Ms. White said the overhaul is necessary, the new program will most likely reduce the amount of state money the shelter and other care facilities around Texas receive because it could result in lower reimbursement rates for services.“I hate talking about kids where you get down to a rate,” Ms. White said, “but unfortunately we have to make sure that we also pay our bills.”Patrick Crimmins, a spokesman for the Department of Family and Protective Services, said that with no end in sight to the recession, the agency is reallocating resources statewide to have as many caseworkers as possible working directly with families. It is also constantly monitoring caseloads, he said, to ensure they are manageable.“It is, admittedly, a big job,” he said, “but we are up to it.”'"
"'11-12-02,'0','“The city has to begin to plan for some significant outlays,” said Jim Reynolds, an investment manager and new member of the board, who was attending his first agency board meeting since Mr. Emanuel replaced the three hold-over mayoral appointees on the seven-member panel.Thursday’s meeting took place in the agency’s offices at U.S. Cellular Field, built on the South Side more than 20 years ago to keep the White Sox from moving to Florida. State lawmakers created the I.S.F.A. to guide the ballpark’s $150 million construction and then to operate the facility.The new fiscal problem for City Hall, however, stems from the Soldier Field deal and represents another time bomb that Mr. Emanuel inherited from Mayor Richard M. Daley. To keep the Bears in Chicago, Mr. Daley pushed successfully for the authority to issue almost $400 million in bonds for the $606 million Soldier Field renovation.A 2 percent increase in the hotel tax was instituted to back the bonds. At the time, proponents of the deal calculated that revenues from the tax would have to grow by an average of 5.5 percent a year over the next three decades to meet the debt obligations.In order to win support for the arrangement from downstate lawmakers, the city had to agree to make up any shortfall, said Emil Jones, the retired State Senate president whom Gov. Pat Quinn selected recently to be the new chairman of the sports facilities authority.As the bonds were issued in 2001, Mr. Daley said he was “absolutely confident that taxpayers are not at risk for any part of this project.”City taxpayers took a hit of more than $1.1 million for the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the audit obtained this week by The Chicago News Cooperative. The agency’s chief financial officer told the new board members Thursday, however, that state officials had informed her this week of an accounting mistake, so the real shortfall should be only $185,000.But Mr. Reynolds appeared worried as he looked at a table showing that the debt obligations would rise steadily to $88.5 million in 2032 from $30.2 million in 2012.The top White Sox official in the boardroom suggested that the baseball franchise was in no position to give the authority more help. The team agreed to pay higher rent three years ago, and Howard Pizer, the executive vice president of the White Sox, said the front office had then invested profits into bolstering the roster.Mr. Pizer told the board members that the success of player signings was as difficult to predict as future hotel tax revenues, and he buttressed that point by making a joke at the expense of the team’s underperforming, high-priced designated hitter: “You could quibble with whether we spent wisely on Adam Dunn.”'"
"'11-12-02,'0','Atom Thomas leafed through his little black sketchpad filled with intricate pencil and ink drawings of landscapes, street scenes and portraits of family members and celebrities like Jay-Z and Michael Jackson. He stopped on one drawing of an angel, wings spread, standing atop a cloud.“This one makes me think of someone watching over me,” Mr. Thomas said, pointing to the page as he sat in the offices of the New Settlement Apartments, a nonprofit organization that provides affordable housing and community services in the Bronx.The first time Mr. Thomas went to New Settlement, in May 2010, he was there to attend a job-readiness program. He said his legs were shaking as he approached the brick building. The old fear of being surrounded by new people he did not trust was rushing in, and he stopped in front of the entrance.“I don’t know what it was, but something just told me to go inside,” said Mr. Thomas, a soft-spoken, baby-faced 25-year-old with a thin mustache. “This was my last chance.”That day, he pushed aside his fears and entered the building. It was the turning point of his life, he said.“I didn’t have any training or experience,” Mr. Thomas said. “I didn’t know how to communicate in a professional way. I didn’t have the skills to look for work.” He added: “I started going every day. I was never late. I was on time for the first time ever.”He had dropped out of high school two months into ninth grade, after developing paralyzing social anxiety that made it very hard to be in a new school with more than 1,000 strange faces.“It was like a brick wall that I couldn’t get over,” Mr. Thomas said, remembering his paranoia. “I was afraid of new people, of how I was going to get treated.” He said he was never treated for social anxiety or given a diagnosis.Mr. Thomas spent most of his time at home, sketching and caring for his younger nieces and nephews in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. To no avail, his father, a security guard, and his mother, a nurse assistant, tried to persuade him to go back to school.“I feel guilty for not succeeding and doing what I was supposed to,” Mr. Thomas said of his teenage years. “I was in a stage where I didn’t want to do anything for myself. I was a big disappointment to my mother and father.”In 2008, his father lost his job and Mr. Thomas was evicted from his apartment along with his parents, a younger sister and an older sister with two children. Mr. Thomas moved in with another sister, but his lack of employment became a constant strain on their relationship. He felt helpless until a friend showed him a flier for the job-readiness program.Mr. Thomas successfully completed the program in two months, learning how to prepare a résumé, search for employment and interview for a job. With his newfound skills, his social anxieties began to fade, and he was ready to start looking for work. But he needed clothing appropriate for interviews.He was referred to the Workforce Advocacy and Support Initiative, which teams up with New Settlement on some programs and is run by the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. He received four grants from the fund totaling $344.46 to buy clothes, including slacks, button-down shirts, ties and dress shoes. (He also got $6.74 for lunch on a shopping trip.)“When you dress up and look professional and you see yourself in the mirror, you ask, ‘Is that you?’ It felt good,” Mr. Thomas said, recalling the first time he tried on one of his new outfits, tying his own tie using a technique he learned at New Settlement.Craving independence, Mr. Thomas left his sister’s home in summer 2010. He received $37.53 from the Neediest Cases Fund to buy personal hygiene products and entered the city’s shelter system. Today, he lives at Create, a shelter for young men in Harlem. He recently received his license to work as a security guard, paying for the classes and fees with the help of $331 from the fund. The fund also helped him open a bank account with a $25 grant to make his first deposit last year. Since then, he has begun working as a sales associate at Duane Reade, earning $7.25 an hour.Mr. Thomas’s father eventually found a new job as a security guard, he said, and last year his parents got a new place. He hopes to move into an apartment of his own, get his G.E.D. and enter college to become an art teacher.“I’ve come a long way,” Mr. Thomas said. “I feel confident now. My dreams are going to become a reality.”'"
"'11-12-02,'0','ON Tuesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Williams v. Illinois, the latest in a string of cases addressing whether the Sixth Amendment’s confrontation clause — which gives the accused in a criminal case the right “to be confronted with the witnesses against him” — applies to forensic analysts who produce reports for law enforcement. In other words, should an analyst responsible for, say, a fingerprint report have to show up at trial to face questions about the report?A logical application of the law produces an easy answer: Yes. The court has defined a “witness against” a defendant as a person who provides information to law enforcement to aid a criminal investigation. That is exactly what forensic analysts do.Subjecting forensic analysts to cross-examination is also good policy. According to a recent National Academy of Sciences study, forensic science is not nearly as reliable as it is perceived to be. DNA specimens, for instance, are sometimes contaminated; fingerprint, ballistics and even run-of-the-mill drug and alcohol analyses depend on human interpretation and thus are subject to error. Worse, investigations over the past decade have revealed outright incompetence and fraud in many crime labs. So it makes sense to subject the authors of lab reports to cross-examination — a procedure the court has called “the greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.”Despite all this, the Supreme Court has been sharply divided on the issue. In similar cases in 2009 and earlier this year, in which I represented the defendants, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, Stephen G. Breyer and Samuel A. Alito Jr. accepted claims by state governments that, simply put, confrontation in this context costs too much. It is far more efficient, these justices contend, to let analysts simply mail their reports to court. Having to appear at trials pulls them away from their labs, and only occasionally proves more revealing than their written testimony. Hence, these justices maintain, “scarce state resources” are better committed elsewhere.Given that several states have long required forensic analysts to come to court, one might think that this financial argument would not have gained much traction. Justice Antonin Scalia, in fact, called the argument a “bogeyman.” But the four dissenting justices not only accepted it but deemed it powerful enough to trump the commands of constitutional text and precedent.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','The debate brought new attention to the ambiguous aftermath of one of the most sweeping claims of executive power made by the Bush administration after Sept. 11: that the government can hold citizens without a trial by accusing them of being terrorists.One of the proponents of making no exceptions for Americans, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said it would be “crazy” to exempt Qaeda suspects who are Americans and are arrested inside the country from battlefield-style detention. He argued that, to stop other attacks, they must be interrogated without the protections of the civilian criminal justice system.Citizens who are suspected of joining Al Qaeda are opening themselves up “to imprisonment and death,” Mr. Graham said, adding, “And when they say, ‘I want my lawyer,’ you tell them: ‘Shut up. You don’t get a lawyer. You are an enemy combatant, and we are going to talk to you about why you joined Al Qaeda.’ ”But Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, said citizen terrorism suspects should retain their “fundamental civil liberties” in order to protect the founding principles of the United States.“I think at a bare minimum, that means we will not allow U.S. military personnel to arrest and indefinitely detain U.S. citizens, regardless of what label we happen to apply to them,” he said.Before voting to leave current law unchanged, the Senate rejected, 55 to 45, a proposal by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, to instead say that Americans are exempt from detention under the 2001 authorization to use military force.The uncertainty over the current law added confusion. Some, like Mr. Graham and Mr. Levin, insisted that the Supreme Court had already approved holding Americans as enemy combatants, even people arrested inside the United States. Others, like Senators Feinstein and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, insisted that it had not done so.Each side pointed to different passages of the Supreme Court’s ruling in a landmark 2004 case. The decision said the Bush administration could hold as an enemy combatant a citizen who had been captured in Afghanistan and was accused of fighting with the Taliban. Mr. Levin noted Justice Sandra Day O’Connor wrote that “there is no bar to this nation’s holding one of its own citizens as an enemy combatant.”But others noted that Justice O’Connor had also stressed that the ruling was limited to “a United States citizen captured in a foreign combat zone” while active combat there was in progress, a different context from a domestic arrest. (She also wrote, “Certainly, we agree that indefinite detention for the purpose of interrogation is not authorized.”)There were two Bush-era cases of people held as enemy combatants arrested inside the United States, one of them a citizen. Lower courts reached contradictory opinions about whether holding them in indefinite military custody was lawful, and they were transferred to the civilian system before the Supreme Court weighed in.Still, in 1942, several German saboteurs were captured inside the United States and prosecuted before a military commission. One was a naturalized American citizen. In an opinion written after the men were executed, the Supreme Court held that the process had been legitimate.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','Heathrow Airport is a jam-packed embarrassment for those who promote London as a global financial center. A brand new four-runway hub in the Thames River estuary east of the British capital may relieve the squeeze. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, likes the idea. Central government enthusiasm would be greater if the private sector could provide the financing — although the British government now says it will explore plans to maintain Britain’s aviation hub status.Second-rate air infrastructure causes economic damage, while the gains of having a first-class air hub are substantial. But these things are hard to quantify. Private financiers, wanting a reasonable return on their investments, could count on receiving only part of the extra revenue generated.Investors in a purely private new airport would have to rely on fees paid by passengers. If the airport took all the additional traffic that some expect could come to London, the cash flow, according to a Breakingviews analysis, would be about £2.1 billion ($3.3 billion) a year.Work commissioned by Mayor Johnson suggests that overall passenger numbers could almost triple to 400 million by 2050. Meanwhile latest numbers from Ferrovial, the owner of Heathrow, suggest a net profit of about £8 a passenger. Discounted in perpetuity at 7 percent, the rough cost of capital used in the current regulatory regime, private financiers might count on about £30 billion of present value from the expected increase in traffic.That rough estimate is well below the assumptions about the cost of the airport and the related transport and environmental infrastructure. Foster & Partners, the architectural firm, and Halcrow, the construction consultancy, have put a £50 billion price tag on their plans, which may err on the low side.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — While the Jets’ offense has sputtered this season, Tom Moore has been watching from his home in South Carolina, where he works as the team’s offensive consultant.Moore was at practice Thursday, watching drills as the Jets struggle to find consistency and answers for their slow starts.Moore, 73, who did not speak to reporters, has been around the N.F.L. for decades as an assistant coach. He is perhaps best known for overseeing the development of Peyton Manning. Moore served as the offensive coordinator for the Indianapolis Colts from the start of Manning’s career in 1998 until 2008. He continued to work with the team until last year.“His thing is he’s retired, but we were fortunate enough to hire him as a consultant,” Coach Rex Ryan said. “It’s good to have him here. We’d like to have him here more. It’s great. The players respect him.”Moore scouts the Jets each week and offers input to the coaching staff. He exchanges e-mails with Ryan, and he communicates often via fax with Brian Schottenheimer, the offensive coordinator. Moore last visited the Jets before their Week 7 win over the San Diego Chargers. He will be at Sunday’s game at the Washington Redskins.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','Florida A&M University said that it was dismissing four students in connection with the death of a marching band member last month, while audio of an emergency call released Thursday indicated that the band member had vomit in his mouth before he died. The university president, James Ammons, referred to the dismissals in a memo this week to members of the Board of Trustees, but did not specify what the four students did. The authorities have said that hazing played a role in the death of the band member, Robert Champion, but they have not released more details. Mr. Ammons said in his memo that the university had a zero-tolerance policy on hazing, then added: “I want to report that four students have been dismissed from the university in connection to the Robert Champion incident.”'"
"'11-12-02,'0','“We feel like we have some places where we can take advantage of what they try to do,” receiver Ramses Barden said.According to the Web site Football Outsiders, the Packers have given up an average of 140.7 yards per game to the opposing team’s top two receivers, or about 20 yards more than the league average. The Giants’ pass-catchers — Hakeem Nicks, Cruz, Mario Manningham (if he is able to play through a lingering knee injury), Barden and tight end Jake Ballard — believe they may be the difference if an upset is to be pulled off.Ballard acknowledged that the Giants’ running game needed to improve — and as a blocker, he is a part of that — but also said that the Giants needed to seize their opportunities down the field against the Packers. If they do not, he said, the Packers have the ability to turn the game into a rout quickly. “It looks like we may have some chances,” Ballard said. “The big play is there. We just can’t miss it.”Ballard said he made a point this week of watching how other tight ends have had success against the Packers. In particular, he homed in on Kellen Winslow of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who had nine catches for 132 yards in a loss to the Packers two weeks ago.What allowed Winslow to flourish, Ballard said, was the way he took advantage of the Green Bay defensive backs’ aggressiveness. A main reason the team has so many interceptions is the backs’ willingness to jump in front of anticipated passing routes, but that can leave open seams down the field where the receiver — as Nicks said — “just puts his hand up and starts running.”Although Manning was prone to interceptions last season, when he threw a league-high 25, he has thrown just 10 this season.Put all those factors together, Cruz said, and the Giants’ receivers figure to have some moments in the spotlight. Cruz, in particular, has been dynamic already this season, recording 55 catches for 957 yards and 7 touchdowns — totals he would like to add to Sunday. “It’s the best feeling we get,” Cruz said of breaking into the open. “You catch it, you see no one in front of you — if we can do that, we’re going to be in good shape.”Perry Fewell, the typically reserved defensive coordinator, spoke emotionally to reporters Thursday, saying it was “disheartening” to see some Giants players not finishing plays at the end of the blowout loss to the Saints. “We won’t accept pulling up short,” Fewell said. He also vowed that the Giants, who did not record a sack against New Orleans, would pressure Aaron Rodgers on Sunday. “We’re going to get the quarterback,” he said. “Period.” ... Linebacker Michael Boley (hamstring) was limited in practice but hopes to play Sunday. Mark Herzlich (ankle) has been ruled out, according to Coach Tom Coughlin. ...Mario Manningham’s knee swelling has continued. Manningham said that he was considering surgery but that he had a good chance of playing Sunday.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','During closing arguments in the federal corruption trial against City Councilman Larry B. Seabrook on Thursday, a defense lawyer urged the jury to weigh 30 years of public service against “so-called evidence.”In their summation a day before, prosecutors had told jurors in Federal District Court in Manhattan that Mr. Seabrook carried out several schemes to funnel money to himself and others through nonprofit groups and a political club that he controlled.But on Thursday, Edward Wilford, one of Mr. Seabrook’s two lawyers, compared that argument to “a shell game” or a street-corner game of three-card monte.“There’s no evidence to connect the dots,” he told the jurors. “There’s only speculation to support the government’s theory.”During a closing argument that lasted about an hour, Mr. Wilford assailed the prosecution’s case from several directions. He reminded jurors that Arlington Leon Eastmond, a Bronx businessman who prosecutors said gave unlawful gratuities to Mr. Seabrook, testified that he had a long history of giving money to the councilman’s political club and wanted to help the community with those donations.Mr. Wilford went on to portray Mr. Seabrook as an unwitting victim who had entrusted nonprofit groups like the Northeast Bronx Redevelopment Corporation and the African-American Legal and Civic Hall of Fame to seemingly qualified appointees, only to be surprised and disappointed by their actions.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','This being the season for Oscar puffery and pretention, it’s also the time of the year when moviegoers who yearn for more action and less talk can be forgiven for thinking that what’s missing from the big screen is a good beat down. It could use one: this hasn’t been a memorable year for cinematic action, aside from a quicksilver move here and there and that gone-in-60-seconds moment in “Drive” when Ryan Gosling glides a car into park. But now there’s “The Yellow Sea,” a rush of a movie from South Korea that slips and slides from horror to humor on rivers of blood and offers the haunting image of a man, primitive incarnate, beating other men with an enormous, gnawed-over meat bone.Even on second viewing, that bone scene is a shocker in a movie with more than one. When I first saw “The Yellow Sea” in May at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was shown under the bluntly literal title “The Murderer,” the audience burst into applause several times, jolted by the choreographed frenzy of the movie’s car and foot chases. Those chases are so exciting, and the blood is so unnerving, that I didn’t at first realize that they’re in service to a moral tale, one in which the struggle between good and evil plays out in often unsettling visual terms: that bone isn’t just a convenient weapon but also an emblem of this man-eat-dog, man-kill-man world.Dogs, dead or furiously barking and snapping, are a recurrent motif in “The Yellow Sea,” which opens with its hapless central character, a taxi driver, Gu-nam (Ha Jung-woo, subtle and moving), relating a story in voice-over. When he was young, Gu-nam says, his dog became rabid, a killer. The local villagers tried to destroy the animal, but it ran off only to return later, whereupon it lay down and died. After Gu-nam buried his dog, the elders dug it up and devoured the carcass. “The rabies that vanished has come back,” he says. “It’s going around.” On screen, a photo of an unsmiling child gives way to the adult Gu-nam losing at mah-jongg, a suggestion of generational misery.Written and directed by Na Hong-jin, “The Yellow Sea” follows Gu-nam as he descends into a nightmare that he helps create. The story takes off in Yanji, the capital of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, a wedge of China that borders North Korea and Russia. Initially, Gu-nam, an ethnic Korean (or chosun-juk), spends his time losing money at mahjongg, driving a cab or passed out in his squalid apartment, where a web of broken glass covering a framed wedding photo of him and his wife hints at the tragic misunderstanding that sets the story in fast, fast motion. His wife has left to find work in South Korea, and Gu-nam, bereft, angry, self-pitying, has built up a debt that he seems unlikely to work or gamble his way out of.When he can’t pay what he owes, he lands before a gangster, Myun-ga (Kim Yun-seok, in a tour de force performance), who will wipe out Gu-nam’s debt if he kills a man. Stoop-shouldered and somewhat sleepy, Myun-ga doesn’t look like much of a danger, but menace radiates off him, especially because he makes his offer in a dog market.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','If the Grammys are a barometer of trends in popular music, then old-school pop songs about unrequited love made a comeback this year. The pop stars Adele and Bruno Mars dominated nominations for the top prizes — to be given out at the 54th annual Grammy Awards in February — while hip-hop and country musicians were largely shut out.When the nominees were announced during a televised concert on Wednesday night, Adele and Bruno Mars each got six nominations, including nods for song, record and album of the year. Foo Fighters — Dave Grohl’s indie rock group — also received six nominations, including best album, and the rapper Kanye West was the overall leader with seven nods, all but one in the rap category.It was expected to be Adele’s year. That 23-year-old British soul singer was nominated for best album for “21,” the year’s best-selling album, which included the ubiquitous breakup song “Rolling in the Deep,” which is in the running for record and song of the year. Bruno Mars, 26, was also nominated in those two categories, for “Grenade,” his harsh song about unrequited love, and his “Doo-Wops & Hooligans,” is in the best album contest.Rounding out the list for best album are “Wasting Light,” by Foo Fighters, and two works by flamboyant pop divas: “Born This Way” by Lady Gaga and “Loud” by Rihanna. Unlike last year, no country or rap albums made the cut, producing some of the biggest surprises. The country star Taylor Swift, who won the best album award two years ago, was not nominated in that category this year, despite putting out the multiplatinum “Speak Now.” “Watch the Throne,” Mr. West’s much-hyped hip-hop collaboration with Jay-Z, was also ignored in the best album category.The nominees for record of the year — for the artist and producers of the best single — are “Rolling in the Deep” by Adele, “Grenade” by Bruno Mars, “Holocene” by Bon Iver, “The Cave” by the folk-rock group Mumford & Sons, and “Firework” by Katy Perry. The lineup for song of the year, which goes to songwriters, is identical, except Mr. West’s hit single “All of the Lights” replaces Ms. Perry’s song.Bon Iver — the musical project led by the haunting alternative songwriter Justin Vernon — is also nominated for what should be an interesting contest for best new artist. He faces off against the country trio the Band Perry, the electronic musician Skrillex and two young rappers, J. Cole and Nicki Minaj.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','“We cannot predict what will happen tomorrow, or what will happen in an hour,” Mr. Melkonyants said. “This is already an open war that they have declared on us, and the overwhelming weight is on their side.”A letter delivered by prosecutors on Thursday said that one of Golos’s most popular features — an online “map of violations” where people can post reports — violates a Russian law against publishing data, especially polling results, during the five days before voting. This is an administrative violation punishable by a fine of up to 100,000 rubles, or about $3,200.The letter also accuses Golos, which has been preparing for Sunday’s election for years, of “dissemination of rumors under the guise of trustworthy reports, with the goal of defaming a party as well as its individual members.”Though United Russia, which now has a commanding majority in Parliament, faces no powerful competitors in the election, opinion polls suggest that it will lose 50 to 60 seats, reflecting growing weariness with leadership that has not changed in a decade. State officials at all levels have been told to guard against significant losses.Meanwhile, amateur observers are pushing back, using the Internet to expose violations that include offers of cash and threats to cut off financing. Dmitri Merezhko, Golos’s communications director, said that events this fall — including the collapse of a pro-business party, Right Cause, and Mr. Putin’s announcement that he will run for president again, after a stint as prime minister and two previous terms as president — “ignited something in the most active part of the public.”“Maybe someone thinks we are the reason,” Mr. Merezhko said, referring to Golos. “But we are not the reason.”Golos’s critics in the Russian government say its work is tainted by the money it receives from two American agencies, the National Endowment for Democracy and the United States Agency for International Development. A promotional video clip for a report scheduled to be broadcast on Friday on the NTV channel, owned by the Russian energy giant Gazprom, features images of suitcases stuffed with $100 bills juxtaposed with footage of Golos’s leaders as a portentous voice asks, “Who is behind these ‘independent observers?’ ” A pro-government blogger has posted what appears to be paperwork showing that Golos received $92,653 from the United States government for the month of February.Russian officials have invoked the memory of the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine, which many people here believe was propelled by American agents. Maksim Rokhmistrov, one of the three lawmakers who signed the appeal to the prosecutor, said he was worried that Golos’s reporting could provoke civil unrest.“A girl dances with the guy who takes her to dinner, as they say,” Vzglyad, a daily newspaper, quoted Mr. Rokhmistrov as saying this week. “The question of maintaining stability in the state worries everyone at election time. No one here wants to see the beginning of our own Egypt, or our own Libya.”Mr. Melkonyants has given a number of interviews with the news media since the critiques began to appear, arguing that the foreign financing does not compromise Golos’s objectivity or violate any Russian law. He told the radio station Ekho Moskvy that much of Golos’s money came from European donors like the Helsinki Committee and the European Commission.He said Golos had submitted to rigorous audits by Russian tax authorities and the Ministry of Justice, and had repeatedly tried to secure financing from the Russian government but had been refused.Mr. Melkonyants is scheduled to appear in a Moscow courtroom on Friday at the request of prosecutors.Though every election monitoring mission has come under pressure from government officials, “it has never been so high in my memory,” he said, adding that he could not blame Golos’s partners for keeping their distance now. “There is no need to say that they are cowards,” he said. “Believe me, all of us — including the political parties — we’re all in a situation that is not simple, not simple at all.”'"

"'11-12-02,'0','What Ms. Nasar does brilliantly here — much as she did in “A Beautiful Mind,” her absorbing 1998 biography of the mathematician John Forbes Nash Jr. — is give us intimate portraits of her subjects, tracing the ways in which personal experiences informed their thinking. Ms. Nasar — a former economics correspondent for The New York Times who is now a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism — writes with ease and authority about complicated economic matters, but shows even more fluency evoking the inner lives of her subjects and the social worlds they transited.Ms. Nasar gives us Belle Époque Vienna — infatuated with modernity and challenging London in the race to electrify with new telephone service, state-of-the-art factories and power-driven trams — and then a devastating picture of Vienna at the end of World War I: war veterans loitering outside restaurants waiting for scraps, and desperate members of a middle class that saw inflation wipe out all its savings trading a piano for a sack of flour, a gold watch chain for a few sacks of potatoes.She conjures the heady, intellectual world of Cambridge in the 1930s, when Keynes’s disciples orbited him like planets around the Sun, and she captures the air of intrigue that surrounded the 1944 Bretton Woods conference, which created a global interventionist framework centered around the World Bank and International Monetary Fund: the “slightly seedy” New Hampshire resort packed with 730 delegates from 44 Allied countries and “crawling with spies.”In the course of the book the reader gets a vague sense of how the horrors of World War I, the Depression and World War II taught economists practical lessons about the functioning of fiscal policy and relationships among countries.The great innovation of the 1920s and ’30s “taught that what was good for one nation might easily be bad for all. Devaluing one’s currency, erecting trade barriers and clamping controls on capital outflows might be effective for reducing balance-of-payment deficits, stopping the outflow of gold and pumping up government revenues,” Ms. Nasar writes. “But if everybody adopted the same tactics, the eventual result would be universal impoverishment and unemployment.”By the time of Bretton Woods, Ms. Nasar goes on, a kind of global Keynesian had been widely embraced: it would be “commonly acknowledged that keeping free enterprise functioning globally required the visible hand of government.”Because of its discursive, disorganized structure, “Grand Pursuit” is read best not as a primer on the emergence of modern economics, but as a sort of Selected Lives of the Economists. Ms. Nasar introduces us to Alfred Marshall, whose own metamorphosis from scholarship boy to Cambridge don informed his “optimism about the improvability of man and his circumstances.” We meet Irving Fisher, the Yale economist, who argued, that “individual action would never give rise to a system of city parks, or even to any useful system of streets.” And Beatrice Webb, of whom Ms. Nasar writes: “No one had a greater claim to the invention of the idea of a government safety net — indeed, the modern welfare state” than she did.Among the more compelling portraits in this volume is that of Joseph Alois Schumpeter, the brilliant European economist who argued that the distinctive feature of capitalism was “incessant innovation” — a “perennial gale of creative destruction” — and who identified the entrepreneur as the visionary who could “revolutionize the pattern of production by exploiting an invention” or “an untried technological possibility.”Although Ms. Nasar does a concise job of explicating what her various subjects thought about the role government should play in regulating the markets — as well as their thoughts about the causes and possible solutions to problems like unemployment and inflation — she does little to show the reader how their theories might shed light on the current economic difficulties of the United States and Europe: another disappointment in this immensely gifted writer’s ungainly, though sometimes inspired, book.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','Ante Markovic, who as the last prime minister of Yugoslavia tried to stave off the ethnic warfare that led to the disintegration of that nation, died on Nov. 28 in Zagreb, the Croatian capital. He was 87.Mr. Markovic, a Croat born in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina, was named prime minister in January 1989, two years before his formerly Communist country fell apart. Despite ancient ethnic rivalries, Yugoslavia had been held together during the 35-year regime of Marshal Josip Broz Tito as perhaps the most open of the totalitarian Eastern European states. Mr. Markovic’s predecessor, Branko Mikulic, made early attempts at liberalization, but resigned in December 1988 when the Yugoslav Parliament rejected his economic reforms. On Jan. 19, 1989, the collective presidency — representing Yugoslavia’s six republics and two autonomous provinces — chose Mr. Markovic as prime minister.Tensions rose as Slovenia and Croatia, the two most prosperous republics, sought a loose confederation that would give them greater autonomy over their economies. Serbia, with 36 percent of the population, opposed decentralization.Hoping to keep the country together, Mr. Markovic instituted economic programs that, for a time, significantly reduced unemployment and inflation that in 1988 had reached 2,400 percent. But his programs faltered as many formerly state-subsidized enterprises went out of business, leaving thousands out of work.By January 1990, the Communist Party had surrendered its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power, and the six republics had seized local control. Soon after, in another attempt to unify the country, Mr. Markovic announced that the central government would conduct free, multiparty national elections.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','SAN ANTONIO — The call came into the behavior specialists here from a doctor in Afghanistan. His patient had just been through a firefight and now was cowering under a cot, refusing to come out.Post-traumatic stress disorder, thought Dr. Walter F. Burghardt Jr., chief of behavioral medicine at the Daniel E. Holland Military Working Dog Hospital at Lackland Air Force Base. Specifically, canine PTSD.If anyone needed evidence of the frontline role played by dogs in war these days, here is the latest: the four-legged, wet-nosed troops used to sniff out mines, track down enemy fighters and clear buildings are struggling with the mental strains of combat nearly as much as their human counterparts.By some estimates, more than 5 percent of the approximately 650 military dogs deployed by American combat forces are developing canine PTSD. Of those, about half are likely to be retired from service, Dr. Burghardt said.Though veterinarians have long diagnosed behavioral problems in animals, the concept of canine PTSD is only about 18 months old, and still being debated. But it has gained vogue among military veterinarians, who have been seeing patterns of troubling behavior among dogs exposed to explosions, gunfire and other combat-related violence in Iraq and Afghanistan.Like humans with the analogous disorder, different dogs show different symptoms. Some become hyper-vigilant. Others avoid buildings or work areas that they had previously been comfortable in. Some undergo sharp changes in temperament, becoming unusually aggressive with their handlers, or clingy and timid. Most crucially, many stop doing the tasks they were trained to perform.“If the dog is trained to find improvised explosives and it looks like it’s working, but isn’t, it’s not just the dog that’s at risk,” Dr. Burghardt said. “This is a human health issue as well.”That the military is taking a serious interest in canine PTSD underscores the importance of working dogs in the current wars. Once used primarily as furry sentries, military dogs — most are German shepherds, followed by Belgian Malinois and Labrador retrievers — have branched out into an array of specialized tasks.They are widely considered the most effective tools for detecting the improvised explosive devices, or I.E.D.’s, frequently used in Afghanistan. Typically made from fertilizer and chemicals, and containing little or no metal, those buried bombs can be nearly impossible to find with standard mine-sweeping instruments. In the past three years, I.E.D.’s have become the major cause of casualties in Afghanistan.The Marine Corps also has begun using specially trained dogs to track Taliban fighters and bomb-makers. And Special Operations commandos train their own dogs to accompany elite teams on secret missions like the Navy SEAL raid that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. Across all the forces, more than 50 military dogs have been killed since 2005.The number of working dogs on active duty has risen to 2,700, from 1,800 in 2001, and the training school headquartered here at Lackland has gotten busy, preparing about 500 dogs a year. So has the Holland hospital, the Pentagon’s canine version of Walter Reed Army Medical Center.Dr. Burghardt, a lanky 59-year-old who retired last year from the Air Force as a colonel, rarely sees his PTSD patients in the flesh. Consultations with veterinarians in the field are generally done by phone, e-mail or Skype, and often involve video documentation.In a series of videos that Dr. Burghardt uses to train veterinarians to spot canine PTSD, one shepherd barks wildly at the sound of gunfire that it had once tolerated in silence. Another can be seen confidently inspecting the interior of cars but then refusing to go inside a bus or a building. Another sits listlessly on a barrier wall, then after finally responding to its handler’s summons, runs away from a group of Afghan soldiers.In each case, Dr. Burghardt theorizes, the dogs were using an object, vehicle or person as a “cue” for some violence they had witnessed. “If you want to put doggy thoughts into their heads,” he said, “the dog is thinking: when I see this kind of individual, things go boom, and I’m distressed.”Treatment can be tricky. Since the patient cannot explain what is wrong, veterinarians and handlers must make educated guesses about the traumatizing events. Care can be as simple as taking a dog off patrol and giving it lots of exercise, playtime and gentle obedience training.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','A sense of normalcy is returning to the N.B.A., in ways both subtle and profound.The players union will soon be back in business, ensuring a timely completion of a new labor deal and a Christmas Day opening. Meanwhile, the players’ faces are slowly returning to N.B.A. Web sites.On Thursday night, the league began restoring the players’ names, faces, statistics and video to NBA.com and the Web sites of all 30 teams. The transition was expected to be complete by Friday morning.NBA TV will likewise cease its frequent replays of “Teen Wolf” and “The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh” in favor of more current and vital programming. Starting at 1 a.m. Eastern on Friday, the channel was to begin carrying condensed, one-hour replays of each game of the 2011 N.B.A. finals. Those highlights will be repeated until 7 p.m. Friday, when “N.B.A. Game Time” will return.The full schedule for the 66-game season will be announced Tuesday at 7 p.m., on NBATV.All references to the players were expunged from the N.B.A.’s digital platforms on July 1, when the league imposed a lockout. The parties reached a tentative settlement last Saturday.The players first had to re-form their union, a process requiring the signatures of about 260 players. More than 300 had been submitted to the American Arbitration Association as of 6 p.m. Thursday.The players dissolved their union on Nov. 14, after labor talks collapsed, in order to file an antitrust lawsuit against the league. The parties subsequently resumed negotiations.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','“We are seeing a broad spectrum of customers return to the market,” Don Johnson, G.M.’s vice president of United States sales operations, said in a statement. “Truck sales showed a very solid increase, as we expected, but the momentum building behind our most fuel-efficient vehicles was even stronger.”One automaker that did not report a gain was Honda, whose sales fell 6 percent. Honda’s operations were the most disrupted by the March earthquake and tsunami in Japan and the company is still working to fully rebuild its inventories. Toyota, which also experienced a sales downturn for much of the year, said it sold 7 percent more cars and trucks in November.Nissan reported a 19 percent gain, led by higher demand for its Versa and Sentra small cars.Many consumers who held off buying a new vehicle because of the uncertain economy, or because of inventory shortages that caused prices to jump, are now making a purchase. The result is a “mini-bubble” that will end in early 2012, said Edmunds.com, a Web site for automotive information.The industry’s annualized selling rate, seasonally adjusted, climbed in November to 13.63 million vehicles, the highest since the government’s cash-for-clunkers program in August 2009. In June, the selling rate was 11.45 million.Automakers are on track to sell at least 12.7 million vehicles this year, about 10 percent more than last year.“People are now returning to the marketplace, and that’s what’s driving the sales increases over the last couple of months,” said Jeremy Anwyl, the chief executive of Edmunds. “But the idea that there’s a sustained turnaround under way and that this will continue is probably overstating things.”But Ford executives said they expected the market to keep growing steadily, and they increased fourth-quarter production by 2 percent from the company’s previous forecast.“The industry sales rate has exceeded 13 million in each of the last three months,” said Ken Czubay, Ford’s vice president for United States marketing, sales and service, said in a statement. “This suggests the current momentum is not an aberration. We believe replacement demand will continue to support stronger levels in 2012.”November was the best month so far for G.M.’s plug-in hybrid car, the Chevrolet Volt. It sold 1,139 Volts, bringing the year’s total to 6,142. G.M. officials acknowledged Thursday for the first time that the company would not achieve its goal of selling 10,000 Volts this year after federal safety regulators said they were opening an investigation into the car’s 400-pound lithium-ion battery pack.G.M. has since sent letters to all Volt owners to reassure them of the car’s safety, and it offered to lend anyone who was concerned about the issue a replacement vehicle free. It also has offered to buy back cars from dissatisfied owners.Sales of the Volt’s primary competition, the Nissan Leaf, were 672 in November, for a total of 8,720 this year. Both cars were introduced in late 2010.'"
"'11-12-02,'0','Stocks were mostly lower on Thursday as better-than-forecast manufacturing growth and a rally in French and Spanish bonds were not enough to extend a three-day gain in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index.Financial stocks fell the most among 10 industries in the S.& P. 500, dropping 1 percent, as Massachusetts sued some of the largest lenders over foreclosure practices. Alcoa lost 2.1 percent as commodities retreated. Kohl’s slumped 6.4 percent after November sales missed estimates.The S.& P. 500 slid 2.38 points, or 0.19 percent, to 1,244.58. The index rallied 4.3 percent on Wednesday as six central banks took action on Europe’s debt crisis by making it cheaper for lenders to borrow in dollars.

The Nasdaq composite average rose 5.86 points, or 0.22 percent, to 2,626,20.“Pressures on the financials are still out there,” said Timothy M. Ghriskey, chief investment officer of the Solaris Group in Bedford Hills, N.Y. “The economic data was positive, but Europe is still a concern. The coordinated central bank action is not a solution. It buys them some time.”Stocks rose in early trading as Spain and France sold 8.1 billion euros ($10.9 billion) of bonds, sending yields lower across Europe.

"'11-12-03,'0','“More and more members of the law enforcement community are speaking out against failed drug policies, and they don’t give up their right to share their insight and engage in this important debate simply because they receive government paychecks,” said Daniel Pochoda, the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, which is handling the Miller case.Mr. Miller was one of 32 members of LEAP who signed the letter, which expressed support for a California ballot measure that failed last year that would have permitted recreational marijuana use. Most of the signers were retired members of law enforcement agencies, who can speak their minds without fear of action by their bosses. But Mr. Miller and a handful of others who were still on the job — including the district attorney for Humboldt County in California and the Oakland city attorney — signed, too.LEAP has seen its membership increase significantly from the time it was founded in 2002 by five disillusioned officers. It now has an e-mail list of 48,000, and its members include 145 judges, prosecutors, police officers, prison guards and other law enforcement officials, most of them retired, who speak on the group’s behalf.“No one wants to be fired and have to fight for their job in court,” said Neill Franklin, a retired police officer who is LEAP’s executive director. “So most officers are reluctant to sign on board. But we do have some brave souls.”Mr. Miller was accused of not making clear that he was speaking for himself and not the probation department while advocating the decriminalization of cannabis. His lawsuit, though, points out that the letter he signed said at the bottom, “All agency affiliations are listed for identification purposes only.”He was also accused of dishonesty for denying that he had given approval for his name to appear on the LEAP letter. In the lawsuit, Mr. Miller said that his wife had given approval without his knowledge, using his e-mail address, but that he had later supported her.Kip Anderson, the court administrator for the Superior Court in Mohave County, said there was no desire to limit Mr. Miller’s political views.“This isn’t about legalization,” Mr. Anderson said. “We’re not taking a stand on that. We just didn’t want people to think he was speaking on behalf of the probation department.”Mr. Miller, who is also a retired police officer and Marine, lost an appeal of his dismissal before a hearing officer. But when his application for unemployment benefits was turned down, he appealed that and won. An administrative law judge found that Mr. Miller had not been dishonest with his bosses and that the disclaimer on the letter was sufficient.In the case of Mr. Gonzalez, the fired Border Patrol agent, he had not joined LEAP but had expressed sympathy with the group’s cause. “It didn’t make sense to me why marijuana is illegal,” he said. “To see that thousands of people are dying, some of whom I know, makes you want to look for a change.”Since his firing, Mr. Gonzalez, who filed suit in federal court in Texas in January, has worked as a construction worker, a bouncer and a yard worker. He has also gone back to school, where he is considering a law degree.“I don’t want to work at a place that says I can’t think,” said Mr. Gonzalez, who grew up in El Paso, just across the border from Ciudad Juárez, which has experienced some of the worst bloodshed in Mexico.The Justice Department, which is defending the Border Patrol, has sought to have the case thrown out. Mr. Gonzalez lost a discrimination complaint filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sided with his supervisors’ view that they had lost trust that he would uphold the law.Those challenging their dismissals are buoyed by the case of Jonathan Wender, who was fired as a police sergeant in Mountlake Terrace, Wash., in 2005, partly as a result of his support for the decriminalization of marijuana. Mr. Wender won a settlement of $815,000 as well as his old job back. But he retired from the department and took up teaching at the University of Washington, where one of his courses is “Drugs and Society.”Among those not yet ready to publicly urge the legalization of drugs is a veteran Texas police officer who quietly supports LEAP and spoke on the condition that he not be identified. “We all know the drug war is a bad joke,” he said in a telephone interview. “But we also know that you’ll never get promoted if you’re seen as soft on drugs.”Mr. Franklin, the LEAP official, said it was natural that those on the front lines of enforcing drug laws would have strong views on them, either way. It was the death of a colleague at the hands of a drug dealer in 2000 that prompted Mr. Franklin, a veteran officer, to begin questioning the nation’s drug policies. Some of his colleagues, though, hit the streets even more aggressively, he said.Mr. Franklin said he got calls all the time from colleagues skeptical about the drug laws as they are written but unwilling to speak out — yet.“I was speaking to a guy with the Maryland State Police this past Saturday, and he’s about to retire in January and he’s still reluctant to join us until he leaves,” Mr. Franklin said. “He wants to have a good last couple of months, without any hassle.”'"
"'11-12-03,'0','He said he would not try the case a third time unless new evidence emerged. It remained open until 1969, when his successor dropped the murder charge.In 1989, new evidence did emerge. Witnesses said they had heard Mr. Beckwith brag about the Evers killing. Others came forward to destroy his alibi. Because there is no statute of limitations on murder in Mississippi, Mr. Beckwith was indicted again. He was convicted of murder in 1994 and died in prison in 2001 while serving a life sentence.William Lowe Waller was born in Oxford, Miss., on Oct. 21, 1926, and grew up on poverty’s edge on a farm in the Northeast Mississippi hill country. He would later be sure to mention the experience in his political campaigns, especially at rural stops. “Bill Waller is a redneck who has felt a hoe handle in his hands,” went the refrain.After high school he hitchhiked to Memphis State University, where he earned a degree in 1948. He graduated from the University of Mississippi School of Law in 1950, served in the Army in the Korean War and worked as a private lawyer in Jackson. He became district attorney in 1960.Mr. Evers’s murder was his biggest case, and perhaps his biggest challenge. For the first trial, only 6 out of a pool of 200 potential jurors were not white. Three of these were called for questioning, and all were dismissed. Mr. Waller, having only whites to question in jury selection, tried to weed out the most obvious racists.“Do you think it’s a crime to kill a nigger in Mississippi?” he asked one potential juror.After a long silence, the judge demanded an answer.In the trials, Mr. Waller was not sure how to address Myrlie Evers, Medgar Evers’s widow. In his 2007 book, “Straight Ahead: The Memoirs of a Mississippi Governor,” he wrote that he was determined not to call her only by her first name, the customarily demeaning way many Southern whites addressed blacks.But he knew that showing deference to a black woman by calling her “Mrs. Evers” would harm his chances of winning a conviction. So he managed never to address her by name, an omission he later regretted, he said in his memoir. He wished he had called her Mrs. Evers.He ran for governor in a six-candidate field in 1967 and finished fifth. He tried again in 1971 in the Democratic primary campaign, emphasizing not race relations but building better highways, fighting drug abuse, creating jobs and cutting government waste. A rival, Lt. Gov. Charles Sullivan, appealed directly for the black vote, which had grown as a result of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.Mr. Waller won a runoff between the two, getting many black votes in a contest that in an overwhelmingly Democratic state effectively decided the governorship. Local politicians and pundits attributed his victory to his vigorous prosecution in the Evers case.As it happened, he was opposed in the general election by Charles Evers, Medgar Evers’s brother and the mayor of Fayette, Miss., who ran as an independent. On a populist platform and backed by rural whites and black Democrats loyal to the party, Mr. Waller rolled to victory with 77 percent of the vote.Though Mr. Waller had not run on race issues, one of his first acts as governor was to name a black as a top adviser, attracting national publicity. He recruited the first blacks for the state’s highway patrol and appointed the first blacks to a planning committee for the Mississippi State Fair. He was grouped with Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and Jimmy Carter of Georgia as a new sort of Southern governor.But Mr. Waller did not mind antagonizing his black supporters sometimes. He opposed busing for racial integration, and in 1972 he released a Ku Klux Klansman convicted of murdering a civil rights leader. The governor explained that the skills of the Klansman, Charles Clifford Wilson, in making artificial limbs were needed by a charity in Mr. Wilson’s hometown.Mr. Waller ran unsuccessfully for the United States Senate in 1978 and for governor in 1987.He is survived by his wife of 61 years, the former Carroll Overton; his sons, Robert, Edward, Donald and William Jr., who is chief justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court; and 14 grandchildren.'"
"'11-12-03,'0','The evidence-based pilot programs make up a tiny portion of federal spending, accounting for about $1.2 billion out of a $670 billion budget for nonmilitary discretionary programs in the 2011 fiscal year. Nevertheless, policy experts hold that they represent an important change in how Washington thinks about accountability for such spending.“All of these programs sprang out of asking the question: How can we get better results with less money in a constrained fiscal environment?” said Robert Gordon, executive associate director of the White House budget office. “If your goal is to change how government works and to send a signal that results matter, programs like these are powerful.”The idea of tying money to outcomes seems commonsensical. But policy experts say most federally financed social programs — like the preschool program Head Start or job retraining initiatives for displaced workers — do not consider results when determining how to allocate money.“For most large social programs,” said Jon Baron, president of the Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy in Washington, “the federal government plays the role of a faucet. It directs the agencies to allocate large streams of funding, often determined by formula. Evidence about which programs are effective or not does not come into the picture.”That began changing during the Bush administration, after years of research showed taxpayers spending billions of dollars for sometimes negligible results on things like substance abuse prevention and early childhood education.The Bush administration created the home-visiting initiative, a $10 million competitive grant pilot program to help state and local governments invest in “quality assurance systems,” train workers and establish programs with “strong fidelity to a proven effective model,” in 2008. Congress expanded the spending to $13.5 million the next year.When the Obama administration came into office, it decided to “turn the dial up,” said Peter R. Orszag, a former budget director who is now a vice chairman at Citigroup. “The ethos is not just to spend money blindly, but to make investments — to spend money on things that demonstrate that they work. If you try three approaches to job training, you actually try to over time dedicate more money to the programs that work better.”The administration drastically expanded the home-visiting program, increasing spending to $1.5 billion over five years. And it decided to apply the evidence-based ethos to other programs. Congress approved $75 million to study and replicate the most effective teenage-pregnancy prevention programs, for instance. It also added competitive, evidence-based financing for two work force training programs, an initiative to improve student achievement and an initiative to help low-income communities.The administrators of the programs say it may take several more years to see hard results. For instance, Paul Carttar, the director of the Social Innovation Fund, says it remains focused on building the infrastructure for its competitive grants to community organizations. But he estimates the program has already reached 70,000 people through local initiatives with a “very significant evidence requirement.”“There are other benefits of these programs that oftentimes are not really appreciated,” Mr. Carttar said. “Other federal agencies can adopt the best practices identified by evidence-based programs. By that same logic, they also have tremendous value, not just to federal grant-makers, but to philanthropic grant-makers, individual donors — anyone who thinks about money creating an impact.”The proposed budget cuts have bewildered social scientists and good-government experts. “Why, in a constrained budget environment, do you cut the programs that have to show they’re working?” asked Ron Haskins, a former Republican Congressional staff member and White House adviser who is co-director of the Brookings Center on Children and Families. “It makes no sense.”The White House has also strongly objected to the subcommittee’s zeroing out financing. Jacob L. Lew, the White House budget director, sent a letter acknowledging the necessity of budget cuts, but asking that Congress retain spending for programs that can help states save money and improve outcomes. “In a period of limited resources, these initiatives encourage and reflect the systemic changes and evidence-based interventions that can achieve the greatest impacts at the lowest cost,” he wrote.Mr. Rehberg, the appropriations subcommittee chairman, stresses that nothing is final. “The days of blindly throwing money at any and all programs without any consideration of how well they work are over, as well they should be,” he said in an e-mail.But Democrats on the subcommittee have said they will fight for their inclusion.“These initiatives are targeted, focused investments that would improve our schools and help American families during these difficult economic times,” said Representative Rosa L. DeLauro of Connecticut, the senior Democrat on the subcommittee. “Cutting these initiatives, and many other worthwhile programs and services, is the wrong direction.”'"
"'11-12-03,'0','E-ZPass tolls during peak travel times rose to $9.50 from $8. By 2015, the cash toll will be $15 and the E-ZPass toll will be $12.50.About 3.5 percent more riders started using E-ZPass and, over all, the Port Authority received 20 percent more in toll revenue than it did the year before.While advocacy groups like the Tri-State Transportation Campaign are pleased that use of public transportation is up, they also hoped it would give government agencies more reason to spend on mass transit.“Shifting more transit is definitely a good thing for the economy and the environment,” said Veronica Vanterpool, associate director of the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. “While transit across the region and especially across the Hudson River has seen tremendous growth in ridership, there hasn’t been a comparable level of financial investment in transit service.”Ron Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority, said the agency’s fleet of PATH trains could absorb the 4 percent increase in ridership. Mr. Marsico added that the agency recently replaced its fleet of 340 cars, with new ones that allow customers to enter and exit more quickly.Over the next few years, he said, the Port Authority will also replace its mechanical switches with computers that will allow trains to run closer together.Joshua Crandall, who runs CleverCommute.com, a Web site where commuters share up-to-the-minute information on bus and train delays with other members, said even some affluent customers had been persuaded to leave their cars at home.“The decision has become easier to say ‘I’m going to get on the train,’ ” he said.The Port Authority experienced a similar drop in car traffic after raising tolls to $8 from $6 in 2008, Mr. Marsico said. But that decline was temporary. PATH ridership also rose after the toll increase, but fell in 2009, largely because of the economy, before rebounding somewhat in 2010.Before the September toll increase, Erica Yahr had driven into Manhattan from Montclair, N.J., one to two days a week for the past 15 years. She is no cheapskate: She recently splurged on an iPad, often has lunch at Pret a Manger and has dinner out. But now she takes the train every day.“I will not drive in on my own dime anymore,” Ms. Yahr said. “It just has to do with how big of a hike at one time that they did. It’s just obnoxious.”Longtime bus and train riders have also noticed the change. Michael Catchpole, who has been taking the Decamp 33 Grove bus into Manhattan for the past three years, said that before the toll increases, he could find a seat four days a week, but he is now lucky to sit once a week.Two to three days a week, he said, buses are so crowded that they do not stop at all.“Suddenly there was barely even room to stand on the bus,” he said.'"

"'11-12-03,'0','“Napolitano not only dictated the timing of the solution but also the contents, that is the unusual thing,” said Andrea Simoncini, a constitutional law professor at the University of Florence. “He didn’t only say, ‘You have to do it soon’; he basically chose Monti and created the conditions so that people couldn’t not say yes to Monti.”Today, Mr. Monti’s government is widely referred to as “a government of the president,” backed by Mr. Napolitano and the European Union as much as by the Italian Parliament, which gave Mr. Monti’s government a rousing vote of confidence last month but has yet to approve unpopular new austerity measures.As often happens in Italy, momentum built slowly, but change happened swiftly. For months, Mr. Berlusconi had clung to power without solid support, making much-needed economic reforms impossible as world markets continued to hammer Italy. The trigger was pulled on Nov. 8, when Mr. Berlusconi lost his ruling majority on a vote the same day bond markets drove borrowing rates on Italian bonds to the same levels that have required other euro zone countries to seek bailouts.That evening, a humbled Mr. Berlusconi went to meet Mr. Napolitano at the Quirinal presidential palace for consultations. Aides said the meeting was cordial, but its outcome was clear: The once-Teflon prime minister had agreed to step down.Moving quickly, Mr. Napolitano plucked Mr. Monti from his post as president of Milan’s Bocconi University and anointed him as a senator for life, making him a full member of Parliament, not just an academic outsider. “That was an act of genius,” said Corrado Augias, a veteran Italian political commentator and writer. “He took a professor and redressed him as a politician.”IT helped that Mr. Napolitano, whose seven-year term began in 2006, enjoys popular approval ratings of around 80 percent, compared with 20 percent in recent weeks for Mr. Berlusconi. “This was his life insurance, because if he hadn’t had it, Berlusconi would have eaten him for lunch,” Mr. Augias said.In the topsy-turvy world of Mr. Berlusconi’s Italy, where the prime minister’s personal life came to overshadow the work of governance, Mr. Napolitano had emerged as the anti-Berlusconi. With his elegant yet feisty wife, Clio, by his side, a lawyer whom he married in 1959, Mr. Napolitano came to be seen as embodying a different Italy, one of civic virtue.This month, the Italian edition of Wired magazine named Mr. Napolitano its man of the year, for displaying “a surprising speed in remaining connected to reality. In a word: Wired.”Even after Mr. Berlusconi did step down, the idea of replacing his cabinet with a technocratic government was not at all a given. The former prime minister’s center-right coalition was dead set on early elections, and some in his former coalition criticize the Monti government as an anti-democratic coup.But in a new order in which markets trumped traditional democratic processes, President Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France all called Mr. Napolitano during the delicate transition to express their support for his leadership — calls widely seen as tacit support for a Monti government over early elections.It was a striking indication of how far Mr. Napolitano, to say nothing of the rest of the world, has come in the last years of his career.At one time, the idea of an American president thanking Mr. Napolitano — who was essentially the foreign minister of the Italian Communist Party — or even calling him was unthinkable.In his earlier years, Mr. Napolitano did not stray much from the Communist Party line, once going so far as to say that the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 had contributed to peace in the world, according to a 2006 article in Corriere della Sera. But by 1969, he was part of a group of Italian Communists who broke with the Kremlin to criticize the crackdown of the Prague Spring uprising of 1968.LIKE many Communists from his native Naples, Mr. Napolitano hailed from the more conservative wing of the party, whose members were known as the “miglioristi,” or the “improvers,” for their desire to make the world better through government rather than revolution.The ambassador to Italy under President Jimmy Carter, Richard N. Gardner, wrote in his memoirs about his secret meetings with Mr. Napolitano, who was respected enough to become one of the first Italian Communist officials to visit the United States.He made the trip in 1978, just weeks after the dramatic kidnapping of former Prime Minister Aldo Moro by a leftist radical group, and delivered well-received lectures at leading universities. None other than the seven-time Christian Democratic prime minister Giulio Andreotti, the mastermind of postwar Italian politics, said that he had helped secure Mr. Napolitano a visa.In the late 1980s, as the communist project was ending and the party reacted by closing ranks, Mr. Napolitano fell out of favor by calling for closer ties with the Socialists, whose social democratic views he largely shared. He left instead for Strasbourg, France, where he was a member of the European Parliament from 1989 to 1992.After the collapse of Italy’s old political order in a bribery scandal, Mr. Napolitano returned to Italy in 1992 and became speaker of the Lower House, where he commanded broad support. In 1996 he was seen as enough above the fray to be named Italy’s first post-Communist interior minister, a politically sensitive position that involves overseeing the secret service.Now, Italians are looking to Mr. Napolitano to guide the ship of state with quiet skill as Mr. Monti and his team of technocrats take on the treacherous challenge of modernizing Italy’s creaking economy.“I appreciate his dynamism and courage, especially remarkable for a man of that age,” said Paolo Olsoufieff, a retired businessman, as he read a newspaper in a restaurant in downtown Rome. “He is the only man capable of holding at bay the circus of ferocious beasts that is the Italian Parliament.”'"
"'11-12-03,'0','State officials said Friday that they would begin examining Detroit’s finances, a first step in what might put Michigan’s largest city under the control of an outside manager. “While we have long hoped the mayor and City Council would agree on a viable recovery plan, given the mayor’s description of the city’s financial condition and the prospect the city may run out of cash in mere months, it has become clear that a preliminary financial review is not only warranted but necessary,” said Andy Dillon, the state treasurer. The review, which is to start next week, will go on even as Detroit officials try to agree on cuts.'"
"'11-12-03,'0','Miller was the last American to win on the Birds of Prey downhill course, in 2006. He also won in 2004. Combined with Lindsey Vonn’s win in the women’s World Cup downhill in Lake Louise, Alberta, on Friday, it was quite the day for United States ski racing.For the 24-year-old Feuz, the second-place finish was the fourth time he has reached a World Cup podium, all in the downhill.“The lower part was absolutely perfect for me,” Feuz said through an interpreter. “The top part was not perfect, but I risked it all, so I knew I was with the best.”How close were the top finishers? “Four hundredths is not a lot of time at that speed,” Miller said. “We’re going across the finish at 75 miles an hour — four hundredths is about a foot and a half. And after a mile and a half of racing, it comes down to a foot and a half.”Racers widely praised the course conditions, including Miller. “It’s absolutely a pleasure to ski,” he said. Because of poor snow conditions in Europe, the F.I.S. added three more races here for next week in addition to the regularly scheduled men’s super-G and giant slalom set for this weekend. Miller said he planned to race in them all.“Most forgiving conditions we’ve ever had here partly because there’s no icy parts at all,” Miller said. “So you can set your skis up specifically for this really aggressive Colorado snow.”He said his recent training in Colorado, including at Copper Mountain, at the new United States Ski Team Speed Center, proved to be helpful.“It’s nice to have enough time on this type of snow because it is a little bit unusual with the altitude and dry air,” he said. “At this point in my career, the setup of my equipment ends up being the most important thing.”Miller’s 3-year-old daughter watched her father’s victory, a first, from the finish area with Miller’s parents. “She was really excited and happy, and then pretty quickly after that had a complete meltdown for no reason — we all know how that goes,” Miller said, chuckling.Miller is one of the outspoken World Cup athletes critical of a new International Ski Federation rule related to giant slalom skis for next season. He seemed pleased to let his skiing do the talking for a day.But in the two downhill training runs on the course earlier this week — Miller was fourth and eighth — he acknowledged he was not running risk full. “There’s just no way to fake it in a training run,” he said. “In a couple of spots, I’m testing out what I can do and what I can’t do. But you can’t take that kind of risk unless there’s something really on the line. And today it was on the line.“I mean, to make it work, 7 out of 10 times it doesn’t work. I hit five or six gates down that pitch where if I was another 8 or 10 inches inside where I was, the day’s over. That’s how close it is.”Asked why he laid it all on the line, Miller said: “I think it’s what skiing needs right now. I’ve done it ever since I was a kid, but right now it seems like more and more times you see guys really technically master the course, but they’re not committed to the risk, and I think it’s a shame. So if I can bring it, I do.”'"
"'11-12-03,'0','As a dog lover, I found the report of post-traumatic stress disorder among “dogs of war” deeply sad. We bring such animals into the violent conflicts of our species on our accord, not theirs.But as a doctor, I couldn’t help but catch the gleam of a silver lining. All too many of my human patients with mental health problems have been denigrated throughout their lives for issues that are “all in their heads.” I doubt that many would dismiss canine PTSD as a dog’s discretionary self-indulgence.If trauma — in battle or elsewhere — can unhinge the uncluttered mind of a dog, how much more readily it must affect the complex mind of a human.My hope is that in recognizing the vulnerability of dogs to mental traumas, we might gain more respect, and compassion, for our own. If so, we owe our four-legged friends yet another debt of gratitude.'"
"'11-12-03,'0','Mr. Lindemann showed up anyway. And the only activism I saw was folded, shrewdly, into the fair’s “Art Public” section: a gathering space for Miami community groups, courtesy of the artists Andrea Bowers and Olga Koumoundouros, where you could pick up a leaflet or buy a T-shirt that said “99%.”No one seemed particularly worried about protests or the euro zone at the fair’s V.I.P. preview in the Miami Beach Convention Center. The work, though, appeared more conservative than in years past.The blue-chip selections were plentiful, among them an elegant display of Calder and Miró sculptures (at Helly Nahmad) and a stuffy-looking but rewarding exhibition of Modiglianis, Soutines and other School of Paris artists (at Galerie Thomas).Those looking for more of a party atmosphere could find it at Mary Boone, where Barbara Kruger’s huge wall texts shouted “Money makes money” and other turns of phrase on the topic of filthy lucre. Just across the aisle, L&M had an equally snazzy booth wallpapered with Warhol’s cows and festooned with a broad selection of his drawings.Many other exhibitors relied on size to make a statement. Edward Tyler Nahem gave most of its booth to a 30-foot-long Frank Stella, “Khurasan Gate Variation III,” from 1968. Everywhere, dealers were pulling out their tape measures.The message, over all, was “We’re here to do business,” not “What does this all mean?” Only a few dealers, like Peter Blum, took shots at the fair environment. At his booth two paintings from a series called “Bankrupt Banks,” by the Danish artists’ group Superflex, caused many double-takes with their prominent corporate logos.Some of the most ambitious displays could be found in the “Art Nova” section, where the official restrictions — only art made in the last three years, and no more than two or three artists per exhibitor — seemed to foster creativity.The smallness of the booths was no obstacle to Untitled, host to an enthralling maze of painting, photography and drywall by Brendan Fowler and Matthew Chambers, or to Overduin and Kite, dominated by Dianna Molzan’s marriage of dainty pastels and muscular formalism.“The Art Kabinett,” single-artist shows scattered throughout the fair, were uneven. The better ones could be hard to find, as was the case with the Francis Alys slide show “Sleepers” (at Galerie Peter Kilchmann); others, like Elmgreen and Dragset’s “idealized gay sauna,” at Galeria Helga de Alvear, took over entire booths.But the only real disappointment at the convention center was “Art Positions,” the section devoted to emerging artists and galleries. Much of the work looked meek and derivative, with the exception of Paulo Nazareth’s “Banana Market/Art Market,” a green Volkswagen van piled high with bananas.Meanwhile, Theaster Gates and Emily Sundblad confirmed, in his sculptures and her paintings, that they are more exciting performers than object makers.The New Art Dealers Alliance fair, at the Deauville Hotel, seemed to be a healthier place for young talent (and some not-so-young; Leo Koenig was showing photographs by Sigmar Polke.)There was plenty of painting, most of it pretty good if not particularly adventurous. But sculpture, video and performance had their moments too. Sean Bluechel’s booth of cactuslike ceramics was a hit, as was Dave Miko and Tom Thayer’s shimmering, abstract video installation (at Eleven Rivington). And On Stellar Rays had photographs fresh from the performance artist Clifford Owens’s current MoMA PS1 survey.For New Yorkers, Art Basel often seemed like an extension of the Performa biennial (which ended in late November). The fair’s increasingly prominent “Art Public” section, in Collins Park, had a full schedule of performances organized with the help of the on-site Bass Museum.On opening night, you could see Theaster Gates and the Black Monks of Mississippi chant on a beachside stage, or help Glenn Kaino try to “levitate” his sculpture — a model of the 1939 World’s Fair — by holding the edge of its wooden platform.You could also wander into the Bass and pour yourself a libation from one of Erwin Wurm’s “Drinking Sculptures,” bar cabinets named for heavy-imbibing artists, including Edvard Munch and Martin Kippenberger. They seemed both silly and cruel. Better to visit the Mark Handforth survey at MoCA North Miami, where his large-scale sculptures of twisted street signs offered potency without consequences.And if you were up for a real museum experience, the Miami Art Museum’s Faith Ringgold exhibition delivered. New Yorkers who missed the show when it was at the Neuberger Museum at Purchase College in Purchase, N.Y., last fall now have another chance to be rocked by Ms. Ringgold’s 1960s series “American People” — a fearless and frank exploration of the civil rights era. If you had spent too long among the convention center’s shiny trophies, the mural-sized “Die,” with its cool gray background and red-hot gunfight scene, let you know it.The exhibition at the Rubell Family Collection also promised a national conversation, along the lines of the Rubells’ 2009 show “30 Americans” (now at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington). But the title “American Exuberance” proved to be a catch-all for recent acquisitions like Sterling Ruby’s moody, spray-painted canvases. Only John Miller’s room of gold-painted, trash-strewn columns and porticos, which had a “Last Days of Pompeii” feel, cut through the cocktail chatter.New to the collection circuit was “Home Alone,” an exhibition sampling the Adam and Lenore Sender Collection. This show in the Senders’ bayside home was available only by invitation, which was understandable, given the intimate spaces. The curator Sarah Aibel made mischievous use of the home’s nooks and crannies, installing a Sarah Lucas rooster in the master shower and two Elizabeth Peytons in a child’s closet.It was a very private experience. But over the course of the week — even over the course of a day — I had many public ones that were just as memorable.In that spirit was the renegade mini-fair SEVEN, where entry is free, and galleries share space on a “salon wall.” There, a vending machine by the artist Jennifer Dalton dispensed wristbands of the sort used to pass through velvet ropes. They read, “What this says does not matter.”'"
"'11-12-03,'0','Del Potro said the slow clay helped Ferrer deal with his serve, but gave full credit to his opponent, underlining the struggle that Argentina now faced.“We are still alive and have another chance tomorrow, but you could see today that you can play unbelievable tennis against Spain and still lose,” Del Potro said.Nadal had arrived in Seville after failing to win a trophy since the French Open in June and a disappointing early exit from the recent Masters tournament in London, which included a bruising defeat against Roger Federer.But on Friday, Nadal crushed a hapless Monaco, with a blend of the blistering forehands and deft drop shots that have made him almost unbeatable on clay, his favorite surface, in recent years.Nadal said that returning to a clay court had given him “a chance to play a little more relaxed, with a little bit more confidence,” as well as make “zero tactical mistakes” against Monaco.Still, he said at a news conference after the match, “things should not be exaggerated,” adding with a wry smile that, according to many observers, “a week ago I was finished and now I don’t seem human.”Monaco echoed this view after the match, when asked to comment on Nadal’s performance.“Perhaps we were speculating a bit that he was lacking in rhythm and that the London Masters left him tired, but I know him so well,” Monaco said. “Deep down, I knew that in the big moments he grows, he’s a big player, and he gives his best.”Monaco did win the opening game of the match, with Nadal said he thought the match was complicated and went on the court feeling nervous. Monaco won the opening game, but that was arguably the last glimmer of hope for him. Nadal then won seven consecutive games that also included some outstanding defensive play whenever Monaco tried to outpace him from the baseline.Tito Vázquez, Argentina’s Davis Cup captain, opted for Monaco to face Nadal rather than the far more experienced David Nalbandian, reflecting concerns that Nalbandian’s recent health problems would not allow him to last through a possible five-set encounter on a slow clay court against Nadal. Nalbandian will play doubles with Eduardo Schwank against Feliciano López and Fernando Verdasco on Saturday, needing a victory to keep Argentina alive.Monaco arrived in Seville on the back of one of his best months of tennis, having reached the final in Valencia, Spain, in early November before losing in the quarterfinals to Federer at the Paris Open.Monaco appeared to have the legs, but not the kind of shot-making that could trouble Nadal once he takes charge on his cherished clay.“It was more about me getting it right than him failing,” said Nadal, who also took the time to console his old friend Monaco in the locker room after the game.Vazquez said that he thought Del Potro’s match was the best chance for Argentina to score a win on the first day, especially given the opportunities that Del Potro had in the fouth set, but “he lost to a guy who was physically very fit.”Spain is hoping to win its fifth Davis Cup this weekend — all since 2000, underlining its domination over men’s tennis over the past decade. Seville was the scene of its 2004 triumph against the United States, in a final that also confirmed that the precocious Nadal would take the helm of a new generation of formidable Spanish players.“I was young and I went through a fascinating experience here, which I will never forget, “ Nadal said during the news conference, when asked about his long and fruitful love affair with the Davis Cup and what the competition meant for him. “I really enjoyed then and seven years later I’m back.”Argentina, meanwhile, is in its fourth Davis Cup final and is probably the best tennis nation not to win the trophy to date. The Seville encounter has also been billed as a revenge opportunity after losing its only home final, against Spain in Mar del Plata in 2008.Despite the one-sided nature of Nadal’s victory Friday, the vociferous and colorful contingent of Argentinean fans did their utmost to respond to the Spanish chanting and confirm that the Davis Cup, when played in front of 27,000 flag-waving and screaming spectators, is as close as tennis gets to the atmosphere at a soccer match.By the time the match between Ferrer and Del Potro had moved into a second-set tie breaker, the crowd had reached fever pitch, forcing the umpire to call repeatedly for silence before allowing play to resume.'"
"'11-12-03,'0','Thus, he said, the United States and its allies remain wholly committed to the program.“Whether Russia likes it or not, we are about defending NATO-European territory against a growing ballistic missile threat,” Mr. Daalder said. “We will adapt the timing and the details to that threat, which is why the focus of our joint effort ought to be about how to figure out how to reduce that threat rather than trying to threaten and retaliate for a deployment that has nothing to do with Russia.”Last week, President Medvedev threatened that Russia would deploy its own missiles and that it could withdraw from the New Start nuclear arms reduction treaty if the United States proceeds with its plans for a missile-defense system in Europe.Returning to that theme this week, Mr. Medvedev dismissed the idea that he was kicking around a political football.“This statement is not of some tactical nature, not to mention some election nature,” Mr. Medvedev said Thursday at a meeting with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin and political supporters, according to the Interfax news agency.Steven Pifer, an arms control expert who has managed Russia policy from top positions at the State Department and National Security Council, said that some of the tougher language out of Moscow seemed intended less for Washington and more for Russian voters, who head to the polls for parliamentary elections on Sunday. And with presidential elections in both Russia and the United States next year, the volume could grow louder, even though the basic positions in the missile-defense debate have not changed.“We’ll probably see more rhetoric on both sides in 2012,” said Mr. Pifer, now of the Brookings Institution. “The Russian presidential transition and our election will make it a difficult year to do serious arms control.” Mr. Pifer said U.S. officials have made efforts to ease the Russians’ concerns, for instance, by inviting them to observe missile interceptor tests, but so far the Russians have refused. “There are some pretty decent offers on the table,” he said.Mr. Medvedev said Russia was open to further negotiations, but would be compelled to respond if the United States proceeded in deploying the missile-defense system.“Our response to the European missile shield will be gradual and its first step was already taken when a radar was activated in the Kaliningrad region,” he said. “More steps will follow if necessary.”He continued: “Time has not run out to negotiate an agreement. But we also must understand that if the situation develops the old way, we will have to respond. We have material and military prerequisites for that.”A spokesman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry told reporters on Thursday that the missile-defense issue would be a focus of a meeting between Russian and the NATO council’s foreign ministers on Thursday.Separately, senior officials in two former Soviet republics, made statements this week in support of Russia’s position. “We share the defense capability concerns and risks of Russia,” President Aleksandr G. Lukashenko of Belarus told Interfax. “Today we are under the protection of Russia’s nuclear umbrella and if the interests of this umbrella are damaged by any grouping, it means damage and danger for us.”Meanwhile, the speaker of Parliament in Kyrgyzstan said his government supported Russia’s response and its efforts to negotiate a resolution of the dispute.'"
"'11-12-03,'0','But the $950 we spent last time for a professional videographer? This time, a few obliging relatives filled that role free. And like last time, we hired a neighborhood teenager who is good at photography to take the pictures. They’re great and cost one-tenth what a professional would have charged.For our first bar mitzvah, I was so entranced to see my older son in a beautifully tailored suit that we bought one, I’m embarrassed to say, for several hundred dollars. He wore it twice before outgrowing it. At least his younger brother used it through much of his bar mitzvah season.This time, we found a three-piece suit for under $100 for the guest of honor. After all, it really only had to last the day.I also learned some life lessons this time around. At major events, we want our close friends and family to be there, but sometimes they can’t make it for any number of reasons. And that can put a real strain on relationships.“It feels like a rejection — it feels like being dumped ,” said Irene S. Levine, a professor of psychiatry at New York University School of Medicine. And “when it’s an event like a bar mitzvah, it’s not just about you but about your child.”In fact, said Dr. Levine, who wrote the book “Best Friends Forever: Surviving a Breakup With Your Best Friend” (Overlook Press, 2009), failing to show up at a major event is one of the most common reasons friendships break down.The best thing to do if you can’t make the special occasion is to tell the hosts sooner rather than later and be as straightforward as possible.“Sometimes people feel so awkward, they don’t give a clear message about why they can’t come,” she said. But when someone says he or she can’t come to an important event for what seems to be a minor reason, it “often means secrets are involved. It’s like a puzzle with a piece missing,” she said. “For example, someone might be having problems with a child and then has trouble celebrating a child’s success.”But, on the flip side, those of us who are throwing the big affairs sometimes fail to realize our events aren’t always the No. 1 priority for others.And, yes, everyone is different. Some people think nothing of hopping on a plane to fly across an ocean to attend an anniversary party, while others may not have the inclination to drive a few hours away, Dr. Levine said. It’s not necessarily a litmus test for who is the better friend.Aside from the emotional cost when people don’t show up, there can be a financial price if someone drops out at the last minute. Thinking of that, here’s a piece of practical advice: Make sure you can give the guest numbers to the caterer as late as possible. I was fortunate that we could do it the day before the party.What about those people who say they’ll come and just don’t show up? For one thing, you’re out the money for food. Cara Davis, who recently updated and self-published an eBook, “Cheap Ways to Tie the Knot,” said it was worth finding out in advance if there was any way to donate the food to a local shelter so it did not go to waste.Because so much food is generally left over at most big events, she added, think about offering take-out boxes at the end of the celebration.Of course, all that doesn’t satisfy a desire to find out why some friends may have failed to show up. If you don’t hear from them and want to make a point, feel free “to call and say, ‘I hope you’re not ill,’ ” said Judith Martin, the nationally syndicated columnist known as Miss Manners. “They’ll come up with something.”David Tutera, host of the television show “My Fair Wedding,” said that every time he had been the host or had organized an event for clients, “there’s always going to be someone who doesn’t show up.” He added, “You just hope they have the courtesy to explain.”He also gave this sage advice: Don’t do anything about the no-shows until the week after the event. If you get into some sort of discussion or argument an hour before, or during, your party, it may ruin your good time.“If someone calls or texts that night saying, ‘Sorry I can’t make it,’ don’t respond that night or over the weekend,” said Mr. Tutera, who also a plans parties for celebrities. “It’s not your responsibility. Call the Monday or Tuesday after and give them a chance to explain. Take the high road and leave it open for closure.”The trouble is, he said, there are so many ways now to hide behind texts and e-mails and assistants without ever being forced to explain honestly.For Ms. Martin, all these questions are emblematic of “the breakdown of the host/guest contract,” she said. “The guest should answer an invitation right away, and not assume that other people can be brought along. They should show up in appropriate dress for the occasion and socialize with others.”The hosts, on the other side, “should supply refreshments for people, rather than asking people to bring their own food or drinks, introduce people and round up the wallflowers.”A host should also not expect gifts. Nor, in Ms. Martin’s opinion, should a guest give money. “We shouldn’t pay people for passing milestones,” she said.The question of money invariably comes up at these kinds of events because for many of us, they’re expensive undertakings that can put a substantial dent in our banking account.For that reason, once we figured out what we would spend, I was taken aback to discover that some vendors expected sizable tips, which we had not expected. Our M.C. (part of a four-person entertainment package) sent us a note along with the invoice before the party with suggested gratuities.Those suggestions were high, far more than we would ever tip. I asked Mike Forkos of ESP Productions, our M.C. (who did a fabulous job), why he sent out such suggestions.“Ninety-five percent of people always ask,” he said. “And some people are embarrassed to ask the question. So we send out an average of what most people tipped.”But he agreed that in the future, maybe it would be best to wait to be asked.We’re done with major parties, as least for now. We could celebrate my older son’s high school graduation next year. But with college tuition being what it is, we will no doubt forgo an extravaganza. Anyone for a hot dog?'"
"'11-12-03,'0','BEIJING — A former Tibetan monk set fire to himself as an anti-China political protest in Tibet’s Chamdo township on Thursday but survived, according to reports on Friday by Tibet advocacy groups. It was the 12th self-immolation by a Tibetan this year and the first inside Tibet.The former monk, Tenzin Phuntsog, in his 40’s, was from the monastery of Karma, which was founded by the first Karmapa Lama in the 12th century, according to the International Campaign for Tibet, based in Washington.The monastery is within what China officially calls the Tibet Autonomous Region, a large area on the Tibetan plateau that was the central part of historical Tibet, the former Himalayan kingdom occupied by the Chinese in the 1950’s.The other self-immolations this year took place to the east, in the neighboring Chinese province of Sichuan, which encompasses parts of regions that Tibetans call Amdo and Kham. All the people were monks or nuns, or formerly of the clergy, and in each case the act appeared to be a protest against Chinese policies.Earlier this week Reuters reported that two monks from the restive Kirti monastery in Sichuan, home to eight of the other self-immolators, had been detained by Chinese security forces. That report has not been confirmed.China has denounced the self-immolations as acts of terrorism encouraged by Tibetan exile groups and the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of Tibet who fled his homeland after the Chinese occupation. Exile groups have called the self-immolations acts of desperate political protest by Tibetans distraught over China’s repression of their religion and culture.'"
"'11-12-03,'0','YANGON, Myanmar — The heroine of Myanmar’s democratic opposition, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, endorsed the new American engagement with the country’s autocratic government on Friday and called on other countries, including China, to support Myanmar’s nascent efforts to build a freer, more open society and economy.“If we go forward together, I am confident that there will be no turning back from the road towards democracy,” she said, appearing with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton on the porch of the lakeside house where she spent much of the last two decades under house arrest. “We are not on that road yet, but we hope to get there as soon as possible with the help and understanding of our friends.”The meeting Friday was the second in two days for Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and Mrs. Clinton — two iconic women in world affairs. The first, a private dinner the night before, was described as intimate by Mrs. Clinton’s aides. “It’s as if they’d known each other a long time,” one said.That they met at all, and appeared together before international and local journalists, was itself a measure of the changes that have swept Myanmar since the new president, U Thein Sein, took office in March, establishing a military-backed civilian government after years of military dictatorship. Those changes, including the freeing of some political prisoners and lifting the heavy censorship of the Internet, were enough to persuade President Obama to send Mrs. Clinton to explore ways to expand relations that have been badly strained for nearly a quarter century.In their remarks at the house, a two-story villa surrounded by a flower-filled garden but also a wall topped by barbed wire, both women emphasized that Mr. Thein Sein’s reforms were only a beginning.'"

"'11-12-04,'0','Numbers for individual companies were equally astonishing. For example, the Fed provided Bear Stearns with $30 billion to see it through its 2008 shotgun marriage with JPMorgan. This was in addition to the $29.5 billion in assets purchased by the Fed from Bear to assist in the buyout by JPMorgan. Citigroup, meanwhile, tapped the Fed for almost $100 billion in January 2009 — its peak during the crisis — and Morgan Stanley received $107 billion in Fed loans in September 2008.Some may see all this as ancient history or as ho-hum disclosures that confirm what everybody already knew — that our banks were on the precipice and that only hundreds of billions of dollars could save them. The Fed says that the money it lent in these programs was paid back without generating any losses.But the information is revealing nonetheless. The fact is, investors didn’t know how dire the situation was at these institutions. At the same time that these banks were privately thronging the teller windows at the Fed, some of their executives were publicly espousing their firms’ financial solidity.During the first three months of 2009, for example, when Citigroup’s Fed borrowing apparently peaked, Vikram Pandit, its chief executive, hailed the company’s performance. Calling that first quarter the best over all since 2007, Mr. Pandit said the results showed “the strength of Citi’s franchise.”Citi’s earnings release didn’t detail its large Fed borrowings; neither did its filing for the first quarter of 2009 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Other banks kept silent on these activities or mentioned them in passing with few specifics.These disclosure lapses are disturbing to Lynn E. Turner, a former chief accountant at the S.E.C. Since 1989, he said, commission rules have required public companies to disclose details about material federal assistance they receive. The rules grew out of the savings and loan crisis, during which hundreds of banks failed and others received government help.The rules are found in a section of the S.E.C.’s Codification of Financial Reporting Policies titled “Effects of Federal Financial Assistance Upon Operations.” They state that if any types of federal financial assistance have “materially affected or are reasonably likely to have a future material effect upon financial condition or results of operations, the management discussion and analysis should provide disclosure of the nature, amounts and effects of such assistance.”Given these rules, Mr. Turner said: “I would have expected some discussion in the management discussion and analysis of how this has had a positive impact on these banks’ operating results. The borrowings had to have an impact on their liquidity and earnings, but I don’t ever recall anybody saying ‘we borrowed a bunch of money from the Fed at zero percent interest.’ ”I asked officials at Citigroup and Morgan Stanley about these disclosures. Jon Diat, a spokesman for Citigroup, said the bank’s disclosures in its quarterly filings with the S.E.C. “were entirely appropriate.” He added that Citi and other financial services firms “utilized numerous government programs that provided significant funding capacity and liquidity support which helped increase the flow of credit into the economy.”Morgan Stanley pointed to its annual report for 2008, which mentioned the various Fed programs and the bank’s ability to tap them. The filing noted that the Fed was authorized to extend credit to Morgan Stanley’s broker-dealer units in both the United States and Britain but contained no dollar amounts used.Of course, there is stigma associated with a company tapping into federal assistance programs. This is the Fed’s main argument for keeping its operations under wraps. And companies want to avoid frightening investors by disclosing their reliance on this type of emergency cash, even if it is only temporary.But keeping this information from shareholders is no way to engender their trust. And a lack of investor confidence often translates to depressed valuations among companies’ shares. If investors doubt that a company is coming clean about its financial standing — the current worry is how exposed our banks are to European debt woes — its stock price will suffer. This is very likely one of the reasons that big bank stocks trade at such low price-to-earnings multiples today.It will be interesting to see whether the S.E.C. does anything to enforce its rules that companies disclose federal assistance in financial filings, either in the recent past or in the future. You could certainly argue that requiring such disclosures is even more important nowadays, given that so many banks are considered too big to fail and that the taxpayer will undoubtedly be asked once again to rescue them from their mistakes.“These banks and the Fed have never believed in transparency,” Mr. Turner said. “I actually think their thought process is sorely flawed. If the banks knew this stuff was going to be made public they’d behave differently. Instead of runs on the bank you’d have bankers doing things intelligently to avoid getting into trouble.”'"
"'11-12-04,'0','MOSCOW — “Khodorkovsky,” a German filmmaker’s documentary on the saga of the jailed former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who for some has become a symbol of opposition to Vladimir V. Putin, made its official premiere in Moscow on Friday, in a theater just blocks from the Kremlin and just two days before parliamentary elections that are expected to hurt Mr. Putin’s party.The screening was part of a long-scheduled documentary film festival. Obstacles that hindered the film’s wider release in Russia seemed to underscore the apparent jitters of the ruling elite and the growing cracks in Mr. Putin’s once infallible image: As the elections approached, movie theaters that had been planning to show the film began pulling out en masse, without citing reasons.At the ArtDocFest at the Khudozhestvenny movie theater near the Kremlin on Friday night, an audience of several hundred Russian intelligentsia laughed at documentary footage of Mr. Putin chastising Mr. Khodorkovsky during a meeting with Russian billionaires in the Kremlin in 2003.They applauded after Yevgeny Saburov, a former minister in President Boris Yeltin’s government, described Mr. Putin’s actions as the vendetta of a “petty man” who can’t stomach criticism.The film, by Cyril Tuschi, ends with the brief scene of Mr. Khodorkovsky behind glass in a courtroom cage. And in a letter quoted earlier in the film, Russia’s most famous prisoner says he has no time for self-pity or thoughts of revenge because he is too busy in prison analyzing his own actions and studying his legal case.'"

"'11-12-04,'0','Another former agency official, who asked not to be identified speaking publicly about delicate operations, said, “My rule was that if we are going to launder money, we better show results. Otherwise, the D.E.A. could wind up being the largest money launderer in the business, and that money results in violence and deaths.”Those are precisely the kinds of concerns members of Congress have raised about a gun-smuggling operation known as Fast and Furious, in which agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives allowed people suspected of being low-level smugglers to buy and transport guns across the border in the hope that they would lead to higher-level operatives working for Mexican cartels. After the agency lost track of hundreds of weapons, some later turned up in Mexico; two were found on the United States side of the border where an American Border Patrol agent had been shot to death.Former D.E.A. officials rejected comparisons between letting guns and money walk away. Money, they said, poses far less of a threat to public safety. And unlike guns, it can lead more directly to the top ranks of criminal organizations.“These are not the people whose faces are known on the street,” said Robert Mazur, a former D.E.A. agent and the author of a book about his years as an undercover agent inside the Medellín cartel in Colombia. “They are super-insulated. And the only way to get to them is to follow their money.”Another former drug agency official offered this explanation for the laundering operations: “Building up the evidence to connect the cash to drugs, and connect the first cash pickup to a cartel’s command and control, is a very time consuming process. These people aren’t running a drugstore in downtown L.A. that we can go and lock the doors and place a seizure sticker on the window. These are sophisticated, international operations that practice very tight security. And as far as the Mexican cartels go, they operate in a corrupt country, from cities that the cops can’t even go into.”The laundering operations that the United States conducts elsewhere — about 50 so-called Attorney General Exempt Operations are under way around the world — had been forbidden in Mexico after American customs agents conducted a cross-border sting without notifying Mexican authorities in 1998, which was how most American undercover work was conducted there up to that point.But that changed in recent years after President Felipe Calderón declared war against the country’s drug cartels and enlisted the United States to play a leading role in fighting them because of concerns that his security forces had little experience and long histories of corruption.Today, in operations supervised by the Justice Department and orchestrated to get around sovereignty restrictions, the United States is running numerous undercover laundering investigations against Mexico’s most powerful cartels. One D.E.A. official said it was not unusual for American agents to pick up two or three loads of Mexican drug money each week. A second official said that as Mexican cartels extended their operations from Latin America to Africa, Europe and the Middle East, the reach of the operations had grown as well. When asked how much money had been laundered as a part of the operations, the official would only say, “A lot.”“If you’re going to get into the business of laundering money,” the official added, “then you have to be able to launder money.”Former counternarcotics officials, who also would speak only on the condition of anonymity about clandestine operations, offered a clearer glimpse of their scale and how they worked. In some cases, the officials said, Mexican agents, posing as smugglers and accompanied by American authorities, pick up traffickers’ cash in Mexico. American agents transport the cash on government flights to the United States, where it is deposited into traffickers’ accounts, and then wired to companies that provide goods and services to the cartel.In other cases, D.E.A. agents, posing as launderers, pick up drug proceeds in the United States, deposit them in banks in this country and then wire them to the traffickers in Mexico.The former officials said that the drug agency tried to seize as much money as it laundered — partly in the fees the operatives charged traffickers for their services and another part in carefully choreographed arrests at pickup points identified by their undercover operatives.And the former officials said that federal law enforcement agencies had to seek Justice Department approval to launder amounts greater than $10 million in any single operation. But they said that the cap was treated more as a guideline than a rule, and that it had been waived on many occasions to attract the interest of high-value targets.“They tell you they’re bringing you $250,000, and they bring you a million,” one former agent said of the traffickers. “What’s the agent supposed to do then, tell them no, he can’t do it? They’ll kill him.”It is not clear whether such operations are worth the risks. So far there are few signs that following the money has disrupted the cartels’ operations, and little evidence that Mexican drug traffickers are feeling any serious financial pain. Last year, the D.E.A. seized about $1 billion in cash and drug assets, while Mexico seized an estimated $26 million in money laundering investigations, a tiny fraction of the estimated $18 billion to $39 billion in drug money that flows between the countries each year.Mexico has tightened restrictions on large cash purchases and on bank deposits in dollars in the past five years. But a proposed overhaul of the Mexican attorney general’s office has stalled, its architects said, as have proposed laws that would crack down on money laundered through big corporations and retail chains.“Mexico still thinks the best way to seize dirty money is to arrest a trafficker, then turn him upside down to see how much change falls out of his pockets,” said Sergio Ferragut, a professor at the Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico and the author of a book on money laundering, which he said was “still a sensitive subject for Mexican authorities.”Mr. Calderón boasts that his government’s efforts — deploying the military across the country — have fractured many of the country’s powerful cartels and led to the arrests of about two dozen high-level and midlevel traffickers.But there has been no significant dip in the volume of drugs moving across the country. Reports of human rights violations by police officers and soldiers have soared. And drug-related violence has left more than 40,000 people dead since Mr. Calderón took office in December 2006.The death toll is greater than in any period since Mexico’s revolution a century ago, and the policy of close cooperation with Washington may not survive.“We need to concentrate all our efforts on combating violence and crime that affects people, instead of concentrating on the drug issue,” said a former foreign minister, Jorge G. Castañeda, at a conference hosted last month by the Cato Institute in Washington. “It makes absolutely no sense for us to put up 50,000 body bags to stop drugs from entering the United States.”'"
"'11-12-04,'0','WASHINGTON — As the long slog toward the presidential nomination continues, at least 10 Texas Republicans in Congress have yet to pick a candidate.Some quickly endorsed Gov. Rick Perry when he jumped into the race in August. Two decided, before that, to back Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker. Representative Lamar Smith of San Antonio made a high-profile endorsement of Mitt Romney in October. And Representative Ron Paul is a candidate himself.That leaves at least eight Republicans in the House, plus Senators John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both Republicans, in the undecided column. The indecision, experts say, could reflect lawmakers’ allegiance to fellow Texans, or they may just be waiting for the perfect moment to strike a deal in exchange for their support.Ms. Hutchison, who challenged Mr. Perry for governor in 2010, told The Texas Tribune last week that she was leaning toward not endorsing anyone. She has said she will support whoever becomes the Republican nominee.Mr. Cornyn has said he will not make a primary endorsement because he does not want to be distracted from his work leading the National Republican Senatorial Committee.A few of the undecided members have hinted at who they support with their donations. Representative Louie Gohmert of Tyler has given $2,500 to Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota. Mr. Perry has received $5,000 from Representative Bill Flores of Bryan and his wife and $2,000 from Representative Kay Granger of Fort Worth.'"
"'11-12-04,'0','Texas grew so much over the last decade that it qualified for four new House seats. Almost all of that growth — more than four million people — came from new Hispanic residents, but when the Republicans who control the State Legislature drew the new districts last summer, they reduced the number of districts where minorities could elect the candidate of their choice to 10 from 11.Hispanics tend to vote Democratic, and under the Texas redistricting plan, the number of safe Republican seats would have risen to 26 from 21. This egregious violation of the Voting Rights Act prompted Hispanic groups to sue, and last month a federal court panel threw out the Legislature’s plan, which was also backed by Gov. Rick Perry. The court has drawn up a plan with three new districts in which minorities would be the majority, potentially giving the Democrats a gain of as many as four seats. Republicans immediately cried foul, demanding an end to judicial meddling.The court’s map “completely disregards the careful work of the members of the Senate,” said Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican. “A court’s job is to apply the law, not to make policy,” said Attorney General Greg Abbott, who has appealed the decision to the United States Supreme Court. But applying the law — that is, redrawing the flawed map — is exactly what the court is required to do when a state violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which explicitly prohibits practices that dilute the ability of minority groups to elect the representative of their choice. Because of its history of discriminatory practices, Texas is required to get clearance from the Justice Department before making electoral changes — permission that both the department and now the federal court denied.Of course, when the Democrats in Texas held power they also drew the district lines to their advantage. Such abuses permeate the majority of states that give legislatures the job of drawing Congressional lines every 10 years. California and at least five other states have a better idea: let nonpartisan commissions draw the districts, following both law and common sense but ignoring politics. If Texas really wants to keep the courts out of the process, it should follow a similar path.'"
"'11-12-04,'0','As the election campaign progresses voters can expect to hear a lot of hype — and if we are very lucky some good ideas — about how best to “reform” . It will take stamina and well-honed skepticism to sort it all out.Republican politicians are touting the virtues of market competition and calling for a “premium support” plan that would give beneficiaries a set amount of money to shop among private plans for their own . What they do not say is that private plans have long been more costly than traditional Medicare and have shown far less ability to slow spending. Nor do they admit that the most extreme versions of premium support — like the one championed by Representative — would save the government money mainly by shifting costs to the beneficiaries, who would have to decide whether to forgo treatments or pay more for coverage.Most Democrats have been fiercely opposed to privatizing Medicare. They believe the traditional system can be reformed to reduce costs without demolishing the whole structure. But with concerns about the rising deficit and the long-term sustainability of Medicare, some centrist Democrats are backing the premium support idea.As Americans try to figure out who is right or wrong in this debate, here are some matters to consider:HAS IT BEEN TESTED? The Massachusetts health care reforms already provide premium support to help low- and middle-income people buy private policies on an exchange. Unlike the Ryan plan, the program guarantees everyone a defined, comprehensive set of benefits, and officials bargain aggressively with private plans to keep their premiums down. As a result, annual cost increases have been held well below the premium increases for other private group insurance providing comparable benefits.The Medicare prescription drug program provides support to help beneficiaries buy coverage from private insurers. The costs have been far less than initially projected, a fact that promoters of premium support trumpet. Market competition has helped, but costs have mainly been held down because many major drugs have gone off patent and have been replaced by cheaper generics.'"

"'11-12-04,'0','Sheriff Lacy Rogers of San Jacinto County suspected the Winfreys almost immediately. A young neighbor said he had seen Ms. Winfrey and her brother at Mr. Burr’s house from time to time. They lived nearby, and their father had a decades-long criminal history that included assault and involuntary manslaughter. At the time of the murder, he had been out of prison on parole for nine days.There was no eyewitness and no physical evidence linking the Winfreys to the crime scene. Investigators tested dozens of DNA samples, but they all excluded the Winfreys.Sheriff Rogers called on Deputy Keith A. Pikett, a self-trained canine handler from the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Department whose bloodhounds had a reputation for helping police link suspects to unsolved crimes.Less than a month after the murder, Deputy Pikett brought his dogs to Coldspring. They sniffed the clothes Mr. Burr wore when he was murdered. Then they smelled samples from Ms. Winfrey, her brother and other potential suspects. The dogs “alerted” to the smells of Ms. Winfrey and her brother, indicating their scent profiles matched what was on Mr. Burr’s clothes.Without other evidence, though, the case against the siblings was not strong enough, and the investigation came to a standstill.Two years later, when Mr. Winfrey Sr. was back in jail on unrelated charges, his cellmate told authorities that Mr. Winfrey had talked about guns being taken from Mr. Burr’s house. Only the perpetrator would have known about the guns, Sheriff Rogers said.“It wasn’t like I just picked them out of the clear blue sky,” the former sheriff said recently, referring to the Winfreys.Sheriff Rogers secured capital murder arrest warrants for all three of the Winfreys and brought back Deputy Pikett and his bloodhounds to do another scent lineup. This time the dogs — James Bond, Quincy and Clue — “alerted” on the father’s scent too.The father was the first to face trial in 2007, with a state-appointed lawyer. Deputy Pikett told the jury that his bloodhounds were nearly perfect performers. Quincy, he said, had returned only two wrong responses in 1,483 scent lineups. The jury found Mr. Winfrey guilty, and he was sentenced to 75 years in prison.Ms. Winfrey’s trial was next, and she was also represented by a state-appointed lawyer. On the stand, she admitted she knew Mr. Burr from school but insisted she had nothing to do with the murder. She was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.When Mr. Winfrey Jr. finally went to trial, after two and a half years in jail, the family had scraped together enough money to hire a private lawyer. And the case against the Winfreys began to come apart.Mr. Winfrey Jr.’s lawyers attacked the scent lineup evidence, telling the jury that Mr. Pikett’s testimony and his dog’s sniffing skills were a sham. They presented experts who discredited the deputy sheriff’s methods and said he had rigged dog scent lineups. The jury took just 13 minutes to acquit Mr. Winfrey Jr.At the same time, Deputy Pikett’s methods were coming under scrutiny in other cases. In 2006, when Deputy Pikett worked on a murder case in which his dogs implicated a retired police captain, defense experts lambasted his work. Steven Nicely, a professional dog trainer and police dog consultant, submitted an affidavit describing him as “an unprofessional charlatan.”The City of Houston was sued by two men who were wrongfully charged in a 2007 triple murder when Deputy Pikett’s dogs identified them. And Calvin Miller sued Deputy Pikett after the dogs identified him in a 2009 rape and robbery in West Texas. DNA evidence later exonerated Mr. Miller.Deputy Pikett declined to comment for this article, citing continuing litigation.Mr. Winfrey Sr. appealed his conviction in 2009, arguing that the evidence was insufficient. In a landmark ruling, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals agreed.“We conclude that scent-discrimination lineups, when used alone or as primary evidence, are legally insufficient to support a conviction,” Justice Barbara Hervey wrote in the court’s opinion granting the acquittal. Mr. Winfrey Sr. left prison in October 2010.With the acquittals of her brother and her father and the court’s ruling on dog-scent evidence, Ms. Winfrey’s lawyers argue that she should also be acquitted, and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has agreed to review her case. Ms. Winfrey’s lawyers would not make her available to comment for this article.District Attorney Richard Countiss of San Jacinto County filed a perfunctory brief opposing Ms. Winfrey’s appeal. In an interview with The Texas Tribune, he said he is not convinced that Ms. Winfrey’s brother and father were not involved in Mr. Burr’s murder.“The conclusion of their cases is not that they are innocent,” said Mr. Countiss, who was not the district attorney when the Winfreys were prosecuted. “It is that they were not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”And there was more circumstantial evidence against Ms. Winfrey than against her father and her brother, he said.Prosecutors also allege that she attempted to thwart DNA testing by shaving her pubic hair and that teachers at her school overheard her make threatening remarks about Mr. Burr and his money.“What I’ve seen so far is enough to support the jury’s decision,” Mr. Countiss said.Briefs have yet to be filed in Ms. Winfrey’s case, which may not be resolved for months.In the meantime, Ms. Winfrey’s father and her brother have said they will not truly feel free until she is.They are now living in North Dakota, working in the state’s booming natural gas industry and saving money to pay for Ms. Winfrey’s lawyers.“It ain’t nothing till we get her home,” Mr. Winfrey Sr. said. “I mean, there’s no rejoicing in anything.”'"
"'11-12-04,'0','Yet, chances are, few teams will heed that lesson at this year’s winter meetings, which start Monday in Dallas. Bidding will intensify for Albert Pujols, Prince Fielder, Jose Reyes and C. J. Wilson, the stars of the current free-agent class, who represent instant fixes and ready-made ad campaigns aimed at grateful fans.“When you look at free agency, the benefit is you’re getting immediate, major league impact,” said the agent Scott Boras, who represents Fielder. “But the competition for that immediate impact is 30 teams.”Often, all it takes is the threat of another bidder to make a team pay much more than it wanted to win a player. As much as they try to avoid it, teams pay for past performance and hope for future results.“It’s a killer,” Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said. “It’s like triple damages. Whatever you go out and pull off the market, if it’s high quality, it’s going to cost you a ton of money. You have to be right, the player has to be healthy, and he has to continue to be productive.”Alex Anthopoulos, the general manager of the Toronto Blue Jays, said he tried to avoid free agency because he valued a flexible roster. Free agency, by definition, runs counter to that.“Most times when you sign a player, you’re the only team in the game that was willing to pay him that money,” Anthopoulos said. “There’s a rare occasion someone slips, but for the most part, you could almost argue he’s an untradeable player because no one else was willing to pay him; otherwise, they would have had him. So the minute the ink is dry, if you wanted to turn around and trade him, you potentially don’t have a market.”In 2005, Toronto signed pitchers A. J. Burnett and B. J. Ryan to lucrative five-year contracts. Both were major disappointments, with only three healthy, strong seasons between them. Good intentions could not help the Blue Jays win the ritzy American League East.Speaking generally, Anthopoulos said he would rather use free agency to sustain a team that had already won. He pointed to the Texas Rangers, who built a winner in 2010 without expensive free agents, then added Adrian Beltre to help win again.“I don’t remember them giving four-, five- or six-year deals until they were in the World Series, and then they went out and signed a big free agent,” Anthopoulos said. “They used it as a final piece, rather than trying to push themselves to be a very good team, if that makes sense. That’s my opinion; it doesn’t mean it’s right. But it makes a whole lot of sense to me, and some of the very good organizations have done that.”Every team enters the market with different motivations. Cashman’s 2008 spree — $423.5 million for Burnett, C. C. Sabathia and Mark Teixeira — came after the Yankees had missed the playoffs. Last winter, Jayson Werth got a staggering seven-year, $126 million deal from the Washington Nationals’ owner, Ted Lerner, then 85 and eager to finally contend.The 2006 season was the Milwaukee Brewers’ 14th in a row without a winning record. Free agents would not even return the Brewers’ phone calls, and the team wanted to make a statement by signing starter Jeff Suppan, who had just pitched the rival St. Louis Cardinals to the World Series.Suppan signed a four-year, $42 million contract with the Brewers, and went 29-36 with a 5.08 earned run average. The Brewers released him in the final year of the deal, and he returned to the Cardinals before retiring.Even so, the Brewers have remained active in the market. Another veteran free agent, Randy Wolf, has pitched well, and the Brewers have shown interest in Aramis Ramirez, Jose Reyes and Jimmy Rollins this off-season.But several of their core players came through the farm system and have signed long-term deals, which could be a safer bet.“When a guy has played for you, you know him intimately,” Mark Attanasio, the Brewers’ owner, said. “You really know his medical history, and you know what kind of person he is. So on balance, it’s a lower-risk proposition to keep your own guys.”The Brewers tried to keep Fielder, but he chose free agency instead. They still hope to sign him, but so do many other teams.The winning bidder will surely feel euphoric. The question is, for how long?'"
"'11-12-04,'0','The last time the Lions came to the Superdome, it was opening day of the Saints’ Super Bowl season. Brees tied a franchise record with six touchdown passes in what turned out to be the first of 13 consecutive victories to open the greatest season in franchise history.Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was a rookie making his first start. He was intercepted three times. Schwartz was a rookie coach in his first game as well. The Lions had been terrible for years and Schwartz had a long rebuilding process still ahead.Now in his third season, Schwartz has Detroit just a few big December wins from its first playoff berth since 1999.“What’s exciting about it is, you get to this stage of the season and these games are important,” Saints Coach Sean Payton said. “The worst part of our industry is getting to this month of December and being on teams where the games aren’t going to matter in regards to playoff ramifications.”He added: “They’ve worked very hard at putting a plan in place. So it’s really then that you begin to appreciate these opportunities that come later in the year as the season winds down.”If only Detroit had all its top players available. Defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh, the 2010 defensive rookie of the year, has been suspended two games for stamping on the arm of Packers guard Evan Dietrich-Smith. That could weaken the Lions’ pass rush, which will be critical against a Saints offense that leads the N.F.L. in passing with 324.2 yards a game and has not allowed a sack in three games. Still, the Saints say they expect Detroit’s defensive line to remain formidable with the rookie Nick Fairley stepping in.“They’re a deep defense,” Saints right tackle Zach Strief said. “They’re aggressive, they’re fast, they’re good athletes and I think they’ve kind of posed problems for everybody.”The Saints also are concerned about Detroit’s offense, particularly the chemistry Stafford has developed with receiver Calvin Johnson. Johnson is clearly Stafford’s top target, but there is little any defense has been able to do about it. Johnson leads the league in touchdown catches with 12 and is third in yards receiving with 1,023.“He’s the best receiver in football, and I say that in a very honest and unbiased way,” Payton said. “There’s certainly a confidence level that Matthew has in throwing the football to him and the team has in him.”Stafford, meanwhile, is having his best season after being hurt for much of 2010. He has thrown for more than 3,100 yards and has developed a commanding presence at the line of scrimmage. He said the Lions were not happy with their recent struggles or Suh’s suspension, but had a positive outlook.“It’s time for us to put the pedal to the metal and start playing our best football at this time of the year; that’s what great teams do,” Stafford said. “If you want to make the playoffs, you have to do it on Sundays.”Brees, meanwhile, would be the last person to expect the Lions to be reeling after their loss to Green Bay. For Brees, the best players and the best teams know how to pull themselves back up after a tough stretch and play their best as the stakes rise.“We’re all fighting for a playoff spot,” Brees said. “You want to be playing your best football going into December and January and secure a playoff spot and then anything can happen. They have the same aspirations we do.”'"
"'11-12-04,'0','Another Coldwell Banker agent, Elaine Pruzon of the Short Hills office, came in ahead of her, recording $94 million in closed sales in 2010 and ranking 32nd. Arlene Gonnella of Weichert Realtors in Short Hills came in just behind Ms. Kolsky-Assatly, selling $68 million worth of homes and ranking 61st.These agents are working in tony territory, where the houses and penthouses have high price tags. ButMs. Kolsky-Assatly asserts that she consistently markets houses across a range of price points. “I’d sell a doghouse, if I could fit through the door,” she said jokingly. She was recently hired to sell one of the most expensive houses in New Jersey: the $28 million Henry Clay Frick mansion in Alpine, which has been on the market for more than three years. The home, set on 14 acres (accommodating 14 horses), is ensconced in Forbes magazine’s “Most Expensive ZIP Code” for 2011.At the lower end, she has a two-bedroom Teaneck condominium, listed for $479,000.“Whatever the price point,” she said, “I would say my strength is, well, do you know what a gift of gab means? I’m not bashful. I tell the truth. I say to people right off: I’ve done the research, here it is, and this is the best you are going to get. If they ask me when the market is going to turn around, I say, how the heck do I know?”Also, she cited an old-school commitment to print advertising. “I am willing to spend money to make money. My clients are still looking at those newspaper ads in the mornings over a cup of coffee. I know it, and those ads tend to grab them in a way that online advertising doesn’t necessarily.”Other documented top-sellers say they see their success as essentially flowing from true grit in a marketplace fraught with stress and frustration.“Every agent in every town in New Jersey will tell you they have to work twice or three times as hard as they used to in order to complete any transaction,” said Gordon Crawford, who leads a six-person team at Re/Max Properties Unlimited in Morristown that sold $81.6 million in 2010 and was ranked 60th among teams.This year, his team will close about 120 sales, versus 108 in 2010, for a significantly reduced dollar volume of about $56 million, Mr. Crawford said.He described an instance of working with sellers in Sparta who insisted on listing their house for $639,000, although Mr. Crawford pointed out that with about 275 houses on the market in Sparta, $550,000 was the appropriate figure. “Seven months later,” he said, “it is listed for $500,000, so offers could start coming in around $490,000.”In Margate, a barrier island community near Atlantic City, the top sales producer, Paula Hartman, runs a team at Prudential Fox & Roach Realtors that did $52 million in business last year, and she expects to do about the same this year. “But we sold 100 houses last year, and this year it will be about 150,” she said, “each one requiring maximum energy.”With today’s tightened mortgage-lending standards and wary property assessors, Ms. Hartman said, brokers have to “sell every house twice — once to the buyer, and once to the bank.”“In this climate, you really have to love your job,” said Ms. Hartman, whose handle on Zillow is RedHeadedRealtor. “I started out as a dental hygienist, and every day I think about how grateful I am not to be cleaning teeth.”Ms. Hartman, like Ms. Kolsky-Assatly, has bolstered her daily work life with family: Both women now have sons who work alongside them; also, Ms. Hartman’s husband is her computer systems handler, and her daughter does office support work.“I think that is a huge part of success,” said Ken Baris, the president of Jordan Baris Realtors in West Orange, founded 60 years ago by his father, who still works with him. “The knowledge you gain by osmosis, and the level of trust between the partners is incomparable.”His agency does not publicly report its sales volume. But Mr. Baris says he employs computer analytics — his own and others’ — to rank agents on their “sales and negotiating ability.”“Sometimes,” he said, “an agent will be a really prolific lister, and have their name on all the signs, and everybody thinks they are really popular, but then have a shockingly low percentage of listings taken to sold.”Also, Mr. Baris said, he analyzes what percentage of an agent’s listed properties are relisted with the agent when the contract expires without a sale. And he assesses agents by the proximity of sales price to list price in each transaction — whether they are representing a buyer or a seller. “It’s not always perfectly clear what they are doing right,” he said. “Whatever it is, we want to go with it.”'"
"'11-12-04,'0','Loans backed by the F.H.A. cannot be used to buy a co-op, according to the administration’s Web site. Condominiums need to obtain certification to be eligible, and in New York many have done that to broaden the pool of eligible buyers.Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, which lobbied to have the loan limits raised, said it was good news for potential buyers across the city.“We are thrilled that it is a two-year extension,” he said, describing the move as a recognition that the housing market still needed help. Had Congress not raised the limits, he said, “it would have been a disaster.”If the lower limits had remained in place, private lenders would have needed to greatly increase the number of jumbo loans they backed, to make up for those no longer secured by federal agencies.It remains to be seen if buyers will turn to the F.H.A. or whether private lenders will step back into the market, but the move ensures that the role of the F.H.A. is likely to grow in coming years.Mark A. Willis, a research fellow at the Furman Center who helped analyze the data, said he was concerned that the private sector was not ready to increase lending so substantially, and that this reluctance would have made financing even harder to get. “Given the fragility of the housing market in general,” he said, “we worried that this might not be the best time to start pulling back government involvement.”Beyond the specific question of loan limits, the question at the heart of the debate concerns the role the federal government should play in the mortgage market. About 90 percent of loans issued in the country are backed by the federal government.While the growth of Fannie and Freddie has been well documented, the F.H.A., which traditionally helped first-time buyers or those with low to moderate income, has also greatly expanded its purview in recent years. There is broad agreement in Washington that the federal government should eventually have a smaller footprint in the mortgage market, but the question is how fast it can pull back without hurting the housing market.The loan limits were increased in 2008 in direct response to the collapse of the housing market and the credit crisis. The Obama administration, in a position paper on the housing market released this fall, argued that lower loan limits would mean that “larger loans for more expensive homes will once again be funded only through the private market.”But many in the real estate industry feared that with the private market not ready to fill the void, loans would be harder to get and home prices further depressed. They lobbied vigorously to reverse the lower loan limits.The National Association of Realtors, which opposed lowering the limits, spent $17.6 million lobbying Congress last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.'"
"'11-12-04,'0','Q: Why is it such a bad thing for a country to abandon the euro?If a country did pull off a surprise euro exit — and get out before everybody could take their money out of the — there would still be a period of economic chaos. Exports and imports would shut down. Lending would collapse, which would send companies into bankruptcy. Ripple effects would be felt throughout Europe.The problem is thorny enough that the British chief executive of Next, a European retailer, recently offered a £250,000 prize for the person who comes up with the best plan for countries to leave the euro without destroying the European economy. (Have a brilliant idea? Entries are due early next year.)Q: Wait a minute: If leaving the eurozone would be so awful, why would anyone do it?It’s not all bad. Leaving the euro would allow a country to ignore demands from the leaders of other European countries. It could simply refuse to pay its debt.After the short-run pain, weaker European countries could also see a long-term benefit. If Greece or Portugal went back to the drachma or the escudo, the cost of their exports would fall. Because it would be cheaper for foreign travelers to stay in their hotels and eat in their restaurants, their tourism industries would get a bump, too. The alternative is to spend the next decade as poor countries tied to a rich one’s currency.Q: Why exactly does Angela Merkel always look so woebegone?For the euro to survive in the long run, Germany — the zone’s biggest economy — will most likely need to vouch for the debt of struggling eurozone members. And it will become more expensive to borrow money if bond investors fear the country is becoming overextended.The Germans are also wary of the widespread calls for the to buoy Spain and Italy by buying their . If they know the E.C.B. will bail them out, what will be their incentive to act responsibly in the future? Worse, Germans argue, printing money to pay off government debt (which is what the E.C.B. would essentially be doing) is the first step to hyperinflation.Q: What happens to the European Union if the euro crumbles?It turns out that a bunch of vastly different countries, each with control over its own budget but all bound to a common currency, is not a sustainable economic model. And that leaves Europe with two main, and painful, options.Option 1: Keep the euro, and make the eurozone even more integrated. While this doesn’t necessarily require a full-blown United States of Europe, individual countries would probably have to give bureaucrats in or power over how much money they can spend. The E.C.B. might promise to do whatever is necessary to stop a panic, but poorer eurozone countries would very likely endure years of difficult economic adjustments, including falling wages.Option 2: Greece and perhaps a few other struggling countries on the periphery leave the euro. A Greek exit alone might give the European dream a hard kick in the teeth, but it wouldn’t necessarily be fatal. It might, in fact, even prod European leaders to act more boldly to defend the rest of the eurozone. But the departure of Italy — the zone’s third-largest economy — would be a different story. Italy is what wonks call a systemically important country, which means that it is so big, and so intertwined with the rest of Europe, that it would take the whole eurozone down with it. Think massive disruptions to European trade, chaos in the financial system and a dose of political and social unrest.Q: What does this mean for the U.S.?Fortunately, exports to eurozone countries amount to only about 3 percent of America’s overall economy. The bigger worry, though, is the financial system. U.S. banks say their exposure to Europe is manageable, but when you ask smart people what a financial disaster in Europe would mean for the U.S., their answer usually goes, “Blah, blah, blah, Lehman.” To put a finer point on it: when went bankrupt in the fall of 2008, it initiated a global financial panic greater than almost anyone predicted, largely because of uncertainty. Nobody knew who owed what to whom. The global financial system froze, with disastrous consequences.European banks currently hold an extraordinary amount of European debt. And while U.S. banks have been reporting more details about their exposure to European banks, there still is a tremendous sense of uncertainty about who is on the hook, and for what, exactly. If Europe’s biggest banks go down, it could very well cause another Lehman-like crisis in the U.S. The good news: It’s still an “if.”'"

"'11-12-05,'1','She’s gone from Occupy Wall Street to occupying a job on Wall Street.Down-on-her-luck protester Tracy Postert spent 15 days washing sidewalks and making sandwiches at Zuccotti Park — then landed a dream job at a Financial District investment firm thanks to a high-powered passer-by who offered her work.“I never thought I would be doing this,’’ Postert admitted to The Post.The Upper West Sider, who has a Ph.D. in biomedical science specializing in pharmacology, was unemployed and had all but given up on finding work in her preferred field of academia when she joined the movement in October.She held signs that read, “Reagan sucks,” and, “I’ll vote after the revolution.”But she said she still needed to get a real job. So she made a new sign.On the front, she wrote, “Ph.D. Biomedical Scientist seeking full time employment,” and on the back, “Ask me for my resume.”It caught the eye of Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst for John Thomas Financial Brokerage. The exec wasn’t looking to hire, but he took Postert’s résumé anyway.That was Oct. 22, Postert’s Day 10 as an Occupier.The next day, Kaufman, impressed by her CV, sent her an e-mail asking if she’d like to come for an interview.It wasn’t far — only two blocks from Zuccotti Park at 14 Wall St.“I had been unemployed for so long, I thought why not?” said Postert, adding that she is in her 30s and has no background in finance or business.Her last paying job was as a lab assistant at Touro College making $2,500 for the one semester she worked there, she said.Kaufman offered her a job as a junior analyst evaluating medical companies as potential investments.Postert said the decision to accept was painful.The starting salary as a junior analyst is near minimum wage, but in time, she can earn a cool six figures, assured Kaufman.Postert has now just completed her third week as a Wall Street geek.She’s already studying for her exams to be a certified financial analyst.“I want to get a perfect score,” she said.Life has definitely changed for the former Occupier.She’s in the office by 8 a.m., and she still has to get used to Kaufman’s rallying cry of “Go! Go! Go!” blaring over the speakers in the morning.CEO Thomas Belesis said he believes Postert will be a great asset.“She was ranting about Wall Street, and now she’s working on Wall Street.

But the forecasters say they are not overly fearful that marketers will suddenly and sharply cut their ad budgets, pointing to coming events like the 2012 Summer Olympics and the United States state and federal elections as significant potential stimulants. They also predict growth in ad spending in Japan as that country continues recovering from the effects of the earthquake and tsunami last spring.GroupM, part of WPP, is predicting an increase of 6.4 percent in worldwide ad spending next year from 2011; its most recent forecast, in July, predicted a gain of 6.8 percent. In the United States, GroupM said, ad spending in 2012 will rise 4 percent from 2011; the July forecast predicted an increase of 4.2 percent.ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe, is predicting an increase in worldwide ad spending in 2012 of 4.7 percent; its most recent forecast, in October, was for a gain of 5.3 percent. In the United States, according to ZenithOptimedia, ad spending next year will increase 3.5 percent from 2011; that is unchanged from the October forecast.¶Publicis Groupe, Paris, acquired Gomye, a digital agency with three offices in China, and Ciszewski, which was described as Poland’s largest independent public relations agency.

"'11-12-05,'1','DALLAS — As baseball executives began to assemble Sunday at the Hilton Anatole for the annual winter meetings, the man with the biggest checkbook in the sport and with a long history of bold off-season transactions was not among the early arrivals.That man, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman, after rappelling a skyscraper dressed in an elf suit in Stamford, Conn., was not scheduled to arrive until Monday. In fact, he was not even booked on an early flight.After all, what’s the rush? The Yankees already locked up the best starting pitcher who will sign a contract this winter when they got C. C.

And for now, there is no expectation that a pitcher better than him will become available on the trade market.Since agreeing to terms with Sabathia on Halloween, the Yankees have set their sights a rung lower, on adding a No. 2 starter. As it is, they have five starters after agreeing to terms with Freddy Garcia, and they are not impressed with the current stock on the market.Heading into the meetings, the free agents’ asking prices appear too high for their corresponding talent, and the price in prospects that teams are seeking in trades also seems too high.'"
"'11-12-05,'1','That particular drone is among the most sensitive in the American fleet, and if the report is true it would mean Iran had gained at least partial access to closely guarded American technology. A stealth version of the drone was flown for hours, on repeated occasions, over Osama bin Laden’s hide-out in Abbottabad, Pakistan, earlier this year, without being detected by Pakistani air defenses, American officials said. There have been reports for months, all unconfirmed, that the same drone was being used regularly over Iran, presumably to hunt for hidden nuclear or missile sites.In a statement on Sunday, the American-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan said that the drone “to which the Iranians are referring may be a U.S. unarmed reconnaissance aircraft that had been flying a mission over western Afghanistan late last week.” It added that operators of the remotely controlled drone aircraft lost control of it “and had been working to determine its status.” The statement did not say what kind of drone was lost, or what might have caused the loss.The statement would seem to suggest that the craft wrongly flew across the border into Iran. If a drone was used for intelligence gathering in Iran, it presumably would not belong to the military — since there are no open hostilities with Iran — but rather to the C.I.A. or another intelligence agency, acting under a presidential finding about the Iranian nuclear program.One of the many theories swirling around the explosion at the missile base is that it could have been hit by a weapon, including one fired from a drone, setting off the huge explosion that followed. But since no outsiders can approach the base or gather evidence, it is unclear whether it will ever be known publicly what triggered the explosion.Even if the cause was an accident — and the United States has suffered some with its own solid-fuel motors — several officials said that it was a major setback for Iran’s effort to focus much of its industrial prowess on that kind of missile.Missiles powered by solid fuels rather than liquids have no need for trucks to fill them with volatile fluids, and can be fired on short notice, making them hard for other nations to destroy before they are launched. That would add to Iran’s ability to protect its nuclear sites from an Israeli strike — a subject of renewed debate in Israel in recent weeks — because Iran could threaten to retaliate before many of its missiles were struck. Solid-fuel missiles are also easier to hide. For those reasons, modern militaries rely on solid fuels for their deadliest missiles.Moreover, at a time Iran is being squeezed by sanctions, the country has succeeded in making the solid-fuel engines with indigenous technology. For liquid-fueled engines, many key components come from abroad.In a recent report, the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London called Iran’s shift to solid-fuel engines “a turning point” with “profound strategic implications” because the technology also brings Tehran closer to its goal of making long-range missiles. In its report three weeks ago, the International Atomic Energy Agency laid out, for the first time in public, detailed evidence it says suggests that Iran worked at some point in the past decade on designing a nuclear warhead that would fit atop its missile fleet.Partly for that reason, Western officials said, many of the sanctions imposed on Iran by the United Nations Security Council seek to block its import of rocket parts.Last week, the Institute for Science and International Security, a private group in Washington, released a commercial satellite image of the destroyed base.It called Iran’s labors there integral to “a major milestone in the development of a new missile.”Government and private analysts described the blast at the military base, which occurred Nov. 12 and killed Gen. Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, the head of Iran’s missile program, as a major setback — not just because of the extensive damage to the site but also because of the loss of expertise from the specialists working there.General Moghaddam’s funeral was attended by Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. “That was a statement of how central Moghaddam’s work was,” one American intelligence official said.The sprawling complex where the blast took place has expanded dramatically in the last few years. Michael Elleman, a main author of the International Institute’s 148-page report on Iranian missiles, examined the public images of the destroyed base and said in an interview that the damage and other evidence was consistent with solid-fuel technology.Mr. Elleman added that the desert area around the base bristled with military compounds and networks of buildings and bunkers — all plainly visible in Google Earth images. Security cordons ringed the bases.He noted that the region south of the destroyed base, roughly one and five miles distant, held two separate complexes that carried the distinctive signature of a firing range for solid fuels.The closer of the two sites has eight test stands in a row, and the desert next to them had been clearly scorched by fiery plumes. In such tests, missile engines are mounted horizontally and shoot their blasts straight out.The more distant complex has three test stands in a row, the middle one bearing bold scorch marks from a recent firing.'"
"'11-12-05,'1','They swooned over the Egyptian cobra, gone rogue inside the Bronx Zoo’s Reptile House last March. They cheered the peacock from the Central Park Zoo, who crossed Fifth Avenue to spend an August day on the ledge of an Upper East Side apartment building, only to return, on his own, the following morning.But three days after the city’s latest audacious animal getaway was reported, it appears that New Yorkers have greeted the news with a collective shrug.On Thursday, an eastern box turtle went missing from the Inwood Hill Nature Center. “Circumstances are unclear,” Sarah Aucoin, the director of the parks department’s Urban Park Rangers, said in a statement.Rangers have been dispatched. A search has been started. But questions abound: Where is the fake Twitter feed, like the cobra’s, which attracted more than 200,000 followers? Where is the press gaggle, which broadcast across oceans the peacock’s great adventure? And what about an army of volunteers, like the one that emerged in the fall to search for a cat named Jack, who was lost in the baggage area at Kennedy International Airport?Residents seem to have overlooked the turtle’s myriad handicaps as it eludes park rangers, particularly when compared to its predecessors. The cobra, though two feet long, most likely had little difficulty camouflaging itself in a dark corner of the Reptile House. The peacock enjoyed the Darwinian advantage of flight.The turtle, meanwhile, is uniquely ill-equipped for a daring escape. Though rarely much more than six inches in length, a male eastern box turtle is easily identified by its fiery red eyes. A woman interviewed by WCBS Radio marveled that such a “slow, large, weird-looking thing” could evade rangers’ watchful gaze.'"
"'11-12-05,'1','The announcement came after his wife, Vanessa Long, 53, filed for divorce Thursday. Friday, she recanted after “prayerful reflection” but later in the day changed her mind and said she did intend to end their marriage of 21 years. They have four children.“Vanessa and I are working together in seeking God’s will in our current circumstances,” Bishop Long, 58, said in a statement issued by the church, New Birth Missionary Baptist Church.During services on Sunday, he told congregants that he was still their senior pastor and would continue to provide spiritual direction, but that he needed time to take care of “some family business.” Members attending services pledged support and said they would stay until his return.“He needs to be with his family,” said Marilyn Arnold, a business manager. “It’s hard on his family. When he comes back, we’ll be here.”But not everyone remains a believer. Miller, a property manager in Lithonia, said she left the church after the young men who accused the bishop of sexual impropriety came forward.“A lot of us left. I mean, a lot,” she said in an interview Sunday.Like others, she hopes that Bishop Long turns this temporary break into a permanent one.“The church needs a cleansing,” she said. “I’m real disappointed. He was a man we all looked up to.”Bishop Long took over the congregation in 1987 when it had a few hundred members. He built a following of 25,000, according to the church’s Web site, and reached millions more on TV.Just after Easter, Bishop Long settled a lawsuit in which young men claimed that the pastor offered gifts, trips, and emotional and spiritual guidance that eventually led to sexual relations. One of the young men, Maurice Robinson, said in court records that his relationship with Bishop Long began when he was 15 and that on a trip to the two engaged in sexual acts.Bishop Long initially vowed to fight the charges, proclaiming his innocence and comparing himself to David who fought Goliath.“I have five rocks and I haven’t thrown one yet,” he said when the charges were revealed.Details of the settlement were to be kept secret, but people with knowledge of the case have put it at several million dollars paid over a period of years.Some of the men have since spoken out, so lawyers for the church have tried to get part of the money returned, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.There have been other legal battles. Ten former members who attended church seminars are suing him, claiming he coerced them into investment deals that cost them their savings. He recently reached a settlement in a lawsuit over a $2 million bank , much of which went unpaid after a real estate deal that went bad.In 2007, Bishop Long was one of a half-dozen ministers whose -exempt status was investigated by a Senate committee.Support for Bishop Long continues to shrink. Just before the sexual coercion settlement was announced, the Rev. Bernice King, the youngest daughter of the Rev. Dr. , left the church.On Sunday, a small group of antigay, religious protesters stood outside the church urging Bishop Long to step down permanently. They said they planned to return every month until he left.“He has a serious moral character flaw,” said Isaac Richmond, 73, the minister at the Church of Human Development in . “It’s a moral question and he’s a religious figure. We don’t want that image as a role model for young men in the African-American community.”The Rev. Timothy McDonald, a Baptist minister in Atlanta and chairman of the group African-American Ministers in Action, said that attendance at the church had dropped to 4,000 from about 8,000 at one point this year. Still, he said, it remains a powerful force. “Even on his bad days, if he gets 4,000 or 5,000, he’s still larger than 94 or 95 percent of most churches,” he said.Frank Cook, a contract administrator who has been a member for 20 years, is not going anywhere. “It’s all about restoring, forgiving and loving,” he said in an interview on Sunday. “We love Bishop Long and we’re going to keep coming.”'"

"'11-12-05,'1','The physical copy of Peter Nadas’s “Parallel Stories” does not hold up well to a particularly aggressive reading. In at least one reader’s experience, cracking the book’s spine to make the 1,133-page tome into a more manageable bedtime read caused pages to break loose from their binding; by novel’s end piles of disordered pages were scattered every which way.In a way that seems fitting. Although this book’s title hints at a relatively simple and precise geometry, “Parallel Stories” is actually a hugely ambitious, breathtakingly inventive and at times maddeningly dense novel intent on obliterating historical, geographical, literary and structural borders. “Parallel” doesn’t really begin to describe how these stories interact with one another. They converge and diverge; they overlap; they crisscross, loop around and double back on one another, resulting in a defiantly nonlinear novel that attempts the daunting feat of recreating the fragmented, and perhaps even shell-shocked experience of living in Hungary during the 20th century.“By fantasizing one builds a more predictable world, and then one has no time to notice what is really happening, because of the din made by one’s expectations crashing down,” one character observes. True enough here: just about any attempt concisely to summarize this morbidly obese book or impose a predictable chronology on it will misleadingly suggest the exact sort of narrative architecture that its author seeks to topple.Born in Budapest in 1942, Mr. Nadas is something of a literary superstar in Hungary, one who has earned comparisons to Leo Tolstoy, Thomas Mann and Marcel Proust. Given his stylistic experimentation, comparisons may just as easily be made to the work of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Anthony Burgess, particularly in the latter’s prescient, channel-surfing 1982 novel “The End of the World News.” In September the British gambling company Ladbrokes set Mr. Nadas’s odds of winning the Nobel Prize at 10 to 1, third place behind Adonis and Tomas Transtromer, the eventual laureate. Mr. Nadas is probably best known in the United States for “A Book of Memories” (1997), which Susan Sontag called “the greatest novel written in our time”; its title could serve Mr. Nadas’s new novel equally well, if not better than the one he has chosen.Given the book’s penchant for blasting through boundaries, “Parallel Stories” begins appropriately enough in 1989, the year the Berlin Wall fell. In the Tiergarten, a public park in Berlin, a mentally unstable young man discovers a body and is subsequently questioned by a highly educated and idiosyncratic detective with an odd fixation on the aromas exuded by the corpse. This setup is memorable and intriguing, but readers eager to learn how it turns out will find their hopes dashed by an author who actively avoids tidy resolutions. Nearly 800 pages will pass with barely a reference to this murder-mystery plot, and even then Mr. Nadas will refuse to resolve it.In between, Mr. Nadas interweaves dozens of plots and the interactions of scores of characters, presenting them against the backdrop of tumultuous 20th-century Hungarian history. Children are subjected to eugenics experiments during World War II, a time when the pro-Nazi Arrow Cross rose to power and much of the Jewish population of Hungary was deported and exterminated under the direction of Adolf Eichmann; after the failed 1956 Hungarian Revolution, people in a bread line are set upon by Russian tanks; in the early 1960s, during the tenure of the Socialist Workers’ Party leader Janos Kadar, a young man cruises the gay pickup scene on Margaret Island, with terrifying and heartbreaking results.'"
"'11-12-05,'1','Yet he broke back immediately and went on to win seven consecutive games. At the start of the second set, however, with Nadal struggling to find his usual rhythm on clay, del Potro wasted a 40-0 lead that would have put him up by two games.Instead, Nadal clawed his way back and drew even. After that, he was once more punching the air in celebration, urged on by a passionate crowd at the sold-out stadium arena.“Getting the break back in that game really gave me a lot,” Nadal said when asked to comment on how he had turned the match around.  “After that, I felt the match had started for me.”Nadal said he had struggled with del Potro’s flat and devastating shots from the baseline, with the Argentine regularly outpacing Nadal during their longer rallies. Indeed, at times it was hard to believe that the match was taking place on a clay court that the players had described as particularly slow.After breaking del Potro at the end of the second set, Nadal took charge, comfortably winning a third. He repeatedly snuffed out del Potro’s attempts to come to the net with pinpoint backhand passes, one of which left del Potro shaking his head in apparent disbelief.By the end of the third set, as del Potro slumped on his chair with his team captain wiping the sweat off his back, it looked as if he was finally paying the price for his efforts Friday, when he battled almost five hours before losing to David Ferrer.Instead, however, del Potro managed to turn the fourth set into a topsy-turvy affair in which he broke Nadal four times before collapsing in the tiebreaker.As Nadal prepared to serve for the match, after breaking his opponent to take a 6-5 lead, stadium stewards started to scurry behind the court to set up the podium for the awards ceremony. But that proved wishful thinking, as del Potro broke back once more to force the tiebreaker.There was no further drama in store, though, as del Potro failed to win a point in the tiebreaker, with Nadal closing the match with another blistering forehand.It was Argentina’s fourth loss in the Davis Cup final since 1981.  Spain, meanwhile, extended a record run of 21 consecutive wins at home in the competition.Spain is set to defend its trophy next year with a significantly different team. Nadal indicated that he would focus instead on the 2012 London Olympics, as well as the regular tournaments, and Ferrer also suggested that it was time to hand the baton to a new generation of Spanish players.As for Sunday’s match, del Potro said that even if Nadal was physically not at his best, he remained “too good for the rest of us on clay.”He added: “ I had a good match, despite losing. I felt that once again, I was very close to winning.”'"
"'11-12-05,'1','The combustion of represented more than half of the growth in emissions, the report found.In the , emissions dropped by a remarkable 7 percent in the recession year of 2009, but rose by just over 4 percent last year, the new analysis shows. This country is the world’s second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, pumping 1.5 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere last year.The United States was surpassed several years ago by , where emissions grew 10.4 percent in 2010, with that country injecting 2.2 billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide emissions are usually measured by the weight of carbon they contain.The new figures come as delegates from 191 countries meet in , , for yet another negotiating session in a global control effort that has been going on, with minimal success, for the better part of two decades.“Each year that emissions go up, there’s another year of negotiations, another year of indecision,” said Glen P. Peters, a researcher at the Center for International Climate and Environmental Research in and a leader of the group that produced the new analysis. “There’s no evidence that this trajectory we’ve been following the last 10 years is going to change.”Scientists say the rapid growth of emissions is warming the Earth, threatening the ecology and putting human welfare at long-term risk. But their increasingly urgent pleas that society find a way to limit emissions have met sharp political resistance in many countries, including the United States, because doing so would entail higher energy costs.The new figures show a continuation of a trend in which developing countries, including China and India, have surpassed the wealthy countries in their overall greenhouse emissions. In 2010, the combustion of fossil fuels and the production of cement sent more than nine billion tons of carbon into the atmosphere, the new analysis found, with 57 percent of that coming from developing countries.Emissions per person, though, are still sharply higher in the wealthy countries, and those countries have been emitting greenhouse gases far longer, so they account for the bulk of the excess gases in the atmosphere. The level of carbon dioxide, the main such gas, has increased 40 percent since the Industrial Revolution.On the surface, the figures of recent years suggest that wealthy countries have made headway in stabilizing their emissions. But Dr. Peters pointed out that in a sense, the rich countries have simply exported some of them.The fast rise in developing countries has been caused to a large extent by the growth of energy-intensive manufacturing industries that make goods that rich countries import. “All that has changed is the location in which the emissions are being produced,” Dr. Peters said.Many countries, as part of their response to the economic crisis, invested billions in programs designed to make their energy systems greener. While it is possible those will pay long-term dividends, the new numbers suggest they have had little effect so far.The financial crisis “was an opportunity to move the global economy away from a high-emissions trajectory,” said a scientific paper about the new figures, released online on Sunday by the Climate Change. “Our results provide no indication of this happening.”'"

"'11-12-06,'1','Natasha Sydney’s new home has a sunset view of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and three “Happy Birthday” balloons hovering near the living room ceiling, but not much else.That is because Ms. Sydney, 30, and her three daughters had nothing to furnish their two-bedroom apartment in the Sheepshead Bay Houses in Brooklyn, where they moved in August.They borrowed some plastic lawn chairs to sit on. Unable to buy a table, they ate on their laps. Ms. Sydney and her daughters also slept on the floor.“I laid out here,” said Ms. Sydney, pointing to the vinyl-tiled living-room floor where she had placed a comforter and pillows. She fashioned a similar arrangement in her girls’ bedroom.“It’s been tough; but it was good for my back,” she said, laughing.Looking tidy in a blue blazer and slacks that were set off by her vivacious smile, Ms. Sydney said she became a mother at 14, never graduating from high school. In 2003, she landed a retail position at Bloomingdale’s that paid $600 a week plus commissions. About five years later, as the recession prompted shoppers to cut back, she lost her job.“I never saved for a rainy day,” Ms. Sydney said with regret. After she exhausted her 401(k) to cover her rent and her commercial landlord refused to participate in the Section 8 housing program, she said, she and her daughters were forced to move. They lived with an aunt, and then with Ms. Sydney’s mother, putting their possessions into storage and squeezing into a three-bedroom home that accommodated several others.When Ms. Sydney could not keep up with the storage payments, all their belongings were auctioned off. The worst part was losing precious family photographs. “I even had a picture of my dad at 18,” she said, sighing.Ms. Sydney received welfare for a time. But, she said: “It wasn’t for me. I felt trapped.”After applying for numerous positions, she got a job two years ago as a home health aide for Attending Home Care in Brooklyn, where she now works four days a week, 12 hours a day. Her weekly salary is $407. But she is happy to have a job. “Now I make my own money,” she said.When the New York City Housing Authority offered her an apartment in July, she barely glanced it over, so eager was she to move in with the family’s few possessions: a cooking pot, a blender, a stereo and clothes. But no beds. Ms. Sydney turned to Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.“When she came to me the first time, she started crying,” her case worker, Maria Gualy, recalled. “She said, ‘I need to provide my daughters with what they deserve.’ ”Through the fund, Catholic Charities gave Ms. Sydney $700 to buy a queen-size bed and a bunk bed designed to sleep three comfortably.“It’s good,” said her oldest daughter, Tyisha Tasha King, 16. “Good, good,” chimed in the two younger girls, Myeira Natalia Joseph, 6, and Tianna Tafari King, 12.“It’s a new beginning,” Ms. Sydney said. “I’m going in wiser. I’m more cautious.”She is enrolled in a workshop run by Operation Hope at Catholic Charities, where she is learning to manage her finances better. “I’m doing extreme couponing,” she said, describing how she cuts coupons from newspapers and visits Web sites to ferret out other discounts. “It’s helping me get back to where I need to be.”“And I’m not doing fast foods,” she said. Instead, she is focusing on home cooking, like the dish she made from random things in her cupboard, including spaghetti, corn, onion and Adobo seasoning on a recent night. “I don’t know what it was,” she said, “but they loved it.”Although Ms. Sydney receives $392 in food stamps and $200 in child support, there is little left over for more home furnishings. “I like color,” she said, envisioning a red sofa someday brightening up the beige walls.As the sunset faded, and not having a single living-room lamp to turn on, she got up and switched on the kitchen light. It will do for now.'"
"'11-12-06,'1','The biggest whopper in ’s fiscal plan comes right at the beginning of the description on his Web site: “We will level with the American people about what it will take to truly cut spending and balance our budget.” Actually, Mr. Romney never tells voters the full cost of his plan to balance the budget while cutting : popular programs would be slashed or eliminated, vital state and local services would disappear, misery would be inflicted on the poor and the working class.Such details would make the plan a hard sell as he runs for the Republican presidential nomination, so Mr. Romney presents it as a breeze, with little pain attached. Just cap spending, make the permanent and eliminate the , raise the age for , and offer some lower-cost options. Before you know it, economic growth will return to 4 percent a year and military cuts can be called off.At no point does Mr. Romney deal with what every reliable budget projection concludes: Without new revenue it will be impossible to cope with an aging population and infrastructure or with the needs of those who are being left behind as the income gap widens.Details are in short supply. For example, his plan supports passage of the 10-year House budget resolution written by Paul Ryan, with a hard cap on spending at 20 percent of gross domestic product (compared with the current 24.3 percent), but it never says what the House plan contains. Here’s a reminder: It would cut food stamps by $127 billion, which would remove millions of people from the rolls during a downturn and cut the benefits of those who remain. Nearly two-thirds of Mr. Ryan’s cuts affect low-income programs like Pell grants, housing subsidies and .That’s never mentioned by Mr. Romney, who instead talks about big cuts to tiny programs that are wildly unpopular with the party base, like the national endowments, family planning and foreign aid. Of course, he wants to repeal , which he claims would save $95 billion but would actually raise the deficit by $124 billion in just the first decade.'"
"'11-12-06,'1','At Monday’s meeting, Mr. Obama spent about an hour with the educators, and Mr. Duncan remained after he left.Jamie P. Merisotis, president of the Lumina Foundation, which works to increase the number of college graduates, said there seemed to be some consensus at the White House meeting that the federal government should develop policies on financial aid, its biggest tool, to spur a higher graduation rates, whether by limiting the number of semesters for which students could receive aid, requiring them to attend full-time, or doling out aid bit by bit to discourage students from dropping out mid-semester, or other approaches.“We discussed three core issues,” Mr. Merisotis said. “One was responsibility for costs, and what the federal government can do to support innovation with incentive money, or something like Race to the Top. We talked a lot about increasing accountability in student aid. And third, there was conversation about what degrees mean.” Mr. Merisotis and Ms. Wellman both testified at Representative Foxx’s hearing.Several of the participants said they discussed the importance of linking colleges with K-12 education, and a recognition that attempts to control costs would require a fundamental rethinking of the traditional model of higher education, making greater, and different, use of technology.“If we’re going to address the 37 million adults with some college and no degree, we can’t just tweak the existing model,” said Robert W. Mendenhall of Western Governors University, an online nonprofit university. “Mostly in higher education, technology is an add-on cost that doesn’t change the model at all. We need to fundamentally change the faculty role, and use technology to do the teaching.”Larry D. Shinn, the president of Berea College, did not disagree. “We’re structured in a 19th-century model, but I think we all know now that blended learning, combining technology and classroom learning, can let us educate for less cost,” he said. “The question is how we get there from here.”Participants said that everyone understood that additional financing for education would be scarce in the coming years, making it crucial to improve affordability and graduation rates through innovation, including online learning.“The key message was a challenge to us to question all our strongly held assumptions, including getting our faculty to think differently about teaching,” said Jared L. Cohon, the president of Carnegie Mellon University, which has developed online classes that provide instructors real-time information about each student’s progress. “I personally get very uncomfortable when people start talking about replacing faculty with technology,” he said, “But I do think technology can help us educate more students faster and better.”The Carnegie Mellon courses are now being used at many universities, including in pilot programs at the three large statewide university systems — Maryland, New York and Texas — whose presidents all attended the meeting.'"
"'11-12-06,'1','Dr. was already in when I spoke to him Sunday afternoon. He was back in the Newton home where he’d lived for 30 years, being pleasantly interrupted during our conversation by his 2-year-old grandson. His last day in Washington as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had been Thursday. Friday was packing day. Saturday was moving day. And, by Sunday, he was already talking about his too-short, 17-month tenure as the nation’s top official in the past tense. Which, alas, it was.Dr. Berwick, I’m here to tell you, was the most qualified person in the country to run Medicare at this critical juncture, and the fact that he is no longer in the job is the country’s loss. Berwick started out as a pediatrician and health care researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health and eventually became vice president of the Harvard Community Health Plan (now known as Harvard Pilgrim Health Care). There, he became enamored with the ideas being promulgated by management gurus like W. Edwards Deming and companies like , which believed that companies could create processes — and a mind-set — that would allow for both continuous improvement and continuous cost reduction. Indeed, they believed that the two went hand in hand.Latching onto these ideas, Berwick helped start — and, for the next 19 years, run — the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, which was devoted to applying them to health care. The result would be healthier patients who spent less time in hospitals — and a culture that wasted less money on things that didn’t lead directly to a healthier population.As the insurer of one out of every three Americans, Medicare is in an enviable position to push for health care improvements, if it chooses to. And with a budget larger than the Pentagon’s — and a consensus that its spending must be brought under control — no government agency has a more urgent need to cut costs. Surely somebody who has spent his career focused on these two issues would seem to be just the ticket.But there’s one more thing about Berwick: He believes that ’s is “an important moral step toward universal health care.” As he put it when we spoke: “Because of it, our country is, at last, making health care a basic human right. It is a majestic thing.”Naturally, this view made him anathema to Republicans, who blocked his nomination in the usual way. They pored through his old speeches and articles, plucked out a few comments they objected to — he once praised the British health care system! — and announced that they would never confirm him.'"
"'11-12-06,'1','As you note in “For Afghan Woman, Justice Runs Into Unforgiving Wall of Custom” (front page, Dec. 2), Afghan government decisions on women’s rights are more critical now than ever as American forces prepare to leave Afghanistan.One way the United States could really advance the “unfinished business of advancing women’s rights” in that country is by ratifying the international women’s rights treaty, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.Women’s rights opponents in Afghanistan and elsewhere now can question our commitment by pointing out that we are one of only six countries in the world (with Iran, Somalia, Sudan and the Pacific islands Palau and Tonga) that have failed to ratify the treaty. Ratification would show that we are ready to walk our talk for women in Afghanistan and worldwide.The writer is director of the Cedaw Education Project of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights.'"
"'11-12-06,'1','Dr. Kelly points to Watson, the question-answering computer that can play “Jeopardy!” and beat two human champions earlier this year. I.B.M.’s clever machine consumes 85,000 watts of electricity, while the human brain runs on just 20 watts. “Evolution figured this out,” Dr. Kelly said.Several biologically inspired paths are being explored by computer scientists in universities and corporate laboratories worldwide. But researchers from I.B.M. and four universities — Cornell, Columbia, the University of Wisconsin, and the University of California, Merced — are engaged in a project that seems particularly intriguing.The project, a collaboration of computer scientists and neuroscientists begun three years ago, has been encouraging enough that in August it won a $21 million round of government financing from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, bringing the total to $41 million in three rounds. In recent months, the team has developed prototype “neurosynaptic” microprocessors, or chips that operate more like neurons and synapses than like conventional semiconductors.But since 2008, the project itself has evolved, becoming more focused, if not scaled back. Its experience suggests what designs, concepts and techniques might be usefully borrowed from biology to push the boundaries of computing, and what cannot be applied, or even understood.At the outset, Dharmendra S. Modha, the I.B.M. computer scientist leading the project, described the research grandly as “the quest to engineer the mind by reverse-engineering the brain.” The project embarked on supercomputer simulations intended to equal the complexity of animal brains — a cat and then a monkey. In science blogs and online forums, some neuroscientists sharply criticized I.B.M. for what they regarded as exaggerated claims of what the project could achieve.These days at the I.B.M. Almaden Research Center in San Jose, Calif., there is not a lot of talk of reverse-engineering the brain. Wide-ranging ambitions that narrow over time, Dr. Modha explained, are part of research and discovery, even if his earlier rhetoric was inflated or misunderstood.“Deciding what not to do is just as important as deciding what to do,” Dr. Modha said. “We’re not trying to replicate the brain. That’s impossible. We don’t know how the brain works, really.”The discussion and debate across disciplines has helped steer the research, as the team pursues the goals set out by Darpa, the Pentagon’s research agency. The technology produced, according to the guidelines, should have the characteristics of being self-organizing, able to “learn” instead of merely responding to conventional programming commands, and consuming very little power.“We have this fantastic network of specialists who talk to each other,” said Giulio Tononi, a psychiatrist and neuroscientist at the University of Wisconsin. “It focuses our thinking as neuroscientists and guides the thinking of the computer scientists.”In early 2010, Dr. Modha made a decision that put the project on its current path. While away from the lab for a few weeks, because of a Hawaiian vacation and a bout of flu, he decided to streamline the work of the far-flung researchers. The biologically inspired chip under development would come first, Dr. Modha said. That meant a lot of experimental software already written was scrapped. But, he said, “chip-first as an organizing principle gave us a coherent plan.”In designing chips that bear some structural resemblance to the brain, so-called neuromorphic chips, neuroscience was a guiding principle as well. Brains are low-power, nimble computing mechanisms — real-world proof that it is possible.A brain does its computing with a design drastically different from today’s computers. Its processors — neurons — are, in computing terms, massively distributed; there are billions in a human brain. These neuron processors are wrapped in its data memory devices — synapses — so that the brain’s paths of communication are extremely efficient and diverse, through the neuron’s axons, which conduct electrical impulses.A machine that adopts that approach, Dr. Modha said, would represent “a crucial shift away from von Neumann computing.” He was referring to a design with processor and memory physically separated and connected by a narrow communications channel, or bus, and operating according to step-by-step sequential methods — the von Neumann architecture used in current computers, named after the mathematician John von Neumann.The concept of neuromorphic electronic systems is more than two decades old; Carver Mead, a renowned computer scientist, described such devices in an engineering journal article in 1990. Earlier biologically inspired devices, scientists say, were mostly analog, single-purpose sensors that mimicked one function, like an electronic equivalent of a retina for sensing image data.But the I.B.M. and university researchers are pursuing a more versatile digital technology. “It seems that we can build a computing architecture that is quite general-purpose and could be used for a large class of applications,” said Rajit Manohar, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Cornell University.What might such applications be, 5 or 10 years from now, if the technology proves successful? They would be the sorts of tasks that humans find effortless and that computers struggle with — the pattern recognition of seeing and identifying someone, walking down a crowded sidewalk without running into people, learning from experience. Specifically, the scientists say, the applications might include robots that can navigate a battlefield environment and be trained; low-power prosthetic devices that would allow blind people to see; and computerized health-care monitors that watch over people in nursing homes and send alerts to human workers if a resident’s behavior suggests illness.It is an appealing vision, but there are formidable obstacles. The prototype chip has 256 neuron-like nodes, surrounded by more than 262,000 synaptic memory modules. That is impressive, until one considers that the human brain is estimated to house up to 100 billion neurons. In the Almaden research lab, a computer running the chip has learned to play the primitive video game Pong, correctly moving an on-screen paddle to hit a bouncing cursor. It can also recognize numbers 1 through 10 written by a person on a digital pad — most of the time. But the project still has a long way to go.It is still questionable whether the scientists can successfully assemble large clusters of neuromorphic chips. And though the intention is for the machines to evolve more from learning than from being programmed, the software that performs that magic for any kind of complex task has yet to be written.The project’s Pentagon sponsor is encouraged. “I’m surprised that we’re so far along, and I don’t see any fundamental reason why it can’t be done,” said Todd Hylton, a program manager.If it succeeds, the project would seem to make peace with the “airplanes don’t flap their wings” critique. “Yes, they are different, but bird wings and plane wings both depend on the same aerodynamic principles to get lift,” said Christopher T. Kello, director of the Cognitive Mechanics Lab at the University of California, Merced. “It’s the same with this project. You can use essential design elements from biology.”'"
"'11-12-06,'1','WASHINGTON — Congressional Republicans said Monday that they would open an investigation into undercover operations by the Drug Enforcement Administration in which agents have laundered and smuggled millions of dollars in drug money as part of an effort to help Mexico fight organized crime.The operations, which drug officials said had the support and cooperation of the Mexican government, have funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars across borders and moved millions more through shell accounts to help American agents identify how criminal organizations move their money, where they keep their assets and who their leaders are.Critics said the operations blur the line between surveillance and facilitating crime, raising questions similar to those around a gun-smuggling operation known as Fast and Furious that involves agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The gun operation has been under investigation for months by Representative Darrell Issa, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. In a letter on Monday to Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., Mr. Issa said he would expand that investigation to include the drug agency, describing its money-laundering investigations as “dangerous schemes” and adding that “the consequences have been disastrous.”Mr. Issa, Republican of California, asked Mr. Holder to provide a briefing on the undercover operations to his staff on Wednesday. He wrote, “It is almost unfathomable to contemplate the degree to which the United States government has made itself an accomplice to the drug trade, which has thus far left more than 40,000 people dead in Mexico.”'"
"'11-12-06,'1','The Internet isn’t really a technology. It’s a belief system, a philosophy about the effectiveness of decentralized, bottom-up innovation. And it’s a philosophy that has begun to change how we think about creativity itself.Almost 20 years ago, I installed on my computer a tiny piece of software called MacPPP, which connected the programs running on it to the Internet. The program immediately transformed my computer from a fancy telex machine to a device running a very early version of the graphical Web.I was working in entertainment at the time, and I remember thinking that this connection was going to change everything. I left to join the first commercial Internet service provider in Japan, PSINet Japan, as its first chief executive. Our first serious challenge, oddly enough, was a battle over an obscure information-sharing computer protocol called X.25. Most of us laboring to build the new Internet preferred the less regulated and simpler Internet Protocol.Until then, large intergovernmental agencies had always gathered experts to work on the technical standards that would become the DNA of the telecommunications industry, the standards to which all companies would have to build their networks and products. These researchers had produced X.25, a complex and extremely well-considered standard that seemed to anticipate every possible problem and application.The Internet, on the other hand, was designed and deployed by small groups of researchers following the credo of one of its chief architects, David Clark: “rough consensus and running code.” Its early standards — uncomplicated, consensual — were stewarded by small organizations that resisted permission or authority. And they won: The Internet Protocol on which every connected device relies was a triumph of distributed innovation over centralized expertise.The ethos of the Internet is that everyone should have the freedom to connect, to innovate, to program, without asking permission. No one can know the whole of the network, and by design it cannot be centrally controlled. This network was intended to be decentralized, its assets widely distributed. Today most innovation springs from small groups at its “edges.”'"
"'11-12-06,'1','SEOUL, South Korea — A senior American diplomat urged South Korea on Monday to suspend imports of Iranian petrochemicals as Washington tried to rally international pressure on Iran to stop its nuclear program.“The situation in Iran has become more and more worrisome over recent months,” the diplomat, Robert J. Einhorn, said at a news conference in Seoul. “The timeline for Iran’s nuclear program is beginning to get shorter.”Mr. Einhorn, the State Department’s  special adviser for nonproliferation and arms control, said that if a diplomatic solution was not found, “pressures will grow for a much stronger kind of action.”“That’s why we need to act soon,” he said. “That’s why we want to work with all of our partners around the world, including the Republic of Korea, to send a right signal to Iran.”The Foreign Ministry in Seoul said it was reviewing the American request.Last month, Washington announced additional sanctions against Iran after a report by the International Atomic Energy Agency that linked its uranium enrichment program with nuclear weapons development. The new restrictions were aimed mainly at Iran’s oil, gas and petrochemical industries.South Korean imports of Iranian petrochemicals amount only to $300 million a year. Still, the country fears damaging its other trade ties with Iran, especially crude oil imports. Iran is the fourth-largest source of  crude oil for South Korea, accounting  for 10 percent of its oil imports.'"

Hulu ultimately did not find a partner.That Verizon looked at Hulu, which streams television shows and movies, underscores the growing interest in delivering video across an Internet pipe, known in the industry as ""over-the-top service."" Verizon, which is newer to the pay-TV business than its cable counterparts, has been more willing to embrace over-the-top as a service, but still believes its core Fios TV product will remain dominant for years.""Over-the-top will be complementary,"" McAdam said.Verizon is reportedly planning its own online video-streaming service to reach customers outside Fios territory and take on Netflix, Hulu, and the traditional cable providers. McAdam declined today to comment on the speculation.McAdam hit upon several different topics during his onstage discussion with an analyst. He said the company would introduced shared data plan--a sort of family plan with a shared pool of data instead of voice minutes--sometime next year. Wireless executives have long talked about the concept of a shared data plan, which would allow consumers to connect multiple devices, but pay one bill.He also expressed some comfort in Verizon's prospects even in this period of economic uncertainty. The continued growth of Fios, as well as growth on the wireless side with 4G services, should keep the company relatively insulated, he said.The company is nearing the end of its Fios deployment, with a goal of having the service available to 18 million people. McAdam said he has a goal of getting to 50 percent penetration in its Fios markets, implying that he hopes to take significant market share from his cable and satellite competitors.That stance puts Verizon in the position of having conflicted partnerships with cable. Last week, Verizon struck a deal to acquire spectrum from Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Bright House Networks for $3.6 billion. As part of the deal, Verizon Wireless stores will sell cable service, even in areas where Fios is available. McAdam said the bundled cable products will begin selling in January.Unlike the cable companies, whose execs spoke earlier at the conference and expressed a willingness to offer a tiered pricing structure on home Internet service, McAdam said it isn't something the company plans to do next year.""Fiber in the home is such a large pipe that it's not taxing on the network,"" he said.On mobile payments, McAdam said he had high hopes for Isis, the company's mobile payments joint venture with AT&T and T-Mobile USA. Isis plans to hold trials next year for its service, which allows customers to wave their phones in front of special checkout readers to pay for goods.McAdam said he expects a significant roll out of the service by the end of next year, and sees a ""real revenue stream"" by 2013. Isis plans to make money through hosting and transaction fees, he added.McAdam also talked up the opportunities that come from Verizon's 4G network, which he said was still ""relatively empty."" While Verizon has been providing lower subsidies on the LTE phones, which mostly run between $250 to $300 with a contract, he said he has kept LTE pricing at the same level as 3G to stimulate usage. He said he wasn't seeing a significant increase in usage on 4G, but anticipates more with the rise of new apps, and the increasing popularity of video services and tablets.The penetration and revenue from 4G will be as good, if not better, than 3G, McAdam said. That's particularly the case if you factor in the new applications that can run on the network.The company continues to monitor the usage between 4G and 3G in balancing where to put more capital.""We feel like we're in a good place,"" he said.McAdam also acknowledged a willingness to eventually sacrifice once-lucrative businesses, including text messaging, which cost the carriers little but offers a lot of profits. A lot of European companies have started to see their text messaging revenue falter as a result of alternative online options, but that trend hasn't fully hit in the U.S., he said.""I do expect SMS to be under attack,"" he said.Text messaging will become like older telecom services, such as long distance, that have fallen by the wayside as far as revenue goes. The trick is to replace it with new sources of revenue, McAdam said, pointing to machine-to-machine connections, or putting cellular modules into nontraditional devices such as smart grid equipment or ATM machines. He said health care and security are among the two industries that could use more wireless connections.Updated at 8:34 a.m. PT: to include an additional comment from McAdam on shared data plans.'"

"'11-12-07,'1','The alternative, he said, was “a sea change in normal criminal law practices” that could require testimony from 10 analysts in a single case, pushing “the system in the direction of relying on less reliable eyewitness testimony rather than more reliable technical laboratory DNA-type evidence.”Tuesday’s case, Williams v. Illinois, No. 10-8505, arose from a sexual assault in Chicago. The defendant, Sandy Williams, was arrested on an unrelated charge and provided a DNA sample to the state police laboratory. A forensic scientist there analyzed it and later testified about Mr. Williams’s DNA profile at his trial on the sexual assault charges. So far, so good, Mr. Williams’s lawyers told the justices.The controversy in the case concerns the material recovered from the assault. It was analyzed by Cellmark Diagnostic Laboratory in Maryland, but the lab’s report was not entered into evidence at trial and no one from that lab appeared to testify about it. But an expert witness for the prosecution was allowed to offer her opinion that the two profiles matched.That appeared to trouble Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, which was something of a surprise, as he had written caustic dissents in the earlier decisions criticizing what he called the imposition of a crushing and needless burden on the nation’s criminal justice system.“The key actor in the play, the Hamlet in the play, is the person who did the test at Cellmark,” he said. “And she or he is not here.”Justice Kennedy referred to the court’s decision in June, Bullcoming v. New Mexico, which ruled that testimony from colleagues and supervisors uninvolved in the testing was not acceptable.“In Bullcoming, at least you had an expert say how the laboratory works,” Justice Kennedy said, in a tone approaching exasperation. “Here, you don’t even have that. You have less here with reference to Cellmark than you did in Bullcoming.”Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, which supported the prosecutors in Tuesday’s case, said the confrontation clause need not figure in the court’s analysis, a position that seemed attractive to several justices.The failure to call a witness from Cellmark may have made the case against Mr. Williams “very weak,” Mr. Dreeben said, but it did not violate the Constitution.“We have a confrontation clause, which requires that the witnesses against the defendant appear and testify personally, and the crucial evidence here is the testing of the semen found on the swab,” he said. “That’s the crux of this evidence, and you’re telling me that this confrontation clause allows you to simply say, Well, we’re not going to bring in the person who did the test; we are simply going to say, ‘This is a reliable lab.’ ” Mr. Dreeben replied, “The confrontation clause, Justice Scalia, does not obligate the state to present a strong case.”'"
"'11-12-07,'1','Dr. Jack Strominger, the Higgins professor of biochemistry at Harvard, said in an interview on Tuesday that the original Watson-Crick discovery was “really a hypothesis based on little scraps of data,” and that the work of Dr. Doty and Dr. Marmur greatly contributed to validating its utility. Their process of heating DNA strands to separate them, then cooling them to encourage them to recombine, ultimately made it possible to “probe” vast amounts of genetic material, he said.Today, recombinant proteins are found in essentially every pharmacy and doctor’s office, used in the treatment of diabetes, hepatitis B and many other diseases. They are used to engineer new strains of rice and other crops and to help farmers control pests. The human genome project, which revealed the precise genetic material, or genome, of a human being, owed much to Dr. Doty’s research.Dr. Doty spoke out on public issues beginning early in his career. In 1951, he wrote a letter to The New York Times complaining that many well-known scientists were barred from a scientific conference in New York because of suspicions about their leftist political beliefs. Dr. Doty’s son said his father believed his own research proposals were sometimes shoved to the bottom of the pile because of his political views.In 1957, Dr. Doty was chairman of an influential group of American scientists who met with their Russian counterparts in Pugwash, Nova Scotia, to help bring a more sophisticated scientific framework to the discussion of nuclear issues. The next year he made the first of 42 trips to the Soviet Union. The meetings are believed to have helped lay the scientific foundation for the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty between the Soviet Union and the United States signed in 1972.Last year, President Obama sent a birthday greeting to Dr. Doty, citing “your work in bridging the cold war divide to bring American and Soviet scientists together in pursuit of measures to reduce the dangers of nuclear conflict.”In 1974, Dr. Doty founded the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard to study arms control and other issues where science and politics merge. It became part of the Kennedy School of Government in 1979 and in 1997 was renamed the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Dr. Doty founded and edited a journal called International Security.Paul Mead Doty was born in Charleston, W.Va., on June 1, 1920, and moved to a small town near Pittsburgh when he was 6 or 7. He got a chemistry set when he was 10, and the teacher in his one-room school soon asked him to take over teaching chemistry. He earned his bachelor’s degree at Pennsylvania State College, now Pennsylvania State University, and his Ph.D. at Columbia.At Columbia, Dr. Doty did research on uranium isotopes that contributed to the Manhattan Project, which built the first atomic bomb. From 1943 to 1946 he worked at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, now the Polytechnic Institute of New York University, on the structure and behavior of molecules. His research on molecular shapes was first applied to making better plastics.After research in England, Dr. Doty joined Harvard as an assistant chemistry professor. He stayed for 42 years. His work on the separating and combining the two strands of the DNA double helix, a so-called macromolecule, led to discoveries about the structure of RNA, another macromolecule whose functions include transporting genetic information. He later helped show that collagen, the major building unit of skin and cartilage, was a triple-stranded helix.Dr. Doty did his work on collagen with his wife, Helga Boedtker, who died in 2001. Besides his son, Gordon, from his marriage to the former Margaretta Grevatt, which ended in divorce, Dr. Doty is survived by his daughters from his second marriage, Marcia, Rebecca and Katherine Doty, and three grandchildren.In 1990 Dr. Crick recalled getting a letter from Dr. Doty 30 years earlier in which he mentioned that he had seen a lapel button for sale in New York with the initials DNA. Thinking the letters must refer to something else, he asked the salesman what they meant.“Get with it, Bud,” he said the man replied in a strong local accent. “That’s the gene.”'"
"'11-12-07,'1','The final chaotic days of a chaotic N.B.A. off-season are winding down, with the league pushing to reopen business Friday after a flurry of last-minute negotiations and formalities.Negotiators for the league and the players union were working through the last of the so-called B-list issues on Tuesday. The goal was to have the labor deal ready for ratification by Wednesday, paving the way for training camps and free agency to start Friday.The players will vote first, through an electronic balloting that will begin at 6 p.m. Wednesday and end at 4 p.m. Thursday. The owners are expected to ratify the deal Thursday at a board of governors meeting in New York. The owners will also be voting on a plan to quadruple the league’s revenue-sharing pool.Assuming there are no hiccups along the way, training camps and free agency will open Friday morning. The season will start Dec. 25 with five games on national television.Players have been slowly trickling into team facilities for the last week, holding informal workouts while the league and the union worked to finish the labor deal, after a 149-day lockout. But coaches are barred from working with players until camps open.'"

"'11-12-07,'1','The Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, led the Republican Party’s opposition to the nomination, saying Ms. Halligan’s record demonstrated that she viewed the court as a means of advancing a social agenda instead of as a forum for even-handedly deciding legal questions.Mr. McConnell argued, for example, that as New York’s solicitor general, Ms. Halligan “advanced the dubious legal theory” that gun manufacturers could be held legally responsible for crimes committed with firearms. Republicans also attacked her on several other issues.During her confirmation hearing, Ms. Halligan distanced herself from positions she had taken on behalf of clients — saying, for example, that she believed that the Second Amendment protects individuals’ right to bear arms. Republicans, however, questioned whether she had been candid and portrayed her as an extremist.“We shouldn’t be putting activists on the bench,” Mr. McConnell said. “I think she would use the court to put her activist judicial philosophy into practices, and for that reason alone she shouldn’t be confirmed.”Senate Democrats strongly criticized the use of the filibuster against Ms. Halligan, who is now the general counsel for the New York County District Attorney’s Office. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, described her as a mainstream and well-qualified legal thinker who was being attacked by “concocted controversies and a blatant misreading” of her record.And Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chamber’s No. 3 Democrat, warned that the Republican action could undo a bipartisan agreement that has guided the way the Senate has handled most appeals court nominations since 2005. The agreement was put together by seven Democrats and seven Republicans known as the Gang of 14. It was reached after Democrats, who were in the Senate minority at the time, employed the tactic to prevent up-or-down votes on several of President George W. Bush’s nominees.Many Republicans at the time argued that it was unconstitutional to block votes on judicial nominees, and the Republican leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, threatened to change Senate rules to ban judicial filibusters.The crisis was averted after seven Democrats agreed not to block certain appeals court nominees and to eschew filibusters except in “extraordinary” circumstances, which were not defined. In exchange, the seven Republicans promised not to vote for changing Senate rules.After the 2008 election, the balance of power shifted: Democrats controlled the White House and had a majority in the Senate. In May, Senate Republicans used a filibuster to prevent the chamber from voting on another one of Mr. Obama’s appeals court nominees, Goodwin Liu.Mr. Liu, however, had unusually outspoken liberal views. He also drew fire for failing to disclose some of his past writings and speeches to the Judiciary Committee. (He has since become an associate justice on the California Supreme Court.)Democrats argued Tuesday that Ms. Halligan should not be seen as meeting a standard of “extraordinary circumstances” that would justify a filibuster. Mr. Schumer said that her defeat “could throw into chaos nominations at the Circuit Court for a long time.”Of the seven Republican senators who were part of the Gang of 14, four — John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine — are still serving. All voted against allowing a vote on Ms. Halligan.

He chose the Rev. , a pastor who opposes , to deliver the invocation at his . Mr. Obama himself has not come out officially in favor of same-sex marriage. But he successfully pushed for repeal of the “ ” policy that prevented gays from serving openly in the military. And the Justice Department has said it will no longer defend in court the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage as between a man and a woman.The initiative also invites attacks from Republicans trying to appeal to a conservative base in the primary and caucus states.One Republican candidate, Gov. of , said: “President Obama has again mistaken America’s tolerance for different lifestyles with an endorsement of those lifestyles. I will not make that mistake.”It could also irritate some American allies, including countries like , where there have been reports of harassment, and , where homosexuality is banned and sex between people of the same sex is punishable by death or flogging.Mrs. Clinton anticipated the sensitivity of the issue for some more conservative countries, saying that “the obstacles standing in the way of protecting the human rights” of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgendered people “rest on deeply held personal, political, cultural and religious beliefs.”She argued that gay rights transcended national, political and even culture boundaries, casting them as universal rights like those adopted by 48 nations in the aftermath of World War II in what was called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Mrs. Clinton’s aides so worried about the reaction of some countries at the Human Rights Council that they did not advertise the theme of her remarks before she delivered them. In the end, no representatives from the council’s 47 member nations walked out, and the audience gave her a standing ovation.The administration’s announcement formalizes several steps that Mrs. Clinton has already ordered. She has asked American diplomats to raise the issue wherever harassment or abuse arises and required a record of them in the State Department’s annual report on human rights. On Tuesday, she also announced a $3 million program to finance gay-rights organizations to combat discrimination, violence and other abuses.A senior administration official said that the money could be used, for example, to finance a lawyers’ group that is defending gays or to pay for the training of journalists who cover the persecution of gays. It could also provide relocation aid to refugees fleeing violence or persecution.“I am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination targeting L.G.B.T. persons around the world,” Mr. Obama said in the memorandum, referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,  “whether it is passing laws that criminalize L.G.B.T. status, beating citizens simply for joining peaceful L.G.B.T. pride celebrations, or killing men, women and children for their perceived sexual orientation.”He said in the memorandum that the State Department would lead other federal agencies to help ensure that the government provided a “swift and meaningful response to serious incidents that threaten the human rights” of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people abroad.The administration’s directive, months in the planning, came after a series of legal steps taken against gay men and lesbians in countries like , where the Parliament reopened debate on legislation that would outlaw homosexuality and possibly make it punishable by death.The State Department’s latest human rights report, released in April, catalogued cases in dozens of countries.In , where the United States overthrew the in 2001 and installed a nominally democratic government, the law “criminalizes homosexual activity.” In , too, it is a crime, though rarely prosecuted, the report said.Homosexuality is accepted in most of , and an increasing number of countries have taken steps to end legal prohibitions. In , the government decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from an official list of psychological disorders in 2001. Mrs. Clinton credited , , , and for taking steps to liberalize their laws.She also noted that, until 2003, sodomy was a crime in parts of the United States and that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people Americans “have endured violence and harassment in their lives.”As was the case with the initial declaration on human rights, which did not immediately abolish racist laws or social and political barriers for women or religious minorities, she said, the notion of human rights has gradually expanded to include all people. She dismissed the assertion of some that homosexuality is “a Western phenomenon.”“In reality, gay people are born into — and belong to — every society in the world,” she said.In countries “where people are jailed, beaten or executed for being gay,” she called on leaders to leap ahead of their constituents cultural or social mores, if necessary. “I’m not saying that gay people can’t or don’t commit crimes,” she said. “They can and do, just like straight people. And when they do, they should be held accountable. But it should never be a crime to be gay.”'"
"'11-12-07,'1','So far, the broader debt crisis engulfing the euro zone nations has pushed discussion of the tax into the background. But if European leaders can agree on a plan that calms the financial markets, they would be in a stronger position to enact a levy, analysts said.“There is some momentum behind this,” said Simon Tilford, chief economist of the Center for European Reform in . “If they keep the show on the road, they probably will attempt to run with this.”The Robin Hood tax has also become a rallying point for labor unions, nongovernmental organizations and the movement, which view it as a way to claw back money from the top 1 percent to help the other 99 percent. Last month, thousands of demonstrators, including hundreds in Robin Hood outfits with bright green caps and bows and arrows, flooded into southern France to urge the leaders of the nations to do more to help the poor, including passing a financial transactions tax.Enacting such a tax still faces many hurdles, however — most notably, skepticism from leaders in the and , home to some of the world’s most important financial exchanges.The day after the Robin Hood protest, for example, Mr. Gates, the chairman of and one of the world’s wealthiest men, presented a report to a closed-door meeting of the G-20 leaders that laid out his ideas on how rich countries could aid poor ones. One of his proposals was a modest tax on trades of financial instruments that could generate $48 billion or more annually from the G-20 countries.Ms. Merkel and France’s president, , quickly piped up, enthusiastically endorsing the tax. But Britain’s prime minister, , expressed serious reservations, saying Britain would embrace it only if it were adopted globally. British officials fear that unless the tax is worldwide, trading will flee London’s huge markets to countries with no tax.The Obama administration has also been lukewarm, expressing sympathy but saying it would be hard to execute, could drive trading overseas and would hurt pension funds and individual investors in addition to banks.Administration officials say they would prefer a tax on the assets of the largest banks as a way to discourage them from risky activities. “The president is sympathetic to the goals that a financial transactions tax is trying to achieve and he is pushing for a financial crisis responsibility fee and closing other Wall Street loopholes as the best and most feasible way to achieve those goals,” an administration official said.Still, support is growing for the idea, which has been largely dormant since the 1970s, when a version was first proposed by the economist James Tobin, later a winner.“The tax is a good idea because banks are where the money is. It’s the same reason Jesse James robbed banks,” said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, which recently held demonstrations at the offices of 60 members of Congress in support of the levy. “The thing about the financial transactions tax is it’s stunning how quickly people get it and how fast they embrace it.”groups like the nurses’ union and the see the tax as a way to finance job creation programs to fight high unemployment in the United States and .Other advocates hope it will slow the speculation that many blame for undermining and causing wild swings in financial markets. Mr. Gates and Mr. Sarkozy would like to use the money to finance development in the world’s poorest nations. And leaders like Ms. Merkel and some members of Congress are eyeing it as a relatively painless source of money to help plug government deficits.On Nov. 16, the French Senate passed a bill supporting a financial transactions tax. And the in has said it would like to put a tax of $10 per $10,000 of transactions in place throughout the by 2014, predicting it would raise 57 billion euros ($77 billion) a year in European countries alone.Last month, Representative Peter DeFazio, an Democrat, and Senator , an Democrat, proposed an American version of the tax that they said could raise $350 billion over 10 years.Their legislation would impose $3 in taxes for each $10,000 in transactions. Other proposals, including those from the nurses’ union, call for a tax of $50 per $10,000.Mr. DeFazio said his tax plan would “raise money to invest in the real economy,” but he acknowledged that it faced an uphill battle in , especially within the antitax Republican caucus.Opponents say that even at the rate in the DeFazio-Harkin bill, the tax would add significantly to the cost of trading, exceeding what institutional investors pay in commissions.“At a time when we face a slow economic recovery, such a tax will impede the efficiency of markets and impair depth and liquidity as well as raise costs to the issuers, pensions and investors who help drive economic growth,” Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., executive vice president for public policy at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, said in a statement.George Osborne, the British chancellor of the exchequer, described the proposed tax as “economic suicide” for Europe. In this time of economic crisis, he said, the European Union “should be coming forward with new ideas to promote growth, not undermine it.”And Glenn Hubbard, who was chairman of the under President , said the Robin Hood tax is a “monstrously bad idea.”“Such a tax isn’t really going to get at the banks,” added Mr. Hubbard, who is now an adviser to the Republican presidential candidate . “It’s going to hit the people who own the assets that are traded,” like investors.Supporters of a financial transactions tax note that Britain already imposes a levy of $50 per $10,000 of stocks traded, while and , with fast-growing financial markets, impose fees of $10 to $20 per $10,000 of the value of certain transactions.The United States imposed a tiny tax on stock trades from 1914 to 1966.The British actor , who has made online videos promoting the tax, calls it a beautiful idea. “It would raise enough money to solve problems at home and overseas, and it could do it without hurting ordinary people,” he said.'"

"'11-12-07,'1','Lagardère, based in Paris, declined to comment on the announcement, according to Bloomberg News.Simon & Schuster, in a statement, said it was “cooperating with the investigation.” Holtzbrinck did not immediately respond to an e-mail query, according to Bloomberg News.Similar concerns in the United States have already led to litigation.In August, Hagens Berman, a law firm, filed a class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, contending that the publishers and Apple increased prices for popular e-book titles to improve profits and force an e-book rival, Amazon, to abandon “pro-consumer discount pricing.”According to Hagens Berman, the “publishers believed that Amazon’s wildly popular Kindle e-reader device and the company’s discounted pricing for e-books would increase the adoption of e-books, and feared Amazon’s discounted pricing structure would permanently set consumer expectations for lower prices.”Until recently, a variety of retailers including large bookstore chains had the power to set the price of books.But that system began to change when the publishers, possibly with the help of Apple, whose popular iPad also serves as an e-book reader, took greater control over setting prices, according to European officials.Those changes may have kept the prices of e-books higher than they might otherwise have been in a fully competitive market, the officials said.The decision to open the case came after surprise inspections by European authorities at the offices of companies in the sector in March, and the commission said it would treat the case “as a matter of priority.”The decision also follows “a significant number of complaints” to the Office of Fair Trading in Britain.That office closed a similar investigation on Tuesday, saying in a statement that, “the European Commission is currently well placed to arrive at a comprehensive resolution of this matter.”European officials are now expected to investigate further to determine whether the five publishers, helped by Apple, deliberately set out to influence prices, and whether consumers have been paying too much for e-books.The European Commission can fine companies who violate the bloc’s competition rules up to 10 percent of their global annual sales, and it can require them to change business practices.'"

"'11-12-07,'1','The alternative, he said, was “a sea change in normal criminal law practices” that could require testimony from 10 analysts in a single case, pushing “the system in the direction of relying on less reliable eyewitness testimony rather than more reliable technical laboratory DNA-type evidence.”Tuesday’s case, Williams v. Illinois, No. 10-8505, arose from a sexual assault in Chicago. The defendant, Sandy Williams, was arrested on an unrelated charge and provided a DNA sample to the state police laboratory. A forensic scientist there analyzed it and later testified about Mr. Williams’s DNA profile at his trial on the sexual assault charges. So far, so good, Mr. Williams’s lawyers told the justices.The controversy in the case concerns the material recovered from the assault. It was analyzed by Cellmark Diagnostic Laboratory in Maryland, but the lab’s report was not entered into evidence at trial and no one from that lab appeared to testify about it. But an expert witness for the prosecution was allowed to offer her opinion that the two profiles matched.That appeared to trouble Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, which was something of a surprise, as he had written caustic dissents in the earlier decisions criticizing what he called the imposition of a crushing and needless burden on the nation’s criminal justice system.“The key actor in the play, the Hamlet in the play, is the person who did the test at Cellmark,” he said. “And she or he is not here.”Justice Kennedy referred to the court’s decision in June, Bullcoming v. New Mexico, which ruled that testimony from colleagues and supervisors uninvolved in the testing was not acceptable.“In Bullcoming, at least you had an expert say how the laboratory works,” Justice Kennedy said, in a tone approaching exasperation. “Here, you don’t even have that. You have less here with reference to Cellmark than you did in Bullcoming.”Michael R. Dreeben, a lawyer for the federal government, which supported the prosecutors in Tuesday’s case, said the confrontation clause need not figure in the court’s analysis, a position that seemed attractive to several justices.The failure to call a witness from Cellmark may have made the case against Mr. Williams “very weak,” Mr. Dreeben said, but it did not violate the Constitution.“We have a confrontation clause, which requires that the witnesses against the defendant appear and testify personally, and the crucial evidence here is the testing of the semen found on the swab,” he said. “That’s the crux of this evidence, and you’re telling me that this confrontation clause allows you to simply say, Well, we’re not going to bring in the person who did the test; we are simply going to say, ‘This is a reliable lab.’ ” Mr. Dreeben replied, “The confrontation clause, Justice Scalia, does not obligate the state to present a strong case.”'"

I will not make that mistake.”It could also irritate some American allies, including countries like , where there have been reports of harassment, and , where homosexuality is banned and sex between people of the same sex is punishable by death or flogging.Mrs. Clinton anticipated the sensitivity of the issue for some more conservative countries, saying that “the obstacles standing in the way of protecting the human rights” of lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgendered people “rest on deeply held personal, political, cultural and religious beliefs.”She argued that gay rights transcended national, political and even culture boundaries, casting them as universal rights like those adopted by 48 nations in the aftermath of World War II in what was called the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.Mrs. Clinton’s aides so worried about the reaction of some countries at the Human Rights Council that they did not advertise the theme of her remarks before she delivered them. In the end, no representatives from the council’s 47 member nations walked out, and the audience gave her a standing ovation.The administration’s announcement formalizes several steps that Mrs. Clinton has already ordered. She has asked American diplomats to raise the issue wherever harassment or abuse arises and required a record of them in the State Department’s annual report on human rights. On Tuesday, she also announced a $3 million program to finance gay-rights organizations to combat discrimination, violence and other abuses.A senior administration official said that the money could be used, for example, to finance a lawyers’ group that is defending gays or to pay for the training of journalists who cover the persecution of gays. It could also provide relocation aid to refugees fleeing violence or persecution.“I am deeply concerned by the violence and discrimination targeting L.G.B.T. persons around the world,” Mr. Obama said in the memorandum, referring to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people,  “whether it is passing laws that criminalize L.G.B.T. status, beating citizens simply for joining peaceful L.G.B.T. pride celebrations, or killing men, women and children for their perceived sexual orientation.”He said in the memorandum that the State Department would lead other federal agencies to help ensure that the government provided a “swift and meaningful response to serious incidents that threaten the human rights” of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people abroad.The administration’s directive, months in the planning, came after a series of legal steps taken against gay men and lesbians in countries like , where the Parliament reopened debate on legislation that would outlaw homosexuality and possibly make it punishable by death.The State Department’s latest human rights report, released in April, catalogued cases in dozens of countries.In , where the United States overthrew the in 2001 and installed a nominally democratic government, the law “criminalizes homosexual activity.” In , too, it is a crime, though rarely prosecuted, the report said.Homosexuality is accepted in most of , and an increasing number of countries have taken steps to end legal prohibitions. In , the government decriminalized homosexuality in 1997 and removed it from an official list of psychological disorders in 2001. Mrs. Clinton credited , , , and for taking steps to liberalize their laws.She also noted that, until 2003, sodomy was a crime in parts of the United States and that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people Americans “have endured violence and harassment in their lives.”As was the case with the initial declaration on human rights, which did not immediately abolish racist laws or social and political barriers for women or religious minorities, she said, the notion of human rights has gradually expanded to include all people. She dismissed the assertion of some that homosexuality is “a Western phenomenon.”“In reality, gay people are born into — and belong to — every society in the world,” she said.In countries “where people are jailed, beaten or executed for being gay,” she called on leaders to leap ahead of their constituents cultural or social mores, if necessary. “I’m not saying that gay people can’t or don’t commit crimes,” she said. “They can and do, just like straight people. And when they do, they should be held accountable. But it should never be a crime to be gay.”'"
"'11-12-07,'1','The final chaotic days of a chaotic N.B.A. off-season are winding down, with the league pushing to reopen business Friday after a flurry of last-minute negotiations and formalities.Negotiators for the league and the players union were working through the last of the so-called B-list issues on Tuesday. The goal was to have the labor deal ready for ratification by Wednesday, paving the way for training camps and free agency to start Friday.The players will vote first, through an electronic balloting that will begin at 6 p.m. Wednesday and end at 4 p.m. Thursday. The owners are expected to ratify the deal Thursday at a board of governors meeting in New York. The owners will also be voting on a plan to quadruple the league’s revenue-sharing pool.Assuming there are no hiccups along the way, training camps and free agency will open Friday morning. The season will start Dec. 25 with five games on national television.Players have been slowly trickling into team facilities for the last week, holding informal workouts while the league and the union worked to finish the labor deal, after a 149-day lockout. But coaches are barred from working with players until camps open.'"
"'11-12-07,'1','Lagardère, based in Paris, declined to comment on the announcement, according to Bloomberg News.Simon & Schuster, in a statement, said it was “cooperating with the investigation.” Holtzbrinck did not immediately respond to an e-mail query, according to Bloomberg News.Similar concerns in the United States have already led to litigation.In August, Hagens Berman, a law firm, filed a class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, contending that the publishers and Apple increased prices for popular e-book titles to improve profits and force an e-book rival, Amazon, to abandon “pro-consumer discount pricing.”According to Hagens Berman, the “publishers believed that Amazon’s wildly popular Kindle e-reader device and the company’s discounted pricing for e-books would increase the adoption of e-books, and feared Amazon’s discounted pricing structure would permanently set consumer expectations for lower prices.”Until recently, a variety of retailers including large bookstore chains had the power to set the price of books.But that system began to change when the publishers, possibly with the help of Apple, whose popular iPad also serves as an e-book reader, took greater control over setting prices, according to European officials.Those changes may have kept the prices of e-books higher than they might otherwise have been in a fully competitive market, the officials said.The decision to open the case came after surprise inspections by European authorities at the offices of companies in the sector in March, and the commission said it would treat the case “as a matter of priority.”The decision also follows “a significant number of complaints” to the Office of Fair Trading in Britain.That office closed a similar investigation on Tuesday, saying in a statement that, “the European Commission is currently well placed to arrive at a comprehensive resolution of this matter.”European officials are now expected to investigate further to determine whether the five publishers, helped by Apple, deliberately set out to influence prices, and whether consumers have been paying too much for e-books.The European Commission can fine companies who violate the bloc’s competition rules up to 10 percent of their global annual sales, and it can require them to change business practices.'"

"'11-12-08,'0','OAK BEACH, N.Y. (AP) — Clothing and other items belonging to a woman from New Jersey whose disappearance helped touch off an investigation into a killing spree on Long Island have been recovered near where she was last seen 18 months ago, the police said Wednesday.The Suffolk County police commissioner, Richard Dormer, said officers had not found any remains of the woman, Shannan Gilbert of Jersey City, a prostitute who was 24 when she disappeared, but said the search would resume on Thursday.The police were looking for Ms. Gilbert last December when they stumbled upon what would turn out to be remains of 10 people in underbrush along a beach highway on Jones Beach Island. Mr. Dormer and other police officials said they did not think the deaths of the 10 people and Ms. Gilbert’s disappearance were related.Detectives on Tuesday and Wednesday found Ms. Gilbert’s purse with a photo ID inside, her jeans and shoes, as well as a cellphone they believe she owned. They think she drowned.“It’s very easy to get engulfed with water, muck, and fall down and not be able to get out of there,” Mr. Dormer said.While the inquiry into Ms. Gilbert’s disappearance appeared to be coming to an end, homicide detectives still have 10 unsolved murder cases to contend with. The remains of the people — eight women, a man and a toddler — were found strewn mostly along a remote stretch of Ocean Parkway several miles long.'"
"'11-12-08,'0','In 2006, a Queens state senator, Shirley L. Huntley, set up a nonprofit group called Parent Workshop that was intended to help parents navigate the inner workings of New York City’s school system. Then she began funneling state aid to the group, whose executives had close ties to her.But the money never helped a single family in the school system, prosecutors said Wednesday.They said four people with ties to Parent Workshop were involved in the theft of nearly $30,000 in state aid that Ms. Huntley had secured.Indictments made public on Wednesday are evidence of a new effort by New York’s attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and its comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli, to crack down on public corruption.Senator Huntley, a Democrat, was not named in the indictment, and officials would not say whether she was under investigation. She would not comment on the charges.Two officers of Parent Workshop, Patricia D. Savage and Lynn H. Smith, are charged with submitting false vouchers to the state for work that was not performed and then keeping nearly $30,000 from the state, according to the indictment.'"
"'11-12-08,'0','Four color-coded varieties of juice boxes were lined up at the opening last week of Module R, a design store in Brooklyn filled with objects for people who can’t leave well enough alone.Movable, swappable elements make up items like the Tetrad Flat Shelving system, assembled from combinations of five units ($1,465 for the configuration pictured), and Shiro Kuramata’s spiraling cabinet for Cappellini ($3,411).

"'11-12-08,'0','Clients can choose from looks labeled with catchy names like the Siren (a 1920s-inspired wave) or the C.E.O. (a rosy lip with defined eyes that not long ago helped steel one Fortune 500 executive at 5 a.m. before ringing an opening bell on the stock exchange). A 90-minute session of daytime hair and makeup costs $250; more-complicated nighttime looks are $325.“Much of it is saving the women from themselves,” Ms. Platt said. “The looks keep them in check, and the makeup artists are on hand to talk them out of something that may not work.”Ms. Platt is one of several socialites who have crossed over from charity boards to the beauty industry (although at least one started in the business: Aerin Lauder, who, after coming of age at the company her grandmother founded, Estée Lauder, will introduce her own line of beauty products and other items, Aerin, next year).The likely role model for many of them, Gloria Vanderbilt, didn’t sell only derrière-enhancing jeans back in the 1970s, she also offered a fragrance that is still sold on Amazon.com.Olivia Chantecaille, an elegant, whippet-thin brunette often seen on NewYorkSocialDiary.com, is the creative director of Chantecaille, a successful skin-care and makeup line. Daphne Guinness, the heiress and aficionado of outlandish couture, will introduce a makeup collaboration with MAC Cosmetics on Dec. 26. And Julie Macklowe, 34, another hedge-fund veteran who attends many charity events, has founded vBeauté, a skin-care line that made its debut on Nov. 11.“Going out is always about networking,” Ms. Macklowe said, explaining her decision to capitalize on her social life. “A lot of the contacts in the fashion and beauty industry you make at events are invaluable. It takes years to build these relationships. I moved back to New York in 2002, and the relationships started then through my husband, my family and fashion events.”That husband is the real estate scion William Macklowe, a former husband of Tory Burch whom Ms. Macklowe married in 2004. But along with her prominent partnership, Ms. Macklowe herself had a 12-year career in finance, which included a stint under Steven A. Cohen, the hedge-fund luminary. She is bothered by the title “socialite.”“I always find the term somewhat funny, and in this day and age, a misnomer,” she said. “I just think of myself as a girl who works and who likes to go out. Especially in New York, most of the women I know from that scene also work. Sometimes it’s a little misogynist.”David Patrick Columbia, who chronicles the upper class on his blog, NewYorkSocialDiary.com, has observed social swans spreading their wings over the years. “A lot of these girls, they don’t need the money, but they need a profession,” he said. “I see beauty as a very profitable business.”But, he added: “I think a lot of it is marketing, and some think that socialite girls have the kind of reach that celebrities have. I’m not so sure that is true. Estée actually went out on the street and worked it.”No one could accuse Ms. Macklowe of being hands-off, though. She spent two years developing her line, which features a complex based on the Alpine rose. The cornerstone is the It Kit, a travel-size set of eye cream, cleanser, moisturizer, serum and exfoliator, priced at $165. Packaged in a dark silver case that could almost double as an expensive clutch, the kit is carried at Bergdorf Goodman, which will also exclusively sell the line’s full-size products. The set will appear in about 100 stores, including Kirna Zabête, Maxfield in Los Angeles and the Webster in Miami, over the next few weeks.“That is my personality; I don’t do things halfway,” Ms. Macklowe said, bright-eyed during a breakfast meeting at Balthazar, in SoHo. “I went to each retailer, one by one. You don’t work with Stevie Cohen without going all-in.”“In fashion, I’m very similar, I sometimes push it too far,” she said with a giggle. “I’ve made it on a couple worst-dressed lists. But I feel like it’s important to have fun with it, take risks.”Ms. Macklowe was wearing a pinstriped pantsuit that morning, but she’s better known for her attention-getting taste, like the royal blue sequined mini-dress with attached satin train that she wore to the New Yorkers for Children fall gala this September. On Nov. 17, she was honored with the Gay Men’s Health Crisis inaugural Style Vault award. “If the gay man approves, that’s the biggest compliment there is,” she said.The next morning, after training sales associates on her product line at Bergdorf Goodman, Ms. Macklowe worked at the counter like a high-end Avon lady for three hours. Wearing a knit Chanel dress, leather Chanel over-the-knee black boots and diamond stud earrings the size of dimes, she rattled off a scientific pitch (“to combat free radicals, it has biocellular peptides derived from the stem cells of Nicotiana sylvestris ...”) mixed with personal chitchat. She prattled on about her husband, who hates her new Mia Farrow circa “Rosemary’s Baby” haircut though her female friends love it, and explained that the “v” in the company name is for “victory over aging” while rubbing product on the back of a customer’s hand.Much of the work of selling socialite beauty, though, happens at night, when its proprietors go out and are photographed, offering their own built-in P.R. package.On the evening of Nov. 14, Ms. Platt was going over her company’s financials in a makeup chair at her office in the garment district, while a Vênsette artist worked on her nighttime look for the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund awards. There were partnerships with Lancôme and Estée Lauder to manage, as well as corporate clients like American Express, who have booked Vênsette for press events.Since its inception, despite the dismal economy, the company has grown by a steady 22 percent month over month, Ms. Platt said. A nail and manicure service is in the works, as is an online product shop edited by professional makeup artists.For the gala, Ms. Platt chose two of the company’s most popular options: the Siren hair style and the Grace Kelly makeup (a flick of black liquid eye liner and classic red lips). The site also offers more avant-garde choices like the Capri, a fashion-forward, slicked-back hairdo, which didn’t suit Ms. Platt but she kept on the menu anyway. “My boyfriend said I looked like Darth Vader’s daughter,” she said with a laugh.Celia Nichols, 34, vice president for marketing and communications at MaxMara, has booked appointments through Vênsette four times. “I met Lauren out socially maybe three or four years ago, and she told me about the company early on,” Ms. Nichols said on a Wednesday evening before her nighttime work events.Behind closed doors in Ms. Nichols’s office, also in the garment district, a cloud of fruity hair spray was hanging over her desk. Another Vênsette artist, Ryan B. Anthony, was curling her locks while she reviewed marketing printouts. “I keep going back because it’s really consistent,” she said. “What you pick is what you get, and we’re so busy, I can’t be bothered with hair and makeup after an entire day of work.”In a neat bit of back-scratching, MaxMara sometimes dresses Ms. Platt for events. Indeed, there is so much friendly overlap in the world of socialite beauty, it might be helpful to sketch the relationships on a cocktail napkin. Sarah Easley of Kirna Zabête knew of Ms. Macklowe through fashion-related events; Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, the fashion director at Lincoln Center, sits on vBeauté’s advisory board; Ms. Macklowe is friendly with Ms. Platt after meeting at various charity events.Meanwhile, Ms. Platt has partnered with Tata Harper, another well-connected entrepreneur known for her largely organic skin-care line. Vênsette artists will begin carrying Ms. Harper’s products this month, using her moisturizer and floral essence mist to help prepare clients’ skin before makeup application.Calling from a skin-care laboratory in New Jersey, Ms. Harper, 36, said, “I met Lauren through my sister-in-law Michelle Harper and another friend that we have in common, Fernanda Niven.” Both Michelle Harper and Ms. Niven are regulars on New York City’s event circuit.“They’ve always been part of my life — these girls who are very social,” Tata Harper said. “And they have been vital to my business. They do my word-of-mouth for me.” One of her business partners is Clarissa Bronfman, the wife of the billionaire Edgar Bronfman Jr., who has helped the company grow by an astounding 500 percent since January of this year, Ms. Harper said. A new distribution and work facility is under construction near Middlebury, Vt., where most of the company is based.To celebrate their new partnership, Ms. Platt and Ms. Harper hosted a cocktail party with Ms. Niven and Marina Rust, a Vogue contributing editor, at Bergdorf Goodman’s BG Restaurant on Nov. 29. Later, Ms. Platt posted images of the event on her company’s Facebook page.“Once the social girls understand and believe in your product and mission, they really get behind it,” Ms. Harper said. “Between them, they know a tremendous amount of people.”'"
"'11-12-08,'0','Mr. Mueller cites an Italian producer who suggests that 50 percent of the olive oil sold in America is, to some degree, fraudulent. The Food and Drug Administration considers this adulteration a low priority. Grody olive oil is not killing anyone. We’re talking about a first-world problem here. Caveat emptor.“Extra Virginity” suggests consumers put a priority on purchasing fresh olive oil, and taste before they buy. The good stuff is peppery and alive and, sipped neat, can make you cough. In the same way that many Americans have never tasted real maple syrup, not believing Aunt Jemima would do them wrong, many have no idea olive oil can be anything but a urine-colored and musty butter substitute.Mr. Mueller spends time with olive growers, with chemists, with cooks and with crooks. His history lessons are never less than interesting. He explains how olive oil was a driving force of life in the Mediterranean, a source of wealth and power. “A jug of olive oil on the dinner table,” he writes, “marked the triumph of Roman cuisine over barbarian beer and lard.”The Greeks anointed their athletes with olive oil, which could be rather sexy. Mr. Mueller quotes Tom Scanlon, a classics professor at the University of California, Riverside, who says: “The oil on a gleaming, tanned, healthy body was a literally ‘flashy’ adornment. Oil heightened the body’s erotic charge, and encouraged male same-sex desire and pederasty, first in Sparta, then throughout the Greek world.”Thomas Jefferson was among the first Americans to champion olive oil. He saw to it, Mr. Mueller writes, “that an olive branch, heavy with fruit, was placed in the talons of the eagle on the Great Seal of the United States.” Mario Puzo, in “The Godfather,” modeled Vito Corleone after a criminal olive oil boss named Joseph Profaci. Puzo even gave Corleone his own olive oil business, Genco Pura, as a front company.For all its provocative bits Mr. Mueller’s book feels unctuous — oil coated — right from the start. It is packed with so many heroic artisans and sentimental peasants that it feels like a dinner theater production of “Fiddler on the Roof” or a canvas by Thomas Kinkade, the “painter of light.”One man here has a “hint of wonder in his voice.” Another “laughed, high-pitched and merrily.” A woman has “almond-shaped eyes that seem to look straight into your soul.” This same woman has “a twinkle in her eye.” Throughout, it is as if we are reading about elves.Olive oil brings out Mr. Mueller’s inner Windham Hill pianist. Olive oil reveals, he suggests, people’s “secret passions and dreams.” He speaks of its “sacred and mythic dimensions.” He writes about one producer: “Alissa Mattei is another person olive oil has touched, bringing out her inner contradictions.”Mr. Mueller uses the words “wondrous” and “wondrously” in back-to-back sentences. A misdemeanor, but a telling one. When he inhales the scent of fresh oil, he reports that he has “aromas and aromatics dancing like angels in my nose.”There’s a second funny moment in “Extra Virginity” when a Swiss agronomist explains, succinctly, what great olive oil will make a person do. It will make you, he says, “get down on your knees” like a Baptist preacher and shout out a word that’s not printable in a family newspaper.That hollered obscenity reminds you that where there’s a flask of olive oil, you also pray to find some vinegar.'"
"'11-12-08,'0','HERITAGE, as much as denim designers love to throw that word around, is a hard thing to come by, particularly when you’re a new label. An antique wash and a whisker effect can make any pair of jeans look old, but is that heritage — or just a patina?You would be hard pressed to find jeans that are more about the business of heritage than those of Imogene + Willie, even though the label is less than three years old. In fact, the collection, which looks as folksy as if it had been painted by Grant Wood, is the second act of a family that once manufactured vintage-looking jeans for labels like Levi’s, Ernest Sewn, Rogan and RRL.Before starting the company, Matt and Carrie Eddmenson, who are 36 and 37, respectively, had worked for many years at Sights Denim Systems in Henderson, Ky.Sights, which grew out of Ms. Eddmenson’s paternal grandfather’s textile rental firm, developed denim styles for designers and at one point produced as many as 250,000 pairs of acid- and stonewashed jeans a week. But it closed in 2008, well after most denim manufacturing had moved offshore or to the West Coast.“We had been making bluejeans for 20 years,” Ms. Eddmenson said. “So what were we going to do? Make crepes? We started a mini version of the old company.”For seed money, the Eddmensons made 250 pairs of custom jeans for $100 each, raising enough capital to open a store in a former gas station in the 12South neighborhood of Nashville.'"
"'11-12-08,'0','In 2004, the business made a symbiotic move. To make referrals from one of the nation’s largest fertility clinics as easy and convenient as pointing a finger, Ms. Heller and Ms. Quinn relocated their business down the hall from Fertility Centers of Illinois, settling in on the ground level of a landmark building on Chicago’s Riverwalk. The floor-to-ceiling windows framed passing boats and Riverwalk strollers.A sublease with the fertility clinic at what they considered “really fair market value” seemed just as salubrious to the health of the business — until, that is, seven inches of rain swelled the Chicago River up over the walls of its engineered channel and throughout the clinic and Pulling Down the Moon, both located on the first floor.When Ms. Quinn and Ms. Heller arrived early on a Saturday morning, ready to mop, they were not terribly alarmed. The water was only about an inch deep. “It wasn’t like on TV, where you see it six feet deep and things are floating,” Ms. Quinn said. “It was like, everything will be O.K. Let’s light some candles, get the aromatherapy going.”But it was not O.K. The building’s drains and sewers backed up, adding to the inflow of river water. They were told it would take weeks, maybe months, of restoration work. This they knew: They had patients scheduled that day, and they owned a service business that tallied about 60 percent of its revenue from this now-unusable location.That morning, Ms. Heller called the doctors at an upstairs OB-GYN practice to ask if she could relocate some of Pulling Down the Moon’s operations and classes there temporarily. The upstairs doctors agreed, and yoga classes were held after hours in the reception area, with the furniture pushed aside. Ms. Quinn, meanwhile, e-mailed everyone in her local Women Presidents’ Organization, asking: “Do you know of a space where we can live?”The business was lucky in other respects. Only one computer was ruined by the flood, and no data was lost because the company had no on-site servers. Patient information and schedules had been saved on the Web by outside providers.Seven days later, Pulling Down the Moon moved into loft space a half-mile away. Not only was the search for a short-term lease made easier by the recession-fueled glut of commercial real estate, the relocation was smoothed by an operations manual the women had written to make the business scalable — one already road-tested by the opening of the company’s satellite centers.Similarly, they were well served by having paid sufficient attention to business insurance when they founded the company. A business-interruption rider paid for the move to temporary quarters and reimbursed the ailing company month by month for lost revenue as patient visits slid by as much as 30 percent. Initially, it looked like all restoration costs would be covered by their general liability coverage. But the flood uncovered an overlooked potential downside to subleasing: being beholden to your landlord’s disaster response, as if riding on the rear seat of a bicycle built for two.Assessing the extensive damage to its quarters, Fertility Centers of Illinois decided the time was right to redesign its space and brought Ms. Heller and Ms. Quinn into the process, which meant moving their subleased quarters. This delayed the build-out and ended up costing Pulling Down the Moon an extra $60,000 because its insurance covered only the restoration of existing walls, not the building of new ones. The owners considered making a permanent move, Ms. Heller said, “but we decided that we have this partnership with the doctors, and it’s a big part of our market strategy.”It took until mid-January, four and a half months after the flood, for Pulling Down the Moon to return to its Riverwalk home. The symbiotic relationship with the fertility clinic was re-established. Then, six months later, on the eve of the one-year anniversary of the flood, another storm sent water into the first floor of the building. This time the damage was not as bad, and the company was able to stay put while waiting for wallboard replacement and restoration work. But once again, Pulling Down the Moon’s co-owners had to ask patients to put up with inconveniences until repairs were made.

Why burden yourself with the uncertainty, lying in bed on a stormy night, that your business may not survive?”Donna Childs, author of a book about disaster preparedness: “The answer to the question of should they move to a new location is to be found in the mission of the business, providing stress-reducing yoga to aid fertility. Disruptions are stressful.”Frank N. Darras, founding partner of DarrasLaw, an Ontario, Calif., firm specializing in insurance law said that “Pulling Down the Moon enjoys 60 percent of its profit from their flagship headquarters location by being strategically located across the hall from the fertility clinic. With rent described as ‘really fair market,’ it’s hard to imagine moving despite two floods.”He added: “Unlike 77 percent of small-business owners who have never heard of business-interruption insurance, purchased to recover lost profits due to loss of use or access, these smart insurance consumers had the right coverage in place.”THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on the decision on the You’re the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss.

"'11-12-08,'0','A statement from Scotland Yard said the 41-year-old man, who remained unidentified by the police on Wednesday, was arrested in London at 7 a.m. “on suspicion of conspiring to intercept voice mail messages” and of perverting the course of justice. Mr. Mulcaire’s lawyer, Sarah Webb, declined to comment when reached by telephone shortly after the reports identifying him as the suspect emerged.The police and government inquiries have uncovered not only widespread phone hacking, but also police bribery and political connections all the way to the prime minister’s office. Two top police officers have been forced to resign. Mr. Murdoch and his son James closed the 168-year-old News of the World, were called before Parliament, and withdrew their $12 billion bid for a British satellite company under public pressure. Prime Minister David Cameron has been questioned over his hiring of a former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson, as his spokesman. Mr. Coulson is among those arrested.So far, suspects have been released on bail after being questioned, but some, including Mr. Coulson, will face further questioning and perhaps charges.The arrest came a week after a 31-year-old woman was detained in the same inquiry in the northeast of England. Scotland Yard declined to identify her, but the BBC and other British media identified her as Bethany Usher, a former News of the World reporter who is a lecturer in journalism at Teesside University. In a statement, she denied the hacking allegations.“I worked for national newspapers between 2005 and 2008, spending two of those years at The News of the World, working largely on the road in the north of England,” Ms. Usher said. “At no time did I work in the Wapping office and I had little contact with other colleagues.” The newspaper’s head office was in Wapping.“I have never been involved in the interception of telecommunications in any way and strictly adhered to the Press Complaints Commission code of practice,” she added, referring to the regulations of British journalism. “However, I became disillusioned through working with some who saw human suffering simply as fodder to fill pages. As such, I made the decision to find an alternative career.”In late November, the police announced the arrest of a 52-year-old man, the first in a related investigation into computer hacking. He has not been identified by name, but was granted bail until December.According to Britain’s Press Association news agency, Scotland Yard detectives are combing through 300 million e-mails from News International, a British media subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch’s News Corporation global empire.'"

"'11-12-09,'1','Until three changes are made, he said, “We won’t support a nominee for this bureau — regardless of who the president is.”One of those changes would put a board in charge of overseeing the bureau instead of the director, abolishing the post. Others would subject the agency to the Congressional appropriations process, giving lawmakers more sway over its policies, and would give other financial regulatory agencies a check on its rules.Senator of , a Democrat, said that the opponents’ “first loyalty is to Wall Street .”The agency can accomplish part of its mission, the protection of consumers from unscrupulous lending practices, without having a director in place. But some of its new powers are vested by law in the director, so it could not expand into realms like the regulation of payday lenders and other nonbank financial businesses.The power struggle between the financial sector and its check-cashing, card-carrying customers has developed into one of the fault lines along which the political parties are playing out their own rivalries as the election year arrives.Previous opposition from Republicans led to the withdrawal of from consideration for the post. She is a law professor who was the driving force behind the agency’s creation and is now a Democratic candidate for the in .Opposite her, in ideological terms, are those in Congress who say the real problem is not so much the need to regulate the financial world as to rein in the Washington regulators.“This is not about the nominee, who appears to be a decent person and may very well be qualified,” said Senator , Republican of , according to the Associated Press. “It’s about a process that is running out of control.”Senator of , the majority leader, called it “the first time in Senate history a party blocked a qualified nominee solely because it disagrees with the existence of an agency that was created by law, through a bipartisan vote.”Democrats have accused the Republicans of reneging on the painstakingly wrought compromises that brought the consumer board into existence as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law of 2010.Mr. Cordray, a five-time Jeopardy champion, is a former attorney general of Ohio noted for his aggressive investigations of foreclosure practices. Currently in charge of enforcement at the consumer agency, he was nominated in July to lead it.In his confirmation hearings in September, he told a Senate committee that he would make it a priority “to streamline and cut back” a mountain of burdensome regulations that discourage banks from lending to consumers. But that stance, intended to reassure Republicans on the committee, did not mollify them. At a time when Congressional Republicans have been opposing most of the administration’s approaches to regulations, the economy and presidential appointments, Mr. Cordray’s prospects were never better than bleak.President Obama, in a speech in Kansas this week on economic policy that was laden with populist overtones, singled out Thursday’s Senate vote for attention and said he would veto any legislation undoing consumer protections in the world of finance.“Does anyone here think the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors? Of course not,” he said.“Financial institutions have plenty of lobbyists looking out for their interests,” he said. “Consumers deserve to have someone whose job it is to look out for them. I intend to make sure they do, and I will veto any effort to delay, defund or dismantle the new rules we put in place.”'"

"'11-12-09,'1','Mark Braun had just landed at San Francisco International Airport after a business trip to Florida. But rather than heading directly back to his home in Burlingame, he found himself lingering. “Normally I’m ready to get out of here,” he said, standing next to his roller bag.Like hundreds of passengers that evening, Mr. Braun stayed at the airport for an unusual reason: to be entertained.Although the airport has an extensive program of art exhibitions — it’s the only airport in the country with an accredited museum — and presents live music during the winter holiday and summer seasons, last Friday night featured something special: a free performance by DJ Qbert, the legendary hip-hop artist and turntable master.Dressed in a blue plaid shirt, jeans and bright red Giants cap, Qbert, or Richard Quitevis, a San Francisco native, used the mezzanine level of the grand lobby of the recently remodeled Terminal 2 as his stage. He played his signature free-form scratch over funk, hip-hop and other beats on two STR8-150 turntables with people watching behind him and in the vast hall down below.It was “a groundbreaking event,” said Nicole Mullen, associate curator of exhibitions, who estimated the crowd at 250 to 300.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','¶ The Land Use and Economic Development Committee of the Board of Supervisors will consider legislation next week to regulate professional dog walkers, an industry that has flourished in the dog boom, but has also drawn complaints for damage to parks, where packs of dogs are routinely unleashed.¶ Proposals are expected to move forward in 2012 for the Golden Gate National Recreation Area — national park land within the city that includes Crissy Field, Fort Funston and Ocean Beach — that would greatly reduce off-leash play areas, because of dogs’ impact on natural habitats and species.¶ A similar plan by the San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department to protect “natural areas” in city parks is also moving ahead, which could reduce existing off-leash dog play acreage by 14 percent or more.¶ And in the city’s suddenly tight apartment market, rentals that allow dogs have become increasingly rare. As a result, advocates for pets are expected to lobby city leaders next year to change rental laws to remove illegal pet ownership as a “just cause” for eviction — essentially allowing renters to defy leases and have dogs, even if they signed contracts agreeing not to. Landlords would most likely fight such a change.“More and more people are wanting pets,” said Bruce Wolfe, president of DogPAC, a pro-dog political action committee, who favors the rental law change.An estimated one-third of San Francisco households now have dogs, which means two-thirds of households don’t. By all accounts, the city is undergoing a period of adjustment as it tries to accommodate both groups.“What happens with social change is that you experience a backlash,” said Sally Stephens, chairwoman of San Francisco Dog Owners Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for responsible dog ownership. “There are people who don’t understand the place that dogs have in our community.”Ms. Stephens said that because so many San Francisco residents are new arrivals, and often single, dogs had become a powerful bonding force for people who might otherwise be lonely. “The dog park is an amazing way to connect with people,” she said.Ms. Stephens acknowledged that some dogs were mishandled.When I recounted a recent incident I saw of a dog eating food off shelves in Safeway as its owner idly watched, she agreed that such episodes had been a source of animosity toward dogs. However, she considered these problems rare.But many of the impending conflicts, especially those involving parks, show that the increase in dog ownership has clashed with one of the city’s most highly prized tenets: appreciation for the natural environment. Efforts to preserve indigenous habitats and species go back decades, predating the current dog craze.But even as the city rolls out environmental plans that call for reducing some off-leash play areas in city parks, it also seems willing to accommodate its canine residents. Dog play areas will be added in new places like Rincon Hill, a once-desolate part of SoMa that has been newly developed as a residential area (as people arrived, so did their dogs).It is an indication, despite the growing signs of a pushing back, that dogs ultimately still have plenty of clout here.“The dog community is an economic factor in this city,” Mr. Wolfe said. “You don’t see pet shops closing.”'"
"'11-12-09,'1','Called the “leaker in chief” for his aggressive approach to spinning reporters when he was the White House chief of staff, Mayor Rahm Emanuel is a voracious and careful reader of the news. He has even remarked on the tweeting habits of the City Hall press corps.In replacing Richard M. Daley in May, Mr. Emanuel inherited a small army of spin doctors: almost 50 employees whose jobs involve the news media and public relations. But he has made modest cuts to this staff, just as he has thinned the ranks of other management-level employees. And this week, his communications director, Chris Mather, initiated an audit of city communications practices with an eye toward further payroll reductions.On Thursday morning, the mayor’s press office sent a questionnaire to Mr. Emanuel’s cabinet members and to the heads of the city’s sister agencies, including the Chicago Public Schools, the Chicago Housing Authority and the Chicago Transit Authority, Ms. Mather said. It seeks to quantify how much time officials spend handling inquiries from reporters, responding to requests for public documents and tracking what has been published about the administration. Other questions center on the methods, including social media, that officials use to reach the public.The results, Ms. Mather predicted, would help the mayor “eliminate redundancies and coordinate efforts to save taxpayers money.”Under his predecessor, even as the city laid off hundreds of front-line workers to plug record budget deficits, the spin machine grew to more than 50 employees, with total salaries of almost $5 million in 2008, according to The Chicago Tribune.The Daley administration also paid millions of dollars for the services of private public relations firms that promoted mayoral initiatives like the blue-bag recycling program, now abandoned, and the effort to help homeowners renovate bungalows. After initially defending contracts with public relations firms, Mr. Daley responded to aldermen’s complaints by rescinding deals awarded in 2008.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','The question of whether these contraceptives, which use a newer synthetic form of progestin called drospirenone, can make women more prone to blood clots has been a subject of debate. Studies have shown differing results. Bayer, the German company that makes the drugs, has said that they pose no greater threat than other contraceptive pills, all of which somewhat elevate the risk of stroke and blood clots in the legs and lungs.The company has said that studies that show otherwise contain methodological flaws that undercut the strength of their results.But other recent research has suggested that drospirenone may somewhat increase the risk of blood clots. An F.D.A. analysis reported that about 10 in 10,000 women taking pills with drospirenone will experience a blood clot or venous thromboembolism in a year, compared with 6 in 10,000 women using other hormonal contraceptives.And a study of 1.3 million Danish women published in October in the journal BMJ found that women taking Yaz or Yasmin had double the risk of blood clots, compared with women taking the older contraceptives.Before Thursday’s meeting, an F.D.A. briefing document acknowledged that studies had yielded conflicting results and said new studies were needed. But the scientists recommended that labels on the pills should be changed to inform the public of possible risks.Although the agency could not determine whether the increased risk resulted from use of the drugs or some other cause, “we believe that, because of the consistency in recent reports for an increased risk, product labeling should reflect that very real possibility,” the scientists wrote.More than 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against Bayer claiming that women have been harmed by taking Yaz or Yasmin, including accusations of about 100 deaths linked to the contraceptives.In documents released recently in those lawsuits, David Kessler, a former F.D.A. commissioner working as an expert witness for the plaintiffs, said that Bayer researchers found increased reports of blood clots in women using Yasmin in the United States, compared with those using three other pills, but did not provide that information to the F.D.A. in a 2004 safety review.“Bayer presented a selective view of the data, and that presentation obscured the potential risks associated with Yasmin,” Dr. Kessler testified. He also said the company promoted the pill for alleviating premenstrual syndrome, when it was not approved for that use.Dr. Pamela A. Cyrus, a vice president for Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, said on Thursday that Bayer had consistently worked with the F.D.A. and other regulatory authorities around the world as new data have become available, had worked with the agencies to make label updates as appropriate and “will continue to do so.”Bayer said it would not comment on Dr. Kessler’s testimony because it is part of continuing litigation.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','The energy industry has long stressed that fracking and water contamination have never been definitively linked.“When considered together with other lines of evidence, the data indicates likely impact to ground water that can be explained by hydraulic fracturing,” the draft study said. And perhaps just as crucially, the evidence also suggested that seepage of natural gas itself had increased around the drilling sites.“Data suggest that enhanced migration of gas has occurred within ground water at depths used for domestic water supply,” said the draft study, which will now be sent for scientific peer review and public comment.A spokesman for Encana Oil & Gas (USA), which bought the Pavillion field in 2004 and drilled some of the approximately 169 wells there, said the E.P.A.’s science was inconclusive. Encana’s parent company is based in Calgary.“What we have here is not a conclusion, but a probability — and based on the facts, not a good probability,” said Doug Hock, the company’s spokesman. He said that enhanced migration of gas as a result of drilling was unlikely in the Pavillion field, since drilling had reduced pressure in the underlying rock, thus reducing forces that can lead to gas seepage. And finding methane and benzene in two deep test wells drilled for the study, he said, is what you would expect in a gas-rich zone.“Encana didn’t put those there, nature did,” he said.The governor of Wyoming, Matt Mead, also said in a statement that the E.P.A.’s conclusions were “scientifically questionable” and not based on enough data. Mr. Mead, a Republican, called for more testing by the E.P.A., in conjunction with a state group of residents, state and federal agencies, and Indian tribes already at work looking into questions about Pavillion’s water supply.Wyoming, which is dependent on oil and gas drilling, along with coal mining, as anchors of its economy, will also be among the peer reviewers of the E.P.A.’s draft, the governor’s statement said. The chairman of a local Pavillion residents’ group — about 200 people, mostly involved in farming and ranching, who live in proximity to the drilling sites — expressed gratitude to the E.P.A., and perhaps a bit of veiled doubt about the zeal of local and state regulators.“This investigation proves the importance of having a federal agency that can protect people and the environment,” said John Fenton, the chairman of Pavillion Area Concerned Citizens. “Those of us who suffer the impacts from the unchecked development in our community are extremely happy the contamination source is being identified.”Gas drilling, using both hydraulic fracturing to release gas and horizontal drilling techniques that can snake underground far from the actual bore holes, is now moving into closer proximity to American population centers than in the past.From the suburbs of Denver to Pennsylvania and Oklahoma, natural gas reserves, known about but previously unreachable for economic and technological reasons, are being tapped, and anxieties about the hydraulic injection process and its consequences are growing. Wyoming, in 2010, became one of the first states to require petroleum companies or their contractors to disclose the ingredients in their specially formulated fracking fluids. The E.P.A. has also begun a national study on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','Recent offerings from the distributor China Lion, which specializes in mainstream Chinese movies — “Beginning of the Great Revival,” “The Butcher, the Chef and the Swordsman” — have tended to be blustery, leaden or galumphing affairs. Its latest bid to beat Hollywood at its own game, the fantasy “Magic to Win,” has, for all its derivative special effects and conceits, an agreeable light-footedness (a clue to its Hong Kong, not mainland, provenance). Its buoyancy may not redeem its predictability, but it makes the movie bearable and even enjoyable at times.A professor (Raymond Wong) has unlocked the unused potential of the human brain and joined a circle of people with supernatural abilities — call it wizardry, superpowers, whatever — telekinesis in particular. A chance collision passes those gifts to Macy (Karena Ng), an adorable college volleyball player, offering abundant opportunities for digital tricks on the court. But Bi Ye Wu (Wu Jing), a sinister practitioner of said abilities, plans to travel in time and rewrite the past. The hunky Ling Feng (Wu Chun), an amnesiac victim of Bi, challenges him, enlisting Macy in his quest.O.K., now forget all that and go with the flow: take the athletic milieu of “Bring It On,” mix it with Hogwartsy academia, toss in a shamelessly pilfered light saber from “Star Wars” and relax.

"'11-12-09,'1','OKATIE, S.C. — Gov. Rick Perry of Texas’ hard turn the past two days on gay issues, in which he has suggested that gay rights are inconsistent with both American and Christian values, has generated enormous criticism from lesbian and gay organizations and some religious groups, and has even helped split Mr. Perry’s top campaign aides over a new ad.In that campaign ad, released on Wednesday, Mr. Perry says “you don’t need to be in the pew every Sunday” to know it is wrong that gay men and lesbians openly serve in the military at a time when there is no organized prayer in public schools.Internally, a top Perry campaign adviser, Tony Fabrizio, was critical of the ad. A Perry aide did not deny division inside the campaign over the commercial — a split first reported by The Huffington Post — but chalked it up to the “occasionally salty” and robust interchanges between advisers.The ad came a day after Mr. Perry stood out in attacking as “silly” a new Obama administration initiative using diplomatic efforts and foreign aid to promote gay rights around the world and beat back efforts in other nations to criminalize homosexual conduct and persecute gays. This policy, Mr. Perry contended, was an “example of an administration at war with people of faith in this country.”Perry aides said neither the criticism of Mr. Obama nor the new ad were intended to be anti-gay, nor were they coordinated; they said that the ad had been in the works for weeks and that they had no advance notice of the administration’s new policy.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','A federal agency announced Thursday that it had found no evidence that decades of live fire and bombing exercises by the Navy on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques had caused health problems documented among its residents.The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, part of the Department of Health and Human Services, released the results of a review that confirmed a conclusion reached by the agency in 2003 that heavy metals and explosive compounds in the island’s soil, groundwater, air and fish posed no health hazards.Citing “gaps in environmental data,” the agency had agreed in 2009 to review the earlier finding after that report drew fierce criticism from Puerto Rican government officials and some members of Congress.Agency officials said they had reviewed environmental, biological and health data from Vieques in their inquiry, including some new studies. Still, they conceded that “limitations” in the information made it hard to interpret research that has found a higher incidence of chronic diseases like high blood pressure, diabetes and cancer in the island’s population by comparison with the rest of Puerto Rico.“A.T.S.D.R. understands that Viequenses are concerned about serious health problems on the island and that they want to know if these health effects are related to U.S. military testing from previous decades,” Christopher J. Portier, the agency’s director, said in a statement. “We believe that Viequenses are right to be concerned about their health.”'"
"'11-12-09,'1','New York’s legislators began arriving in Albany on Tuesday morning, and, by late Wednesday night, the Legislature had voted to revamp the entire state income tax code. The Senate voted less than half an hour after Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s 19,000 word bill was made public. As for the voters and taxpayers? They were out of the loop.The governor’s plan, which drew only eight no votes from the entire Legislature, will raise about $2 billion next year, less than half as much money as the so-called millionaires’ tax that expires at the end of December. It also means that the state will still face a deficit of at least $1.5 billion next year.Mr. Cuomo’s main pitch is that this new tax structure benefits the middle class. But most New Yorkers will see only very modest tax cuts. The biggest break goes to those with taxable income from about $300,000 to $2 million a year — their taxes will drop to 6.85 percent from as much as 8.97 percent. (That really stretches the concept of “middle class.” )At a press conference after the voting, Mr. Cuomo dismissed criticism by good-government groups for failing to allow full public debate. And, as for legislators, he said that if any had not been thinking about state tax policy, “then that is a person who shouldn’t be serving in the Legislature.”That is not the point, of course. Everybody has thought about taxes. It is the specifics of tax law that matter, not the generalities.Governor Cuomo is certainly getting things done. We assume he was just kidding last month when he told a radio interviewer, “I am the government” of New York State.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','With only a week to go before Congress adjourns for the holidays, Congress has yet to renew federal unemployment benefits or the payroll tax cut that will expire at year-end. Unfortunately, Republican leaders seem far more interested in advancing their partisan aims than helping millions of struggling American families.The House leadership weighed in on Thursday with a particularly bad proposal. It would extend the current payroll tax cut but gradually reduce the duration of unemployment benefits. And it proposes to pay for both with changes to social spending programs and by freezing pay for federal workers. The bill is also larded up with deplorable amendments, including one that would weaken clean air rules and another that would rush ahead with a potentially dangerous pipeline from .In the Senate, the debate has focused on how to pay for a renewal of the payroll tax cut. Democrats want a surtax on incomes over $1 million a year. Republican leaders, wrapping themselves in a populist mantle, claim the surcharge would hurt small businesses and the economy since small businesses are “job creators.”Research shows that a mere 1 percent of small business owners make more than $1 million per year. Only about 5.4 million of the nation’s 20 million small businesses pay any wages at all. The Republican claim about wealthy small business job creators, it turns out, is based on a convenient and overly broad definition of “small” that includes partnerships and S-corporations, like hedge funds, accounting firms, law practices and other often big businesses.So when they claim to be protecting small business from high-end , Republicans are really talking about protecting big companies whose owners fall into the one-half of 1 percent of taxpayers who are millionaires or better. A surtax would certainly not hurt them.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','The machinists’ union at Boeing asked the National Labor Relations Board to drop a complaint against the company after union members approved a new four-year contract that increases production in Seattle and averts the risk of a third consecutive strike.About 74 percent supported the contract on Wednesday in a ballot among 31,000 union members, mostly in the Seattle area, who accepted the surprise proposal unveiled last week.Boeing plans to increase output by 60 percent after four union walkouts since 1989 delayed hundreds of deliveries. Workers were promised that a revamped 737 jet would be built at a current factory near Seattle, and the union requested that the N.L.R.B. retract the complaint filed over a new 787 plant in South Carolina.The faltering relationship between the plane maker and its largest union reached a low point two years ago, when Boeing decided to build its first commercial assembly plant outside the Puget Sound area, where the company was founded in 1916.The union complained to the N.L.R.B. after company executives said that the new 787 factory in South Carolina would avoid walkouts in Washington. The new plant is not unionized. After an investigation, the labor board accused Boeing of violating workers’ federally protected right to strike.The N.L.R.B. has said it would consider the union’s request for a dismissal of the case.Workers will get a 2 percent raise each year of the contract, a new performance-based incentive program and a $5,000 ratification bonus that will be paid this month.

"'11-12-09,'1','Whether you cherish the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center’s presentations of Bach’s “Brandenburg” Concertos during its annual Baroque Festival as a developing holiday tradition or dismiss them as an easy out, you know pretty much what to expect (this year on Dec. 18 and 20).But there was nothing so easy or predictable about the concert that opened the festival on Tuesday evening at Alice Tully Hall. The program, conceived by John Harbison, the society’s “season composer,” consisted of four relatively unfamiliar and austere Bach sacred cantatas.Mr. Harbison took an interest in Bach cantatas as a child and nurtured it over the decades, working with the Bach Society Orchestra at Harvard and the Cantata Singers and Emmanuel Music in Boston. His involvement with the works extends beyond supplying finishing touches to sketchy scores, as needed, to a hands-on involvement with the texts. The first work in the program, the Cantata No. 12, “Weinen, Klagen, Sorgen, Zagen,” was presented in Mr. Harbison’s English translation, as “Weeping, Crying, Sobbing, Sighing.”An intense preoccupation with texts might seem paradoxical coming from a composer, but Mr. Harbison begs to differ. “The idea of translation comes from being a composer,” he said in a preconcert discussion. Composers want listeners to “follow word by word,” he said, an experience “different from looking over a bridge.”A second cantata — No. 163, “Nur Jedem das Seine” — was presented in an English translation by Ann Harleman, “To Each One His Own.” Those two works date from Bach’s time in Weimar (1708-17), and all four set texts by Salomo Franck, a poet (the best Bach ever worked with, Mr. Harbison said) and the director of the mint at the ducal court there.The performances, using four vocal soloists — Erin Morley, soprano; Phyllis Pancella, mezzo-soprano; John Tessier, tenor; Eric Owens, bass-baritone — and shifting handfuls of instrumentalists, were mostly appealing. The two violinists, Cho-Liang Lin and Yura Lee, alternated as effective leaders.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','“I would never talk about that publicly,” Blue Jays General Manager Alex Anthopoulos said. “Obviously, he is a very talented pitcher, and I think it’s good for baseball if he comes to pitch here, but I would not comment any more than that.”The Yankees, who could use a front-end pitcher for their rotation, just won the posting bid for the 29-year-old Japanese shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima, but for a modest $2.5 million. No one knows what it will take to win the posting auction for Darvish, but many in baseball say it will be at least $30 million, and perhaps significantly more.Will that number scare off the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, despite their financial resources? It might. The Yankees had a disastrous experience when they signed Kei Igawa from Japan to a five-year, $20 million contract, in addition to the $26 million posting fee. Igawa spent the great portion of that contract in the minor leagues.And the Red Sox had only mixed results when they spent lavishly to sign Daisuke Matsuzaka. Boston won the posting in November 2006 with a bid of $51,111,111.11, then signed him to a five-year, $50 million contract, so the entire venture cost more than $100 million.Matsuzaka helped the Red Sox win the 2007 World Series and went 18-3 with a 2.90 earned run average in 2008, but his years in Boston since then have been marked by miscommunication, frustration and injury.Considering what occurred with Igawa and Matsuzaka, it might be too daunting for the Yankees to commit tens of millions of dollars to acquire a pitcher whose talents are not a lock to translate to the United States.So far, the Yankees’ interest in Darvish has seemed lukewarm. On Thursday, Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman talked about the crucial aspect of timing, and referred to the years when free agents like Carlos Beltran and Carlos Delgado wanted to go to the Yankees, but the Yankees had no need for them with Bernie Williams and Jason Giambi.In this instance, the Yankees are actually concerned about money and the financial incentives the new collective bargaining agreement will provide down the road if they can get their payroll under a $189 million threshold. A long-term contract for Darvish would not help that goal.“He’s an extremely talented player,” Cashman said. “I don’t think that’s in dispute. But in terms of how it transitions and everything like that, I wouldn’t want to speculate. But obviously, he’s got a great deal of ability.”In seven years with Hokkaido, Darvish has gone 93-38 with a career 1.99 E.R.A. This season, he went 18-6 with a 1.44 E.R.A. and 276 strikeouts.He has not had an E.R.A. over 1.88 since 2006, and has major star power and charisma in Japan, so there could be a marketing aspect to his signing as well.Although the Red Sox feel somewhat stung by the Matsuzaka experience, the addition of Bobby Valentine as manager could increase the likelihood that they will submit a meaningful bid.Valentine managed three years against Darvish in Japan, is at home with Japanese baseball and could help make the transition to the United States easier for him.The Rangers are the consensus leading candidates, especially with the loss of Wilson.Although Wilson believes Texas’ relatively low offer to him indicates a reluctance to spend, it may mean that the team, which had two Japanese pitchers on its roster last year, is more interested in signing Darvish.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','Spent batteries house up to 40 pounds of lead, which can cause , and in adults, and serious developmental delays and behavioral problems in young children because it interferes with neurological development. When batteries are broken for recycling, the lead is released as dust and, during melting, as lead-laced emissions.Lead battery recyclers in the United States now operate in sealed, highly mechanized plants — like labs working with dangerous germs. Their smokestacks are fitted with scrubbers, and their perimeters are surrounded by lead-monitoring devices.But for much of the past decade, at the vast recycling compound of Industrial Mondelo here, batteries have been dismantled by men wielding hammers, and their lead melted in furnaces whose smokestacks vent to the air outside, where lead particles can settle everywhere from schoolyards to food carts. Officials of the plant, which has been given more than a dozen citations and fines for lead emissions and improper storage of dangerous materials, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.The recycling factory has put a neighborhood of children at serious risk of lead exposure, said Marisa Jacott, director of Fronteras Comunes, an environmental group in Mexico City. Ms. Jacott wants to test young residents living near the plant but lacks the money to do so. The town’s elementary school is on the same block as the recycling plant, which recently moved the bulk of its operations to a larger facility elsewhere. Lead pollution remains in the ground for decades.A sample of soil collected by The Times in the schoolyard showed a lead level of 2,000 parts per million, five times the limit for children’s play areas in the United States set by the Environmental Protection Agency. In most states, that would rate as a “significant environmental lead hazard” and require immediate remediation, like covering the area with concrete or disposing of the soil.“If we export, we should only be sending batteries to countries with standards as strict as ours, and in Mexico that is not the case,” said Perry Gottesfeld, executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, a group devoted to reducing lead exposure.While Mexico does have some regulation for smelting and recycling lead, the laws are poorly enforced and even licensed plants are allowed to release about 20 times as much lead as their American equivalents, said Mr. Gottesfeld, who has studied the export trade.Some American companies recycling in Mexico say that they already exceed that country’s requirements and that they intend to bring their Mexican plants up to American standards. But there is no way to ensure that will happen. The E.P.A. says it “does not inspect, monitor or verify the Mexican facilities.”Which is why doctors and teachers in Mexico are demanding testing in a country that has little or none. At her community clinic on the outskirts of , Dr. Lourdes Pérez Ramírez said that she routinely saw children with seriously delayed development and that she was convinced that lead poisoning from a nearby recycling plant might play a role, although she cannot prove it, because studies have not been done. “I think there is danger from the lead,” she said, “but to find it you have to look. You have to look!”Although lead batteries have long been classified as hazardous waste, the E.P.A. only last year began requiring that American companies report their exports — but already, even that minimal system is not achieving the agency’s goal of safer recycling. Exporters must estimate how many batteries they intend to transfer out of the country in the coming year and specify the recipient plant. That paperwork is sent to Semarnat, the Mexican counterpart to the E.P.A., which is responsible for accepting or rejecting the shipments. In 2010, Semarnat never refused.Then each March, American companies are supposed to tally how many batteries were actually sent, but this year only 3 out of 10 exporters complied.The E.P.A. declined to speak publicly on the export trade, instead explaining in a statement that its role was “limited to processing” the paperwork for the new battery tracking system.Many people familiar with the industry said more needed to be done.“We’re shipping hazardous waste to a neighbor ill equipped to process it and we’re doing it legally, turning our heads, and pretending it’s not a problem,” said Robert Finn, chief executive of RSR, a -based lead recycler that operates solely in the United States, and is concerned about the loss of raw materials to Mexico.Sergio Herrera, deputy director for industrial inspection at the Mexican legal agency that oversees environmental compliance, known as Profepa, said regulating the battery trade was an “important priority,” but early efforts to control it have mostly exposed the daunting size of the task. A recent government survey found that 19 of 20 recycling plants did not have proper authorization for importing dangerous waste, including batteries. And a retrospective review of truck manifests turned up 142 illegal shipments containing millions of spent car batteries that had not been detected at the border.Acumuladores de Jalisco, the recycling plant near Dr. Pérez Ramírez’s clinic, operates without the proper authorization to recycle imports and when it was last inspected in 2006, was found to lack storage for even “one fifth of the hazardous waste it generates.” Yet there is no record of any fine, or follow-up, which Mr. Herrera called “a deficiency on our part in not verifying our procedures.” The recycler did not respond to repeated interview requests.Along the border, where American vigilance focuses on drugs and illegal immigrants, there is little effort to stanch the flow, with the agency dealing “mostly with imports,” said Erlinda Byrd, an agency spokeswoman, though she noted there had been some spot checks for illegal waste exports. This year, the Mexican government trained more than 200 of its border agents on better detection of illegal shipments of batteries and other electronic waste.But most illegal activity is discovered by accident: the criminal division of the E.P.A. says it has recently opened investigations into three cases of illegal battery exports, the first such cluster. All resulted from tips, often from American companies trying to operate within government rules, agency officials said.In Mexico, a truck from was impounded in October after a border agent noticed it was dripping acid. It contained 1,800 spent batteries. The truck’s paperwork indicated that it was heading for a licensed recycler, but the driver told the police he was really taking it elsewhere. Another case involved 22.5 tons of batteries sent from Texas whose lead had already been resold to buyers in .The amount of lead shipped from Mexico to China has nearly tripled in three years to an estimated $150 million in 2011, according to government trade statistics. Mexico’s production of lead from mining has increased only minimally since 2007.Chronic lead poisoning in children is hard to diagnose because the symptoms are fairly common, among them low I.Q. and attention issues. Without blood test results, a definitive diagnosis is impossible. Few labs in Mexico offer lead testing and the cost — about $100 — is beyond the reach of poor families.After Mariel Landeros developed last year in her first months of life, her family worried that the battery recycling plant across from her home in Naucalpan de was to blame.Industrial Mondelo has been recycling batteries for nearly a decade, but production has grown manyfold in the last few years. “As soon as they started, there was a putrid mist over the town,” said Mariel’s aunt, Irma Landeros Aguirre.She had become increasingly concerned about the problems of her own daughter, Krystell, now 16, who suffered from nosebleeds and stomachaches, and lagged years behind her peers in school. Krystell had been referred for tests and was on a medley of drugs to control her behavior. But she had never had her blood tested for lead.So when the baby exhibited serious neurological problems, the family visited the National Institute of Pediatrics in Mexico City. Mariel’s first test came back at 18.4 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood when she was 2 months old, well above what doctors consider safe for children. At 4 months, the level had gone up to 24.8. The doctor prescribed powerful medicine to bind the lead in her body so that it can be cleaned out by her kidneys.According to the United States , “ of 10 micrograms per deciliter of blood in young children can result in lowered intelligence, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced , and antisocial behavior.” An advisory task force in the United States has recommended remediation for children to 5 micrograms.It is difficult to prove that lead battery recycling is the culprit in any one poisoning case, because there are other sources of lead exposure, like lead-based paint or ceramic pottery. But performing crude battery recycling close to where people live is a frightening combination, experts say.Outside Acumuladores de Jalisco, the recycler at the edge of Guadalajara, open-air restaurants and a farmers’ market sidle up to the factory’s dirty brick wall. Fruits and vegetables are piled on crates and children play on the ground. A sample of that dirt tested at an accredited lab in the United States contained a lead level of 485 parts per million, a rate unsafe for play areas, let alone food handling.The American car battery industry likes to boast that it has the highest recycling rate for any commodity — 97 percent of the lead is recycled — and most states have laws mandating that stores take back old batteries. Whether deposited at the store where they were purchased or with a local mechanic, used batteries are redirected to recycling plants, where the real goal is not environmental stewardship but extracting the precious lead that is the gold of a protean trading system where traceability is impossible.The provenance of any one battery is hard to ascertain because big stores like AutoZone and put their own brand names on batteries that may be manufactured by various companies. Similarly, some large battery manufacturers like Johnson Controls and Exide Technologies take back their batteries and operate some recycling plants themselves. But they sometimes send batteries out to external recyclers, and buy lead from these outside recyclers for their battery-making operations.At some point in their existence many used batteries are sold to middlemen who ship or sell them for lead extraction to the cheapest processor — increasingly, in Mexico, despite the transport cost — so the lead can be reused or resold. The price of lead scrap sold on trading Web sites has varied from 25 to 40 cents a pound in the past year, up from 5 cents a pound a decade ago. The lower the cost to extract the lead, the bigger the profit — a reality, experts say, that encourages smuggling and has fueled a black market in batteries.Federico Magalini, a researcher at the University who is trying to quantify the illegal lead trade, said batteries were ideal for smuggling because — unlike bulky refrigerators or computer monitors — they are compact and loaded with lead. “If you want to make a lot of money you can just smash the plastics, throw the acid wherever you want, and sell the lead at a high price,” he said.But the increasing export of lead batteries has hobbled many American recyclers, especially smaller players, who now say they have only enough spent batteries to run one shift a day, resulting in layoffs. “Our industry is built on the ability to keep that material here,” said Bruce Cole, executive vice president, strategy and business development, of Exide, one of the largest domestic manufacturers and recyclers.Already hurt by the , American recyclers are now also suffering from the cost of tougher regulation. The E.P.A. has reduced allowable lead levels in both smokestack emissions and ambient air by a staggering amount in the last three years because of a growing appreciation of the devastating effect that even low levels of lead have on health. American recyclers estimate the cost of compliance for a typical plant at $20 million.Companies are being forced to make difficult decisions.Exide, which has five recycling plants in the United States, does no recycling in Mexico, according to Mr. Cole, who said it was “not in our interest” to “skirt regulations.”Some battery brokers have begun trucking their goods to independent smelters south of the border instead of to American plants.Johnson Controls, the -based battery giant, trucked hundreds of thousands of spent batteries to its own recycling plant in Mexico last year, according to E.P.A. export notices. The company runs one licensed recycling plant in Mexico and is completing construction of a second; it is also building a new recycling plant in .Alex Molinaroli, a senior executive at Johnson Controls, said its plants in Mexico far exceeded that country’s regulatory standards and that they would be upgraded to meet the new American standards when they take full effect in 2013. “We don’t have a Mexican standard or a U.S. standard or a German standard,” he said. “We have our one standard globally, which today is being driven by the E.P.A.”Although Johnson Controls has won praise from the E.P.A. for environmental innovation in the United States, its Mexican recycling plant does not face the same regulatory scrutiny.Mexico does have some regulations governing lead exposure, and many plants hire doctors to monitor lead in the blood of workers. But the results are not made public or even disclosed to the workers themselves. If the levels come back high, employees are sent home for several days with an analgesic for the that typically accompanies adult lead poisoning, said Ms. Jacott, of Fronteras Comunes, who has spent two years interviewing workers. There are no requirements for monitoring lead levels beyond the factory.Residents who live near the Acumuladores de Jalisco plant said they had been told by the government that the ground water was contaminated with lead, and they tick off maladies they attribute to lead exposure.The men who disassemble the batteries end each shift covered in dust from their work and must shower and change before they leave, said the wife of one worker, who said that the factory doctor took good care of the men. “Anyway,” she said, “there are not many other jobs around here.”Environmental advocates and domestic recyclers say the onus should be on the United States to make sure its old batteries do not become Mexico’s health problem. Some say a system is needed for inspecting foreign recyclers so they can be held to American standards. But one group, Slab Watchdog, has called on companies like Wal-Mart — which sells a huge share of the nation’s batteries and prides itself on environmentally friendly operations — to guarantee that their batteries are recycled domestically.The company’s spent batteries, a spokeswoman said, now go to Johnson Controls — the company that last year sent by far the most batteries to Mexico.'"

"'11-12-09,'1','Suspending disbelief in the face of Paul McCarthy’s amusingly hideous new bronzes, a viewer might imagine this narrative: A skilled commercial artist was working on a suite of clay sculptures illustrating Walt Disney’s “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” At some point he lost his mind and started desecrating them by gouging and tearing into them, grossly distorting them and adding sexually explicit and scatological elements. Then he disappeared, leaving half-finished messes. An art dealer discovered them and had them cast in bronze — wheeled work benches, studio paraphernalia, clay scraps and all.Studying them in a high-end gallery, a critic interprets them as monuments of resistance to hypocritical mainstream culture and locates them in an avant-garde tradition, running from Rimbaud to Dash Snow, based on the conviction that going crazy is the only sane response to modern life.Recollecting Mr. McCarthy to be an eminently canny and industrious professional art maker lets the air out of that fantasy balloon. Yet the mythic dream of the wildly eccentric creative mind lingers like a cloud of sentimentality around a stone angel in a Victorian cemetery.The exhibition includes something refreshingly different: an enormous Baroque-style sculpture of Snow White and Dopey smoothly carved from solid walnut. There is nothing obscene about it, except perhaps for the girl’s suggestively open mouth.This raises a question: Having exhausted the possibilities of chaotic ugliness, might it be time for Mr. McCarthy to consider the subversive potential of beauty?'"
"'11-12-09,'1','DETROIT — The Ford Motor Company on Thursday said it would resume paying quarterly dividends to its shareholders for the first time since 2006, as it closes out its third consecutive profitable year.The company’s directors approved paying out 5 cents a share on March 1. Ford recently signaled that it was close to restoring its dividend, and analysts had been expecting an announcement soon, though some were forecasting a slightly higher amount.The payouts will total about $200 million, Ford said.“We have made tremendous progress in reducing debt and generating consistent positive earnings and cash flow,” William Clay Ford Jr., the company’s executive chairman, said in a statement. “The board believes it is important to share the benefits of our improved financial performance with our shareholders.”Ford, the only one of the three Detroit automakers to avoid bankruptcy during the 2008-9 recession, will be the first to pay a dividend on common shares since July 2008. General Motors is working to shore up its pension funds before considering a dividend, even though it has more cash than Ford.Ford has earned more than $17 billion in the last 10 quarters, and it had nearly $21 billion in cash and securities at the end of September. After closing numerous plants and cutting thousands of jobs as part of its restructuring, Ford has been focused on strengthening its balance sheet by paying down debt and improving its liquidity.'"
"'11-12-09,'1','BOSTON — Protesters at Occupy Boston began preparing for the possibility of a police raid on Thursday, after Mayor Thomas M. Menino issued his first ultimatum for them to decamp.“If they do not leave by midnight, expect the police to take appropriate action,” said Christopher Loh, a spokesman for the mayor.The warning came after a Suffolk County superior judge on Wednesday vacated a temporary restraining order barring the police from moving to evict the protesters, who have been camped in Dewey Square, a grassy area in Boston’s financial district, since Sept. 30 in one of the nation’s largest and consistently running occupations.Although over 100 protesters were arrested when the camp tried to expand on Oct. 11, the city has not undertaken any action to remove the original encampment.By Thursday night, protesters had packed up and removed the Occupy Boston library, which held over 1,000 volumes and had a raised floor and a checkout system. John Ford, its curator, said earlier that the protesters hoped to avoid a situation similar to the loss of the Occupy Wall Street library, which was destroyed in the Nov. 15 raid in New York City.'"

Others would subject the agency to the Congressional appropriations process, giving lawmakers more sway over its policies, and would give other financial regulatory agencies a check on its rules.Senator of , a Democrat, said that the opponents’ “first loyalty is to Wall Street .”The agency can accomplish part of its mission, the protection of consumers from unscrupulous lending practices, without having a director in place. But some of its new powers are vested by law in the director, so it could not expand into realms like the regulation of payday lenders and other nonbank financial businesses.The power struggle between the financial sector and its check-cashing, card-carrying customers has developed into one of the fault lines along which the political parties are playing out their own rivalries as the election year arrives.Previous opposition from Republicans led to the withdrawal of from consideration for the post.

Currently in charge of enforcement at the consumer agency, he was nominated in July to lead it.In his confirmation hearings in September, he told a Senate committee that he would make it a priority “to streamline and cut back” a mountain of burdensome regulations that discourage banks from lending to consumers. But that stance, intended to reassure Republicans on the committee, did not mollify them. At a time when Congressional Republicans have been opposing most of the administration’s approaches to regulations, the economy and presidential appointments, Mr. Cordray’s prospects were never better than bleak.President Obama, in a speech in Kansas this week on economic policy that was laden with populist overtones, singled out Thursday’s Senate vote for attention and said he would veto any legislation undoing consumer protections in the world of finance.“Does anyone here think the problem that led to our financial crisis was too much oversight of mortgage lenders or debt collectors? Of course not,” he said.“Financial institutions have plenty of lobbyists looking out for their interests,” he said. “Consumers deserve to have someone whose job it is to look out for them. I intend to make sure they do, and I will veto any effort to delay, defund or dismantle the new rules we put in place.”'"
"'11-12-09,'1','NEW DELHI — The Indian police have filed criminal charges against one of Tibetan Buddhism’s most important figures in connection with more than $1 million in cash discovered this year at his headquarters in the foothills of the Himalayas.The 17th Karmapa, as he is known, is facing charges of illegal possession of foreign currency, forgery and conspiracy, according to a police official in the state of Himachal Pradesh. This week, the police filed the charges in a local court, which must now decide whether to move forward with the case.Karma Chungyalpa, an administrator for the Karmapa, said the Karmapa had not yet been formally notified of the charges.“This is a surprise,” Mr. Chungyalpa said. “We were really not expecting this.”The case seems certain to inflame passions among the vast Tibetan diaspora in northern India. In January, the police in Himachal Pradesh raided the Buddhist monastery where the Karmapa lives as a guest. The Karmapa is Tibetan Buddhism’s third most important figure and is regarded as a possible successor to the Dalai Lama.In the raid in February, investigators discovered trunks of cash, totaling more than $1 million, including about $166,000 in Chinese currency. News of the raid swept through the Indian media and brought sensationalistic reports questioning whether the Karmapa was a Chinese spy.But the Karmapa’s representatives said the money was from followers who had come to pay homage from around the world, including from Tibet, inside China.

The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index slipped 2.1 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 2 percent. Financial stocks fell the most, down nearly 4 percent.European stocks closed even lower, with the Euro Stoxx 50 down 2.4 percent.At their two-day summit meeting, European leaders are expected to consider proposals for tougher fiscal rules from the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France. The leaders were gathered for a dinner on Thursday before the main part of their agenda on Friday.José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, sought to instill confidence that a solution would be found, saying early Thursday: “I believe this is possible,” according to The Associated Press.“My appeal — my strong appeal — to all the heads of state and government is to show this commitment to our common currency,” Mr. Barroso said. “I think this is indispensable, and leadership is about making possible what is indispensable.”Mr. Barroso was in Marseille along with Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs. Merkel for a meeting of the European People’s Party, the conservative bloc in the European Parliament, before their departure for Brussels.Laura LaRosa, the director of fixed income for Glenmede, said that United States Treasury prices rebounded as investors’ appetite returned for assets seen as safer. On 10-year Treasuries, the yield, which moves opposite to the price, was at 1.969percent, down 6 basis points.“I think what you are going to see tomorrow is going to be another day where there is a tremendous amount of anticipation,” she said.Tim Courtney, chief investment officer of Burns Advisory Group, said that with the euro zone debt crisis a concern for investors for some time, expectations for a solution were already low and priced in to the markets.Late Wednesday, Standard & Poor’s said that it was putting the credit ratings of the entire 27-nation European Union on watch for a possible cut from its top AAA rating, citing “concerns about the potential impact on these member states of what we view as deepening political, financial, and monetary problems within the euro zone.”The action, of mainly technical interest since the bloc itself does not issue debt on a large scale, came after the agency on Monday put 15 of the 17 euro member nations on watch for downgrade, meaning all of the euro zone countries face ratings cuts — and potentially higher borrowing costs — if the crisis meetings fail.“A bit of pressure is not unwelcome,” Jean-Claude Juncker, the Luxembourg prime minister who acts as head of the Eurogroup, said on French radio regarding the S.&P. action, according to Reuters. Still, he said, “the pressure would have existed even if there hadn’t been these warnings from the agencies.”In its second monetary easing in just five weeks, the European Central Bank cut its main overnight rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1 percent.

"'11-12-10,'0','WASHINGTON — Another chapter is out in the continuing and very public story of conflict within the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which has now taken the form of a battle of snail mail.A letter addressed to the White House chief of staff and signed by four of the five commission members was circulated Friday criticizing the fifth member, Gregory B. Jaczko, its chairman, and expressing “grave concerns” that his deficiencies as a leader could compromise nuclear safety. It was dated Oct. 13. A similar letter was sent directly to Dr. Jaczko.And this week, a rebuttal letter from Dr. Jaczko, also addressed to William M. Daley, President Obama’s chief of staff, said the other four members were improperly trying to involve themselves in management affairs, which in a reorganization of the commission in 1980 became the chairman’s sole responsibility. Dated Dec. 7, the letter said that the rest of the commission had “taken an approach that is not as protective of public health and safety as I believe is necessary.”Criticism of the chairman first became public in June when an inspector general’s report critical of him came out.

Peja Stojakovic and Brian Cardinal were pondering their free-agent options and were not at the first practice.“I’m anxious to see what are roster is going to end up looking like because it’s obviously not complete yet,” Carlisle said.“We had some guys that did some great things for us here that probably aren’t going to be back,” Carlisle said. “But that’s part of the circle of life in the N.B.A. We’re all going to adjust. Guys are going to step up into some opportunistic situations. We plan on defending our crown with a lot of pride.”All optimism centers on the aging nucleus of Kidd, who turns 39 in March; Dirk Nowitzki, 33; Jason Terry, 34, and Marion, 33. Kidd, entering his 18th season, said he wanted to play another three years and hoped to end his career with the Mavericks.“Hopefully, my talent will stay at a respectable level where I can help a team out,” he said. “I’d love to stay here and finish it out. I’d like to get to 20 years.”Kidd said he even told Nowitzki he wanted to keep playing so that the two could retire together. A joke, perhaps, but he and the older Mavericks clearly do not want to let go of their late-career success.“The makeup of the team is probably going to be a little different, but that’s just the business of basketball,” Kidd said. “That happens. But we still believe we can win. We’re going to take pride in trying to protect our championship.”The Mavericks steered away from any comments about the Lakers and the trade controversy surrounding Paul and the N.B.A. Carlisle insisted he was only concerned about who was in camp, even if it was only 10 players for the first practice.“The N.B.A. will take care of whatever that situation is,” Kidd said. “For me, it’s trying to figure out here what we have to do to win.”'"

"'11-12-10,'0','A group of five Nobel laureates has called on China to release Liu Xiaobo, the imprisoned winner of the Nobel Peace Prize last year. In 2009, Mr. Liu was sentenced to 11 years on charges of trying to subvert the state. He was a main author of a manifesto circulated online, Charter 08, that called for gradual democratic reforms. His wife, Liu Xia, is under house arrest in Beijing.The Nobel winners said in a statement on Thursday, “The international community seems to have forgotten that, a year after the award ceremony, Liu Xiaobo remains in prison in China and in harsh conditions.” The five Nobel winners calling for Mr. Liu’s release are Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Shirin Ebadi, Jody Williams, Mairead Maguire and Betty Williams.This year, a group of patriotic Chinese seeking to present an alternative to the Nobel Peace Prize awarded the second Confucius Peace Prize to Vladimir V. Putin, prime minister of Russia. On Friday, two Russian exchange students, Ekateryna Dakhova and Maria Ostasheako, accepted a 10-inch gold-plated statuette of Confucius in Beijing because Mr. Putin did not show up to collect the prize.'"
"'11-12-10,'0','Unlike typical A.T.V.’s, which have handlebars and an open saddle, side-by-sides — the seats are beside one another — have a steering wheel and a roll bar. They reach speeds upward of 60 miles per hour, and in some states, no driver’s license is required. “As a utility vehicle where people are using them on the farms, they are perfectly appropriate,” said Donald L. Mays, senior director of product safety at Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. But without rigorous stability tests, he said, “The concern that I have is these things can flip over, particularly when they are used on uneven terrain.”Industry officials maintain that the vast majority of the accidents are caused by human error. And they worry that the government will require them to make side-by-sides so wide and so low to the ground to decrease the chance of rollovers that they will no longer be able to go on trails.“Their mandatory standard is unrealistic from an off-road vehicle standpoint,” said Steve Nessl, marketing manager for the A.T.V. and side-by-side group at the Yamaha Motor Corporation.The regulatory debate comes as manufacturers rush out new models to meet the robust demand. Polaris Industries, which markets a fleet of side-by-sides including a two-seat, 88-horsepower model, posted record profits in its most recent quarterly earnings. Its shares are up 53 percent since the first of the year.“I went from selling roughly two to four side-by-side vehicles in a year to now I sell four a month,” said John Resciniti, the owner of the Motorcycle Mall in Belleville, N.J., which began selling Polaris side-by-sides a year ago. “It’s insane.”Dave Crocker, senior partner at Power Products Marketing, which tracks the industry, said sales of side-by-sides fell with other recreational vehicles in 2009, but rebounded in 2010 even as the rest of the industry’s products — like A.T.V.’s, snowmobiles and dirt bikes — continue to lag.This year, he said he expected roughly 240,000 side-by-sides to be sold in the United States; a decade ago, about 100,000 side-by-sides sold each year. Recreational users account for roughly a quarter of sales, he said, with the remainder bought by hunters, farmers, fire departments and for other utility uses.By comparison, 330,000 A.T.V.’s were sold in 2010, and sales have declined from 10 to 30 percent in recent years, according to the Recreational Off-Highway Vehicle Association. Some analysts, including Mr. Crocker, believe that side-by-side sales have already surpassed A.T.V. salesSome version of side-by-sides has been around since the 1980s, but the early models were relatively slow-moving utility vehicles. In the late 1990s, however, more people began using the vehicles for recreation, a trend that was accelerated when Polaris pushed past the 25 mile-per-hour speed limit in 1998 with its Ranger model.But the real propellant was the introduction, in 2003, of the Yamaha Rhino, the first side-by-side designed for recreation. In its peak year, 2007, Yamaha sold 44,000 Rhinos, Mr. Crocker said. Other manufacturers, including Polaris, soon followed with their own recreational models.“It enabled people to buy these things and go on these incredible trails, and your son or your wife or your girlfriend can sit next to you,” he said.But the Rhino became the subject of hundreds of lawsuits and a 2009 recall to address safety concerns, primarily rollovers that have led to injuries and some deaths. Among the victims was 10-year-old Ellie Sand of Ohio, who was killed when a Rhino she was riding in flipped in 2007.“They are very narrow, they are top-heavy, and unfortunately they give the visual perception that they are safer because you see a steering wheel, you see a roll bar, you see a seat belt,” said her father, John Sand. “The concept is a nice concept. I just think they need to do things to make them safer.”Yamaha officials maintain that there is no defect. “We see nothing wrong with the Rhino and have defended it aggressively,” Mr. Nessl, of Yamaha, said. He noted that his company had won all 10 lawsuits that had gone to trial; Yamaha officials declined to say how many other lawsuits filed against them had been settled.Even so, Inez Tenenbaum, the chairwoman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, said her agency had rejected drafts of voluntary standards proposed by the industry as too weak. “We have to make sure there is stability and standards that prevent rollovers,” she said. She said the commission was moving toward adopting mandatory standards and would continue to do so unless the industry embraced far tougher voluntary standards.On a recent afternoon in Cochecton, N.Y., near a bend in the Delaware River, Mr. Liconti, a burly disc jockey from Staten Island, put his Polaris Razor through the paces, driving over rocks and logs with ease, climbing hills and plunging through deep pools of mud with his friend Joe Tinari riding shotgun.“I drive this thing very, very aggressive,” he said. “You know your limits. I have not rolled this thing, and I have not felt like it’s going to roll.”He has tricked out his Razor with overhead lights, a steel roll bar and custom doors to provide extra protection. Besides being able to take along his wife and son, strapped into a car seat, Mr. Liconti said he did not get as beat up as he did on his A.T.V.“I don’t feel like I went through the war on Sunday,” he said. “You get to have the same amount of fun, and you are not as tired.”'"

"'11-12-10,'0','The United States on Friday rejected a European Union plan to eliminate subsidies provided to Airbus and said it would ask the World Trade Organization for permission to impose trade sanctions that could amount to $7 billion to $10 billion annually. The United States is still prepared to negotiate with the Europeans with a goal of ending subsidized financing, Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, said Friday. John Clancy, a spokesman for the European Commission in Brussels, called the sanctions threat “premature and not in line with the appropriate sequence of events in W.T.O. disputes. We will nevertheless review the requests carefully and consider the next steps.” Last week, the European Union presented a plan to comply with a W.T.O. appellate body ruling against European government support for Airbus in a case brought by the United States in 2004. The W.T.O. appellate body ruled this year that Airbus had received around $18 billion in illegal subsidies over many years to help develop a variety of aircraft.'"
"'11-12-10,'0','And Portland’s Brandon Roy, an elite player before knee injuries slowed him down, was preparing to retire at age 27, according to multiple reports.Meanwhile, the three teams in the vetoed Paul trade tried to cope with the fallout and the bitter feelings.By late afternoon, the New Orleans Hornets had reopened talks to trade Paul, their franchise star, who plans to leave as a free agent next summer. The Hornets, the Lakers and the Houston Rockets hoped to revive some form of the deal that Commissioner David Stern rejected on Thursday night.But the Hornets were listening to other offers as well, with the Knicks, the Los Angeles Clippers and the Golden State Warriors trying to get into the mix.League officials declined interviews, but Stern issued a statement asserting that he had made the highly unusual decision to protect the interest of the Hornets. Stern had veto authority because the league owns the franchise.While some owners — most notably Cleveland’s Dan Gilbert — objected to the trade, league officials said that Stern made the call independently, with comment from the N.B.A.’s basketball operations staff.Under the N.B.A.’s ownership, Stern said, “final responsibility for significant management decisions lies with the commissioner’s office,” and “all decisions are made on the basis of what is in the best interests of the Hornets.”Regarding the vetoed trade, Stern said, “We decided, free from the influence of other N.B.A. owners, that the team was better served with Chris in a Hornets uniform than by the outcome of the terms of that trade.”The Hornets would have received Lamar Odom from the Lakers and Luis Scola, Kevin Martin and Goran Dragic from the Rockets, along with the Knicks’ 2012 first-round pick, which Houston owned.Martin, Scola and Odom are high-caliber players who could have kept the Hornets in playoff contention, or been used in subsequent trades. But Odom is 32, Scola 31, and Martin will be 29 in February. Stern’s basketball advisers concluded that package was not young enough or talented enough to justify the trade for Paul, who is 26 and a four-time All-Star.The league has directed the Hornets to get a package of young talent and draft picks, to ensure long-term success, rather than short-term mediocrity.The other 29 owners have a vested interest in protecting the franchise’s value, because they paid $300 million to buy the team last year and will eventually re-sell it.Until then, Stern is in the awkward position of serving as the Hornets’ de facto owner, with ultimate responsibility for all personnel and financial decisions. In that respect, league officials said, Stern’s actions were no different from any other owner telling his general manager to get a better deal.The league created the potential for this sort of controversy when it bought the team from George Shinn, who was no longer willing to absorb millions of dollars in annual losses.Stern’s decision to veto the trade was widely denounced by fans and commentators, and by agents, players and team executives — even those who had nothing to do with the deal.On Twitter, Indiana’s Danny Granger referred to “the sabotaging of the LA/NO trade by david stern” and joked that he would change his name to an unprintable phrase. Magic Johnson, the former Lakers legend and current broadcaster, also spoke out on Twitter, saying: “Wrong decision by Stern & the owners. Sends a bad message to fans. Was a good deal for the Lakers, Hornets & Rockets-everyone got better.”Adding fuel to the controversy were comments made by Gilbert and Mark Cuban, the Mavericks’ owner, each of whom passionately advocated the veto.Cuban, in a Dallas radio interview Friday, noted that one of the goals of the lockout was to give small-market teams a better chance to keep their stars. “So to all of a sudden have a league-owned team trade their best player, particularly after having gone out and sold a ton of tickets in that market, that’s not the kind of signal you want to send.”Gilbert called the trade a travesty in an e-mail message to Stern, which was subsequently obtained by The New York Times and Yahoo Sports. The timing of Gilbert’s message, which emerged Thursday night, gave the appearance that Stern was reacting to the outcry. But the time stamp on the message was 10:20 p.m., hours after Stern made his decision.Stern is not opposed to trading Paul to a big-market team, league officials said, as long as the Hornets get the best deal possible.The players union had not decided whether to file a grievance on Paul’s behalf. But Derek Fisher, the Lakers guard and union president, was outraged, saying that Stern’s decision “flies in the face” of the labor deal that was just negotiated.In that deal, Fisher noted, the players gave up $300 million a year “in exchange for freedom of movement within the system, so there shouldn’t be arbitrary reasons why guys can or can’t get traded.”In Los Angeles, the fallout was evident. Odom reported to camp but left 15 minutes later, after a brief meeting with Mitch Kupchak, the Lakers’ general manager. Pau Gasol, who would have gone to Houston in the vetoed trade, also did not practice, although the team said it was because of an injury.All the other players involved in the deal, including Paul, practiced with their teams Friday.The other controversy of the day involved Howard, another superstar who is angling to move to a larger market. NBA.com reported Friday morning that the Magic were considering tampering charges against two teams. Sports Illustrated later named the teams as the Nets and the Rockets.However, the Magic had not filed a formal charge as of Friday evening. According to reports, Howard met with Billy King, the Nets’ general manager, and Mikhail Prokhorov, the team owner, in Miami on Thursday night.League officials seemed to view the reports skeptically. King issued a statement denying the meeting.'"
"'11-12-10,'0','How could such a thing happen? I had always assumed it was impossible and that strict internal controls existed at all brokerage firms so that firm officials couldn’t tap segregated customer funds even if they were willing to break the law. Thanks to MF Global, it’s now apparent that isn’t necessarily true. “If people are determined to misuse customer funds, they will misuse them,” said Ananda Radhakrishnan, the director of the division of clearing and risk at the Commodities Futures Trading Commission.That’s because the commodities and securities industry is mostly self-regulating, and self-regulation ultimately depends on the integrity of the regulated. Broker-dealers — securities firms that execute trades of stocks, bonds and other assets for customers — are overseen by the S.E.C., while futures commission merchants, which trade commodities, derivatives and futures, are regulated by the C.F.T.C. Like most large brokerage firms, MF Global was both a broker-dealer and a futures commission merchant, though its primary business was commodities futures trading.The federal regulators issue and enforce the rules, but day-to-day oversight for securities firms is delegated to the Chicago Board Options Exchange, a for-profit company, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, a nonprofit organization financed by the brokerage industry. For commodity dealers, it’s the National Futures Association and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. They conduct periodic examinations and audits and, in addition, member firms are required to have internal controls and compliance mechanisms to make sure that customer assets remain safely segregated at all times.Typically, this requires transfers from segregated accounts (other than at the customer’s request) to be approved by multiple officials, including in many cases, the firm’s chief financial officer and chief compliance officer.“It’s not a low-level functionary,” a regulator said. “It’s someone who has real standing. Most customer assets are held at the biggest firms and they have scores of people involved in this process.”Susan Thomson, a spokeswoman for Merrill Lynch, the nation’s largest brokerage firm, said that any transfer from segregated accounts there required “at least three checks and possibly more.” Officials from operations, regulatory reporting and collateral are usually involved and sometimes compliance officials, as well. “There are multiple streams of responsibility. You have management accountability in each of those streams on a daily basis,” she said.MF Global also had internal controls and a chief compliance officer, which raises the question: How did the customer assets ever leave the segregated accounts to begin with? In testimony on Capitol Hill on Thursday, Mr. Corzine only added to the mystery. He said that transferring customer funds was “a complex process” and, asked who could execute such a transfer, said “I wouldn’t know probably who that person is.”While Mr. Corzine said he had “no intention” of authorizing any transfer of segregated funds and “didn’t intend to break any rules,” he left open the possibility that someone might have thought he did. Others at MF Global surely know. A spokeswoman for MF Global Holdings, the holding company for the broker-dealer, said “there was an approval process” for moving segregated funds, but said she was unable to provide more details.There are legitimate reasons to move assets from segregated accounts, the most common being that they are overfunded. Commodities firms are required to reconcile customer assets with the amounts in segregated accounts every day, and must report any shortfall to the C.F.T.C.For securities firms, the requirement is only once a week, but many firms do it every day. They are required to report shortfalls to Finra. If there’s an excess (many firms deliberately overfund the segregated accounts to make sure there is never an inadvertent shortfall), they can transfer the excess funds. But that usually requires high-level approval from someone like the chief financial officer, and then the transfer can’t exceed the amount of the excess. So that wouldn’t explain the missing $1.2 billion at MF Global.The law also allows commodities firms like MF Global to use segregated customer funds as a source of low-cost financing for their own operations, but they are required to replace any customer assets taken from segregated accounts with supposedly ultrasafe collateral of the same value, typically United States Treasuries, municipal obligations and obligations whose payments of principal and interest are guaranteed by the government.This week, the C.F.T.C. issued new rules restricting how client assets can be invested, which had grown under C.F.T.C. interpretations to include sovereign debt and transactions known as “in-house repos,” or repurchase agreements, in which a firm contracts with itself to use customer assets as, in effect, interest-free loans to finance its inventory of Treasury bonds. MF Global was apparently a heavy user of in-house repos, and before his firm collapsed, Mr. Corzine had argued strenuously against the C.F.T.C.’s proposal to ban them.Making bad bets on European sovereign debt — like making bad bets on United States mortgage-backed securities — isn’t a crime, but improperly transferring segregated customer assets is a potential criminal violation of the securities laws and a relatively straightforward one at that. (The United States attorney’s office in Manhattan is in the early stages of investigating the removal of customer assets from MF Global.)I spoke this week to several people involved in the MF Global investigation. No one has reached any firm conclusions about how the assets were transferred, but possible innocent explanations have dwindled to almost none. And James B. Kobak Jr., a lawyer for the MF Global trustee, said in court on Friday that there were “suspicious” trades made from customer accounts. If that’s the case, there may have been a deliberate and concerted effort to override MF Global’s internal controls to gain access to segregated customer assets, and if that can be proved, those responsible should be prosecuted and, if convicted, go to jail.Unfortunately for MF Global’s customers — and future victims of similar crimes, if that’s what it turns out to be — there’s no easy remedy and it will most likely be months or even years before they recover their money. The Securities and Investor Protection Corporation explicitly warns that it’s “not uncommon for delays to take place when the troubled brokerage firm or its principals were involved in fraud.”SIPC will replace up to $500,000 of securities and cash (but not futures contracts) missing from customer accounts at member firms. A measure of the magnitude of the problem is that since its creation in 1970, SIPC has advanced $1.6 billion to make possible the recovery of $109.3 billion in assets for an estimated 739,000 investors (through the end of 2010).Meanwhile, the C.F.T.C.’s enforcement capabilities, like the S.E.C.’s, have been starved for lack of funding. “Our funding has declined to such an extent that three to four years ago, just as the industry was taking off, we had less than 500 employees,” Mr. Radhakrishnan said. But even with more resources, “We can’t be at every firm overseeing every activity. We have to expect people to understand the rules and adhere to them.”'"
"'11-12-10,'0','More than two years after his death, the choreographer Merce Cunningham has grown only more unknowable. Even if you can keep track of the restless ways in which he made formal inventions with human movement over the course of 60 years, the ways in which he shaped choreography as drama keep defying categorization.This farewell month of performances by the Merce Cunningham Dance Company brought the rich comedy of “Roaratorio” (1983) to the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday. On Thursday came a double bill of the severely elegiac “Second Hand” (1970), with its suggestions of a leader preparing his followers for his departure, and then becoming invisible to them, and the cornucopia “Biped” (1999), with its floods of passing dancers who continually embody transcendence or confront it. Though both works suggest life’s end and its continuation, they’re polar opposites.“Second Hand” is characterized by stillness, restraint, finality and leave-taking. “Biped,” despite astonishing pauses (especially for dancers waiting on the peripheries) is largely a perpetuum mobile, a vision of human flux. Each is a dance drama like no other. You can see movements recalling others in Cunningham’s repertory, but each has powerful qualities of atmosphere, expression, structure and phrasing not to be found elsewhere.The Cunningham experience is a tantalizing one. Whereas “Giselle” or most ballets by George Balanchine come round often enough for many people to feel acquainted with them, few people have ever had the chance to become truly familiar with any Cunningham repertory. Even among those in the Brooklyn Academy audience, many of whom have been watching this choreographer’s work there for over 20 years, some were seeing “Roaratorio” and “Second Hand” for the first — and very likely the last — time. We mourn the artist we scarcely had the chance to know, who kept moving on to the next idea before we had caught up with the last one.In “Second Hand,” Robert Swinston dances the role Cunningham made for himself. He never leaves the stage, and in his remarkable opening solo he scarcely leaves a single central spot to which he is largely rooted. His head and body turn to the side; his arms open up into a succession of different lines (often extended through one stretched leg); throughout he keeps returning to a forward-facing stance, directly addressing the audience. A few heavy, alternating steps from side to side become powerfully significant.In the central section, a duet, he dances with a female companion (Andrea Weber). Although their relaxed intimacy is apparent, her lightness and fluency contrast with his more grounded manner; his gravity, in every sense, is a crucial dimension of the work.'"
"'11-12-10,'0','But Mr. Graham said he would continue to place an indefinite hold on any of President Obama’s nominations to the National Labor Relations Board, a stance he adopted after the board filed its case against Boeing. The board has only three members now and will drop to two in January, so the blocking of new nominees would leave it with too few members to issue rulings in future cases.In the Boeing case, Mr. Solomon asserted that Boeing’s decision to build its $750 million Dreamliner factory in South Carolina constituted illegal retaliation against the machinists’ members in Washington for having exercised their federally protected right to strike. He cited public statements by Boeing officials about the machinists’ militancy in Washington State as one piece of evidence in the case, although Boeing officials said that lower costs were their major reason for choosing South Carolina.After months of sharp rhetoric, Boeing and the machinists announced a surprise agreement on a new contract last week. Last week, Local 751 of the machinists’ union announced that 74 percent of its Boeing workers in Washington State had voted to ratify a four-year contract extension that included substantial raises, unusual job security provisions and Boeing’s commitment to expand aircraft production in the Puget Sound area.The union then asked the labor board to withdraw the case.Mr. Solomon said he was delighted that Boeing and the union had settled their dispute. “The case was always about the loss of future jobs in the Seattle area,” he said. “This agreement has resolved that issue. There is job security in the Washington area.”He said the board’s goal was always to promote the resolution of disputes through collective bargaining, adding that filing the Boeing case had helped lead to such a settlement.“This is the outcome we always preferred, and that is typical for our agency,” Mr. Solomon said in a telephone news conference.Boeing applauded the board’s withdrawal of the case.“We have maintained from the outset that the complaint was without merit and that the best course of action would be for it to be dropped,” said Tim Neale, a Boeing spokesman. “Boeing is grateful for the overwhelming support we received from across the country to vigorously contest this complaint and support the legitimate rights of businesses to make business decisions.”In the case, the labor board had asked a judge to order Boeing to move its three-plane-a-month South Carolina production line to Washington State.Mr. Solomon said critics had misconstrued the board’s intentions. “This case was never about the union or the N.L.R.B. telling Boeing where it could put its plants,” he said. “This was a question for us of retaliation, and that remains the law.”He said that if the labor board were ever faced with a similar situation, “we might well issue a complaint.”Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor at the United States Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the board’s decision to drop the case, but added, “More needs to be done to prevent this outrageous overreach in the future.”He added that employers remained concerned about other board actions, like a pending rule to speed up unionization elections.Charles Craver, a labor law professor at George Washington University, predicted that business groups and Republican lawmakers would “continue to be full speed ahead with their attacks on the N.L.R.B. I think the Republicans will continue to block anyone Obama names for the board.”The labor board will drop to two members from the current three when the term of a Democratic recess appointee, Craig Becker, expires later this month. The Supreme Court ruled last year that when the five-member board dwindled to fewer than three members, it could no longer rule on any cases.Underlining Republicans’ continuing dismay with the board, Representative John Kline, Republican of Minnesota and chairman of the House Education and the Work Force Committee, vigorously urged the Senate on Friday to approve a bill already passed in the House that would bar the labor board from ever again filing a case against a company over where it located a plant. He called the Boeing case “a shameless campaign to bully an American employer.”'"
"'11-12-10,'0','For the first time in American history, a major political party may be choosing between two leading presidential candidates who are not Protestant. If current polling holds through the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses and beyond, the Republican nomination will come down to a choice between a Latter-day Saint, or Mormon, and a Roman Catholic.It is therefore time to celebrate the broad-mindedness of American voters, but also to mourn the bigotries that may still linger. On the one hand, the Mitt Romney/Newt Gingrich showdown — which, given the fickleness of primary voters, could soon seem as passé as Rick Perry/Herman Cain — testifies to Americans’ pluralist ideals. American voters, even religious Protestants, do not require that their president be Protestant, or born again, or even a regular churchgoer. So long as a candidate makes bland, predictable affirmations of religious faith, he or she has adequately punched the religion card.The New York Times/CBS News poll conducted Nov. 30 to Dec. 5 found that of seven Republicans in the race, the two Mormons — Mr. Romney and Jon M. Huntsman Jr. — were in the bottom three of evangelical Christians’ preferences in Iowa. Mr. Romney was fifth, with 10 percent of evangelicals saying they would support him on Jan. 3; the former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum, who is Catholic, was sixth, with 6 percent; and Mr. Huntsman got 1 percent support.Mr. Huntsman and Mr. Santorum have been trailing throughout the campaign season, so there is nothing surprising about their poor poll numbers. But Mr. Romney has steadily been among the top candidates, and the fact that evangelicals give Mr. Gingrich more than three times the support they give him — 33 percent to Mr. Romney’s 10 percent — calls for some explanation.After all, Iowa evangelicals are known for supporting family-values Christians; four years ago, they helped deliver a victory to Mike Huckabee, the folksy pastor and former Arkansas governor. But in his public life Mr. Gingrich has demonstrated the sort of family values that evangelical voters might be expected to reject. In 1980, Mr. Gingrich left his wife of nearly 20 years, the former Jackie Battley, for Marianne Ginther, with whom he was having an affair. In 1981, Mr. Gingrich married Ms. Ginther, but he later left her for Callista Bisek, with whom he had been having an affair for several years. They married in 2000.The third Ms. Gingrich is a Catholic, and in 2002, Mr. Gingrich asked the Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta to annul his second marriage on the ground that the former Ms. Ginther had been previously married. “We were married 19 years, and now he wants to say it didn’t exist,” she told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.'"
"'11-12-10,'0','The mystery surrounding the disappearance nearly five years ago of a former agent in was rekindled Friday with the release of a hostage videotape showing him alive as of a year ago.In the video, the former agent, Robert A. Levinson, is shown in a makeshift cell looking gaunt and wearing a threadbare shirt. Mr. Levinson, who worked as a private investigator after retiring from the F.B.I., disappeared in March 2007 while on Kish Island, a resort in the Persian Gulf.In the tape, which was received by Mr. Levinson’s family last November, he says that he has been held in captivity for three and a half years but does not identify his captors. The tape was the first sign he was still alive.“I need the help of the government to answer the requests of the group that has held me,” he said on the tape as faint played on a soundtrack. “Please help me get home. Thirty-three years of service to the United States deserves something.”The footage of the former agent was included with a longer video that was released Friday on the family’s Web site in which Mr. Levinson’s wife, Christine, and one of the couple’s seven children appeal for his release. The decision by federal officials to publicize the tape a year after it was sent to the family by e-mail indicates that investigators have made little progress in their search for the former agent, said people briefed on the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.'"

"'11-12-11,'0','The industry as a whole has not done much better. According to the Web site BoxOfficeMojo.com, total theatrical revenues for limited releases in 2010 totaled $288 million, a far cry from a peak of roughly $481 million in 2002.So why does a forward-looking businessman think he can make it work? “Through our efforts with Fantastic Fest, we saw a lot of films that came through our pipeline that weren’t getting any offers at all, particularly foreign films,” Mr. League said in an interview earlier this month. “We thought we could promote them through the theater chain, and we are also very bullish on new technologies and the way people are watching movies now.”In 2010 the company distributed its first release, “Four Lions,” a British film about a team of hapless terrorists trying to plan a suicide bombing, in partnership with the more established Magnolia Pictures. Mr. League, who said the release was something of an experiment for the company, joined the film’s director, Chris Morris, on a multicity promotional tour last fall. And while “Four Lions” grossed only $304,000 in North America, it received strong reviews, and Mr. League said it earned a modest profit.Mr. Morris said in an e-mail that he found working with the neophyte Drafthouse Films highly gratifying. “I doubt another distributor would have sent the guy in charge on the promo tour to drive and carry bags,” he said, adding, “Without an attitude that favors the unusual, decent films in the U.S. would disappear.”Although Drafthouse Films didn’t release any films in 2011, Mr. League and his team spent the year building a modest release inventory for 2012, including “Klown,” a Danish comedy about a canoe trip gone awry, and “The FP,” an action-comedy pastiche of cult fare like “The Warriors.” (Mr. League said Drafthouse Films would also reissue six repertory titles next year, either theatrically or on DVD or both.)The highest-profile acquisition is “Bullhead,” an unsettling crime drama set in the illegal market for cattle steroids. The film is Belgium’s submission for an Academy Award for this year’s best foreign-language film. Aware that a nomination could help put his company on the map, Mr. League has hired a Los Angeles-based publicist for the film and is taking out industry trade ads and setting up screenings for awards voters. (Mr. League declined to specify how much the company was willing to pay to acquire a new title but acknowledged that it couldn’t compete with “mini-majors” like Fox Searchlight Pictures or Focus Features.)With only one release under Drafthouse’s belt, it remains unclear whether the company can grow. And considering that the distribution wing is being financed entirely from within the privately held company, it may easily turn out to be Mr. League’s Waterloo. But film industry observers, who tend to root for the avuncular, press-friendly Mr. League, are cautiously optimistic.“He’s proven he has a certain level of understanding and vision and taste,” Ms. Harris said. “Is this going to work? Beats the hell out of me. But it’s a reasonable, logical move for the franchise Tim League has created.”For his part, Mr. League — who also expects to expand the Alamo Drafthouse chain significantly in the next few years — doesn’t regard himself as a savior for a struggling industry. But by exploiting a loyal following that reaches far beyond Austin and by embracing video-on-demand and alternative revenue, he remains confident he’ll be able to turn a profit. If nothing else, he’ll have the opportunity to do what he’s been doing for many years: bringing the films he adores to the attention of others. And, with luck, making a buck.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','The audit attributed many of the problems to Mr. Cancel’s management, which, it determined, led to a climate of confusion. The audit described a “culture of mistrust” in the department, with many employees citing “fear of retribution” as a hindrance to reporting abuses of power.The review included interviews with past and current staff members.Mr. Cancel, responding to questions in an e-mail, sent a copy of the audit annotated with point-by-point rebuttals and denials. He said part of the audit “clearly reflects the political agenda of President Johnston,” referring to P. J. Johnston, the president of the 15-member commission.Mr. Johnston, a commissioner since 2003, denied that the audit was politically motivated.In one example of unusual spending cited in the report, Mr. Cancel used money from the department’s administrative fund, which is supposed to go toward general overhead costs and equipment, to finance unbudgeted special projects including a $189,000 book commissioned to celebrate the department’s coming 80th anniversary. Unlike other money, which is governed by bond rules or legislation, the administrative fund has relatively few restrictions on its use.Mr. Cancel said the spending from the administrative fund was approved by both the controller’s office and the mayor’s budget office. But a spokeswoman for the department disputed this, saying it was Mr. Cancel, not the budget office, who oversaw the fund.The audit also described problems with the Cultural Equity Grant program, whose budget was $2.2 million last year. Four of the eight grant categories did not fit the program’s legislated guidelines, it said.The program’s biggest grantee, the Center for Cultural Innovation, which received $477,000 over five years, should not have been eligible for the money, the audit said. As Ms. Beltran noted, the center is based in Los Angeles, not San Francisco, and it has an annual budget of more than $1 million — both violations of the program’s statute.Also, the report said, significant parts of financing that the center received from the Cultural Equity Grant program, including $90,000 approved this spring for studies of local Asian and Latino artists and groups, did not go through the public, competitive process mandated for all arts commission grants.Mr. Cancel resigned in July after news media accounts of his frequent absences from office and his differences with Jill Manton, the arts programs director. He received a severance package of around $50,000.Mr. Cancel, a New Yorker, was named director of cultural affairs in late 2007. He was highly praised for starting initiatives like the Art in Storefronts program, which enlivened empty storefronts across the city, and Street SmARTS, which paired graffiti artists with private property owners to create murals.But, the audit said, he also eliminated the deputy director position in 2009, for budget reasons, thereby removing the person responsible for overseeing staffing and fiscal policy.Mr. Cancel said the oversight responsibilities of the deputy director were reassigned to other department members, they were not eliminated.Last week, the commission announced that Tom DeCaigny, an arts consultant who used to lead the Performing Arts Workshop, a youth-oriented arts nonprofit in San Francisco, would become director of cultural affairs in early January.Some leaders in the city’s arts community said that even with new leadership, the problems in accountability and operations revealed by the audit would take years to repair, and that the review had come much too late. They said complaints about the department had been circulating for years.“If I were on the commission, and I heard this stuff, I would have called for the audit two years ago,” said Debra Walker, president of the San Francisco Planning Commission and former head of the San Francisco Arts Task Force, which released a report in 2006 advocating for changes in city arts programs.“It’s great that they called for it,” Ms. Walker said, “but it’s a day late and a dollar short.”Mr. Johnston, the current president, defended his work on the commission, saying he had “tried to raise questions all along the way.” But, he said, “government moves slowly.”“Yes, I wish that some of the problems that ultimately emerged in the controller’s audit, and in other reports, had been addressed sooner,” he said.But, Mr. Johnston said, there is a weakness in the system: The commission relies on the director to inform it of what is going on. Ms. Beltran, for instance, said she was disturbed to discover that a $90,000 grant she had approved as a commissioner was awarded without competitive bidding and included transcription services billed at $140 an hour.Members of the arts commission said they hoped the audit closed the book on a difficult period. “I’m looking forward to looking forward,” said Mr. DeCaigny, the new director.Rebekah Krell, who joined the department this fall as the new deputy director, said she anticipated putting out the last regime’s fires for the foreseeable future, making sure that there is “no pot of money that isn’t budgeted,” and dealing with the long list of workplace issues detailed in the audit.“That report is basically my job description, my mandate,” Ms. Krell said. “I am hopeful that I won’t be doing that forever.”A public meeting to discuss issues at the arts commission is scheduled for Dec. 12.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','The number of deaths is spiking this year on the tracks of the 77-mile Caltrain commuter line between San Francisco and Gilroy. With the 15th and 16th fatalities taking place within an hour of each other on Dec. 3, the total is nearing the 1995 high of 20 fatalities.Many of the deaths are suicides, as 11 have been determined to be so far this year.The engineers are the last people to see the victims alive. There is no way to stop a speeding 400-ton train in time. There is also no way to forget the sight or sound of death on the tracks.One of those killed on Dec. 3, Donald Larson, 48, of San Jose, was hit by a northbound Baby Bullet in Palo Alto. A week earlier, Gregory Brown, 54, of Redwood City, died in the same spot in front of the same train. The same engineer hit them both, said Alex Cano, chairman of the local train engineers’ union. No further details have been released about their deaths.Less than an hour after Mr. Larson died, Jayne Cox, 27, of Folsom, was killed by a southbound train north of the Menlo Park station. The incident is being investigated as a suicide.Christine Dunn, a Caltrain spokeswoman, said the deaths had an effect on everyone at the agency, from the engineers to the people who answer calls from passengers. “This is why the agency is heavily involved in community suicide prevention efforts that make a proactive effort to deal with the underlying causes of this complex problem,” she said.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','“Your nerves are twitching,” said Christian Stracke, Pimco’s global head of credit research.Michael Mayo, a longtime bank stock analyst, said he was working the lobster shift so often just to keep up with the latest International Monetary Fund rescue or Slovenian parliamentary vote that he might as well call himself a 24-hour-a-day research shop. “Who would have thought we would have to be looking at Italian sovereign debt yields to figure out what Morgan Stanley’s stock will do?” he said.For traders, there is too much to lose if they sleep through history.That’s why Craig Gorman, a partner at First New York Securities, routinely monitors his trading positions in the middle of the night. He turns on CNBC and fires up the Bloomberg terminal with six screens at the foot of his bed. “With the TV and all my monitors on, it gets a little bright in there,” he said. “My wife is not thrilled about it.”The other downside? It is hard to fall back asleep once the adrenaline from trading starts pumping. Even so, Mr. Gorman said it was worth the price: “You can’t get the same feel for market psychology looking back at the charts in the morning as when you are up,” he added.News organizations and brokerage firms see an uptick in early-morning activity, too. Bloomberg reports at least a 30 percent jump from a year ago in the use of its mobile applications, which allow customers to remotely log into the trading terminal at their office desk. The biggest spikes have occurred well before the New York markets open, between 5 and 7 a.m., when traders wake up and commute to work, as well as between midnight and 3 a.m., when trading in Asia winds down and the European markets open, according to company officials.CNBC has recorded a 50 percent increase in the tiny audience watching “Worldwide Exchange,” which broadcasts between 4 and 6 a.m. Traffic on its Web site between 2 and 5 a.m. has risen about 30 percent compared with a year ago.There are also signs that predawn trading by American retail investors has increased. TD Ameritrade, which caters to individual investors, said customer trading volume in S.& P. futures — a bet on the coming day’s direction in the market — has more than doubled between 3 and 6 a.m. over the last year.Wall Street has long been the land of the early riser, and plenty of fixations in high finance have come and gone. In the late 1970s and 1980s, traders obsessed over the state of the money supply; in the late 1990s, they focused on rapidly rising Web page views of the leading dot-com companies. Last year, traders acted like armchair engineers in deep-water drilling as they monitored images of the BP oil spill gushing into the Gulf of Mexico.Whether or not Europe’s new plan struck on Friday to achieve budgetary discipline brings market stability, some suggest that the current middle-of-the-night frenzy heralds a lasting change for an industry that coined the term “bankers’ hours.”“It is now making people aware that they can become a global trader,” said J. J. Kinahan, the chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade. “They don’t have to rely on the hours of the New York Stock Exchange” between 9:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. Eastern time.Several forces are at play. The convergence of mobile technology and financial information allows investors to trade on news — anywhere, anytime. The markets, meanwhile, have grown so interconnected that what happens with sovereign bonds can quickly affect equities.Any whiff of trouble in Europe can send markets into a tailspin and easily overwhelm the hard-earned edge a trader might have gained by digging deep into the financials of an individual stock.“The degree to which asset prices are connected is off the charts,” said Dean Curnutt, the president of Macro Risk Advisors and another early riser.That is the main reason that Brad Alford, the chief investment officer of Alpha Capital in Atlanta, rolls over in bed, grabs his iPad and glances at the Bloomberg market feeds with one eye, sometimes two, before the sun comes up. Or why Mr. Kass trudges over to his poolside home office in Palm Beach, Fla., to e-mail hedge fund friends about the latest troubled country du jour. “There is a pretty active cabal in those early hours,” he said.It is also why Al Moniz, a European bond fund manager at Fore Research and Management in New York, has been waking up at 2 a.m. at least several times a month, and expects even more bleary-eyed nights next year.“It is probably going to get worse,” he said. “I don’t think there is any end in sight.”'"
"'11-12-11,'0','Mr. Griffin, who died on Nov. 23 at 78, was the city editor of a semiweekly Pecos newspaper that competed fiercely with a daily paper owned by none other than Mr. Estes. On a five-person news staff, Mr. Griffin was by necessity a jack of all trades, as much reporter as editor. And it was as a reporter that he brought down Mr. Estes, unraveling an elaborate fraud scheme in four articles that earned Mr. Griffin and his little newspaper, The Pecos Independent and Enterprise, a Pulitzer Prize in 1963 for distinguished local reporting.The series, which was as understated and meticulous as Mr. Griffin and took months to prepare, at first caused no particular fuss or fanfare in Pecos. The articles carried no byline, ran under headlines smaller than those for the major articles and did not even mention Mr. Estes by name.But their description of how that businessman masterminded a byzantine scheme to borrow money using nonexistent fertilizer storage tanks as collateral caught the attention of the F.B.I. Congressional hearings into this and other Estes flimflams led to the highest levels of the Kennedy administration, particularly Johnson, who had been a business associate of Mr. Estes’s in several ventures.Some histories say the vice president tried to help Mr. Estes in questionable dealings with the Agriculture Department that emerged after Mr. Griffin exposed the tank fraud. Some say Kennedy may have considered dropping Johnson from his ticket in 1964, partly because of the Johnson-Estes connection.In 1963, Mr. Estes was convicted of a battery of fraud charges by federal and state courts and was sentenced to 24 years in prison. (The United States Supreme Court overturned the state conviction on the ground that television and radio coverage of his pretrial hearing had violated his rights.)After six years in prison, Mr. Estes was released on parole in 1971. Eight years later, he was convicted of other fraud charges and served four more years.As the Estes story unfolded and the national news media picked up on it, Mr. Estes’s supporters outnumbered his detractors in Pecos, nestled at the juncture of the Pecos River and the old Comanche Trail.“You have to remember that Billy Sol was like God in this town,” one man told The New York Times in 1962, adding, “Anyone opposed to him might just as well pack up their bags and leave town.”The episode began in 1961, when Dr. John Dunn, a physician who bought The Independent the year before with three partners, grew suspicious of Mr. Estes’s maneuvers. Dr. Dunn’s mother, who ran a retail credit shop, had told him of the unusual number of mortgages being carried by farmers dealing with Mr. Estes.Dr. Dunn soon discovered that Mr. Estes had borrowed $24 million — $180 million in today’s dollars — using as collateral fertilizer tanks that turned out not to exist. Mr. Estes had persuaded farmers in a cotton-growing area to pretend to buy tanks by taking out mortgages on them. He offered the farmers 10 percent of the purchase price — in effect, something for nothing.Dr. Dunn told the F.B.I., but federal agents found no violation of banking laws. Before long Dr. Dunn sold his interest in the paper and turned over his material on the Estes case to The Independent.Mr. Griffin said he first became suspicious of Mr. Estes’s easy-money scheme when he overheard farmers talking in a small cafe. “It’s like pennies from heaven,” he quoted one as saying, recounting the case in an interview with United Press International in 1962.In pursuing the Estes story Mr. Griffin was taking on a competitor. Mr. Estes started his newspaper in August 1961 after The Independent refused to back him as a candidate for the local school board. Mr. Estes’s paper slashed advertising rates to force The Independent out of business and warned advertisers to avoid it.The strategy appeared to be working. The Independent cut its editorial staff from five to two.The Independent’s trump card was Mr. Griffin’s investigative series, which came out in February and March 1962. Mr. Estes was arrested on March 29. In addition to the fertilizer tank scam, he was convicted of defrauding the federal government’s grain storage program in a scheme that in one instance involved taking three federal agriculture officials on a shopping spree at the Neiman Marcus store in Dallas.The day before Mr. Estes was arrested, Mr. Griffin said he went to see him and asked him “point blank” if the fertilizer tanks existed. “He told me that there weren’t as many tanks as the mortgages showed,” Mr. Griffin wrote. “That sure was the understatement of the year.”Mr. Estes, now 86, still nurses hard feelings about Mr. Griffin, the reporter who helped put him in jail. “It’s a good riddance that he left this world,” Mr. Estes said Friday in a brief telephone interview.Oscar O’Neal Griffin Jr. was born in Daisetta, Tex., on April 28, 1933. He served in the Army in the 1950s, graduated from the University of Texas in 1958 and worked at several other small Texas papers before joining The Independent.After his series appeared, he joined The Houston Chronicle in 1962 and covered both the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. He was later a spokesman for the federal Transportation Department, worked at small Texas oil companies and earned an M.B.A. from Harvard Business School.His family said he died of cancer in New Waverly, Tex., where he lived.Mr. Griffin is survived by his wife of 56 years, the former Patricia Lamb; a brother, Red; a sister, Peggy Marino; three daughters, Gwendolyn Pryor, Amanda Ward and Marguerite Griffin; a son, Gregory; and seven grandchildren.The Independent not only got the goods on Mr. Estes; it also defeated his newspaper, The Pecos Daily News, which Mr. Estes had started in the hope of grinding The Independent out of existence. After the scandal broke, The Daily News went into receivership. (The Independent survives as The Pecos Enterprise.)'"
"'11-12-11,'0','Here are some of the points Moore emphasizes.EYES OPEN Every so often, the sheer simplicity of Moore’s advice astonishes Keller. Consider this suggestion: “Always get in position to see the quarterback’s eyes.” It sounds simple, obvious, a basic tenet of receiving. “Then you think about it,” Keller said, “and you’re like, ‘Duh, how come it never occurred to me?’ ” That command changed Keller’s perspective. He realized that he must have made it hard for Mark Sanchez, all those times a pass was thrown Keller’s way when one of them never saw the other. “He’s throwing it blind,” Keller said of Sanchez. “He doesn’t always know if you’re there, just where you’re supposed to be.”Keller takes pride in running crisp routes with sharp cuts, knowing that being a second late or a yard short can sabotage a play, but he does so with greater awareness now, trying to lure linebackers underneath to clear space — and a better line of vision — for him. Even if a defender matches him stride for stride, Keller knows he can still get open if he can make visual contact with Sanchez.While Keller watched video in training camp, it struck him how expertly (and often) Clark would catch the ball in tight coverage. One factor, naturally, was Manning’s accurate right arm. Another was how well Clark applied Moore’s instruction. “Even now, I’ll run a route and I’ll hear Tom’s voice in my head,” Clark said over the phone from Indianapolis. “The way he teaches football was applicable 20 years ago, just as it will be 20 years from now.”TOTAL CONCENTRATION The first rule of Tom Moore is that he doesn’t talk about Tom Moore. “It’s not about me,” he said. “It’s about the players.” So he tells Keller about outstanding receivers he once coached, players like John Stallworth, Lynn Swann, Cris Carter and Marvin Harrison. All had exceptional talent. But, Moore tells Keller, all of them also possessed great concentration, the ability to compartmentalize, to block out crowd noise and distractions and defenders. And so in his notebook Keller wrote, “It’s only me and the football.”To hammer home the point, Moore put Keller through drills that tested his focus. Keller would run routes behind teammates waving their arms in the air. He would catch passes just as someone walloped him with an air bag. He would take special care of the football, bringing it close to his body, his hand wrapped over top. As a result, Keller is dropping fewer passes — only 3 of 45 deemed catchable by ProFootballFocus.com, as opposed to 9 of 61 during the 2010 regular season. “You have to have the mentality that nothing else matters,” Keller said. “If you’re concerned about the ball and the ball only — and not running toward a safety — you have a greater chance of catching it.”PING-PONG WIZARD In high school, Keller dunked over Portland center Greg Oden, but he is deadlier at a Ping-Pong table than on a basketball court. “He’s no joke,” said Drew Keller, Dustin’s older brother. Moore tapped into that talent by assigning him off-season homework that involves a Ping-Pong ball — but no paddle. Keller must catch the ball with only his fingertips, not his palm. The exercise, one of a few drills stored away in his notebook, is intended to enhance his hand-eye coordination. “Ever try doing it?” Moore asked. “If you try to grab it, it squirts right out. You have to have touch.”Moore sold Keller even before explaining the details. First, he told Keller that he could sit. “That sounded great,” Keller said. Then, Moore added that Keller’s wife, Erin, could help. And she will, Keller said, by throwing the ball at him. Creativity and ingenuity have long been a hallmark of Moore, who stretched defenses and created mismatches in Indianapolis by liberally running double-tight-end formations. One of those tight ends, Marcus Pollard, knows all about Moore’s willingness to experiment. “I was a basketball player when he met me,” said Pollard, who played seven seasons for Moore. “He made me into a football player.”SELL, SELL, SELL Gregarious and charismatic, Keller would make a good salesman. On the field, his powers of persuasion are just as vital, setting up defenders intent on disrupting his timing. There is an art to it, Keller has learned. And one way he now disguises his routes is to “sell vertical” — a phrase written three times on one line in his notebook. In other words, Keller wants the defender always to think that he is running a deep route, that he will run right by him. “A lot of these in-breaking or out-breaking routes, once you get the defender’s hips open, you can beat him with anything,” Keller said. “Then he has to react, and by then, he’s 3 or 4 yards behind you.” Just ask Buffalo safety Da’Norris Searcy, who covered Keller on a first-and-10 from the Jets’ 44 on Nov. 27. As he sprinted 12 yards, Keller gauged Searcy’s leverage, then lost him by cutting across the middle to make a memorable 22-yard reception, reeling in the ball with his left hand. It set up another catch three plays later — a touchdown.DON’T BE A PUNCHING BAG The revelation came during one of those late nights they spent together during training camp watching film, Keller taking notes as Moore flipped from clip to clip. At 6 feet 4 inches and 250 pounds, Keller is more than capable of bowling over defensive backs and smaller linebackers, but too often he juked and shook, trying to make them miss. “I don’t know why,” Keller said, “but it wasn’t acceptable.”In Moore’s positive style, he praised Keller before pointing out his mistakes. The next day, Keller performed a drill in which he ran up the field toward Moore, who smacked him with an air bag, simulating a defender. “He’d just blast me,” Keller said, “and I’d keep on running.” Keller lowered his shoulder. He initiated contact. “If you do that,” Moore told him, “they will fear you every time you have the ball in your hands.”Keller filed away that nugget until Sept. 25, when the Jets played Oakland. On their second offensive play, Sanchez rolled right and found Keller streaking by the left hash mark, about 15 yards downfield. No defenders within 10 yards of him. Instead of turning toward the middle, away from safety Michael Huff, Keller ran right at him. Over him, actually. On the play, Huff sustained a concussion and missed the remainder of the game.“As soon as I caught it, one thought came into my mind: get physical,” Keller said. “Just like Coach Moore told me to.”'"
"'11-12-11,'0','Finley, who felt that Kuhn had a vendetta against him, said his enemy “sounds like the village idiot.”Marvin Miller, the chief of the players union, called Kuhn’s decision “sheer insanity” and declared that Kuhn had “singlehandedly plunged baseball into the biggest mess it has ever seen.”Perhaps to demonstrate his smoldering contempt for Kuhn, Finley showed up at a hearing into the sales of the players wearing a yellow golf hat, a yellow sports shirt and a yellow carnation.This was a tense time in baseball. It was June 1976, months before the first class of free agents was preparing to negotiate with owners. Kuhn and some owners believed free agency would wreck baseball.Finley badly wanted the $3.5 million denied him by Kuhn. He said he was having a hard time financially in Oakland, competing for fans against the nearby San Francisco Giants. He said he tried to trade Blue, Rudi and Fingers. He said he had tried to sign them. He wanted to get something. So he sold them.And if he could not get the money from the Yankees and the Red Sox, Finley was going to get it from Kuhn.So he sued Kuhn (and other baseball parties) in federal court in Chicago for $10 million.In the meantime, Finley was proving to be as stubborn as Charlie O, the mule that was his team’s mascot — he benched Blue, Rudi and Fingers, claiming that they belonged to other teams, and he ignored edicts from the American League president, Lee MacPhail, and Kuhn to play them.The rest of the A’s threatened to go on strike against him unless he relented, and eventually he did.As he awaited a decision on his case in district court, Finley stayed on the offensive. During spring training in February 1977, he sold reliever Paul Lindblad to the Texas Rangers for $400,000. Kuhn held that up, too, but while he deliberated, he let Lindblad work out — at the Yankees’ camp in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., neutral territory that was not far from the Rangers’ facility in Pompano Beach.But then Kuhn let the Lindblad sale go through.In March, the district court ruled against Finley and upheld Kuhn’s power to halt the sales of Blue, Rudi and Fingers. A month later, Blue walked out of A’s camp, unable to come to a deal with Finley.He returned, but his 14-19 record, with a 3.83 earned run average, was a significant stumble from the season before (18-13, 2.35). The A’s were an altogether different team without Rudi (who signed with the Angels) and Fingers (who was signed by San Diego), as well as third baseman Sal Bando (who left for Milwaukee).In 1977, the A’s won 63 games, ushering in a decade with only one winning season.That season, the Mets’ trade of Tom Seaver to the Cincinnati Reds for four young players gave Finley a new opportunity to fillet Kuhn. Finley blustered that the swap confirmed Kuhn’s “perverted, selective and political use of his office to favor his friends and punish anyone he dislikes.” Blue got between Finley and Kuhn once more. In early 1978, Finley traded Blue to the Reds. But Kuhn nullified it, saying it would further weaken the A’s and would “materially and adversely” affect the National League West. Blue finally escaped to the Giants in spring training. Kuhn did not block that deal.Two years later, the N.B.A. had a problem with one of its owners, Ted Stepien of the Cleveland Cavaliers. After a flurry of dubious trades soon after Stepien took over the team, Commissioner Larry O’Brien ordered him to make no more for a while. Then he required Stepien to clear all trades with a league official. In Stepien’s name, a league rule survives: a team cannot trade No. 1 picks in consecutive years.Now, in 2011, Stern, O’Brien’s successor, was assessing the proposed Paul-to-the-Lakers trade as commissioner, owner (the league bought the Hornets a year ago) and de facto general manager (substituting his judgment for that of Dell Demps, the real general manager).And although Stern was not judging a player sale — but a trade in which the Hornets would have received several players, including Lamar Odom, and a No. 1 pick — his rationale for disallowing it sounded quite Kuhnian.“All decisions,” he said in a statement, “are made on the basis of what is in the best interests of the Hornets.” The team, he added, “was better served with Chris in a Hornets uniform.”At least Stern does not have a Finley-like owner ready to sue him over the trade.Stern wouldn’t sue himself. Would he?'"
"'11-12-11,'0','PARIS — In a ceremony in Oslo that repeatedly invoked gender equality and the democratic strivings of the Arab Spring, the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize was presented to three female activists and political leaders on Saturday for “their nonviolent struggle for the safety of women and for women’s rights” as peacemakers.To spirited applause and at least one ululating cry, diplomas and gold medals were presented to President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia, 73; her compatriot Leymah Gbowee, 39, a social worker and a peace activist; and Tawakkol Karman, a Yemeni journalist and a political activist who, at 32, is the youngest Peace Prize laureate and the first Arab woman to receive the award.“The promising Arab Spring will become a new winter if women are again left out,” said Thorbjorn Jagland, the chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, who presided over the ceremony.In her address, Mrs. Sirleaf said: “In its selection this year, the Nobel Committee has brought here three women linked by their commitment to change, and by their efforts to promote the rule of law and democracy in societies torn apart by conflict.”Mrs. Sirleaf, in 2005, became the first woman in modern African history to be elected head of state, and she is widely credited with ushering her country into a stable peace after a brutal 14-year civil war. She was re-elected president in November, though that contest was marred by violence and a boycott by the opposition.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','ON weekends year-round, and daily in summer and during the holiday season, Pepperheads Hot Sauces has tastings at a counter in the atrium outside its store in the Harbor Square Mall here. More than a dozen hot sauces are available, ranging from “not hot” to mild, medium and hot. To sample “extra hot” sauces like Blair’s Ultra Death Hot Sauce, however, you must enter the store and sign a waiver (adults only) releasing the store from claims of damage or injury.“Everyone says, ‘I like heat but I want flavor.’ Well, what’s hot to you?” said Bruce Passarelli, 60, of Setauket, the owner of Pepperheads. “That’s why we have tastings. Put a speck on your spoon and put it on your tongue, not your lips. Wait 30 seconds for the full impact. Then decide.”Although the retail focus at specialty stores like Pepperheads, Pickle Packin’ Papa in Rocky Point and the Crushed Olive in Huntington and Stony Brook may be primarily one or two products, the range of choices can be broad. The shops’ proprietors count among their customers devotees who go out of their way for the variety they offer.“The guy who drives here knows what he wants,” Mr. Passarelli said. “If it gets discontinued, he goes ballistic.”Mr. Passarelli inherited the Pepperheads store when he bought the Harbor Square Mall in 2005. He said the original owner had been stocking the shop since about 1997 with hot sauces he discovered on trips to the Caribbean.Mr. Passarelli’s son Bryan, 26, now manages the store, which carries more than 800 different bottles of hot sauce, as well as barbecue sauces, spicy chocolates, mustards and more.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','The relationship between the details of Ernest Hemingway’s life and his fiction is a constant source of fascination and frustration, as Arthur Phillips notes in his Nov. 13 review (“The Letters of Ernest Hemingway: Volume 1 — 1907-1922,” “Hemingway: A Life in Pictures,” “Hemingway’s Boat”). Hemingway himself was attuned to the problem as early as “In Our Time” (1925), when he excised the part of “Big Two-Hearted River” in which the character Nick Adams admits to having written stories in the book — an admission that seems to invite and validate biographical criticism. In “The Things They Carried,” Tim O’Brien’s naming of a fictional 43-year-old writer “Tim O’Brien” does not tritely blur the biography/fiction distinction, but cannily reinforces it.My major concern, however, is Phillips’s slighting of the volume of Hemingway’s letters, edited by Sandra Spanier and Robert W. Trogdon, as “repetitive and dull,” driving the “general reader” to “skimming,” and full of “precious, even fetishistic” scholarly attention. It strikes me as ungenerous to judge a book against a purpose and audience for which it was not intended.ALEX VERNONLittle Rock, Ark.The writer is the author of “Hemingway’s Second War: Bearing Witness to the Spanish Civil War.”Arthur Phillips dispenses with Ernest Hemingway’s directive against posthumous publication of his letters by offering us the option of skipping his review of the first volume of what promises to be the publication of every scrap of correspondence Hemingway ever put his name to. And in referring to Pauline Hemingway’s burning of the letters sent to her, Phillips seems to agree with the prevailing belief that celebrities forfeit any right to privacy that they themselves don’t enforce absolutely. But dishonoring such wishes, even 50 years after Hemingway’s death, is still dishonorable, and tarnishes the legacy he clearly wanted to leave: not a portrait of a man with all his flaws in plain sight, but the great works of literature he produced.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','In the early 1870s in what is now Zambia, David Livingstone, the greatest of all Victorian explorers, led several expeditions in search of the source of the Nile. At times, he could barely walk, ulcers having chewed through the “muscle, tendon and bone” of his feet. Riddled with malaria, plagued with piles and weakened by pneumonia, he had pulled out several of his rotting teeth using strong thread and a heavy pistol. He had been attacked by roasting heat, pouring rain, tick fever, hostile slavers and leeches “as close as smallpox.” By 1873, he had an excruciatingly painful blood clot in his intestine the size of a fist. In this extremity of suffering, he found time to appreciate the “sweet” voice of a tree frog, but it is another entry in his diary — of truly towering understatement — that most perfectly sums up the wry fortitude of men like Livingstone: “It is not all pleasure this exploration.”The men (and occasionally women) who went in search of the headwaters of Africa’s longest river displayed superhuman resilience and courage, and the all-too-human frailties of vanity, cruelty and petty-mindedness. But in an age when the earth is Google-flat, its every corner accessible from an armchair, Tim Jeal’s book is a reminder of just how tough, uncompromising and bitchy those Nile adventurers were.“Explorers of the Nile” is a brilliant, scholarly and at times almost unreadably vivid account of the two decades in the middle of the 19th century when the search for the Nile’s source in central Africa was at its height, told through the interlocking stories of Livingstone, Richard Burton, John Hanning Speke, James Grant, Samuel Baker and Henry Morton Stanley. These men were fired by different impulses — religion, scientific inquiry and a thirst for fame — but they were not driven (at least not primarily) by a desire to stamp British imperial authority on the empty spaces of the map. That would come later. Less dramatically, Jeal’s book goes on to trace the unforeseen political consequences of the opening up of Africa and colonization, from the appalling atrocities in Uganda under Idi Amin to the contemporary horrors of Darfur.The explorers, with their elaborate facial hair, overweening confidence and almost boundless energy, came not to rule but to solve an ancient mystery that had intrigued geographers since the time of the pharaohs: where in the vast interior of Africa did the Nile rise, with enough volume to cross thousands of miles of desert and flood Egypt every year? That riddle had fascinated Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar. Nero dispatched two centurions to try to find the source. For the Victorians, the grip of this conundrum went far beyond its scientific significance: it became a leitmotif for exploration itself, a quest comparable in emotive and symbolic force to the race to the moon in a later century.These gentleman-­adventurers were ready to submit to any hardship in pursuit of the river’s source, and prepared to stoop pretty low to claim credit for having found it. They battled nature, and they scrapped ferociously with one another. Jeal’s most notable achievement is to lay bare the poisonous rivalry between Speke and Burton, recalibrating their places in history.In February 1858, Burton and the man he forever referred to as his “subordinate” reached the shores of Lake Tanganyika after a journey of quite astonishing unpleasantness. Burton was so ill he had to be carried for the last 200 miles. Speke’s raging ophthalmia meant he could barely see the lake. Burton subsequently contracted ulcers on his tongue and could hardly speak. Meanwhile, a small black beetle flew into Speke’s ear and “began with exceeding vigor, like a rabbit at a hole, to dig violently away at my tympanum.” He stuck a penknife into his ear, killed the beetle and wounded himself so badly that for months he was without half his hearing.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','RECENTLY Bartok trounced Schubert in an impromptu audience poll at Carnegie Hall. I was surprised and delighted. It seemed an indicator, albeit fanciful, that the battle for contemporary music had been won.The event was the first concert of the pianist Andras Schiff’s Perspectives series. The Budapest Festival Orchestra, conducted by Ivan Fischer, had just played a Schubert overture, Bartok’s First and Third Piano Concertos (with Mr. Schiff as soloist) and Schubert’s Fifth Symphony. Mr. Fischer charmingly offered the audience a choice of encores: Schubert or Bartok.Shouts rang out for Bartok, with only scattered calls for Schubert. Mr. Fischer asked for a show of hands. An overwhelming victory for Bartok. “Well,” Mr. Fischer said, “how about something short by each?” So he conducted a lilting German dance by Schubert, then a zesty Romanian folk dance by Bartok.I know, I know. The choice was between Schubert and Bartok, not Schubert and Gyorgy Kurtag. Yet my hunch is that the audience also would have gone for Mr. Kurtag, or even a new piece by a young composer from Budapest, had Mr. Fischer announced the work as something special.Classical music audiences seem more curious than ever, and performers have been emboldened over the past decade or so to take more chances. Composers from the early and mid-20th century have been brought pretty well into the repertory. These days orchestras and ensembles trumpet their premieres. So should those who have campaigned for contemporary music declare victory?Yes and no. Here is my field report from the battle front.The New York scene has been rejuvenated of late by the emergence of clubs and alternative concert spaces where contemporary music of all kinds is presented to youngish audiences eager to check things out. Are these experiences prodding young listeners to give the established classical scene a try? It seems an open question.But what about the more established institutions? Recent years have been tough economically for orchestras, ensembles and opera companies. It would be easy for the major institutions to look at the hotbed of activity in the smaller halls and alternative spaces and conclude that contemporary music is being attended to quite well. By this point in its history classical music has centuries’ worth of repertory, and our major orchestras and arts centers face the challenge of keeping that repertory fresh. The inclusion of new music has always been important, not just for its own sake — that is, for the future of the art form — but as a way to keep older works vibrant by juxtaposing them with the new.Not that long ago the doomsayers were predicting the death of classical music. Yet during the 1990s the most innovative orchestras hired dynamic conductors with palpable enthusiasm for new music who had the capacity to excite their communities with fresh artistic vision, notably Esa-Pekka Salonen at the Los Angeles Philharmonic and Michael Tilson Thomas, still on the job at the San Francisco Symphony. More recently conductors like David Robertson at the St. Louis Symphony, Marin Alsop at the Baltimore Symphony and Gustavo Dudamel, Mr. Salonen’s successor in Los Angeles, won their appointments to a considerable degree because of their abilities to entice new audiences by embracing new music, living composers and experimental programming.So how is the New York Philharmonic doing? The conductor Alan Gilbert arrived in 2009 full of promise and potential. His televised inaugural concert as music director was an inspiring statement of purpose and a welcome departure from the mostly musty tenures of Kurt Masur and Lorin Maazel. The program opened with the premiere of an urgent work by Magnus Lindberg. Then Renée Fleming sang a plush, haunting account of a 30-minute song cycle by Messiaen. After intermission Mr. Gilbert conducted a rhapsodic performance of Berlioz’s “Symphonie Fantastique.”He has given audiences many such evenings since. An early milestone in his tenure came in the spring of 2010, when Mr. Gilbert conducted the New York premiere of Gyorgy Ligeti’s audacious 1978 opera “La Grand Macabre,” in an inventive production by Doug Fitch. To see not just the new-music crowd but also older Philharmonic subscribers laughing at this bleakly satirical, complex modern opera was, well, something I thought I would never see. In June the Philharmonic followed up with another exhilarating staged opera, Janacek’s “Cunning Little Vixen,” again directed by Mr. Fitch.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','Benoit Denizet-Lewis highlights the lifetime of misery that bulldogs have to endure. In my eight years of clinical veterinary practice, 100 percent of the bulldogs I have seen suffer respiratory distress. Anybody persuaded by this article to place welfare first — and disregard what is deemed to be cute — when it comes to choosing a dog saves one more deliberately handicapped animal a lifetime of struggle.Despite the myriad health problems described in this article, many bulldog owners will testify that their beloved pets are healthy and happy. Having owned two wonderful “bullies,” I can say that they have been among the most loving and wonderful dogs I’ve ever owned, able to swim, run, play and even leap over furniture. My Pretty Baby Belvedere was able to keep up with its most active cocker spaniel, Labrador and Belgian shepherd friends, and surprised everyone when this “nonswimming” breed jumped into the lake when her “water dog” friends didn’t even dip their toes. The bulldog, though, is an acknowledged “heartbreak breed,” and all potential bulldog owners must do their research before making this most important purchase, or, if possible, adopt a rescue animal of whatever breed that just needs a good home.The Web site Bulldogs World blames what it calls “backyard breeders” for the fate of the breed, saying, “It can take many years for responsible breeders to correct the damage done by a few backyard breeders.” The site cautions that breeding of bulldogs should only be done out of love, and that responsible breeders will not find any profit in raising the dogs. Even with responsible breeding, the site says most bulldogs now require artificial insemination to achieve pregnancy and as many as 95 percent of births are achieved through Caesarean sections.It’s not just bulldogs that suffer. Shrink a bulldog down in size, put a heavy coat on it and you’ve got a Pekingese, which is also in dire need of intervention to take the breed back to what it was. The show-quality Pekingese of today looks nothing like the Pekingese that came out of China in the 1800s. Like the bulldog, it has great personality and spirit but a body so deformed that its quality of life is diminished. In the United States, the parent-breed club determines the breed standard, not the A.K.C. Those who vote on the breed standard are the breeders. Only passage of laws similar to the European Convention for the Protection of Pet Animals will force breeders to breed for overall health instead of for a peculiar physical characteristic.With regard to the unhealthy breeding of bulldogs, it would seem that the deliberate breeding of deformity to achieve an extreme appearance should be deemed cruel, immoral and, preferably, illegal. I have owned a German shepherd dog that went “down in the rear” due to breeding for exaggerated “angulation” for show purposes only. I have also endured having my favorite cat breed — the Persian — turned into a freak face with its barely visible nose bred into its skull, causing protruding tongues, mouth problems and eye problems. This type of cruelty should be stopped.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','Mr. Bird, who looks like a soccer dad with strawberry-blond hair and flashing blue eyes, said he didn’t tackle “Ghost Protocol” with the specific intent of becoming an A-list director without an asterisk. Live action represented a new challenge.“I don’t want to make the same kind of movie over and over,” he said. But it’s clear from talking to him that part of the challenge is not just mastering a different kind of movie. It’s proving that a director is a director is a director, breaking out of what is perhaps Hollywood’s most restrictive ghetto.Plenty of live-action directors have successfully taken on animated movies, including Gore Verbinski (“Rango”) and Tim Burton (“Corpse Bride”). But the flow almost never goes in reverse — if you can name a successful example you have movie historians beat — making Mr. Bird’s chance at bat a fascinating one for Hollywood to watch. A similar attempt will come in March, when Andrew Stanton, the director of Pixar’s “Finding Nemo” and “Wall-E,” unveils his live-action space saga, “John Carter.”“Ghost Protocol,” which arrives in Imax theaters on Friday and on Dec. 21 on regular screens, is not just a little swing. Mr. Bird’s movie, the fourth in the Paramount Pictures franchise, cost an estimated $145 million to make and was filmed on location (Dubai, India, Russia) using Imax cameras. Adding to the pressure, the movie’s star, Tom Cruise, who is also a producer, urgently needs a fresh hit.Mr. Bird got this gig largely because of Mr. Cruise. He called Mr. Bird shortly after “The Incredibles” was released. “His composition and storytelling was absolutely wonderful, and I said, ‘If you ever want to direct live action, please, please direct me,’ ” Mr. Cruise said by telephone from Tokyo. Mr. Bird was charmed. But he went on his way, pursuing an ambitious live-action project about the wild and woolly scene in San Francisco just before the 1906 earthquake.Then, one night at about 11:30, Mr. Bird got a text message from J. J. Abrams, a friend (they used to share an agent) and a producer of “Ghost Protocol.” Mr. Abrams also directed “Mission: Impossible III.” His message read: “Mission?” Mr. Bird was intrigued. “It sounded big and daunting in a good way, crazy, but the kind of crazy that I got into this business to embrace,” he said.Adam Goodman, president of the Paramount Motion Picture Group, said he needed no arm twisting. “It didn’t matter at all that he only had animated experience, because every one of those films was inspired, with the best form of story and action sequences and every frame blew your mind,” Mr. Goodman said.Still, Mr. Bird recalls Paramount having some jitters during the early shoots. “There was a moment, after some of the first rushes came back, that they seemed very relieved,” he said. “It suddenly hit me that they were a little worried about me.”In many ways the core of Mr. Bird’s job on “Ghost Protocol” was the same as on a film like “Ratatouille”: coordinating various creative teams, making decisions on myriad small details, staying on schedule, paying attention to thematic questions. Are the characters relatable? Can the audience understand what the characters are thinking from moment to moment? Does the story elicit emotions? Is the ending surprising yet satisfyingly inevitable?But directing animation is very different for a few reasons. You’re always under a roof, for starters. Many components of animated films are also completed in isolation, or nearly so. Voice actors record their lines separately from one another, for instance, and the words are added to the pictures later. With live-action films, everything is done in one giant swirl, and you had better pray that it doesn’t rain on that outdoor set.Rather than setting up shots inside Pixar’s cushy headquarters, Mr. Bird found himself on the 123rd floor of the Burj Khalifa, the Dubai skyscraper that is the world’s tallest structure at a little more than 2,715 feet. For a scene in which Mr. Cruise’s character scales the tower’s exterior Spider-Man style, Mr. Bird had to remove windows and dangle cameras outside the building.“Ghost Protocol” picks up with the Impossible Mission Force as its top agent (Mr. Cruise), blamed for blowing up the Kremlin, is disavowed. Along with other IMF fugitives — played by Jeremy Renner, Paula Patton and Simon Pegg — Mr. Cruise’s character traverses the globe to unravel a terrorist plot and clear his name. Because the agents are operating for the first time without backup from headquarters, their high-tech gadgets sometimes go on the fritz, heightening the tension.“Ghost Protocol” aims to be funnier than its predecessors in the series and includes some unexpectedly quirky moments, at least for this type of action film. One comes early on, as Mr. Cruise’s character breaks out of a Russian prison during a riot. A bouncy Dean Martin tune plays as the thick-necked thugs tear into one another. “That’s all Bird,” Mr. Cruise said. “He found that song, and I was like: ‘Wow. O.K. Let’s do it.’ ”Mr. Cruise said he was “constantly amazed” at Mr. Bird’s ability to pull off concepts that seemed a little squirrely at first, though people who have worked with Mr. Bird before are not surprised to hear it. “If you’re going to pursue a dream, you have to wake up first,” said Patton Oswalt, the actor who voiced Remy in “Ratatouille.” “Brad has unreined imagination and enthusiasm and what comes first with him is the gee-whiz. But what makes him able to execute on all of that is an incredible foundation of professional knowledge and experience.”Mr. Bird, who is married with three sons, the youngest of whom is 17, was born in Montana but spent most of his childhood in Corvallis, Ore. He traces his interest in moving images to the age of 3, when he drew a rudimentary rabbit named Boinky in sequential pictures.When he was 10, he saw Disney’s “Jungle Book” and something clicked. “I realized that an adult somewhere made a living deciding how an arrogant panther should move, and that’s what I wanted to do,” he said.In person, in the Heidi conference room at the Skywalker Ranch (named for its kitschy Swiss décor), Mr. Bird oscillated between curt and intense, and chatty and quick to laugh. He has a tendency to break into character voices, talking like a grizzled old man to make a point about his age. (Mr. Bird provided the voice of Edna Mode, the persnickety fashion designer, in “The Incredibles.”)He also exhibited a controlling demeanor that along with an attention to detail, revealed his director’s stripes. He routinely interrupted our interview to ask that something he said earlier be tweaked or ignored, for instance. Asked if he was trying to direct this article, he said, “No, of course not.” But then he tried a few more times and stopped on his way out of the room to adjust crooked mini blinds.If a big-budget sequel like “Ghost Protocol” isn’t what you would expect from a guy who has spent his career making unconventional choices (a rat cooking in a kitchen?), Mr. Bird has a bit of a hard time explaining it himself. He talked about wanting to work with Mr. Cruise and Mr. Abrams, wanting to do a spy movie and wanting to prove that “a commercial movie can still be art.”But what about the time, back in 1999 in an interview with The Orange County Register, when Mr. Bird said he had no interest in “copying whatever made a lot of money.” How does “Ghost Protocol” square with that statement?“O.K., so you have your gotcha moment,” he said, a bit icily.He enjoys people who challenge him? Hmm.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','What’s to celebrate here? The Wild West represents something akin to a normal, thriving market. It is largely overseen by the S.E.C., which takes a forgiving approach to firms that sell products to active investors. The downsides to this lax regulation are well known, but it is not without its benefits. Entrepreneurs with nothing more than a good idea can enter the market relatively quickly and compete against established firms. If they can offer better products than their competitors, they’ll succeed; if not, they go bust (hopefully before they almost blow up the world). One major sales pitch for capitalism is that constant competition makes us all better off. If FAZ — or a hedge fund, for that matter — doesn’t appeal to enough people, it will eventually collapse. And there is nothing wrong with that. Failure is as important to healthy capitalism as success.The nation’s handful of huge banks, however, are spared the indignity of failure. (Ignore Bear Stearns and Lehman — they were puny compared with the true giants.) Citi and Goldman Sachs both bet against the interests of some of their largest clients and created products designed to fail. It’s extremely likely that all of the nation’s largest banks would have collapsed over the past three years without enormous help from the Federal Reserve. In any normally functioning market, they would have subsequently had trouble making huge profits. Instead, they’ve gotten bigger and richer.One of the biggest problems is that the big banks are regulated in a manner that, paradoxically, often works to their benefit and against ours. The S.E.C. watches over them but so do a host of other regulators. Every large institution can choose from among the Fed, the F.D.I.C., the Comptroller of the Currency and 50 state banking regulators, all of which compete with one another in turf battles. They also have countless agencies in other countries overseeing them. With so many different regulatory bodies, some things slip through the cracks. (A.I.G., for example, had around 400 different regulators throughout the world and conducted its sketchy financial activity in places where it did slip through.) Remember that the worst excesses of the housing bubble — especially the creation and distribution of those toxic assets — occurred within the highly regulated big banks, not the lightly overseen hedge funds.When the banking rules are rewritten — as they are every few decades, usually after a crash — the banks also get the chance to play a big role in drafting them. Last year, Congress set broad new guidelines and tasked each regulator with writing specific rules. It was a nominally democratic process — all Americans are invited to express their views about banking regulation — but the main participants are the lawyers and lobbyists for the largest financial institutions. In one example, the S.E.C. held 34 meetings with groups proposing changes to the way the important Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from certain risky investments, is implemented. So far, almost all of these get-togethers have been with big banks and their representatives. Only one has been with a consumer-advocacy group.The reality is that smaller banks or clever entrepreneurs who want to sell useful products to the general public simply cannot pay the price of admission. They can’t get much market share, because they don’t have the influence; and even more practically, they can’t afford the extraordinary number of lawyers and the lobbyists either. And being too big to fail generally makes the largest institutions fairly impervious to competition. There are nearly 8,000 banks in the United States, but the top 20 control more than 90 percent of the market. The top three alone control 44 percent. This is terrible for customers, who would be better served if banks competed entirely on the basis of serving us better.Some economists say banking in the United States is a full-on oligopoly, while others say, well, it’s only oligopolesque. Regardless, we clearly need smarter, stronger regulation. But we also need banking upstarts — the Googles of finance — capable of competing with the big banks. Unfortunately, many ambitious newcomers mostly see opportunities in high-risk, high-loss products like FAZ and not in sensible things that the rest of us might want.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','Earlier this year, one of the defining villains of the age met his end. A generation of children grew up frightened by his legend and haunted by the image of his face. More than just an evildoer, he seemed at times to be the embodiment of evil itself, the ruthless leader of a vast and shadowy network whose very principle was terror. His death was unsurprisingly violent, widely celebrated (with a few qualms expressed here and there) and also curiously anticlimactic. His diabolical charisma — the power of his name alone to inspire shudders of dread and revulsion — dissipated almost instantly. Life resumed its ordinary, anxious course.Yes, him. Parallels between the malefactors of fantasy and their real-life counterparts are always suggestive, even if the alignment is never exact. Osama bin Laden and the demonic artist formerly known as Tom Riddle were both wayward sons of privilege, but the convergence of their careers is simply a historical accident, or perhaps an example of the kind of serendipity that takes on significance only in hindsight. Bin Laden was active in the early and mid-’90s, before J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels became a global sensation, but Bin Laden himself only achieved that status with the Sept. 11 attacks, which occurred two months before the release of “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone,” the first of eight feature films.The last one, “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,” arrived in theaters this July, just between the Navy Seal raid in Abbottabad and the 10th anniversary of the attacks. And while there is no obvious causal or allegorical relationship between the war on terror and the turmoil in the wizard world, it does seem that 2011 marked the end of an era of evil.Or maybe it would be more accurate to say that the death of the actual Bin Laden and the fictitious Voldemort confirmed a shift — a temporary vacillation or an epochal pendulum swing — in the character of American nightmares. Whether or not we are wired, as a species, to dream up boogey­men, we are habituated, as a culture, to seeking them out in shapes that conform to our collective anxieties. The scale of Voldemort’s ambition and the perfection of his depravity made him one of the exemplary movie bad guys of his time — the slithery Satanic verve of Ralph Fiennes’s noseless performance certainly helped — but by the final installment in the franchise, his imperial, metaphysical badness had lost some of its negative sublimity. His cruelty to his followers made it hard to credit the intensity of their loyalty, and the way his baleful powers seemed to multiply and dissipate at the same time was a source of confusion as well as dread.The grand, Manichaean battle between Voldemort and Harry had to be seen to its conclusion, of course. But more memorable and more moving than their final confrontation were the secondary conflicts and supporting characters that were the true lifeblood of the series. The denouement of Ron and Hermione’s seven-year mutual hate-crush. Mother Weasley’s dispatching Bellatrix Lestrange. The fractious politics at the Ministry of Magic and among the Hogwarts faculty. And above all, the unquiet life and noble death of Severus Snape.“Deathly Hallows” might have been Voldemort’s Götterdämmerung, but it was Snape’s apotheosis. Ambivalent, vain, a target of bullying who grew into a bully, Snape, played with such subtle mastery by Alan Rickman, was a brilliantly gray exception to the black-and-white moral scheme of the Potter universe. Snape’s dalliance with the Death Eaters may have been unforgivable, but his lifelong grievance against James Potter proved to be justified, and the intensity of his mixed motives was a source of perpetual unpredictability and, in the end, tremendous pathos.Severus Snape is more in tune than Voldemort with a popular culture that seems, at least for the moment, to prefer ambiguities instead of absolutes. Over the past decade, we have become accustomed to agonized or shadowed heroes, including Tobey Maguire’s moody Spider-Man, Christian Bale’s brooding Dark Knight and the strangely melancholy James Bond incarnated by Daniel Craig. Even Harry Potter had his moments of anger, moroseness and ill humor. But the grimness of these heroes arose less from the moral defect of being tempted by evil than from their intimate knowledge of its depths. They could be lawless, vengeful, guilty and tormented, but only because the enemies they faced were so utterly beyond the reach of compassion or reason. Fiennes’s Voldemort represented one face of this kind of unredeemable vileness: grandiose, totalitarian, obsessed with power. The other side — whimsical, chaotic, devoted to destruction for its own sake — was brought most vividly to life by Heath Ledger’s Joker in “The Dark Knight.”There were a few stabs at this kind of villainy on screens this year, but they seemed more cartoonish than awe inspiring. Red Skull, the nemesis of Captain America, was a creature of comic book retro-kitsch, so over the top in his fiendishness that even the movie’s Nazis felt he went a bit too far. And the heavy-metal, supermean Decepticons? They’re toys, so lumbering in their belligerence that any 8-year-old knows better than to take their threats seriously.In the fantasy and superhero realm, the most chilling and compelling villain of the year was surely Magneto, who in “X-Men: First Class” is more of a proto-villain, a victim of human cruelty with a grudge against the nonmutants of the world rooted in bitter and inarguable experience. Magneto is all the more fascinating by virtue of being played by Michael Fassbender, the hawkishly handsome Irish-German actor whose on-screen identity crises dominated no fewer than four movies in 2011. In addition to Magneto, Fassbender was Rochester in Cary Fukunaga’s “Jane Eyre” (a romantic hero who for much of the story wears a plausible guise of gothic menace); the psychiatrist Carl Jung in David Cronenberg’s “Dangerous Method”; and the sex-­addicted protagonist of Steve McQueen’s “Shame.” All of these men are studies in ambivalence, divided against themselves and soliciting, at best, a wary sympathy from the audience.Magneto, more than the others, also evokes a curious kind of self-reproach, because his well-founded vendetta is, after all, directed against us. (And the worst of us is represented by Kevin Bacon’s Sebastian Shaw, the nemesis behind the nemesis.) Magneto’s tragic beginnings give him something in common with Caesar, the chimpanzee who transcends his species-based oppression to become a simian Spartacus in “Rise of the Planet of the Apes.” There is nothing malevolent about Caesar at all: he is the underdog we are expected to root for, even if as a consequence we are rooting against ourselves. The bad guy in “Planet” — the greedy Big Pharma C.E.O. played by the British actor David Oyelowo — is more of a scapegoat than an agent of evil. His indifference to the well-being of his company’s research subjects is not really what dooms humanity to decimation by virus and enslavement by our primate cousins. The true culprit in that regard is Will Rodman, James Franco’s serious, sensitive scientist, an unwitting Prometheus whose experiments give the apes the genetic boost they need to take over the planet.'"
"'11-12-11,'0','Whether you should, however, is a separate matter. It’s possible the error was an honest mistake, and you wouldn’t want to underfinance the institution responsible for your wife’s care. In any case, it might not be easy for your wife to pursue a financial dispute with the people on whom her life depends. Given your finances, you might decide that $300 a month is a bargain compared with the cost of being right.In our latest online ethical debate, readers addressed the question of whether pediatricians may refuse care for families that don’t vaccinate their children.Many people said doctors shouldn’t refuse to treat patients because of their “beliefs.” I agree that it would not be ethical to deny someone treatment because he is an Anabaptist or because he supports Ron Paul. But giving a vaccine isn’t, or shouldn’t be, a matter of “belief.” It is a matter of medical judgment, the essence of a doctor’s responsibility.Nor is it fair to compare this situation to one in which a doctor kicks someone out of her practice because the patient drinks too much or because he won’t agree to get that gastric bypass she recommends. (“Until doctors reach a 100 percent success rate in their cures,” Rick L., of Chicago, argues, “they have to allow patients to make some of their own decisions.”) This is not strictly a personal decision.People who make unwise decisions about their own health endanger themselves. But those who forgo vaccination as a matter of personal choice are examples of what’s known as the free-rider problem. They benefit from the retreat of childhood epidemics, but they do not share in keeping them at bay. Indeed, they invite those illnesses to return. That’s true no matter what you think of vaccines; not even their most vocal critics claim that inoculation is more dangerous than measles, mumps, rubella, whooping cough, influenza and so on once were.Several readers argued that doctors have an obligation to treat those who are most vulnerable, so pediatricians should go out of their way to treat unvaccinated children. But California Pediatrician, from San Jose, explains that “the measles outbreak in L.A. years ago was from a child coming back from Europe, going to a new doctor’s office, where five infants contracted measles as they were not yet old enough to vaccinate, and they all required hospitalization.” As Lauren from Atlanta says, “Pediatricians have a right and a duty to protect their entire patient base.” So where does that leave us?The claims about how best to influence the child’s family are similarly contradictory. “As a matter of ethics,” said L.J.G., of Austin, refusing to treat an unimmunized patient “is analogous to tough love. Refuse to see the patient unless the mother consents to the vaccination. There is no other way to convince her she is doing the wrong thing.” That could work. Or it could just drive the family in question further from good care. Meanwhile, “a relationship that is nurtured over time may convince said parents that they should change their viewpoint,” George M. Woods said. Or it might deprive them of incentive to listen. Who can guess?I think the most persuasive ethical argument is that in the case of a pediatric practice, the patient is captive to his parents’ wishes. If his parents endanger his health (and that of other children around him), it’s not his fault, and the doctor should not punish him. She should treat him. Just not while newborns are present.'"

But insiders are selling, and the supermodel Heidi Klum, host of “Project Runway,” has some advice that might suit investors in Michael Kors, whose namesake is a judge on the show. Each week she reminds competing designers that “in fashion, one day you’re in, and the next day you’re out.”The I.P.O. filing cites research that the global luxury goods market will expand at 7 percent a year through 2014. If the company’s growth slackens to anything approaching that mundane level, investors might relegate Kors shares to the discount bin.Two companies projecting fourth-quarter earnings could be signaling economic worries. DuPont and Texas Instruments said last week that their results would be weaker than they previously thought. Earnings at American multinational companies have been surprisingly robust up to now, but these bellwethers suggest that may be changing.Chemicals and computer chips are two necessities for other industries around the world. When business slackens for the likes of DuPont and T.I., it can be a sign of things to come for others. If manufacturers think fewer automobiles, computers or televisions will be sold in the coming months, they will cut orders for supplies today.That said, rather than pointing to a drop in end-user demand, both companies pinned much of the blame for their shortfalls on conservative manufacturers wanting to hold onto as much cash as possible. Cutting inventories to the bone achieves this. It is not sustainable over the long run, but it helps companies keep the lights on should financial markets seize up or demand plunge. While both companies said the slowdown occurred globally, it is telling that the biggest hit was in Europe.The two profit warnings could be false signals of an economic slowdown. If consumers keep buying cars, toys and televisions, supply chains will have to be restocked. The same could happen if continuing concerns about the stability and liquidity of the financial system abate.Yet financial imbalances have been building for years, so they are unlikely to be resolved overnight. And when corporate treasurers are worried about their cash positions, they are not making big investments or hiring. Even if the alerts from DuPont and T.I. are a result of inventory reductions rather than falling demand, they suggest a trend that could feed on itself and hit other companies’ profits.For the third quarter, earnings in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index showed almost 18 percent year-on-year growth, Standard & Poor’s says. For the fourth quarter, though, more than twice as many companies have indicated earnings will be below expectations than above. Estimates of yearly earnings growth for the quarter, meanwhile, have been declining and now stand below 10 percent. If DuPont and T.I. are any indication, that downward trend has further to go.'"
"'11-12-12,'0','A dog that ran to retrieve a Frisbee jumped into the Hudson River on Sunday afternoon, but it was quickly rescued by a police boat.The dog, a 2 ½-year-old Airedale terrier, had been playing with its owner, identified as Scott Kariya, on a pier at 13th Street in Greenwich Village, according to the police.At some point the Frisbee skipped off the ground and went into the water. The dog, whose name is Bodhi, went in after it and was unable to climb out, the police said.The police were called, and a boat from the harbor unit as well as Emergency Service Unit officers headed to the waterfront about 4 p.m. The officers found Mr. Kariya on a piling trying to rescue the dog.Officer Benjamin Reiver of the harbor unit maneuvered the front of his boat under the pier, while Officer Kevin Fedynak hauled the dog onto the boat using a device known as a dog noose.The boat then went to the piling and picked up Mr. Kariya, who was helped aboard, the police said.Bodhi, who was wrapped in towels and warmed in the cabin, and Mr. Kariya were unhurt, the police said.'"
"'11-12-12,'0','“What it has done is injected an enormous amount of stress into the campaign system,” said Bill Miller, a longtime political consultant and lobbyist in Austin who works with both Republicans and Democrats. “It’s just like a snow globe that’s been turned upside down. All this stuff is in the air, and it’s slowly going to settle down, but you don’t where and you don’t know why.”The two sets of maps at the heart of the dispute — one drawn by the Republican-controlled Legislature and the other by the federal judges in San Antonio — each pose distinct advantages and drawbacks for Republicans and Democrats, as well as Hispanic and black voters.The state’s boom in population — census data in 2010 showed it had grown by 20.6 percent since 2000 — gave Texas four new seats in Congress, for a total of 36. The Legislature-drawn maps would give Democrats fewer Congressional and State House seats than the maps created by the three-judge panel, which could deliver to Democrats as many as four additional seats in Congress and about a dozen in the State House. Several minority groups and lawmakers argued that the Legislature’s maps did not reflect growth in the state’s Hispanic and black populations, and violated minority voting rights laws. Attorney General Greg Abbott and Republican leaders maintain that no court has found the Legislature’s maps to violate any law and say that the federal panel in San Antonio exceeded its authority in issuing its own maps.“This is all about the changing demographics in Texas and what that means for partisan politics,” said Mark P. Jones, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston. “In Texas, most of the growth in population that has resulted in Texas’s four additional Congressional seats is a result of a growth of the Hispanic population. But this Hispanic population generally votes Democratic. At least a segment of the Republican Party is trying to keep the growing Hispanic electorate from negatively impacting their power in the state for as long as possible.”Gov. Rick Perry signed the Legislature’s maps into law in June and July. Minority groups sued the state in federal court in San Antonio, charging that those maps discriminated against minorities.But Texas and other states with a history of racial discrimination cannot put new maps in place without federal approval. So, the state had asked a federal court in Washington to approve the Legislature-drawn maps, but the court refused, prompting the San Antonio judicial panel to create an interim map so that the elections could proceed. The federal judges in Washington, in their ruling last month, faulted the state for using an improper methodology to determine whether the Legislature’s maps hurt minority representation.Meanwhile, the Justice Department, whose civil rights division also found the state’s maps to discriminate against minorities, has become a central figure in the dispute. The Texas attorney general accused it this month of delaying the federal-approval process in an effort to have the court-drawn maps imposed, a claim the agency denies.For the most part, reaction to the Supreme Court’s decision on Friday to take up the matter tracked along party lines, with Democrats expressing some disappointment and Republicans feeling pleased. State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, a San Antonio Democrat who is the chairman of the Mexican-American Legislative Caucus, one of the groups that sued the state over redistricting, said in a statement that they were “deeply concerned about the potential disruption of the 2012 election schedule.”On a practical level, the developments on Friday created a sense of uncertainty that spanned the aisles, particularly when it came to any decisions lawmakers may have made about their political futures based on the court-drawn maps.State Representative Aaron Peña, a Republican who represents part of Hidalgo County in South Texas, announced late last month that he was not seeking re-election, citing his redrawn district as a primary reason. The Legislature’s maps put Mr. Peña, a former Democrat, in a 52 percent Democratic district, while the court-drawn maps placed him in a 75 percent Democratic district that he felt was unwinnable by any Republican.But the Supreme Court in effect changed Mr. Peña’s political prospects.“I’m going to re-examine the question of whether or not I should run,” Mr. Peña said on Sunday. “About a week before the ruling I had ended my relationships with my campaign staff, and the same is true for the some of the primary donors who have supported me over the years. As soon as the court ruling hit the Internet, I received over 50 calls from people asking me to reconsider.”'"
"'11-12-12,'0','Leaders from both parties and both chambers of Congress want to extend the payroll tax cut. Many lawmakers also want to extend jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed, who will begin to lose assistance early next year unless Congress acts. The cost would range from $34 billion to $55 billion or more, depending on specifics of the legislation.Democrats see an urgent need for extending the benefits. The average duration of unemployment, now 40.9 weeks, is the longest in more than 60 years, the Labor Department says.On a separate track, House and Senate negotiators have nearly finished work on an omnibus spending bill to finance most of the government through the remainder of the current fiscal year, which began in October. A stopgap spending bill, adopted last month, runs through Friday.In addition, Congress is facing a deadline for action on Medicare. Unless lawmakers step in, doctors treating Medicare patients will see a 27 percent cut in reimbursements in January.House Republicans would block the cut and replace it with increases of 1 percent a year in 2012 and 2013. That would cost $39 billion, the budget office estimates. The cost of a 10-year fix, $300 billion or more, is so high that Congress is not seriously considering it.A statutory formula sets annual goals for Medicare spending on doctors’ services. When actual spending exceeds the goals, payments to doctors are supposed to be reduced. If Congress intervenes to block a cut — as it often does — Medicare is supposed to recoup the money by making deeper cuts in future years.Medicare payments to doctors have a direct impact on beneficiaries. AARP and other advocates for older Americans say they fear that some beneficiaries would lose access to their doctors and that fewer doctors would see Medicare patients if payments were reduced.Congress also hopes to grant a reprieve to millions of middle-income Americans facing the alternative minimum tax, originally aimed at high earners. The cost of providing such tax relief for a year could be more than $135 billion, the budget office has said. Without a change in the law, more than 30 million Americans could be hit by the tax in 2012, up from fewer than 5 million taxpayers this year.A fierce fight has broken out in Congress over how to pay for these big-ticket items and whether to use the savings from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, known as overseas contingency operations, or OCO.Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, refers to Uncle OCO — a rich uncle who may hold the key to breaking the deadlock in Congress over taxes and spending. “OCO is the perfect place to go” for money needed to deal with the payroll tax cut and Medicare payments to doctors, Ms. Pelosi said.Representative James E. Clyburn, Democrat of South Carolina, said that war savings could be used “not just for the payroll tax extension but for unemployment insurance as well,” and for doctors’ payments under Medicare.Many Republicans say this would amount to an accounting gimmick, because it claims to save money that was never going to be spent.“Only in Washington can you increase spending and call it a cut,” said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. “This is the kind of fraudulent accounting that has caused Americans to lose faith in Washington.”Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said he was so concerned about cuts in Medicare payments to doctors that he was willing to use war cost savings to wipe out the debt that Congress has accumulated by repeatedly overriding scheduled reductions in payments for doctors’ services.“What I’m proposing is using one budgetary gimmick to pay for another — specifically, using funds budgeted for the wars and wiping clean the bad debt accumulated” under the Medicare formula, Mr. Kyl said. Congress can then devise a new system to pay doctors, and any increases in fees should be “fully offset with real savings,” he said.Money for the wars is not sitting idle in a Treasury account that can be tapped for other purposes. The anticipated savings reflect the difference between what the Pentagon will actually spend and projections made by the Congressional Budget Office. The projections were based on an assumption that war spending would continue at the current level, $159 billion in 2011, and total $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years, with an allowance for inflation.Critics, including Speaker John A. Boehner, say those savings are phony because no one expects the wars to go on for a decade.“I have made it pretty clear that those savings that are coming to us as a result of the wind-down of the war in Iraq and the war in Afghanistan should be banked, should not be used to offset other spending,” Mr. Boehner said.'"
"'11-12-12,'0','A state tax agent who specialized in investigating the trafficking of illegal cigarettes was shot to death by her husband, a former New York police officer, the authorities said on Sunday.The body of the investigator, Tracey Young, 42, was discovered by the police and paramedics shortly after 11 p.m. Saturday in her apartment on the eighth floor of 143-41 84th Drive, in Briarwood, Queens. She had been shot several times in the head and torso, and was pronounced dead at the scene.Early Sunday, Ms. Young’s husband, Clarence Cash, 49, turned himself in to the police and was charged with murder and criminal possession of a weapon, according to a spokeswoman for the Queens district attorney’s office.Ms. Young worked in the Criminal Investigations Division of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. She was involved in surveillance work and undercover stings against illicit cigarette importers. “She was an energetic, enthusiastic, constantly upbeat investigator,” said William Comiskey, a former deputy commissioner of the department. “Her focus was on combating bootleg cigarettes, and it put her into regular contact with people who had the potential for doing violence. She is really going to be missed.”Ms. Young was also the president of the board of the homeowners’ association for her building, an eight-floor brick apartment house.

"'11-12-12,'0','While there may still be chapters that Mr. Gingrich will fight to keep closed, so far he is proving to be something of a Teflon candidate as scrutiny of his record and personal life fails to erode his standing in the polls, defying naysayers who predict that his current dominance of the Republican field will be short-lived.“I can’t imagine what dirt they’ll dig up on Newt that hasn’t already been dug up,” said Jeff Knollenberg, another supporter who visited his headquarters. “There’s not going to be any surprises, I think.”Attacked in Saturday’s debate by five other Republican hopefuls over inflammatory remarks he made about the Middle East, his previous support for a health care mandate and, implicitly, his two divorces, Mr. Gingrich parried each one while keeping his cool.Mitt Romney, armed with research that Mr. Gingrich, in a past geeky moment, had advocated a lunar colony to mine minerals, said, “I’m not in favor of spending that kind of money.”But Mr. Gingrich turned the laugh line against Mr. Romney with a high-minded rejoinder. “I’m proud of trying to find things that give young people a reason to study science and math and technology,” he said.Many people inside and outside the Gingrich campaign assumed early on that he would be most vulnerable because of his marital history, including an admission of infidelity.“The way we look at it,” Mr. Hammond said Sunday morning, “someone sitting in a church right now in the middle of Iowa is talking to somebody about Newt Gingrich. ‘Did you see his wife on TV last night? That’s the third one.’ ”Mr. Gingrich has repeatedly said that he is not perfect and that there are episodes he regrets. “There are periods of my life I’ve had to seek forgiveness and reconcile with God for,” he said last month in an interview in New Hampshire. “But if you look at who I am today, I think I can withstand scrutiny as well as anyone else in the field.”His candor seems to be working even with social conservatives, who seem more interested in choosing a hard-edged opponent to face President Obama. Recent polls of Iowa voters showed Mr. Gingrich with the largest share of support from Christian evangelicals.Unlike most of the other candidates, whose handlers have often shielded them from the news media, Mr. Gingrich has made himself available for reporters’ questions at nearly all of his appearances. Opening headquarters in Greenville, S.C., last month, he requested questions from the press before calling on some of the 100 supporters gathered in a parking lot.At the most damaging moment so far for him, when Bloomberg News reported he had earned up to $1.8 million consulting for Freddie Mac, Mr. Gingrich argued before reporters that he had not been a lobbyist. The issue seems to be fading among rank-and-file Republican voters, who are less concerned about Mr. Gingrich’s past as a Washington insider than his potential to take on Mr. Obama forcefully.And the campaign intends to continue to make Mr. Gingrich accessible. It is planning a bus with room for the news media — something no other candidate has done — and the joke is that it will be the “Newt Talk Express” a nod to Senator John McCain’s 2000 Straight Talk Express, on which he often he gabbed for hours with reporters.Mr. Gingrich recently requested transcripts of Franklin D. Roosevelt’s press conferences to study his ability to influence his coverage. Reporters often quoted President Roosevelt without identifying him.Even though Mr. Gingrich publicly insists that he will take the high road with a positive campaign that does not criticize other Republicans, he recently strayed from that vow, offering himself as an anonymous source in a New Hampshire newspaper last week to reply to criticism by John H. Sununu, a former aide to President George H. W. Bush who, as a Romney surrogate, has called Mr. Gingrich “untrustworthy and unprincipled.”Mr. Sununu told the newspaper, The Union Leader, that Mr. Gingrich supported a tax increase deal that the first President Bush made with Democrats in 1990, then reversed himself. The newspaper, quoting a source identified as “a senior aide in the Gingrich campaign,” elaborately rebutted this account.Mr. Hammond said the source was actually Mr. Gingrich, who did not want to be identified to avoid the impression he was getting into a fight with the Romney camp.'"

"'11-12-12,'0','Nobody familiar with Europe’s history can look at this resurgence of hostility without feeling a shiver. Yet there may be worse things happening.Right-wing populists are on the rise from , where the Freedom Party (whose leader used to have neo-Nazi connections) runs neck-and-neck in the polls with established parties, to , where the anti-immigrant True Finns party had a strong electoral showing last April. And these are rich countries whose economies have held up fairly well. Matters look even more ominous in the poorer nations of Central and Eastern Europe.Last month the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development documented a sharp drop in public support for democracy in the “new E.U.” countries, the nations that joined the after the fall of the . Not surprisingly, the loss of faith in democracy has been greatest in the countries that suffered the deepest economic slumps.And in at least one nation, , democratic institutions are being undermined as we speak.One of Hungary’s major parties, Jobbik, is a nightmare out of the 1930s: it’s anti-Roma (Gypsy), it’s anti-Semitic, and it even had a paramilitary arm. But the immediate threat comes from Fidesz, the governing center-right party.Fidesz won an overwhelming Parliamentary majority last year, at least partly for economic reasons; Hungary isn’t on the euro, but it suffered severely because of large-scale borrowing in foreign currencies and also, to be frank, thanks to mismanagement and corruption on the part of the then-governing left-liberal parties. Now Fidesz, which rammed through a new Constitution last spring on a party-line vote, seems bent on establishing a permanent hold on power.The details are complex. Kim Lane Scheppele, who is the director of ’s Law and Public Affairs program — and has been following the Hungarian situation closely — tells me that Fidesz is relying on overlapping measures to suppress opposition. A proposed election law creates gerrymandered districts designed to make it almost impossible for other parties to form a government; judicial independence has been compromised, and the courts packed with party loyalists; state-run media have been converted into party organs, and there’s a crackdown on independent media; and a proposed constitutional addendum would effectively criminalize the leading leftist party.Taken together, all this amounts to the re-establishment of authoritarian rule, under a paper-thin veneer of democracy, in the heart of Europe. And it’s a sample of what may happen much more widely if this depression continues.It’s not clear what can be done about Hungary’s authoritarian slide. The , to its , has been very much on the case, but this is essentially a European matter. The European Union missed the chance to head off the power grab at the start — in part because the new Constitution was rammed through while Hungary held the Union’s rotating presidency. It will be much harder to reverse the slide now. Yet Europe’s leaders had better try, or risk losing everything they stand for.And they also need to rethink their failing economic policies. If they don’t, there will be more backsliding on democracy — and the breakup of the euro may be the least of their worries.'"
"'11-12-12,'0','You are right to recognize that online copyright theft has had a devastating impact on the creative industries (“Going After the Pirates,” editorial, Nov. 27). But we don’t agree that the proposed bills in Congress could “stymie legitimate speech.” To the contrary, the bills are specifically designed to focus on the worst of the worst sites whose model is predicated on theft.Moreover, there is extensive due process afforded to accused sites under the bills. They require the attorney general to extensively document why a site meets the bills’ tight standards — pulled from existing law and Supreme Court cases — and a federal judge must approve any order.Similarly, if companies serving pirate sites choose not to take action voluntarily, copyright owners must state their case and persuade a federal judge to issue a court order before payment processors or ad networks can be compelled to stop servicing the site.There may be different ways to craft a sensible bill, and we’re all for finding the best way, but one thing is clear: the status quo isn’t working. These illicit sites are among the culprits behind the music industry’s more than 50 percent decline in revenues during the last decade, resulting in 15,000 layoffs and fewer resources to invest in new bands.It should be unacceptable to any of us involved in legitimate commerce online that a rogue Web site based outside the United States — but hawking American products or copyrighted works — can currently escape our laws.'"
"'11-12-12,'0','“Not that we didn’t know that before,” guard Brandon Moore said of Ryan’s speech, “but we’re trying to make a playoff push here.”The lone disconcerting development occurred on, of all things, an interception by Jim Leonhard. A do-everything safety and defensive signal caller, Leonhard sustained a right knee injury that will probably sideline him for the remainder of the season.The playoff push that Moore mentioned has gathered force, and on Sunday, it evolved into a full-on shove. Of the four teams that began the day in a virtual tie for the A.F.C.’s final wild-card berth, the Jets (8-5) were the only one to win. In Green Bay, the Packers routed the Raiders (7-6). In Cincinnati, Houston shocked the Bengals (7-6) with a last-second touchdown. In Nashville, a potential game-winning drive by the Titans (7-6) stalled at the New Orleans 5.A man with great comic timing, Slauson did not say those words deadpan. He was beaming. It was Slauson who said recently that the Jets had pushed “the panic button” after bottoming out in a loss to Denver on Nov. 17.Since then, the offensive line has allowed but three sacks — all on Sunday. Since then, the Jets have won three straight games heading into next Sunday’s game against Philadelphia.“We’ve got to go face the Dream Team,” LaDainian Tomlinson said, smiling.Mark Sanchez ended the game on the sideline wearing a winter hat and a smile, having been replaced by Mark Brunell under happy circumstances. Becoming the first Jets quarterback to throw for two touchdowns and run for two in the same game, Sanchez executed a smart game plan intended to exploit the Chiefs’ pass rush.The screen pass, though hardly practiced last week, was crucial. A 36-yard catch-and-run by Shonn Greene, who also rushed for 129 yards and a score, set up Sanchez’s 4-yard touchdown pass to Santonio Holmes. A 19-yard reception by Tomlinson closed out the Jets’ first-half scoring.Tomlinson’s touchdown served another purpose. It satisfied a goal he set before the game when, he said, he told Greene, “Let’s be the guys that put the ball on our back and make some plays.”All week, the Jets’ linebackers could tell what was at stake just by looking at a page given to them by their position coach, Bob Sutton. A former head coach at Army, Sutton typed up a sheet with quotations from the military theorist Sun Tzu under the heading “Death Ground.” Sutton told them, “You’re going to fight, or you’re going to die.”Figuratively speaking, the Jets obeyed him. They fought. They swarmed. Against a woeful Chiefs offense that had scored two touchdowns in its previous 58 possessions, the Jets submitted the most dominant defensive first half in franchise historyThey allowed one first down and negative-15 net yards passing, which, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, was the fewest in an opening half since 2004. The Chiefs were so dazed that they just stood by the line of scrimmage as the first-half clock expired.Kansas City self-destructed, too, collecting mistakes like rare stamps. Over one third-quarter stretch, the Chiefs committed seven penalties in 10 plays, including an unsportsmanlike-conduct call on Coach Todd Haley. They mis-hit an onside kick. Dwayne Bowe dropped a ball in the end zone on fourth down.He added, “I don’t know that it’s even close.”At their worst, the Jets might have rivaled it. Their offense has disappeared for drives, quarters and games at a time, but on Sunday, it was not by accident that the Jets converted all five red-zone chances or scored 28 first-half points.“The best defense is to have the offense on the field,” linebacker Calvin Pace said.Maybe so, but one would not argue another point — that the Jets’ best defense includes Leonhard, who appeared to have sustained a season-ending leg injury for the second straight December.The Jets offered no details on the severity, but Ryan sounded discouraged, as did Revis, who said he had heard that Leonhard would miss the rest of the season.The Jets have been let down before. They have been teased before. They have endured illusions, expecting breakouts when none have come. But mostly, they have waited, waited for a chance to look more primed for a postseason run than foolish for envisioning one. It came on Sunday, and they held on tight.'"

"'11-12-13,'0','Dr. Samuel L. Stanley, president of Stony Brook, said that the donation, to be given over seven years, was more than triple the amount the university typically raised from all donors in a year. The university is 54 years old, he said, but “this is our rebirth day.”Like most of the nation’s public universities, SUNY has faced declining state support, but unlike most of them, SUNY cannot compensate by raising tuition. In New York, the Legislature sets tuition at state universities, and for years it has resisted the rapid increases seen around the country.That made SUNY a bargain, but it also squeezed the university’s budget, resulting in fewer class offerings, larger class sizes and inadequate facilities. Administrators worried aloud that the system would fall behind its peers.“There was no point to continue to support an institution that the state was backing away from,” Mr. Simons said in an interview at the Simons Foundation’s offices near Madison Square in Manhattan. “Inexpensive access to mediocrity is not doing anyone such a favor.”This year, the Legislature and Mr. Cuomo enacted a law that allowed SUNY and the City University of New York to raise tuition by $300 a year for five years and also committed the state to maintaining its support for the universities. Full-time, in-state tuition at SUNY is set to climb to $6,170 in 2014-15, up from $4,970 last year, and for the first time, the system’s four main research campuses — Stony Brook, Binghamton, Albany and Buffalo — can also charge somewhat more than its smaller universities to out-of-state students.Dr. Stanley said the Simons gift was being tailored to the areas in which Stony Brook lags noticeably behind the most prestigious public universities around the country: the student-to-faculty ratio, the number of endowed professorships and the life sciences.“We want to be a top-25 research university,” he said. “There’s no reason why New York shouldn’t have that kind of flagship public university.”Public universities generally raise far less money from donors than private universities do, but Mr. Simons said he saw support for public schools as vital, “especially in these days when private universities are so unbelievably expensive.” As for Stony Brook, he said, “We have a warm spot in our hearts for that particular institution.”Marilyn Simons, the president of their foundation, went to Stony Brook as an undergraduate and received a doctorate in economics there. Mr. Simons, who earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from M.I.T. and a Ph.D., also in mathematics, from the University of California, Berkeley, was appointed chairman of Stony Brook’s math department in 1968.But in 1978, he left academia for finance, becoming one of the first highly successful “quants” — quantitative analysts who use sophisticated math to guide investments. In 1982, he founded Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund firm; though he stepped down as chief executive two years ago, he remains chairman.In October, Forbes magazine estimated his worth at $10.6 billion, making him the 30th wealthiest person in the country.Now semi-retired, he spends more time on charitable work.“It is fun,” he said, “but it’s not as much fun as it seems like it would be, since we have to say no a lot.”'"

"'11-12-13,'0','Tensions over the conflicting claims of control came to a head on Saturday when General Hiftar’s convoy, on its way to the international airport, was attacked as he sped through a checkpoint run by fighters from the western mountain town of Zintan, according to rebel leaders and an army spokesman.Col. Mukhtar Farnana, head of the military council in western Libya, accused General Hiftar of “trying to take the airport by force” and called for an investigation into the clashes. He derided the national army as little more than a collection of militias from eastern Libya, where the interim government is based, that behaved like “bodyguards for Hiftar.”“This is not how the national army should behave, and we are waiting to see what the N.T.C. and the Ministry of Defense say because the situation on the ground right now is not bearable,” he said. “We are waiting for answers about what they will do with Hiftar.”Col. Ahmed Omar Bani, a spokesman for the Defense Ministry, disputed the militiamen’s version of events. The Zintan militia was not even involved in the fight, he said, which he said had pitted the army against “a group of uneducated men” who were “thinking about killing Gen. Khalifa Hiftar.”He warned that General Hiftar enjoyed respect among army officers and that an attack on him “would cause a disaster for Libya.”The Libyan National Army is in the earliest stages of its development. Many of its members are defectors from Colonel Qaddafi’s armed forces, but they are ill-equipped and poorly trained. The Transitional National Council is urging militiamen to join the army or lay down their arms and return to civilian life. It is an initiative that militia commanders say they support, although there appear to be widespread misgivings about the current force, which on Saturday appeared unable to go head to head with one of the country’s more powerful rebel groups.As the clash unfolded, scores of soldiers rushed to the scene of the clashes in their own cars, battered sedans or old station wagons, haphazardly waving rifles and wearing ill-fitting and sometimes mismatched fatigues. Many fired randomly into the air.Colonel Bani said that the size of the army was currently unknown and that the force operated without a chief of staff, like “a body without a head.” Much of the confusion and tension among the rebels also stems from the lack of a clear chain of command within the fledgling army since the assassination of General Younes.“After Abdul Fattah Younes was killed, a new head of the army should have been chosen right away,” said Colonel Farnana. “The N.T.C. must choose the head, and after that we can gather together the body.”Both the army spokesman and the Zintan militia commander at the airport, Mukhtar al-Akhdar, agreed that the clashes began when General Hiftar’s convoy tried to pass through the checkpoint, tucked under a highway overpass. The militia has guarded the airport since August, and its members wanted the convoy to properly identify itself, said Mr. Akhdar, who also accused the army of trying to seize the airport, a valuable strategic asset, “by force.”That confrontation sparked clashes that ricocheted between the highway checkpoint and an army base that General Hiftar used as his headquarters through the night, the militiamen said.The army had arrested two members of the Zintan militia in the initial confrontation and taken them to the base, and the Zintan militia soon followed, exchanging fire with soldiers. Mr. Akhdar said he “gave Hiftar a few hours to release our men,” a deadline that the army answered with a counterattack on the checkpoint, killing two fighters and leaving the concrete walls of the underpass pocked with bullet holes.The militiamen stormed General Hiftar’s compound and took prisoners, using them as bargaining chips to free their two men, Mr. Akhdar said. In the tense final moments, his forces surrounded the general and his men near the back entrance of the base, he said, but let them leave unharmed on the insistence of the Defense Ministry.“We told Hiftar, ‘You are free, but do not come back to the airport,’ ” Mr. Akhdar said. “We had them and could have killed them all, but we gave them their freedom.”'"
"'11-12-13,'0','In combination with sanctions imposed by the Arab League, the European Union and the United States, Turkey’s own tough measures — including freezing the Syrian government’s assets — are slowly beginning to choke Mr. Assad’s rule.But businesspeople here complain that the rupture cuts both ways.On Monday, more than 150 Turkish truck drivers protested after they were forced to leave their vehicles in Syria and walk to the Turkish border; Damascus had closed down its crossing near Urfa, in eastern Turkey. The drivers told Turkey’s NTV news channel that Syrian looters had stolen their tires and batteries. Turkish companies, which relied on Syria as a transit route to the Middle East, have begun bypassing Syria, shipping goods via Iraq and the Mediterranean instead.Syria last week unilaterally suspended its free trade agreement with Turkey, retaliating to the Turkish sanctions by introducing taxes of up to 30 cents on Turkish goods entering Syria. Turkey did the same.Here in this large industrial center of 1.7 million people, everyone from olive vendors to owners of large textile conglomerates complained that the shifting geopolitics was proving bad for business, even if, as Turkey’s economy minister,  Zafer Caglayan,  said last week, Syria suffers more than Turkey, which is its second-largest export market after China.Turkish sellers are harder hit than buyers: imports from Syria amounted to just 0.3 percent of Turkey’s total last year, while 10.6 percent of Syria’s came from Turkey.Turkey’s decision to become the voice of regional outrage against the Assad government has also divided the identities of some in a city where Turkish and Arab culture have commingled for centuries.Emre Hadimogullari, 22, an electrical engineering student in Gaziantep, is so irate at the Turkish government’s policy in Syria that he has grown a long beard in protest. Mr. Hadimogullari is an Alawite whose grandparents found themselves Turkish citizens when his hometown, Samandag, formerly part of Syria, was ceded to Turkey in 1923. Mr. Hadimogullari expressed a kinship with Mr. Assad, also an Alawite, and said he believed that the reports of atrocities in Syria were exaggerated. Turkey, he insisted, should stop playing the part of regional police officer.“Turkey should mind its own business and stop interfering in another country’s affairs,” he said.Huseyin Qebed, a marketing analyst from Aleppo and one of few Syrians remaining in Gaziantep, said the crisis had not harmed his relationship with his Turkish friends, though these days he avoided talking about politics. The Turkish sanctions, he added, were harming all Syrians, including the demonstrators whom Turkey purported to support. “The sanctions won’t solve anything,” he said. “Costs are rising for everyone.”Turkish businesspeople here also questioned the wisdom of sanctions, even as they acknowledged that Mr. Assad’s brutality could not go unanswered.Cengiz Akinal, vice president of Akinal Bella, a large shoe manufacturer that imports bows for its shoes from artisans in Syria, said that the Turkish tax increase on goods from Syria was forcing him to import bows from China. On the upside, he said, Arab League countries boycotting Syrian shoe companies were turning to his.Mr. Akinal, whose ancestors imported leather from Syria during the Ottoman Empire and produced shoes for the sultans, said that Akinal Bella, which exports about 70 percent of its shoes to Middle Eastern countries, had benefited handsomely from Turkey’s courtship of the Arab world. But he warned that Turkey’s newly assertive stance could backfire.“I want the rebellion in Syria to be over,” he said. “Bad relations with Middle East countries are bad for business.”Some businesspeople said they expected to wait years before Syria and other countries upended in the Arab Spring, like Egypt and Libya, would stop being buffeted by unrest, rebuild their economies and become attractive markets.Mehmet Ali Mutafoglu is vice president of the Akteks Group, a large textile company that has two factories in Syria making products such as synthetic yarn and cotton. He sells to the Syrian market as well as to Europe and the Middle East. Syria’s unstable economy had depressed demand there by 40 percent since March, when the uprising began.Mr. Mutafoglu, who still travels regularly to his Syrian factories, said he had noticed a conspicuous cooling of many Syrians’ ardor for Turkey, which had been intense just months ago, as Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan presented a modern Muslim face to the world. “Before the crisis, Syrians loved us,” he said. “If Erdogan had run for election in Syria, he would have won 99 percent of the vote. Now he would get 1 percent.”Fetullah Askin, general manager of Altinoluk, a travel agency here that used to run four buses daily between Gaziantep and Aleppo, said that now there were none, due to security concerns. To offset the decline, Mr. Askin is promoting trips to Mecca.Despite the economic sacrifices, Mr. Askin said that the repression of the Assad regime justified the Turkish government’s taking action. “Syrians are our brothers,” he said. “When one brother makes a mistake, we have to try and help him fix it.”'"

And as a Shiite leader who some say owes his current position to Iran’s backing, he has not made clear if Washington, or Tehran, will wield more influence.A Western diplomat who has worked closely with Mr. Maliki said the prime minister’s mind-set still reflected the years after the American invasion when 3,000 Iraqi civilians were dying each month and sectarian war threatened to rip the country apart.“He sees himself as fighting since 2006 to pull the country out of the brink,” the diplomat said.But Mr. Maliki has also taken steps to put his stamp on the Green Zone, the physical center of government whose geography and very name became shorthand for the cloistered American presence. His son, Ahmed, has overseen raids evicting Western companies from the Green Zone in recent weeks. As the prime minister left for the , onerous new security procedures were put in place at the few entrances into the area.That, and the scale and secrecy of the arrests in October and November, of 600 former Baathists, have raised new tensions in Iraq’s suspicious political atmosphere. They have fanned fears that Mr. Maliki will use the threat of terrorism and unrest as a pretext to strike political foes.The Iraqi government said the arrests had been prompted by a tip from ’s transitional government that said documents revealed Col. was working with insurgents to stage a coup. Mr. Maliki has denied any sectarian or political motives behind the sweep, pointing out that both Shiites and Sunnis were arrested. In an interview with Iraq’s official television channel, he said the raids had captured loyalists to Saddam Hussein who were conspiring with , not peaceful, low-level party apparatchiks.“We do not have space in our government for those plotting against our government,” he said.A person briefed on the raid by Iraqi security forces said some of the detainees were in fact military and intelligence officials from the old government. Other names on the target lists, however, included laborers, political adversaries of the government, the elderly — even dead people.“It’s highly unlikely to be much validity behind” the coup plot, said a Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, to avoid upsetting relations with the Iraqi government. “Baathism here is a symbol that Maliki uses as a bogyman. It gives them the leeway to go around arresting people. It’s about a climate of fear.”Mr. Maliki’s signal achievement since he first won office in 2006 has been consolidating control of the security forces, reducing violence through a willingness to crack down on Shiite militias from strongholds in the southern city of Basra. The defeat of the militias demonstrated to Iraqis, particularly the Sunnis, that Mr. Maliki would evenly target all insurgent groups, regardless of sect, and bolstered his credentials as a nationalist.As Iraq’s commander in chief, he sometimes micromanages the forces under his control. He pays informers out of his own pocket for intelligence and sometimes sends orders to commanders in the field by text message, officials say.But in a country where political leaders regularly fly off to second homes in or , Mr. Maliki often works through the night in his Baghdad offices and has a steel-trap memory for dates, names and conversations. His family — wife, four daughters and a son — all live in Iraq, while many leading politicians have moved their families abroad.If he eschews a cult of personality like that built by Mr. Hussein, his close control over Iraq’s police and army and his influence over the country’s judicial system have drawn calls that Mr. Maliki is becoming too powerful.His government has come under criticism from rights groups for running secret jails, widespread abuses inside Iraq’s detention system, and for jailing political adversaries, such as journalists and demonstrators calling for government reforms.In interviews, a handful of the people arrested in the recent Baathist sweeps spoke angrily about the justice system.“It’s unbelievable,” said Abu Muamel Bahadli, 60, a retired teacher from Basra who was arrested. “They don’t have an idea about who is the real enemy. They also want to keep the people distracted from their corruption. I spent two weeks and then they released me without one question.”Nearly nine years after the American invasion broke the Baath Party’s stranglehold on power, the specter of Baathism remains a ghost that Iraq cannot seem to exorcise. The Baath Party staged coups in 1963 and 1968 to seize power, and its persistent, if shadowy, presence in Sunni areas of the country offers a reminder that few Iraqi leaders leave office peacefully.In late October, more than 100 professors at Tikrit University — in Mr. Hussein’s hometown — were fired for alleged Baathist connections.“You can’t live in a democratic system in this way,” said former Prime Minister , a former Baathist himself who frequently clashes with the prime minister. “It is painful to see what is happening to this country.”Despite strains of Sunni disenfranchisement, Sunni Arab politicians hold powerful posts in government, including speaker of Parliament, deputy prime minister and vice president. (A Kurd serves as president.)And, as Mr. Maliki frequently points out in speeches, deadly vestiges of Mr. Hussein’s government do continue to stalk Iraq.But when the Iraqi forces arrested former Baathists, they also hauled in suspects like Jasim Nusaif, a 71-year-old retired bureaucrat with and a tendency to faint on his morning walks to buy bread.Mr. Nusaif’s wife and son said he was an employee in Iraq’s Water Ministry who was expelled from the Baath Party in the early 1980s for refusing to volunteer for the front lines in the grinding Iran-Iraq war. He retired from the government and worked for a while at a minibus depot.Mostly, his family said, he now just collected his pension and read the newspapers at home in the heavily Sunni neighborhood of Adhamiya, a jumble of faded colonial mansions where bombs still rip through crowds.“He’s old and he’s sick. He just sits in the ,” said his son, Mohammed Jasim. “I can’t believe how a 71-year-old man could carry out a military coup against the government.”'"
"'11-12-13,'0','Lee Enterprises, which publishes 48 daily newspapers, including The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Monday to refinance nearly $1 billion in debt.Lee is the third-largest newspaper publisher to file for bankruptcy, behind the MediaNews Group in 2010 and the Tribune Company in 2008, as readership and advertising revenue continue to dwindle across the industry.Lee was founded in 1890 in Ottumwa, Iowa, by A.W. Lee. Most of the company’s newspapers trace their beginnings to the mid-1800s. The luminaries who have worked for the company’s papers include Mark Twain, Willa Cather and Thornton Wilder.The company plans to repay its creditors in full and will use the bankruptcy to essentially extend the maturity of about $1 billion in debt that was coming due in April.Under its plan, the company will push out that repayment to 2015 and 2017, although with higher interest rates, according to court documents.'"
"'11-12-13,'0','“All of that just breeds uncertainty and I think you are just seeing that reflected in the market,” he said.Fitch warned Monday that European politicians were taking a “gradualist” approach to creating a true fiscal union among the 17 euro zone member nations — a protracted effort that Fitch said would impose additional economic and financial burdens on the region. “It means the crisis will continue at varying levels of intensity throughout 2012 and probably beyond,” the agency said.Moody’s said it was putting the sovereign ratings of European Union countries on review for a possible downgrade in the coming months. Standard & Poor’s issued a similar warning last week, saying it could lower the sterling credit ratings of Germany and France and cut other countries’ credit scores as Europe headed into a probable recession next year.Cuts in credit ratings for crucial euro zone countries could play havoc with financing European bailout plans.In United States, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 1.49 percent, or 18.72 points, to 1,236.47. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.34 percent, or 162.87 points, to 12,021.39. The Nasdaq composite index lost 1.31 percent, or 34.59 points, to 2,612.26.American financial stocks as a group were off more than 3 percent, dragged down by Morgan Stanley’s 6 percent plunge, to $15.38, and Citigroup’s 5 percent drop, to $27.22.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 13/32, to 99 27/32, and the yield fell to 2.02 percent from 2.06 percent late Friday.In Europe, the Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed down 3.1 percent, while the FTSE 100 in London fell 1.8 percent. The DAX in Frankfurt lost 3.4 percent and the CAC in Paris fell 2.6 percent.President Nicolas Sarkozy of France acknowledged Monday that a loss of the nation’s triple-A rating could come soon, but said it would not pose an “insurmountable” difficulty. Mr. Sarkozy has made it a priority of his coming presidential campaign to keep the country’s top credit rating, and repeated a pledge to reduce the nation’s debt and deficit without cutting wages and pensions.Mr. Sarkozy’s rival, the Socialist candidate François Hollande, said Monday that he would try to renegotiate the terms of the European deal struck Friday if he were elected president in May, saying the pact would stifle growth.With markets and rating agencies expressing disappointment with last week’s Brussels deal, the spotlight returned to the European Central Bank, the only institution with overall responsibility for maintaining the health and integrity of the euro.Amid last week’s political theater, the central bank took a crucial step to help the biggest European commercial banks by agreeing to provide them with unlimited funds for up to three years.While that may ease the pressure on the financial system, any further downgrade in the credit rating of European governments could escalate the crisis by making it more expensive for the weakest countries to service their debts. It could also make it more difficult for banks in Italy, Spain and even France to get credit from other banks, causing a potential pullback in lending to consumers and businesses at a time when economic growth is already being squeezed.“No one has talked about what the euro zone’s growth strategy is, but economic growth is what does most of the eroding of debt,” said Richard Batty, an investment strategist at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh.Carl B. Weinberg, the chief economist at High Frequency Economics, said some European banks, which had already been selling assets to keep enough money on hand, were now also cutting back on lending. “A contraction of credit has already begun and will get worse,” he said.Many governments and investors still cling to hope that the central bank will ride to the rescue by buying the bonds of troubled governments in Italy and Spain, in an effort to keep their borrowing costs from rising to levels that forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to take international bailouts.But Germany has opposed the move as being outside the bank’s mandate. Mario Draghi, the central bank president, made clear last week that the central bank was loath to take such steps.Keeping the heat on Italy, Spain and Portugal to limit their borrowing, the central bank last week reduced its bond purchases of government debt, according to data disclosed Monday. The bank spent 635 million euros ($850 million) buying bonds on the open market, down from 3.7 billion euros the previous week.Bond trading is typically thin in December, so the central bank probably saw less need to intervene.Still, the total since the European Central Bank began buying government bonds last year stands at 207.5 billion euros — only about a tenth of what the United States Federal Reserve has spent as part of its effort to bolster American growth by adding to the money supply.Moody’s warned Monday that the longer policy makers took an incremental approach to the crisis, “the greater the likelihood of more severe scenarios, including those involving multiple defaults by euro area countries and those additionally involving exits from the euro area.”In Brussels, one potential legal snag arose Monday with the fiscal compact that most European Union members agreed to last week. The agreement calls for tightening the enforcement rules against countries that exceed budget deficit limits of 3 percent of gross domestic product.Fully initiating that plan, however, might require changes to the European Union’s governing treaty, which would require parliamentary approvals beyond the scope of the deal reached in Brussels last week, according to European officials who were not authorized to speak publicly.But Olli Rehn, European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said that most of the changes could be enforced.“The results of this summit are better than first meets the eye,” he said, adding that people “should not underestimate its potential to fundamentally change the landscape of fiscal and economic policy making in Europe.”'"

"'11-12-13,'0','Anthony Hamilton has a voice equally fit for soothing or supplication, and he finds time for both on his steadily engaging, rarely surprising new album, “Back to Love.” Which is just what you want from him, and just what he wants to give you. As an R&B singer upholding a distinctly grown-up masculine ideal — chivalry and constancy, strength and humility — he’s in the business of meeting expectations. So you’ll find him singing here in an imploringly mellow style, his tone conveying the deep-amber viscosity of something you’d pour over your pancakes.He sounds marvelous. And it would be disingenuous to ignore the role that stability, in both the musical and personal sense, plays in his work. Mr. Hamilton is 40, married with a family; he’s also unfettered by any track record of lecherous club hits. “Back to Love” might seem to suggest a prodigal’s return to form, but it really refers to its title track, in which Mr. Hamilton, working an earthy falsetto, lays out a rich premise from the start: “Here we are, in the storm of our lives/ Both posing as strangers who never fell in love.”Behind the album’s thematic consistency is a sort of stealth eclecticism. Its 12 tracks, all partly written by Mr. Hamiton, range in tone and texture from earthy Southern soul to lissome 1990s-style R&B, with beats that nod toward hip-hop. “Sucka for You” awkwardly emulates the sort of funk-pop anthem now associated with Cee Lo Green.Mr. Hamilton sounds truer to himself on “Never Let Go,” a pas de deux of domestic reassurance, featuring Keri Hilson; and “Best of Me,” his rundown of courtly attentions. But he also pulls off the lead single, “Woo,” a testimonial of the so-bad-but-feels-so-good variety, written with and mainly produced by Kenneth Edmonds, a k a Babyface.Mr. Edmonds, a formalist with the insights of a humanist, is a good new partner for Mr. Hamilton. “Pray for Me,” another song bearing the Babyface imprint, finds Mr. Hamilton both pleading with an estranged lover and entreating the heavens, as if unsure which tactic will work best.It’s a moment that rings with genuine desperation on an album that reeks of reassurances. And it has a follow-up of sorts in “Life Has a Way,” the closing track, produced by James Poyser. “There’s always room left to grow,” Mr. Hamilton sings near the song’s fade-out ending. He doesn’t make it sound like a welcome challenge, but he’s not flinching, either. NATE CHINENCarl Thomas thrives on tormented love. “I Wish,” the 1999 single that helped give him a million-selling debut album in 2000, agonized over falling for a married woman. And the grainy melancholy in his voice — which suggests John Legend and R. Kelly looking over their shoulders at Marvin Gaye — often signals deep misgivings, even when his romances are going more comfortably.Mr. Thomas, a neo-soul singer who got his start in Chicago, had patchy success with his next two albums, which generally took a more optimistic tone. “Conquer” returns, wisely, to brooding, amid productions that juggle the retro and the futuristic.Its first single, “Don’t Kiss Me,” reaches directly back to plush, orchestral 1970s soul while Mr. Thomas stays wary. “Don’t you kiss me,” he sings, “unless those lips that you kiss me with will say I love you, love you for life.” Another track with cheerful vintage flourishes — scrubbing wah-wah guitar, horn-section buildups — turns out to be a breakup song: “It’s Not the Same,” about a couple growing apart.Mr. Thomas and his producers don’t usually backdate the music so thoroughly. They savor the uneasiness of stranding Mr. Thomas’s old-school singing between eras and emotions. He’s involved with a straying woman (as he was in “I Wish”) in “It Is What It Is,” wrestling with temptation over a choppy programmed beat, whistling synthesizers and an uncomforting plucked harp. The album begins with “The Night Is Yours,” as Mr. Thomas urges a lover to “take this opportunity to make all your dreams come true.” But the music is a minor-key dirge, with an ominous electric lead guitar: a come-on delivered as if it were a warning. “Long Distance Love Affair,” over a boom-bap beat and ricocheting organ chords, is an affirmation of loyalty that’s still riddled with suspicion. In another gloomy melody Mr. Thomas complains “It Ain’t Fair” that a woman he has his eye on is so “perfect, flawless, gorgeous.”The songs often mingle elements of R&B and hip-hop with a spacious, keyboard-laden sound and rock beat. Both the title song of “Conquer,” in which Mr. Thomas vows to “fight you and make you mine just to keep you alive,” and “Running,” which applies sports advice to life — “keep good form, maintain your speed/ endure the pain, believe” — have the billowing pomp of MTV anthems by Seal or Phil Collins. Those songs might have been overbearing, but instead, remembered wounds and self-doubt make them soulful. JON PARELES'"
"'11-12-13,'0','Unions declined, eroding blue-collar bargaining power. The financial industry grew, with paydays heavily weighted toward the top. Corporate culture accepted the growing gap between the executive suite and the factory floor.Falling tax rates on the highest earners added to the net income divide, by allowing top earners to keep more of their pay and increasing their incentive to maximize it.In the decades after World War II, by contrast, the average income of the top 1 percent grew only marginally faster than inflation and significantly slower than middle-class incomes. That combination caused inequality to decline throughout much of the 1950, ’60s and early ’70s.As recently as 1980, only about one-tenth of the nation’s pretax income went to the top 1 percent. By 2000, that share had grown to about 22 percent. It slumped to about 18 percent in 2003, after a market crash, only to rebound by 2007 to levels not achieved since the Roaring ’20s.Pointing to the recent declines at the top, Mr. Kaplan argues the Occupy protesters have accused the wrong villain by focusing on inequality, which he called an inevitable byproduct of growth. “If you want to reduce inequality, all you need to do is put the economy in a recession,” he said. “If you want the economy to do well, as all of us do, then you’ll get more inequality.”But Harry J. Holzer, an economist at Georgetown University, argues much of the recent growth at the top reflects insider privilege instead of real productivity. “The notion that the really high earners are earning it has become very questionable,” he said. “Look at outrageousness of the damage they imposed on the rest of the economy and the cost being born by middle-income Americans.”“There’s been rising income inequality all over the world, but nowhere as much as in the United States,” he said.Critics of the Occupy Wall Street movement say the falling incomes at the top show that concerns about inequality are outdated.“We don’t want to spend years focused on income inequality, only to learn that the financial crisis fixed it for us,” wrote Megan McArdle in a blog post for The Atlantic.But Jared Bernstein, a former Obama administration official, said that after previous market-related dips, income inequality only soared to new highs. “If you believed the inequality problem had been solved in the early 2000s, you would have been proven terribly wrong,” said Mr. Bernstein, now of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.While top incomes probably rose in 2010, most analysts doubt they returned to their 2007 peak, since stocks remain about 20 percent lower. Mr. Kaplan argues that new restraints on Wall Street will keep the income shares of the rich below those earlier levels, a view Mr. Bernstein disputes.“The structural forces driving inequality remain very much in place,” he said.The income shares of the top 1 percent became a common metric of inequality after a 2003 study by the economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanel Saez, which traced trends back to 1913. It peaked at 24 percent in 1928, just above its 2007 level. Mr. Saez, of the University of California, Berkeley, sides with those who think the rich will soon get richer.“Barring an economic cataclysm ahead, top earners will be recovering faster than the other 99 percent,” he wrote in an e-mail. “The inequality problem is not going away and won’t until drastic policy changes are made (as happened during the New Deal).”'"
"'11-12-13,'0','More good news for coffee drinkers: A large new study has found that women who drink four or more cups of coffee a day are at reduced risk of endometrial cancer.Endometrial cancer is the most common uterine cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, there are about 46,000 new cases and 8,000 deaths yearly from the disease.Researchers followed 67,470 women aged 34 to 59 at the start of the study from 1980 to 2006. The women recorded dietary details, lifestyle information and medical history. The study was published online Nov. 22 in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.After controlling for dozens of other factors, the scientists found that compared with women who drank less than one cup of coffee a day, those who drank four or more cups had a 25 percent lower risk of endometrial cancer. Neither decaffeinated coffee nor tea drinking was associated with a risk reduction, and the authors drew no conclusions about whether caffeine or some other ingredient in coffee causes the effect.The lead author, Youjin Je, a doctoral student at the Harvard School of Public Health, said that for healthy non-pregnant women, drinking four cups of coffee a day has no known negative effects.But, she said, “a substantial amount of sugar, cream or milk added to coffee can negate the potential benefits.”'"
"'11-12-13,'0','Still, the complexity of the relationship was also in plain view, particularly regarding a split over how to respond to the brutal crackdown in . Mr. Obama has imposed sanctions and called for President to step down, saying his “capacity to retain legitimacy inside Syria, I think, is deeply eroded.” Mr. Maliki, while affirming support for the Syrian people, said he did not have “the right to ask a president to abdicate” and did not favor a trade embargo.Mr. Obama acknowledged there were “some different tactical views in terms of how best to transition to an inclusive, representative government inside of Syria.” But he added that he respected Mr. Maliki’s decision.The White House meetings, and the wreath-laying, were part of a choreographed series of events to draw the war to a close. On Wednesday, the president and his wife, Michelle, will travel to Fort Bragg, N.C., to thank the troops for their service. Next week, a ceremony in Iraq will include the furling of the military’s colors, which signifies the end of the mission.This will be a season of homecomings, Mr. Obama said, as military families around the country are “reunited for the holidays.”In a few weeks, the American military force that invaded almost nine years ago, and still numbered 150,000 when the president took office, will have shriveled to a vestigial presence of military liaison officers and embassy guards. Mr. Obama acknowledged that the embassy in Baghdad would maintain a larger-than-normal security force — a decision that has aroused criticism among some Iraqis. He said that measure was necessary to protect diplomats or American civilians working in the oil sector who might be targeted by militant groups.Mr. Maliki and Mr. Obama sent an indirect warning to not to meddle in Iraq after the Americans leave. Iraq, the prime minister said, speaking through an interpreter, follows a foreign policy “which does not intervene in the affairs of others and does not allow the others to intervene in its own affairs.”Despite his assertion of Iraqi sovereignty, Mr. Maliki made it clear that Iraq would depend on the United States for military equipment and training. His most fervent answer of the news conference came when he made a pitch for Congressional approval of the 18 fighter jets.“The military hardware creates a surrogate relationship with the American military,” said Kenneth M. Pollack, director of the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the . “It also sends a message to Iran.”Unresolved issues include the status of Camp Ashraf, where thousands of dissident Iranians have been labeled terrorists and detained, and what will happen to the last remaining prisoner being held by the American military in Iraq, Ali Musa Daqduq, a Lebanese suspected of being a operative and accused of involvement in a 2007 raid by Shiite militants in Karbala that resulted in the deaths of five American soldiers.Secretary of State , who joined Mr. Obama for his meeting with Mr. Maliki and met later with the foreign minister, , said Mr. Daqduq’s fate was “still a matter of discussion.”Outside the White House, about a thousand supporters of the Iranian dissident group the , known as , rallied to demand that the group be removed from the State Department’s list of terrorist groups, and that the residents of Camp Ashraf be protected. They waved yellow banners and were addressed by , the former secretary of homeland security, and other former senior officials, who support their demands.'"
"'11-12-13,'0','Unlike a PC, they usually have solid-state drives that use flash memory chips, not mechanical hard drives. While ultrabooks weigh and cost slightly more than tablets, the larger screen and the familiar keyboard make them potentially attractive alternatives to tablets. Intel and others are investing in research to make touch screens, now standard on tablets, a feature of ultrabooks as well.Solid-state drives are still readily available from Intel and others. Typically, these devices cost five to 10 times as much as disk drives. But solid-state drives consume less power and take up less space, making them desirable in both ultrabooks and tablets.With hard drive makers hurting, “we’ll be using this as an opportunity” to increase sales of solid-state drives, Mr. Smith told analysts. He did not announce any immediate plans to increase investment or production in solid-state drives or components for ultrabooks, however.Still, Intel and other companies are likely to benefit from the shortage of disk drives. “If Intel is given lemons, it will make lemonade. It’s a chance to have an even broader Intel platform” of both storage and processor, said Rob Enderle, an industry analyst in San Jose, Calif. “You’ll see people pushing solid state quite a bit now, Samsung, Intel and others,” he said.So far, the best-selling ultrabook is Apple’s Air, which uses Intel chips but not an Intel solid-state drive. Alternatives from Acer, Asus, Toshiba and Lenovo, all using Intel processors, have recently appeared, and Intel is counting on a big push into the market next year. Apple’s least expensive Air costs about $1,000, while other ultrabooks can cost $870 to $1,200.In August, Intel announced a $300 million fund for ultrabooks, primarily to finance research to produce lower-cost chassis and touch screens. Last week, Intel sponsored a series of meetings in Taiwan between component makers and the Taiwanese manufacturers who make computers for companies like Hewlett-Packard and Dell. Around the end of this year, Intel is expected to produce a chip called Ivy Bridge specifically for ultrabooks.Manufacturers have been complaining about the high prices Intel charges for its processors, but Intel in unlikely to give up much on pricing. On Monday, Intel said that, aside from hurting revenue, the hard disk drive shortfall would narrow its gross profit margins to 64.5 percent, from 65 percent. In the short term, Intel will probably want to recover that.Even as increased production and more research will probably lower the relative cost of solid-state drives, the way people use computers is changing the need for hard drives. For a long time, people wanted lots of storage for keeping things like music and pictures. Digital cameras and digital music increased demand.Increasingly these things are stored in the cloud — in remote data centers — and reached over the Internet through machines that consumers want to be lightweight, portable and with long battery lives. External hard drives are also available, and if needed, they can be hooked up to ultrabooks for more memory.“Lots of people buy tablets, find they can’t do as much, and switch over to a MacBook Air,” Mr. Enderle said. More ultrabook producers will increase the alternatives to tablets, he said, as will the absence of hard disk drive producers for regular laptops. “It helps if the lower-priced product isn’t around,” he said.'"
"'11-12-13,'0','Stocks in the United States declined Monday and losses steepened in Europe as investors reassessed last week’s European Union summit meeting and reacted to a new warning that the sovereign debt crisis could get worse.The declines came in the wake of a rally at the end of last week, when investors waded back into stocks in hope that European leaders on Friday could deliver much-needed firepower to help lift the region out of its crisis.But Monday’s activity suggested that investors now believe the meeting was inconclusive at best.In a reminder of the pressure on the European Union, Moody’s Investors Service noted Monday that it is reviewing the ratings of debt in European Union countries for a possible downgrade. S.&P. is expected to announce the results of its own review as soon as this week. Cuts in credit ratings, particularly for the so-called core euro zone countries, could play havoc with bailout plans.“It looks like a reversal out of what was, from my standpoint, unwarranted optimism on Friday,” said Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management. “It is a little bit of a puzzle as to why the market tends to act so euphoric going into these meetings only to act so disappointed.”In addition, the chip maker Intel said before trading opened in New York that its fourth-quarter revenue would be lower than expected because of shortages of hard disk drives. It now expects fourth-quarter revenue of $13.4 billion to $14 billion, down from a previous forecast of $14.2 billion to $15.2 billion.'"

"'11-12-14,'0','WASHINGTON — An electricity price-fixing scandal thought to have cost New York consumers about $300 million has led to a proposed settlement with Morgan Stanley for $4.8 million. But the proposal has brought complaints from a consumer group, which points out that the company took in four times that much in the scheme.In February, a judge approved a settlement against another defendant, the KeySpan Energy Corporation, which had a complex deal using derivatives that gave it a stake in the profits of a competitor, Astoria Generating Company. KeySpan then closed some of its generators, pushing up revenue for its remaining power and for Astoria’s; the move also benefited generators around the state not involved in the scheme. KeySpan did not admit wrongdoing but paid $12 million.Now the Justice Department is seeking $4.8 million from Morgan Stanley, which acted as an intermediary in the deal: according to prosecutors, Morgan Stanley realized revenues of $21.6 million on it. The settlement would be a so-called disgorgement of illicit profits, which is unusual in cases like this, which was brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act.One consumer advocate, AARP, said the proposed settlement, like the first, was too lenient.“I don’t understand how the government thinks this will deter anyone,” said Gerry Norlander, a consultant on the case for AARP. The group filed a comment with the department last week calling for tougher punishment.AARP also wants whatever money is recovered to be paid to ratepayers and not the Treasury. The Justice Department said in the KeySpan settlement that it had no mechanism for doing that.The Justice Department would not say how it arrived at the $4.8 million figure. In a court filing, it said, “Disgorgement will effectively fulfill the remedial goals of the Sherman Act to prevent and restrain antitrust violations, as it will send a message of deterrence to those in the financial services community considering the use of derivatives for anticompetitive ends.”'"
"'11-12-14,'0','But handicapping the eventual fate of Olympus’s stock is hard to do, because of the inconsistent way that Japanese authorities have policed and censured white-collar crime in recent years.What’s more, the powerful Tokyo Stock Exchange wields considerable discretion in deciding whether to delist, which experts say can make its decisions on such matters seem arbitrary or politically biased.“Japanese regulators aren’t consistent; they seem to make calls based on political motive,” said Tadashi Kageyama, senior managing director and head of Asia and Japan for Kroll, a global risk consulting company. “These inconsistencies are confusing foreign investors.”Two cases in the past decade illustrate the discrepancies — or, in critics’ view, the political biases — in the way companies are punished in Japan.When the Internet start-up Livedoor was accused in 2005 of manipulating its earnings to appear to be more than $40 million, its offices were raided, its stock delisted and its top executives jailed.But the next year, Nikko Cordial, a prominent Japanese brokerage firm, was accused by financial regulators of padding its books by almost $350 million. Nikko was forced to pay a modest financial penalty. But there was no raid, no delisting and no jail time.“Japan is still haunted by the Livedoor case; they went after that company like beating up on a drowning puppy in a pond,” said Kenichi Osugi, a professor in corporate governance and restructuring law at Chuo University in central Japan. “It was seen as politics, not justice.”And so the eventual outcome of the Olympus investigation by police officials, and the company’s treatment by regulators and the Tokyo Stock Exchange, will be seen as the latest indication of which way the corporate winds are blowing in Japan.Keeping Olympus a listed company would add fuel to accusations that Japan Inc. coddles established players while punishing newcomers like Livedoor, which had dared to rock the boat with a series of ambitious takeover bids before the scandal caused the company to implode. An Olympus delisting, though, would probably incite a furor from those who argue that shareholders should not be unfairly punished for acts by corrupt executives.Even Michael C. Woodford, Olympus’s ousted president, has said he hopes company shares remain listed for the sake of company investors and employees, even as he calls for a thorough investigation.“I want no part in selling Olympus or breaking it up,” Reuters quoted Mr. Woodford as saying Wednesday after meeting with local politicians.It was Mr. Woodford who drew attention to the cover-up, first within the company and then publicly after he was fired on Oct. 14.Mr. Woodford arrived in Japan on Tuesday, his second visit to the country since his dismissal, where he hopes to persuade investors and employees to support his return to the helm of Olympus. The current Olympus board has said it will step down as early as February, but it has not agreed to welcome back Mr. Woodford.Though the Tokyo Stock Exchange is independent of the Japanese government, its executives have strong links to both government and industry. And there is plenty of suspicion that it is vulnerable to pressures. Its president is a former Nomura banker who previously led a government-run fund for turning around troubled companies. The chairman of the exchange’s board is a retired finance ministry official.“Compared to Livedoor, the fraud is tens of times bigger and went on for much longer” at Olympus, Takafumi Horie, Livedoor’s former chief executive, wrote Monday from his Tokyo jail cell through a Twitter account maintained by his staff. “If there’s no delisting, no criminal charges,” Mr. Horie continued, “then it’s like there’s no equality before the law here.”The question comes down to what purpose delisting should serve, analysts say. Is it mainly a punishment for the company? Or is it meant primarily as a way to keep markets clean?Advocates of tough punishment argue that if the exchange or financial regulators are seen to be lenient on fraudulent companies, trust in Japanese markets could be hurt in the long run.“If the Olympus case is not deemed a serious offense, it could become a message that anything goes in Japanese markets,” said Takaaki Hoda, a professor of corporate and venture finance at the Otaru University of Commerce. “Then what would happen to credibility?”But others argue that delisting is too blunt a measure to deal with many securities law violations. Instead, they say, the Tokyo exchange should rely more on fines — although the current 10 million yen, or around $128,500, ceiling on fines might spark derision if it is applied to a fraud of $1 billion or more at Olympus. (Of course, Japan’s securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, could choose to issue heftier fines.)Another risk for investors, meanwhile, is a possible link to organized crime. An internal report prepared by a panel of third-party legal experts, though scathing in language, appeared to clear the Olympus cover-up of that allegation. The head of the panel has conceded, however, that the whereabouts of much of the money is still unclear.But Japanese police investigators are still pursuing possible criminal links, according to people familiar with the inquiry who were not authorized to speak publicly.Under Tokyo Stock Exchange rules, a connection with “antisocial forces” — long used as a euphemism for organized crime — makes it unlikely that any company could remain listed, if such connections were proved. In reality, no company has ever been delisted over suspected mob links.Still, the Japanese government recently has been stepping up its vigilance with robust laws that make it a crime to do business with antisocial forces.Government guidelines drafted in 2007 on antisocial forces, moreover, adopt a much wider definition of the term to mean any group that uses violence or fraudulent activity for economic gain. That interpretation, analysts say, could cover the obscure brokers that even Olympus’s third-party panel has said aided the company’s cover-up.The Tokyo exchange, on the other hand, has delisted nine companies for falsifying earnings since 2004. But that sanction has mainly been used against smaller companies like Livedoor, which now exists as only a shell of its former self.A case that may most closely resemble Olympus is the accounting scandal that came to light at the Toyota auto parts maker Futaba Industrial in October 2008. The stock exchange put Futaba’s shares on watch. But the company quickly appointed an outside investigative panel and reported amended results, while Toyota brought in a new management team.In June 2010, after Futaba submitted numerous reports detailing ways it would improve its corporate governance, the stock exchange declared that Futaba shares were no longer at risk of delisting.But last year, the exchange banished two companies for false financial statements. One was Senior Communication, a small nursing care consulting firm, accused of padding profit by a little more than 2.2 billion yen, or a little more than $28 million over six years.By the end of the one-month warning period, the company’s share price had plunged to near zero. The Tokyo exchange said it had found the fraud at Senior Communication to be “systematic” and “deviant.”So Olympus’s fate may be difficult to predict.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','The authorities have maintained, though, that Ms. Gilbert’s case is not necessarily related to the others. The location of the body believed to be hers, Mr. Dormer said Tuesday, has helped validate his belief that Ms. Gilbert drowned while trying to reach the parkway through the swampland nearby after knocking on a door in Oak Beach. The body was found, Mr. Dormer said, about a quarter mile northeast of where investigators last week retrieved what they believed were Ms. Gilbert’s purse, jeans, shoes and cellphone.“She traveled at least half a mile, three quarters of a mile, on foot through that muck,” Mr. Dormer said at a news conference on Tuesday. “It would be very easy to get exhausted and fall down and not be able to move any further.”Later, Mari Gilbert, Shannan’s mother, appeared at the vigil with a small group of friends and relatives of the other victims. Those gathered released balloons into the air, recited the Lord’s Prayer and, in some cases, hammered crosses into the earth beside the parkway.But Mari Gilbert, who said the authorities contacted her on Tuesday morning with news of the discovery, was unconvinced that the remains were her daughter’s, noting that an autopsy had not been completed. “Until I hear positive confirmation that it’s my daughter, I’m going to believe it’s not,” she said.Ms. Gilbert has also expressed doubts that her daughter’s death was accidental. She spoke on Tuesday of hoping to meet a killer who the authorities are not sure exists. “I want to meet him face to face one day,” she said. “And I just want to ask him: ‘Who hurt you? Who hurt you this badly that you have to hurt others?’ ”Mr. Dormer said areas adjacent to where the remains had been found were drained over the last week to aid in the search. Detectives were traveling through thick brush on an amphibious vehicle, Mr. Dormer added, before noticing “the skeletal remains lying on the surface of the ground.”It is still unclear why Ms. Gilbert might have charted such a dangerous course through the swamp. After leaving a seaside home in the Oak Beach area early on May 1, 2010, Ms. Gilbert banged on the door of a resident, Gus Coletti, shortly before 5 a.m. “She kept saying, ‘Help me,’ ” Mr. Coletti said in an interview last spring. When he dialed 911, she ran. He did not see her again.Since the discovery of the first bodies along Ocean Parkway, on Dec. 11 and Dec. 13 last year, victims’ relatives have forged a unique, if heart-rending, connection, they say. “We’re a family,” said Lorraine Ela, the mother of Megan Waterman, whose body was found last December, “but not by blood.”At one point, Mari Gilbert expressed her grief that, if the remains were not her daughter’s, another victim had been added to the tally. “Nobody truly knows how,” she began, before Ms. Ela completed her thought. “How it feels to have a missing child come up deceased,” Ms. Ela said.Over the past year, Ms. Gilbert seemed to find solace in the notion that her daughter’s disappearance had shined a light on other victims.“Everyone has their destiny,” she said last spring. “Maybe this was hers.”'"
"'11-12-14,'0','On Wednesday, at 5 p.m. Eastern, the bidding will close on Yu Darvish, the right-handed ace of the Hokkaido Nippon Ham Fighters, and the results may be announced a few hours later. Several teams are thought to have serious interest, led by the Texas Rangers, the Washington Nationals and the Toronto Blue Jays, but the bidding is secret and teams are cagey about divulging their intentions.With Matsuzaka generating more than $51 million for the Seibu Lions, but with mixed results for the Red Sox, it remains a mystery how the bidding will go for the 25-year-old Darvish, whose statistics in Japan were better than Matsuzaka’s.“I haven’t seen him in a couple of years,” said Mets Manager Terry Collins, who managed against Darvish with the Orix Buffaloes in 2007 and 2008. “But he’s as good as any pitcher I’ve ever seen. Ever. I asked a scouting guy over there, ‘If Dice-K got $50 million, how much would Darvish get?’ At the time, the guess was $70 million.”After the uneven results of Matsuzaka, Igawa and others, the bidding for Darvish is expected to be more restrained, perhaps $30 million to $50 million, and recently some people in baseball have projected that figure below $30 million.Last week the Fighters notified Major League Baseball, under a 13-year-old agreement between the two leagues, that they were posting Darvish. On Friday, M.L.B. relayed the information to its 30 teams, which all have the chance to submit sealed bids during a window that ends Wednesday afternoon.According to the system, whichever team submits the highest bid wins the right to negotiate with Darvish over the next 30 days, and Darvish can negotiate only with that team. If a contract agreement is reached, the Fighters will receive the posting fee. If there is no deal, Darvish must return to Japan to play for the Fighters, and no money changes hands.Several recent posting bids have increased frustration with the process, including the Yankees’ surprisingly low $2.5 million winning bid on shortstop Hiroyuki Nakajima, and last year’s $19.1 million bid by the Oakland Athletics for pitcher Hisashi Iwakuma. The A’s were unable to reach an agreement with Iwakuma, and his agent, Don Nomura, said they were insincere in their pursuit of him.A team could bid $100 million to negotiate with Darvish, then offer him a $1 million contract, which he would certainly turn down and return to Japan.“The system has already failed,” said Scott Boras, Matsuzaka’s agent, “and that type of thing is only going to increase. I lived through it with Matsuzaka. As it stands, this system doesn’t benefit anyone.”The posting system was introduced after the experiences of Hideo Nomo and Alfonso Soriano, who escaped their Japanese teams via loopholes. Then in 1997, the Chiba Lotte Marines, who had a working agreement with the San Diego Padres, agreed to let them sign Hideki Irabu, who refused to play for San Diego and forced a trade to the Yankees.“It wasn’t fun,” recalled Arizona Diamondbacks General Manager Kevin Towers, who was the Padres’ general manager at the time. “I think that episode annoyed a lot of people, and that’s why we have the system we have now, as flawed as it might be.”But it might change within a couple of years. Under the new collective bargaining agreement, a committee will be established to discuss a worldwide draft, including changes to the current system along with Nippon Professional Baseball.Boras suggested a sliding scale whereby Japanese players can negotiate with any team and their Japanese teams would receive a percentage of the contract. For instance, if a player leaves after one year, the Japanese team would get 80 percent of the contract, 50 percent after five years and 20 percent with just one year remaining before free agency.“A lot of Japanese players aren’t successful here because they aren’t comfortable in their situation,” Boras said. “If they could choose where they want to play, their success rate would definitely increase.”'"

The ruling reversed a finding by junior judges that would have freed the defendant, Ieng Thirith, 80, because doctors had concluded she has Alzheimer’s disease.

"'11-12-14,'0','David Brooks does an excellent job of debunking the big business hysteria over regulations. But the big business story is even more upside down than he reports.First, as Mr. Brooks notes, regulation did not cause the jobs crisis. But it’s also true that it was precisely deregulation and regulatory failure — the failure of financial regulators to control Wall Street and big banks’ reckless speculation and other activities — that led to the financial collapse that plunged the nation and the world into recession.Second, while Mr. Brooks is right to note the relative modest cost of regulations, he doesn’t note the benefit of those regulations. The Obama administration estimates that major regulations issued from 2000 to 2010 will have monetized benefits at least twice as large as costs, and up to 15 times greater.The George W. Bush administration reached very similar conclusions for rules issued between 1997 and 2007.The writers are co-chairmen of the Coalition for Sensible Safeguards and the presidents of Public Citizen and OMB Watch, respectively.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','Mr. Abu Risha, in an interview in his compound beside a lazy bend in the Euphrates River, said members of the tribal militias in western Iraq were not likely to disarm quickly — and certainly not by the end of the month.“I don’t think the Awakening members will give up their weapons,” he said, contending that the problem was a lack of government protection against Al Qaeda. “They want to defend themselves. The weapons they carry are their personal weapons.”In the tradition of the endless negotiations, feints and shifting alliances of desert tribes, the Sunni chieftains in Anbar Province unexpectedly switched sides in 2006 and 2007, in perhaps the most important single step for establishing stability here after the war and the insurgency. Once on the American side, they were an enormous help in hunting down their former insurgent allies, members of the Islamic militias, including Al Qaeda.Members of the Abu Risha family first caught the eye of American commanders in Anbar Province by attacking trucks carrying Qaeda militants passing on the highway in front of their compound in 2006.These were acts of vengeance more than politics; Al Qaeda had killed eight family members. But they illustrated that the tribe and the United States had a common enemy. Soon, platoons of Marines were dropping into the Abu Risha compound for feasts of lamb and rice, and fighting side by side with former insurgents and Baathists they might have been battling just months before.But the pendulum is now swinging back toward repression of Baathists, something being discussed over tea in places like Mr. Abu Risha’s tent, pitched in the courtyard of his fortresslike compound.The Shiite-dominated central government has arrested prominent Sunnis on accusations that they are secret members of the long-disbanded Baath Party, which has alienated Sunni elites. Meanwhile, a Sunni revolt a few hundred miles to the north of here against the Shiite-aligned government in neighboring Syria is gathering force.Last month, government police officers wounded two guards and detained two others in a raid on the home of a Sunni, Sheik Albo Baz, in Salahuddin Province, prompting a protest by several thousand Sunnis in Samarra, a city divided by sect.This followed the roundup by police officers of 600 suspected Baath Party sympathizers in October; they were accused of planning a coup.Distressingly for Sunnis, the government paraded some of those arrested on state television in a bizarre spectacle: relatives of their supposed victims were invited into the room and screamed at the suspects, and demanded their execution. Such a program was a tradition on Mr. Hussein’s state television, though the suspects then were more likely to be Shiites.In the interview, Mr. Abu Risha produced an envelope containing photographs of shrapnel damage on an armored sport utility vehicle, proof, he said, that he was the target of an assassination attempt two months ago on a highway in Abu Ghraib.He said a Shiite-dominated police brigade that is part of the central government was responsible, because the roadside bomb that struck his car, ineffectually, was set 50 yards from one of the brigade’s watch towers.The government has denied this, though the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr agreed to open an investigation into the unit, called the Muthana Brigade.Mr. Maliki and other Shiite politicians insist that they are legally fighting sedition among former Baathists, and that the police are evenhanded with Sunnis.Mohammad Rida, a member of the Sadrist party in Iraq’s Parliament, said in an interview that the government had documents indicating that Baath Party sleeper cells intended to stage a coup after the American withdrawal. The police obtained the names of hundreds of conspirators in a confession by a former Baathist detained in July, he said.In addition, Mr. Rida said, documents found in the ruins of the Libyan intelligence office after the fall of Tripoli corroborated the plot. “Iraq did what any other country would do,” he said. “We responded.”Mr. Abu Risha’s compound is less than a mile from what used to be Camp Blue Diamond, home of the young United States Army officers who first struck up a friendship with him, and who brought him to the American side. (A grandfather of Mr. Abu Risha had chosen a different path, choosing to fight the British occupation in the 1920s.)About 30,000 former Awakening militia members have received jobs in the Anbar police, and thousands more have entered the army. Mr. Abu Risha said about 80,000 remained in irregular tribal-based units. The central government has put thatfigure at 50,000.Mr. Abu Risha has entered politics, with nine supporters in Parliament, but he does not hold public office, wielding power instead in informal gatherings over tea or feasts at his house.He often cites the Iraqi Constitution in asserting rights for Anbar Province and describes himself as an Iraqi patriot opposed to any foreign meddling in Iraq, whether from Syria or Iran.In the latest calibration of his loyalties, Mr. Abu Risha has become a steadfast supporter of Kurdistan-style autonomy for the Sunni desert regions of western and northern Iraq, a position gaining traction in provincial councils. This, he said, would resolve disagreements with the central government about the expected wealth from natural gas fields in the desert and the future of militias, with regions being granted the right to field their own guard units.“We will form a region,” he said.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','Best Buy said Tuesday that its third-quarter net income fell 29 percent as it cut prices in popular categories like tablets and TVs to drive sales and traffic during the busy holiday season.Its adjusted earnings missed analysts’ expectations, and its shares tumbled.Best Buy’s results highlight the challenges the electronics retailer is facing as it seeks to increase traffic during the crucial November and December holiday season. The company, which is competing with discounters and online retailers, increased markdowns and spent more on advertising.Its chief executive, Brian Dunn, said customers were firmly focused on value this holiday season, so Best Buy had to cut its prices to attract them.“We took decisive actions to drive our business,” he said. “These actions, while negatively impacting gross margin, significantly resonated with customers and resulted in improved traffic.”Net income for the three months ended Nov. 26 fell to $154 million, or 42 cents a share. That compares with $217 million, or 54 cents a share, last year.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','James Harrison and the Pittsburgh Steelers have thought that the N.F.L. has unfairly singled him out for penalties and fines since it began cracking down on hits to the head in the middle of last season.They probably do not feel much better now. On Tuesday, Harrison, a linebacker, became the first player suspended for a helmet-to-helmet hit since the increased emphasis on the rule began. The N.F.L. sidelined him for one game for a hit to Cleveland Browns quarterback Colt McCoy’s head last Thursday that resulted in a concussion.Harrison will probably seek an expedited appeal. That would be considered this week by Art Shell or Ted Cottrell, who are mutually appointed by the league and the players union. If the suspension is upheld, Harrison will miss the Steelers’ game Monday against the San Francisco 49ers.The league said the blow to McCoy was Harrison’s fifth illegal hit against a quarterback in the past three seasons. Harrison was called for roughing the passer on the play. Last season, the N.F.L. fined Harrison, considered one of the game’s best defensive players, four times for a total of $125,000 for what it called dangerous and banned hits to the head.During the Steelers’ run to the Super Bowl last season, Harrison taped in his locker a note from the league informing him that the largest of the fines was being reduced. Harrison, who had been so upset by the earlier penalties that he once threatened to retire, was unmoved by that gesture.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','LONDON — Rupert Murdoch’s son James received and responded to e-mail messages in 2008 that referred to “a nightmare scenario” of legal repercussions from widespread phone hacking at the tabloid The News of the World, a chain of e-mail messages and replies released Tuesday by a British parliamentary panel shows. It is the first documentation that Mr. Murdoch had been notified of a wider hacking problem long before he has admitted.In statements released Tuesday, James Murdoch, who runs the News Corporation’s operations in Europe and Asia, admitted he had received and replied to the message on his BlackBerry, but he said he “did not read the full e-mail chain.” He said he stood by his repeated public denials that he knew of widespread hacking at the tabloid at the time he approved a large legal settlement with a victim of the practice in 2008.But the new documents appear to add fuel to a controversy that has severely damaged the reputation of the News Corporation and the Murdochs’ leadership, both in Britain and the United States. The e-mail chain of messages backs up the accounts of two of James Murdoch’s former senior executives, an in-house lawyer and an editor, who said they had told him of evidence that illegally intercepting voice mail messages to gather news and gossip went beyond a single “rogue reporter.”The top e-mail in the chain — the one Mr. Murdoch replied to directly — came from the editor of The News of the World at the time, Colin Myler, who wrote that the potential legal fallout from the hacking problem was “as bad as we feared.” Mr. Myler urged Mr. Murdoch to call a meeting promptly to discuss the issue. Mr. Murdoch replied within minutes, saying he could be available that evening or the next day.The e-mails do not show conclusively that Mr. Murdoch knew more about the extent of hacking than he has said. But they make clear that his subordinates informed him about the potential fallout at the time they were seeking his approval for an unusually large payment of more than $1 million to a victim of hacking. That victim had obtained evidence that the practice was common at The News of the World.Mr. Murdoch, viewed as a possible heir to his father at the News Corporation, has come under pressure from British politicians and some shareholders of the global media company to explain how much he and other senior executives knew about the hacking. The e-mails seem likely to provide ammunition to critics of the News Corporation’s leadership who have expressed doubts that James Murdoch or his father could have been as unaware of intrusive reporting practices at the tabloid as they have claimed.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','A late afternoon slide pulled stock indexes lower after the Federal Reserve held off on any new steps to help the economy. The Fed cautioned that strains in global financial markets still posed a danger, a nod to Europe’s debt crisis.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.45 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 11,954.94. The Dow dropped more than 70 points in the last hour of trading after having risen as high as 126 points earlier Tuesday after two strong auctions of European debt.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 10.74 points, or 0.9 percent, to 1,225.73. The Nasdaq composite index fell 32.99 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,579.27.The Federal Reserve portrayed the nation’s economy as slightly healthier but cautioned that it remained vulnerable to the European debt crisis. “Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook,” the Fed said. Stock indexes turned lower after the Fed released its policy statement Tuesday afternoon.Stocks had been higher for most of the day after the Spanish government was able to sell short-term debt at much lower interest rates compared with a month ago, a signal that markets are becoming less fearful about the government’s ability to repay its debt.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','A senior European official said on Tuesday that ’s demands for measures to protect its financial services industry at last week’s summit meeting were impossible to meet and directly responsible for the collapse of a -wide agreement meant to help save .In blunt language, the official, José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, said that the “specific protocol on financial services” requested by Prime Minister would have presented “a risk to the integrity of the internal market,” as the ’s vast trading area is known, and was thus untenable.“This made compromise impossible,” Mr. Barroso told the in , . “All other heads of government were left with the choice between paying this price or moving ahead without the U.K.’s participation and accepting an internal agreement among them.”Mr. Barroso’s portrayal of Britain as asking for extra protection for its financial services sector seemed to contradict the account given by Mr. Cameron, who told on Monday that he had asked for no special treatment for Britain, simply a “level playing field” with the rest of Europe.“The choice was a treaty with the proper safeguards, or no treaty,” Mr. Cameron said. “The result was no treaty.”Britain’s action had the effect of denying European leaders one of their main objectives in last week’s meeting: to have all 27 European Union countries endorse changes to the Lisbon Treaty, the basic governing document of the European Union, which requires unanimity among all 27 members. Instead, at least 23 European countries, and possibly 26, agreed to exclude Britain in drafting and ratifying a different deal, an intergovernmental treaty between themselves.'"
"'11-12-14,'0','Never being content to make the same recipe year after year, when Hanukkah rolls around, she’ll try something new.She has made latkes with purple potatoes and latkes with sweet potatoes. She has added carrot, celery root, and once even shredded beet for a borscht-like mouthful of crunch. She has made fat latkes with mashed potatoes and flat latkes with a blender (don’t try that at home).What this meant was that when I left home, I became a staunch latkes traditionalist. For years, my potato pancakes were a classic mix of potato, onion, egg and not much else.But eventually, I became bored and opened the floodgates of latkes play. It turns out, though, that simple, straight-up latkes are hard to beat.After much experimentation, however, I came up with recipes for parsnip latkes and zucchini latkes I’m happy with. The secret?

"'11-12-15,'1','WASHINGTON (Reuters) — American import prices recorded their largest increase in seven months in November as the cost of oil surged, but underlying import inflation pressures remain contained.Overall import prices in the U.S. rebounded 0.7 percent, the Labor Department said Wednesday. They had fallen 0.5 percent in October. Last month’s increase was the largest since April.Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices to rise 0.9 percent last month. Import prices were up 9.9 percent in the 12 months through November.Despite the 3.6 percent rise in the cost of imported oil last month, inflation pressures remain largely in check, after a surge in energy prices early this year dampened growth.Prices on imported petroleum rose in November for the first time since July and reversed a 1.1 percent drop in October.Suggesting benign inflation pressures, imported food prices slipped 0.1 percent last month after falling 0.7 percent in October.The cost of imported capital goods rose 0.1 percent after falling 0.3 percent in October.

"'11-12-15,'1','Representative Harold Rogers, Republican of Kentucky and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said House and Senate negotiators had reached a bipartisan agreement on how to resolve this and other nettlesome issues in the spending bill — even though the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, raised objections at the behest of the White House.Mr. Reid denied that the agreement was final. “It’s not complete,” he said. “There are still major issues, critical issues, to be ironed out.”Federal officials at some agencies began notifying employees on Wednesday that they might be furloughed if the government shut down temporarily because of a lapse in spending authority. However, Congress could try to prevent the disruption by passing another stopgap spending bill.Senator Reid said Republicans “obviously want to have the government shut down,” an assertion denied by Republicans, who said Mr. Reid was holding up the omnibus spending bill to gain leverage on other issues, like the extension of a payroll tax cut.“A government shutdown is a terrible idea,” said the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.Mr. Reid said the proposed change in Cuba travel restrictions was too important to American foreign policy to be shoved through Congress as a rider to an appropriations bill.House Republicans are also trying to prohibit the District of Columbia from using local tax revenue to pay for abortions for low-income women under Medicaid. The White House and Congressional Democrats are resisting. Even “local funds” raised by the city are deposited in the United States Treasury and can be spent only if appropriated by Congress. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s delegate in Congress, explained it this way: “Although the District raises and manages its own $8 billion budget, Congress technically appropriates these local funds back to the District, a holdover and throwback to the pre-home-rule period.”House Republicans also want to waive a 2007 law so the Defense Department can continue using coal as an “alternative fuel.”Some Democrats and environmentalists say this provision could slow the Defense Department’s progress in increasing the use of cleaner fuels. Mr. Rogers and Kentucky state officials say that, with new technology, coal itself can be a clean fuel.House Republicans are also trying to repeal energy efficiency standards for light bulbs. “We are trying to promote fluorescent lights while Republicans are protecting incandescent bulbs,” said a Senate Democratic aide.Republicans said the federal government had no business telling people what kind of lights they could buy for their homes. Supporters of the federal standards said the new bulbs saved energy and would save money in the long run.White House officials were pursuing several goals of their own in the omnibus spending bill. For example, they sought more money for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, so the agency could more adequately protect consumers under the 2010 law overhauling regulation of financial services.Members of Congress said they were puzzled by the president’s effort this week because he signed a bill last month providing $205 million for the commission.As part of the omnibus spending bill, House and Senate negotiators agreed to a small increase in the budget of the National Institutes of Health, whose biomedical research enjoys bipartisan support. They dropped riders that would have prevented Mr. Obama from carrying out the new health care law. They provided less money for the Race to the Top program, under which states compete for federal grants for their schools. But lawmakers agreed to a policy change that would open the competition to big-city school districts.'"
"'11-12-15,'1','For months, the Justice Department has largely been silent as Republican-dominated legislatures in state after state made it harder for minorities, poor people and other Democratic-leaning groups to vote. On Tuesday, however, Attorney General Jr. spoke out forcefully and promised to use the full weight of his department to ensure that new electoral laws are not discriminatory. To live up to that vow, he will have his hands full.Republican lawmakers in more than a dozen states have recently enacted laws designed to limit Americans’ access to the polls, often concentrating on voters — blacks, Hispanics, students and the poor — who showed up in large numbers in 2008 to elect . They have imposed strict voter-ID requirements, knowing that millions of people cannot easily meet them; eliminated early voting periods; and restricted registration drives. (Voter ID laws have been introduced in at least 34 states.)These efforts, Mr. Holder said, have led many Americans “to believe that we are failing to live up to one of our nation’s most noble, and essential, ideals.” Quoting , the congressman who was beaten in the 1960s while advocating voting rights for blacks, he said those rights are under attack by “a deliberate and systematic attempt” to prevent millions of voters from exercising their constitutional right to engage in democracy.It was very encouraging to hear Mr. Holder recognize the depth of the assault on a fundamental constitutional right. The question is how far he will use his department’s power to stop it. On that subject, he was a little vague, promising to use his power under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act to object to any law that is discriminatory, citing new laws in , and .That section, however, only applies to 16 states that have a well-documented history of voter discrimination, mostly in the South. The new Republican effort is far broader than that group of states, and may require the Justice Department to use other tools to fight it. Though Mr. Holder did not mention it, Section 2 of the act allows the government to take legal action anywhere against measures that are intentionally discriminatory on the basis of race or that have a clear racially disparate impact. The Justice Department can also intervene in private lawsuits that allege violations of the equal-protection clause of the 14th Amendment, such as the one filed this week by the against .Those cases are harder to make, particularly given the 2008 decision upholding ’s voter ID law, but Mr. Holder at least suggested that his department would now actively be looking for patterns of discrimination in the new laws. As he noted, race continues to preoccupy many state officials. The Justice Department recently had to object to a redistricting plan in an eastern parish that was based on a meeting that excluded black officeholders. It also intervened against the Republican redistricting plan in Texas, which created no new Hispanic districts despite a huge influx of new Hispanic residents. (That case is going to the Supreme Court.)Mr. Holder effectively demolished the phony voter-fraud excuse used by Republicans supporting these laws, pointing that such fraud happens far too infrequently to justify this kind of discrimination. And he called on citizens of every state to demand a voter registration system that is not cumbersome, allowing anyone eligible to exercise what called “the basic right, without which all others are meaningless.”'"
"'11-12-15,'1','The Texans play at Indianapolis on Dec. 22, and Phillips is hoping to return for the regular-season finale against Tennessee on Jan. 1. “At the end of the day, I’m not Wade Phillips,” Herring said, “but it’s Wade Phillips’s system. It’s our calls. It’s what the players know.”ROETHLISBERGER RESTS ANKLE Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger watched practice to rest his sprained left ankle, and the backups Charlie Batch and Dennis Dixon said they were preparing to play Monday against the 49ers. Roethlisberger declined to talk to reporters and wore a walking boot while limping noticeably out of the team’s facility. He injured the ankle in the second quarter of a 14-3 win over Cleveland last Thursday, leaving briefly before returning to finish the game.VICK SITS OUT PRACTICE Michael Vick watched practice from the sideline, still sore from taking a beating in his first game back after breaking his ribs last month. Vick participated in a walkthrough in the morning, but was a spectator in the afternoon when the Eagles began preparations for Sunday’s game against the Jets. Before practice, Coach Andy Reid said he was confident Vick would start.RAIDERS RECEIVER RETURNS The Raiders got one of their injured big-play threats back at practice as receiver Denarius Moore took the field with his teammates for the first time since injuring his right foot. Moore practiced on a limited basis as the Raiders (7-6) began preparations for this weekend’s game against Detroit.HASSELBECK, FOR NOW Titans Coach Mike Munchak says he is assuming Matt Hasselbeck is playing Sunday at Indianapolis until he sees otherwise. That’s even though Hasselbeck, his veteran quarterback, only watched practice. And the backup Jake Locker’s ribs are sore enough that the Titans limited him, too. Hasselbeck hurt his left calf in last week’s 22-17 loss to the Saints, and Locker left for a play after being taken to the ground. The Titans (7-6) must win their final three games to have a shot at the playoffs.CHIEFS PLAN TO START ORTON Kyle Orton will start at quarterback for the Chiefs against the Packers on Sunday unless an injured finger on his throwing hand prevents him from playing. The interim coach, Romeo Crennel, said that he made the change in an effort to jump-start the stagnant offense. The journeyman quarterback Tyler Palko had led the Chiefs to only two touchdowns in four games since taking over for the injured Matt Cassel.PEYTON MANNING IS THROWING Colts Coach Jim Caldwell said that Peyton Manning was throwing the ball as part of his rehabilitation from neck surgery Sept. 8. There is no indication Manning will practice with his teammates before the season ends.JAGUARS SALE APPROVED The Jacksonville Jaguars have been sold to Shahid Khan, giving the N.F.L. its first minority owner.

"'11-12-15,'1','WASHINGTON — President Obama will not veto a military authorization bill that contains several disputed provisions about the treatment of terrorism prisoners, the White House announced Wednesday, signaling a likely end to a political battle over detainees and executive power.The administration had threatened to veto versions of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 passed by the House and the Senate, arguing that provisions would open the door for the military to perform policing functions inside the United States, and that they would infringe on executive branch powers.But the White House said in a statement that adjustments made by a House-Senate conference committee had sufficiently addressed its concerns.“As a result of these changes, we have concluded that the language does not challenge or constrain the president’s ability to collect intelligence, incapacitate dangerous terrorists, and protect the American people, and the president’s senior advisors will not recommend a veto,” it said.Civil liberties groups still object to the revised bill. But other critics of earlier versions — notably, Representative Adam Smith of Washington State, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee — praised the changes and urged that the bill be passed. On Wednesday, the House approved the bill, 283 to 136; it goes to the Senate.'"
"'11-12-15,'1','“If we get a really good block, it brings intensity,” said the sophomore middle blocker Ashley Neff, who had a hand in more blocks (192) than any other player in the country this season. “This team feeds off the energy of the block.”An in-sync blocking unit in volleyball can have the same menacing effect on hitters that an effective pass rush has on quarterbacks in football. The opponent becomes less aggressive, more predictable and prone to mistakes. In its last two matches, Florida State has limited Purdue’s Ariel Turner, the Big Ten player of the year, to 10.5 percent hitting (16 kills and 8 errors on 76 attacks) and Iowa State’s Carley Jenson to 3.6 percent hitting (14 kills and 12 errors on 56 attacks).“The block is probably the most demoralizing thing that can happen to a player,” Poole said. “A big hitter goes up, and it’s blocked straight down on her? That really plays with your mind.”U.C.L.A.’s heavy hitters are Rachael Kidder, Tabi Love and Kelly Reeves. The Seminoles are most familiar with Love, a 6-foot-6 outside hitter who transferred to U.C.L.A. from Minnesota. She had 21 kills for the Gophers when they eliminated Florida State in the 2009 N.C.A.A. regional final. That loss ended what was then the most successful season in Seminoles history. They won a school-record 31 games and rose to No. 11 in national rankings.But off-court misfortunes and injuries derailed the Seminoles’ momentum in 2010. The outside hitter and Serbian native Visnja Djurdjevic coped with the death of her father from afar. Setter Patricia Figueiredo, a Brazilian native, learned her father had cancer. Right-side hitter Rachael Morgan (stress fracture) and middle blocker Lauren Young (torn meniscus) missed several matches. Outside hitter Stephanie Neville passed out in a bathroom during a road trip and was hospitalized with an irregular heartbeat.All of those events, Poole said, occurred in a one-month span. Florida State had six losses during the 2010 season in matches that went to five sets and were decided by two points. With a roster of just 14 players before the setbacks, Poole asked Neff, then a freshman, to surrender her redshirt because the Seminoles needed immediate help.Poole considered Neff a raw talent whose physical ability— 6-3 with a jump and reach that allow her to touch 10-foot-4 — would make for a solid middle blocker. He said the experience she gained as a freshman, averaging over a block per set, set her up for what he called an all-American-caliber campaign as a sophomore.Florida State got all of its players back in time to make a run in the 2010 N.C.A.A .tournament. The Seminoles had top-seeded Florida on the ropes in the second round in Gainesville. They took two of the first three sets and led, 12-7, in the fifth before falling to the Gators. “There was a lot of motivation for that group to prove that Florida match was no fluke, that we were that good,” Poole said.Florida State started the 2011 season with a sweep of Kentucky on Aug. 26. The Seminoles strung together 12 blocks in just three sets and dominated a team that they narrowly defeated two years ago in the N.C.A.A. tournament. They added a season-high 26 blocks in a five-set road win Oct. 9 at North Carolina State, a match in which the Florida State offense struggled.Despite playing a freshman setter (Sarah Wickstrom) and redshirt freshman libero/defensive specialist (Katie Mosher), Poole felt he had the blocking presence to compensate for inexperience on the backline. Neff and Sareea Freeman (6-4) patrol the middle and team up often with Morgan to deny outside hitters. The associate head coach Holly Watts spends 30 to 40 minutes each practice with the blocking unit to work on footwork, form and stability.“You need to be able to read the hitters and know where the ball is going to go,” Freeman said. “Then it’s about penetrating, getting your block over the net rather than straight up in the air, pressing your shoulders and holding your block as long as you can.”When Poole arrived in 2008, he switched to a 6-2 rotation so that the setter always comes off the back row, keeping three hitters/blockers up front at all times.“It was more one-dimensional then; it was all about power hitting and attacking,” said Morgan, the only senior who has been with the team all four years. “Now there’s much more focus on everything else.”Most volleyball enthusiasts in San Antonio this weekend want to hear the thud of a kill, the pop of an ace or the crash of a player sprawled out for the dig. The Seminoles would be most satisfied with the silencing effect of the block.'"
"'11-12-15,'1','McCoy was home Wednesday, still dealing with a headache.Holmgren, in the course of answering questions, made the point that reporters in the press box could see the replay of the hit on McCoy. Holmgren said he saw the hit on replay and thought, “O.K., that’s not good.”He added: “But, I’ve also seen hits where it looks bad and off you go.  You really do have to just let the medical people go through their procedures and make the judgment they’re getting paid to make.”Holmgren met with representatives of the N.F.L. and the players union Tuesday to discuss the situation. He said the meeting was not a condemnation of the Browns’ handling of McCoy. Among the questions raised: Why didn’t anybody who saw the replay notify coaches and trainers about the severity of the hit?“It seems inconceivable, but nobody alerted anyone,” Holmgren said. “So how do we do this so the doctors get the information they need? Best thing we could come up with is putting in a process to have somebody say something.”Holmgren’s explanation recalled an incident from the 2010 season, when Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Stewart Bradley stumbled and collapsed to the turf during the first half of a game, causing teammates to wave for medical personnel. He returned to the game minutes later, and a concussion was not diagnosed until halftime.The Eagles later said Bradley was sent back in because a sideline exam had revealed no concussion and no medical personnel saw the hit or Bradley collapsing on the field.Holmgren said he did not expect the N.F.L. would punish the Browns.“I don’t expect anything to happen in a punitive way,” he said. “What could we have done differently? They followed protocol. We did what we had to do.”The N.F.L. said because there was a league meeting Wednesday, the league office had not had a chance to review the report from the Tuesday meeting with the Browns and discuss it with the chairmen of the head, neck and spine medical committee.DeMaurice Smith, the executive director of the union, said of the meeting in a statement, “We will review the findings with our team and take into consideration the public comments made by the Browns today.”The controversy has reopened the issue of whether the N.F.L. should have independent neurologists on the sideline at each game to evaluate players who they suspect are concussed. That would presumably take the responsibility for determining a player’s fitness away from team personnel and place it with someone who does not have to answer to the head coach. And it would immediately bring experts on head injuries into the process.The N.F.L.’s protocol calls for players who are suspected of having sustained a concussion in practice or a game to be asymptomatic and to have a normal neurological examination. He also has to be cleared to play by a team physician and an independent neurological consultant.The protocol also stresses the importance of honesty among players about their symptoms.The Browns’ handling of McCoy began to draw scrutiny after his father, Brad, criticized the team’s decision to put his son back in the game. The elder McCoy, a longtime high school football coach, told The Cleveland Plain Dealer last Friday that his son did not remember anything after Harrison hit him in the fourth quarter.'"
"'11-12-15,'1','MOSCOW — Criminal proceedings were dismissed Wednesday against the former Ukrainian president Leonid Kuchma in the killing 11 years ago of a prominent investigative journalist critical of his administration.The case, which helped galvanize Ukraine’s Orange Revolution, was seen as a litmus test for whether the country had broken with the sometimes bloody post-Soviet period.The decapitated body of Georgy Gongadze, 31, was found in a forest outside Kiev in November 2000, two months after he was reported missing. Almost immediately, Mr. Kuchma’s political opponents began accusing him of complicity, and a former bodyguard released a tape recording in which a voice identified as the president’s told officials to “deal with” Mr. Gongadze, the founder of the Ukrainian Pravda Web site, suggesting that he should be “kidnapped by the Chechens.” Mr. Kuchma, who has denied involvement in the killing, said the recordings had been doctored.Mr. Kuchma was finally charged in March, about six years after his presidency ended, with abusing his authority, as prosecutors argued that illegal orders to subordinates had led to Mr. Gongadze’s abduction and murder.In August, Aleksei Pukach, a former high-ranking Interior Ministry official who prosecutors say confessed to carrying out the murder, accused Mr. Kuchma of orchestrating the killing, according to news reports. He also implicated the current speaker of Parliament, Volodymyr Lytvyn, and a former interior minister, Yuri F. Kravchenko. Mr. Kravchenko died of two gunshots to the head in 2005 in a case that was ruled a suicide.'"
"'11-12-15,'1','Google itself has hired at least 15 lobbying firms to fight the bills; Mozilla has included on its Firefox browser home page a link to a petition with the warning, “Congress is trying to censor the Internet.” A House committee plans to take up one of the bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act, on ThursdayOn the other side, some of the biggest business lobbies like the Motion Picture Association of America and the United States Chamber of Commerce are supporting the bills. Both sides, in fact, plan to spend millions of dollars for advertisements aimed at swaying consumer sentiment.Even newly proposed changes that the House panel will consider fail to address all the legislation’s ills, opponents say. People involved in the drafting of the latest version, however, say the bill now specifically singles out only “foreign rogue Web sites.”“Our mistake was allowing this romantic word — piracy — to take hold,” Tom Rothman, the co-chief executive of Fox Filmed Entertainment, said in an interview last week in Washington.“It’s really robbery — it’s theft — and that theft is being combined with consumer fraud,” he said. “Consumers are purchasing these goods, they’re sending their credit card information to these anonymous offshore companies, and they’re receiving defective goods.”Those goods include not just movies shot surreptitiously in a theater with a jiggly hand-held video camera, the companies argue, but dangerously flawed pharmaceuticals, faulty brake pads and defective smoke alarms, to name a few categories of illegally copied goods.Each bill has attracted dozens of co-sponsors and broad support. The Senate bill, called the Protect IP Act, was overwhelmingly approved by the Judiciary Committee; a revised House bill, intended to address some initial criticisms, is scheduled to be marked up and voted on in committee before Congress adjourns for the holidays.Many in the Internet world, however, see ominous aspects even in the revision. “There are some provisions that have improved,” said Markham Erickson, executive director of NetCoalition, a group of technology companies that includes Facebook, LinkedIn and eBay.“Unfortunately,” Mr. Erickson said, “the amendment also creates new problems in other places and fails to correct some of the original concerns we have raised since the start of the debate.” Among them, he said, the amendment allows anyone to seek court action to restrain a Web site’s activities, even those of sites based in the United States.Representative Lamar Smith, a Texas Republican who is the primary sponsor of the bill and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, which is working on the legislation, said the immediate rejection of the amendment by technology companies showed that they were simply protecting their financial interests — and sacrificing intellectual property rights in the process.“That’s because they’ve made large profits by promoting rogue sites to U.S. consumers,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.Opponents say that many of the things that the legislation aims to prevent are already covered by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998. Under that law, Internet sites are required to take down links to specific pirated material when asked to do so by a copyright holder. “We’ve done that more than five million times,” Katherine Oyama, a Google policy counsel, told the House committee recently.Ms. Oyama added that Google also ejected companies from its advertising system when notified of illegal activities. Yet, as Mr. Smith and others have pointed out repeatedly, Google agreed in August to a $500 million settlement with federal and state agencies for failing to reject advertising business from pirates — specifically, online Canadian pharmacies that used Google’s AdWords program to place targeted ads promoting illegally imported prescription drugs to United States consumers.Google officials note that it acknowledged the conduct, accepted responsibility and paid a large fine — but Google’s Web site was not shut down. Opponents of the current bills argue that under the new proposals, Google could have been shut down.That sort of draconian measure is not where the bills are aimed, said Steve Tepp, chief intellectual property counsel for the United States Chamber of Commerce. “The targets are the rogue sites, the real bad actors,” he said, which by selling counterfeit material endanger the jobs of ordinary workers at mainstream businesses.The jobs issue has been seized on by the bill’s supporters and has created some strange alliances: supporting the bills are both the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Chamber of Commerce, which rarely take the same side on a business issue. On the other side, both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Tea Party Patriots oppose the legislation.A third alternative emerged last week, as Representative Darrell Issa, a California Republican, and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who has been blocking the Senate bill from getting to the floor, introduced a new proposal that would make the United States International Trade Commission the arbiter for Internet disputes over copyrighted material.“Butchering the Internet,” Mr. Issa said, “is not a way forward for America.”'"
"'11-12-15,'1','On foreign exchange markets on Wednesday, the euro hovered near its lowest levels of the year against the dollar,The euro crisis has driven political turmoil across the euro zone, forcing the collapse of governments in Greece, Italy and elsewhere and heightening political strains. Mr. Lindner’s announcement on Wednesday threw his party into confusion, prompting a significant leadership crisis for the second time this year after party chairman Guido Westerwelle stepped down in May. The party is “in mortal danger like never before,” Gerhart Baum, a former deputy head of the party and German interior minister, told the Phoenix television news television channel.Barely two years ago, Mr. Westerwelle steered the Free Democrats to their best electoral result with 14.6 percent of the vote in the September 2009 parliamentary election. In recent nationwide polls only 3 percent of those polled now say they would vote for the Free Democrats, below the 5 percent threshold needed to remain in Parliament.In a short statement, party leader Philipp Rösler said that he “regretted greatly” Mr. Lindner’s decision to step down and that a successor would be announced in the coming days.Mrs. Merkel’s problems at home have begun to multiply at a critical moment for the efforts to stem the sovereign debt crisis and save the euro.President Christian Wulff, a member of her Christian Democratic Union, is facing significant criticism over a questionable private loan of 500,000 euros or around $658,000 he took from a friend while minister president of the state of Lower Saxony.Opposition politicians say he evaded questions last year in the state Parliament over his business ties to the friend’s husband. A spokesman for Mr. Wulff said that he had behaved appropriately. Mrs. Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, said Wednesday that Mr. Wulff had her “complete trust” and that he was “a good federal president.” Mr. Seibert said that the cabinet did not discuss Mr. Lindner’s decisions to step down, which was a party matter, not a government one.The Free Democrats’ dramatic drop in public support has made the party a difficult partner for Mrs. Merkel at a crucial moment. In the run-up to the vote on the expansion of the temporary European rescue fund, known as the European Financial Stability Facility, members of the Free Democrats were starkly critical of bailing out heavily indebted partners like Greece, Ireland and Portugal.The bailout skeptic and parliamentarian Frank Schäffler has led a party referendum on the euro rescue, with the goal of rejecting the planned permanent rescue known as the European Stability Mechanism. The results of the referendum are expected Friday. Mr. Rösler was sharply criticized for saying that the necessary quorum of roughly one-third of the 64,000 members would not be reached.The resignation of Mr. Lindner, who had been seen as a potential future leader of the Free Democrats, dealt a further blow to the party, which received only 3 percent of the vote in September’s state election in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The result meant that the Free Democrats were excluded from the regional parliament, which requires winning at least 5 percent.Voters have been expressing disappointment with the performance of the Free Democrats in the federal coalition government, partly because of the party’s initial opposition to closing the country’s nuclear energy plants, but also because of persistent squabbling and concerns about a leadership widely viewed as weak and indecisive.The party’s loss of a string of regional elections over the past year has weakened Mrs. Merkel’s center-right government and its overall standing in the polls.“We have no illusions that we have to improve the standing of the Free Democrats,” Mr. Lindner said at the time.'"

"'11-12-16,'0','In 2005 Carlos Ruiz lost part of a thumb when it was caught in machinery at Little Village Car Wash, where he had worked since coming to Chicago from Mexico City in 2000. After the accident, he moved to washing cars by hand, and for six years he worked 12-hour shifts three days a week, earning about $40 a day.Co-workers reported similar pay: Only tips and a small fee per car.“It could be $60 a day, or it could be $30 or $20, for 12 hours,” said Martin Montoya, 28, a former co-worker who came to Chicago from Tijuana two years ago.The wages Mr. Montoya and Mr. Ruiz, 32, say they earned are well below the Illinois minimum of $8.25 an hour, which has led Arise Chicago, advocates for workers’ rights, to organize protests. At one last month, protesters descended on Little Village Car Wash brandishing squeegees and asserting that workers were owed tens of thousands of dollars in back pay. The car wash’s owner did not return phone calls, and a manager on the premises declined to talk.In recent years, advocates and government officials have filed high-profile charges of labor law violations against major companies operating big-box stores, slaughterhouses and warehouses. But according to several academic studies and workers’ rights groups, small businesses like car washes, diners, corner grocery stores and neighborhood butchers may be more likely than large employers to underpay workers.A 2008 study of 4,387 low-wage workers in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles found that 82 percent of people who worked more than 40 hours a week at businesses with fewer than 100 employees were not paid all overtime due. At large employers, the number was 52 percent.'"
"'11-12-16,'0','Armed with a quick wit and a keen appetite for combat, Mr. Hitchens was in constant demand as a speaker on television, radio and the debating platform, where he held forth in a sonorous, plummily accented voice that seemed at odds with his disheveled appearance. He was a master of the extended peroration, peppered with literary allusions, and of the bright, off-the-cuff remark.In 2007, when the interviewer tried to make the case for an all-seeing God, Mr. Hitchens dismissed the idea with contempt. “It would be like living in ,” he said.Mr. Hitchens, a British Trotskyite who had lost faith in the Socialist movement, spent much of his life wandering the globe and reporting on the world’s trouble spots for The Nation magazine, the British newsmagazine The New Statesman and other publications.His work took him to , , , , and in the 1970s, generally to shine a light on the evil practices of entrenched dictators or the imperial machinations of the great powers.After moving to the in 1981, he added American politics to his beat, writing a biweekly Minority Report for The Nation. He wrote a monthly review-essay for The Atlantic and, as a carte-blanche columnist at Vanity Fair, filed essays on topics as various as getting a Brazilian bikini wax and the experience of being waterboarded, a volunteer assignment that he called “very much more frightening though less painful than the bikini wax.” He was also a columnist for the online magazine Slate.His support for the Iraq war sprang from a growing conviction that radical elements in the Islamic world posed a mortal danger to Western principles of political liberty and freedom of conscience. The first stirrings of that view came in 1989 with the Ayatollah ’s fatwah against the novelist for his supposedly blasphemous words in “The Satanic Verses.” To Mr. Hitchens, the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, confirmed the threat.In a political shift that shocked many of his friends and readers, he cut his ties to The Nation and became an outspoken advocate of the American-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and a ferocious critic of what he called “Islamofascism.” Although he denied coining the word, he popularized it.He remained unapologetic about the war. In 2006 he told the British newspaper The Guardian: “There are a lot of people who will not be happy, it seems to me, until I am compelled to write a letter to these comrades in Iraq and say: ‘Look, guys, it’s been real, but I’m going to have to drop you now. The political cost to me is just too high.’ Do I see myself doing this? No, I do not!”Christopher Eric Hitchens was born on April 13, 1949, in Portsmouth, . His father was a career officer in the Royal Navy and later earned a modest living as a bookkeeper.Though it strained the family budget, Christopher was sent to private schools in Tavistock and , at the insistence of his mother. “If there is going to be an upper class in this country, then Christopher is going to be in it,” he overheard his mother saying to his father, clinching a spirited argument.He was politically attuned even as a 7-year-old. “I was precocious enough to watch the news and read the papers, and I can remember October 1956, the simultaneous crisis in and Suez, very well,” he told the magazine The Progressive in 1997. “And getting a sense that the world was dangerous, a sense that the game was up, that the was over.”Even before arriving at Balliol College, , Mr. Hitchens had been drawn into left-wing politics, primarily out of opposition to the Vietnam War. After heckling a Maoist speaker at a political meeting, he was invited to join the International Socialists, a Trotskyite party. Thus began a dual career as political agitator and upper-crust sybarite. He arranged a packed schedule of antiwar demonstrations by day and Champagne-flooded parties with Oxford’s elite at night. Spare time was devoted to the study of philosophy, politics and economics.After graduating from Oxford in 1970, he spent a year traveling across the United States. He then tried his luck as a journalist in , where he contributed reviews, columns and editorials to The New Statesman, The Daily Express and The Evening Standard.“I would do my day jobs at various mainstream papers and magazines and TV stations, where my title was ‘Christopher Hitchens,’ ” he wrote in “Hitch-22,” “and then sneak down to the East End, where I was variously features editor of Socialist Worker and book review editor of the theoretical monthly International Socialism.”He became a staff writer and editor for The New Statesman in the late 1970s and fell in with a literary clique that included , , James Fenton, Clive James and . The group liked to play a game in which members came up with the sentence least likely to be uttered by one of their number. Mr. Hitchens’s was “I don’t care how rich you are, I’m not coming to your party.”After collaborating on a 1976 biography of James Callaghan, the leader, he published his first book, in 1984 to commemorate ’s invasion of Cyprus a decade earlier. A longer version was published in 1989 as “Hostage to History: Cyprus From the Ottomans to Kissinger.”His interest in the region led to another book, “Imperial Spoils: The Curious Case of the Elgin Marbles” (1987), in which he argued that should return the Elgin marbles to Greece.In 1981 he married a Greek Cypriot, Eleni Meleagrou. The marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by their two children, Alexander and Sophia; his wife, Carol Blue, and their daughter, Antonia; and his brother, Peter.Mr. Hitchens’s reporting on Greece came through unusual circumstances. He was summoned to in 1973 because his mother, after leaving his father, had committed suicide there with her new partner. After his father’s death in 1987, he learned that his mother was Jewish, a fact she had concealed from her husband and her children.After moving to the United States, where he eventually became a citizen, Mr. Hitchens became a fixture on television, in print and at the lectern. Many of his essays for The Nation and other magazines were collected in “Prepared for the Worst” (1988).He also threw himself into the defense of his friend Mr. Rushdie. “It was, if I can phrase it like this, a matter of everything I hated versus everything I loved,” he wrote in his memoir. “In the hate column: dictatorship, religion, stupidity, demagogy, censorship, bullying and intimidation. In the love column: literature, irony, humor, the individual and the defense of free expression.”To help rally public support, Mr. Hitchens arranged for Mr. Rushdie to be received at the White House by President , one of Mr. Hitchens’s least favorite politicians and the subject of his book “No One Left to Lie To: The Triangulations of William Jefferson Clinton” (1999).He regarded the response of left-wing intellectuals to Mr. Rushdie’s predicament as feeble, and he soon began to question many of his cherished political assumptions. He had already broken with the International Socialists when, in 1982, he astonished some of his brethren by supporting Britain in the .The drift was reflected in books devoted to heroes like George Orwell (“Why Orwell Matters,” 2002), Thomas Paine (“Thomas Paine’s ‘Rights of Man’: A Biography,” 2006) and (“Thomas Jefferson: Author of America,” 2005).His polemical urges found other outlets. In 2001 he excoriated Mr. Kissinger, the secretary of state in the Nixon administration, as a war criminal in the book “The Trial of Henry Kissinger.” He helped write a 2002 documentary film by the same title based on the book.Mr. Hitchens became a campaigner against religious belief, most notably in his screed against Mother Teresa, “The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice” (1995), and “God Is Not Great.” He regarded Mother Teresa as a proselytizer for a retrograde version of Roman Catholicism rather than as a saintly charity worker.“I don’t quite see Christopher as a ‘man of action,’ ” the writer told in 2006, “but he’s always looking for the defining moment — as it were, our Spanish Civil War, where you put yourself on the right side, and stand up to the enemy.”One stand distressed many of his friends. In 1999, , an aide to Mr. Clinton and a friend of Mr. Hitchens’s, testified before a grand jury that he was not the source of damaging comments made to reporters about , whose supposed affair with the president was under investigation by the House of Representatives.Contacted by House investigators, Mr. Hitchens supplied information in an affidavit that, in effect, accused Mr. Blumenthal of perjury and put him in danger of being indicted.At a lunch in 1998, Mr. Hitchens wrote, Mr. Blumenthal had characterized Ms. Lewinsky as “a stalker” and said the president was the victim of a predatory and unstable woman. Overnight, Mr. Hitchens — now called “Hitch the Snitch” by Blumenthal partisans — became persona non grata in living rooms all over Washington. In a review of “Hitch-22” in The New York Review of Books, Mr. Buruma criticized Mr. Hitchens for making politics personal.To Mr. Hitchens, he wrote, “politics is essentially a matter of character.”“Politicians do bad things,” Mr. Buruma continued, “because they are bad men. The idea that good men can do terrible things (even for good reasons), and bad men good things, does not enter into this particular moral universe.” Mr. Hitchens’s latest collection of writings, “Arguably: Essays,” published this year, has been a best-seller and ranked among the top 10 books of 2011 by The New York Times Book Review.Mr. Hitchens discussed the possibility of a deathbed conversion, insisting that the odds were slim that he would admit the existence of God.“The entity making such a remark might be a raving, terrified person whose cancer has spread to the brain,” he told The Atlantic in August 2010. “I can’t guarantee that such an entity wouldn’t make such a ridiculous remark, but no one recognizable as myself would ever make such a remark.”Readers of “Hitch-22” already knew his feelings about the end. “I personally want to ‘do’ death in the active and not the passive,” he wrote, “and to be there to look it in the eye and be doing something when it comes for me.”'"
"'11-12-16,'0','A half dozen or so readers replied, all agreeing. “A drooled and kissed over tomb is as much history as the man who’s resting there,” wrote a blogger who calls herself Superheidi. Another, Miss Rosette Brune, wrote, “I am sure that Oscar loves lipstick on his tomb, wherever he is now.” Miss Marie responded in the comments, adding: “I wonder how I would feel about lots of people kissing my ancestors’ graves. I think I’d be chuffed, actually!”In the late 1990s, the number of visitors to Wilde’s tomb rose appreciably, as it became a place of pilgrimage within the cemetery, where some of Wilde’s closest neighbors are Gertrude Stein and her companion Alice B. Toklas, as well as Édith Piaf, the French singer. Farther afield is the grave of Jim Morrison of the Doors, another focus of admiring fans.Mr. Holland said the flood of visitors was unleashed by “a combination of things.” There was “Wilde,” the 1997 film starring Stephen Fry, the centenary of Wilde’s death in 2000, but also an extensive exhibit at the British Library that opened that same year. For years, visitors to Wilde’s tomb had limited themselves to leaving graffiti or little notes or flowers. But then, Mr. Holland said, he felt helpless as the number of pink and red kiss marks accumulated.“Polite requests were simply ignored. First, a sign I put up was pinched,” said Mr. Holland, 66, whose grandmother — Wilde’s wife — changed the family name to avoid public scorn after Wilde was sent to prison by a London court for the crime of homosexuality.Wilde left London for Paris in 1897 but never regained the creative impetus that yielded powerful verse and plays like “Lady Windermere’s Fan” and “The Importance of Being Earnest.” He died penniless, of meningitis, at 46 in the Hotel d’Alsace, today just L’Hotel, on the Rue des Beaux-Arts, but not before remarking, with characteristic wit, “I am dying as I have lived — beyond my means.”Friends put up the money to buy the plot at Père Lachaise and had him buried there with a monument by the young Epstein, which survived intact until the 1960s when its outsize genitals were smashed off in an act of vandalism. (It is rumored the cemetery director used them as a paperweight.)Lengthy negotiations with the French authorities and the Irish government led to the tomb’s restoration, which was completed last month. The cost of the work was “perhaps 40,000 to 50,000 euros,” Mr. Holland said, or roughly $55,000 to $67,000, the greater part of it put up by the Irish government, despite its fiscal difficulties, and a lesser amount by the Ireland Fund of France.The glass wall leaves even supporters of the project with a sense of unease. “We’re not happy, of course, with the partition, with the glass screen,” said Sheila Pratschke, director of the Irish Cultural Institute in Paris, which helped arrange the tomb’s restoration. “But it’s more aesthetically pleasing than I expected,” she said.It is hard to say how Wilde would have reacted. But out at Père Lachaise on a recent sunny afternoon, Marc Overton and his partner Ray Fluta, who had traveled from San Diego to pay homage to the writer, were relieved to see the glass barrier. “He’s a great hero to me, to people who believe that the life of the mind has real value,” said Mr. Overton, who said he had first visited the grave in 1966 and had been returning almost every year since. He said he was gratified to see “no more disgusting lip marks.”However, the glass was already spotted with kisses, and flowers and notes were strewn at the tomb’s foot and inside. One paraphrased Wilde: “You taught me that wisdom can come only with winter.”Another quoted him: “We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.”Krzysztof Zembrzycki, 26, a researcher at the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, had come to visit his countryman Frédéric Chopin, who is also buried at Père Lachaise, but dropped by to see Wilde and was put off by the glass wall. “It’s definitely a negative impression,” he said.Lauren Kunze was even more offended. An ardent admirer of Wilde, she had traveled from London, where she is studying marketing, to visit the tomb with her aunt, Kate King, who was visiting from Boston. Both women were appalled by the glass wall.“Some people are purists, they want to see things as they were built,” she said. “It’s their experience of history.”'"
"'11-12-16,'0','CHICAGO (AP) — Chicago Bears receiver Sam Hurd was in federal custody on Thursday, charged with trying to set up a drug-dealing network. He was arrested with a kilogram of cocaine in a sting, the authorities said.Hurd was arrested Wednesday night after meeting with an undercover agent at a Chicago restaurant, according to a criminal complaint that says he was first identified as a potential drug dealer over the summer as the N.F.L. lockout neared an end.Hurd told the agent that he was interested in buying 5 to 10 kilograms of cocaine and 1,000 pounds of marijuana each week to distribute in the Chicago area, the complaint said. He said that he and a co-conspirator distributed about four kilos of cocaine every week, but that their supplier could not keep up with his demands, the complaint alleges.Judge Young Kim said Hurd would need to return to Texas to face the charges. During a hearing Thursday in Chicago federal court, Kim ordered Hurd held pending bond. The hearing will be continued Friday after prosecutors and defense lawyers discuss possible bond. Hurd was handcuffed as marshals led him to the hearing.Brett Greenfield, a defense lawyer, said Thursday that he spoke with prosecutors and expected Hurd to be released Friday. Greenfield said Hurd was ready to “fight the case.”According to the complaint, Hurd agreed to pay $25,000 for each kilogram of cocaine and $450 a pound for the marijuana. The United States attorney in Texas said Hurd faced up to 40 years in prison and a $2 million fine if convicted of conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute more than 500 grams, or half a kilogram, of cocaine.'"
"'11-12-16,'0','The federal government on Thursday escalated its campaign to stanch the flow of what it says is dirty money to the Shiite militant group Hezbollah. Prosecutors filed a civil suit aimed at financially punishing American and Lebanese businesses that the government charges were behind a Hezbollah-controlled global network that laundered huge sums in South American cocaine proceeds.The court action, filed in Manhattan federal court, seeks nearly half a billion dollars in penalties from three Lebanese financial organizations — the now-defunct Lebanese Canadian Bank and two Beirut-based money exchange houses — and 30 auto dealers in the United States. The $480 million in penalties is the sum of the drug proceeds that are alleged to have been laundered; the government is also seeking to freeze and seize assets traceable to those companies.The suit represents the latest effort by the Obama administration to disrupt the financial network that sustains Hezbollah, an organization that the American government has long considered a terrorist group but that has become the pre-eminent military and political power in Lebanon.In February, after a six-year investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Treasury Department forced the closing of the Lebanese Canadian Bank and the sale of its untainted assets to a new owner.It charged the bank with assisting a handful of account holders in a scheme to wash drug money for Colombian cartels by mixing it with the proceeds of used cars bought in the United States and sold in Africa. The government said that the cash was then flown to Lebanon and deposited first into exchange houses named in Thursday’s civil suit and then into the Lebanese Canadian Bank, with Hezbollah taking a cut of the profits.'"
"'11-12-16,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — In a case with potentially far-reaching consequences for freedom of expression on the Internet, a federal judge on Thursday dismissed a criminal case against a man accused of stalking a religious leader on Twitter, saying that the Constitution protects “uncomfortable” speech on such bulletin-boardlike sites.The government had accused the defendant, William Lawrence Cassidy, of harassing and causing “substantial emotional distress” to a Buddhist religious leader named Alyce Zeoli. He had posted thousands of messages about her, some predicting her violent death. He lived in California, she in Maryland.In his 27-page order, Judge Roger W. Titus wrote that “while Mr. Cassidy’s speech may have inflicted substantial emotional distress, the government’s indictment here is directed squarely at protected speech: anonymous, uncomfortable Internet speech addressing religious matters.”The United States attorney’s office in Maryland, which filed the case, had no comment on the order Thursday, and it was unclear whether it would exercise its right to appeal the decision. Shanlon Wu, a lawyer for Ms. Zeoli, said in an e-mail that his client was “appalled and frightened by the judge’s ruling.”Mr. Cassidy’s attorneys with the Federal Public Defender’s office said they were working on his release from jail. Mr. Cassidy’s diatribes on Twitter, posted under an ever-changing list of pseudonyms, were along these lines: “Do the world a favor and go kill yourself. P.S. Have a nice day.”In his order, Judge Titus drew an analogy to the colonial period, when the Bill of Rights was written. A blog, he said, is like a bulletin board that a person of that time might have planted in his front yard. “If one colonist wants to see what is on another’s bulletin board, he would need to walk over to his neighbor’s yard and look at what is posted, or hire someone else to do so,” he offered.'"
"'11-12-16,'0','OTTAWA — Research in Motion said on Thursday that a new line of BlackBerry smartphones that it hoped would turn around its flagging fortunes will not come to market until late next year.It was the latest, and perhaps most significant, setback in a string of product delays and missteps from the company.The phones, which the company had been expected to start selling early next year, will replace RIM’s aging operating system with a new one known as BlackBerry 10. The company said the change would give them performance and capabilities more like Apple’s iPhone or phones using the Android operating system from Google. Mike Lazaridis, a co-chief executive of the company, said the delay in the new phones came from the company’s decision to use a more compact and power efficient microprocessor that would not be available from its manufacturer until the middle of 2012.The phones are widely seen as RIM’s last hope for reversing the drastic decline of the BlackBerry in the United States. BlackBerrys accounted for just 9 percent of the United States’ smartphone market in the third quarter of this year, compared with 24 percent during the same period a year ago, according to market research firm Canalys.The delay was announced during a conference call for the company’s third quarter results. Research in Motion’s third quarter net income fell 71 percent, hurt by giveaway pricing for the BlackBerry PlayBook tablet and costs related to a global service interruption in October. The company said Thursday that its net income was $265 million, or 51 cents a share, plunging from $911 million, or $1.74 a share, in the same time period last year. The smartphone maker, which is based in Waterloo, Ontario, also said that its revenue during the quarter was $5.2 billion, a 6 percent drop from the year before.'"
"'11-12-16,'0','Wayne Pacelle, president of the , which is strongly opposed to any experimentation on chimpanzees, said, “We’re tremendously encouraged.” He said the report’s “overarching conclusion was that chimps are largely unnecessary” for research, and that the report and N.I.H. action could influence two other continuing efforts to stop research on chimps.One is the Great Ape Protection and Cost Savings Act of 2011, now before both houses of Congress. Another is a petition before the federal to declare captive chimpanzees endangered, as wild chimpanzees are. The exemption has allowed research to continue and permits the use of chimpanzees in entertainment and as pets.“ ‘Endangered’ stops all those uses,” Mr. Pacelle said, and the report’s skeptical assessment of the value of chimps in research would provide support for the Fish and Wildlife Service to categorize all chimps as endangered.At the same time, people involved in chimp research said they, too, were happy.Dr. Thomas Rowell, director of the New Iberia Research Center in New Iberia, La., which houses 471 chimpanzees, more than any other center in the country, also said he was “quite pleased” with the report. “It just confirms what we’ve been saying all along in regard to the chimpanzee model for advancing public health research,” he said, referring to the necessity of the chimpanzee for some research on public health.Dr. Collins said the N.I.H. would set up a working group to decide how to carry out the recommendations. Until the group finishes its deliberations, no new grants would be awarded and all N.I.H. chimpanzees that are not already enrolled in experiments would not be involved in any further research projects. Dr. Collins did not offer a timeline or say how many chimpanzees were currently involved in research.Use of chimpanzees has already been waning, partly because it is expensive. The report covers only chimps owned or supported by the government, 612 of a total of 937 chimps available for research in the . Only a few are in experiments at any one time.The committee identified two areas where it said the use of chimpanzees could be necessary. One is research on a preventive vaccine for C. The committee could not agree on whether this research fit the criteria and so left that decision open.In the second area, research on immunology involving monoclonal , the committee concluded that experimenting on chimps was not necessary because of new technology, but because the new technology was not widespread, projects now under way should be allowed to reach completion.The report offered two sets of criteria, one for biomedical experiments, which it said could be considered necessary when there was no other way to do the research — with other animals, lab techniques or human subjects — and if not doing the research would “significantly slow or prevent important advancements to prevent, control and/or treat life-threatening or debilitating conditions.”For behavioral and genomic experiments, the report recommended that the research should be done on chimps only if the animals are cooperative, and in a way that minimizes pain and distress. It also said that the studies should “provide otherwise unattainable insight into comparative genomics, normal and abnormal behavior, , emotion or cognition.”The report also recommended that chimpanzees be housed in conditions that are behaviorally, socially and physically appropriate. All United States primate research centers are already accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, and Dr. Kahn said that this accreditation meets the committee’s recommendation.That was one area where the Humane Society disagreed with the report. “That language,” said Mr. Pacelle, referring to the requirements for adequate cages and enclosures, “was disappointing to us,” because it could mean that chimps that were not in experiments would stay at research centers.“I’m arguing for the movement of all of them to the sanctuaries,” he said, where large open enclosures are much more common.The N.I.H. commissioned the report after an outcry over its plan in 2010 to move a colony of chimpanzees it owned out of semiretirement in Alamogordo, N.M., and back into medical research at a primate center in .The N.I.H. responded in January 2011, by announcing it would leave the chimps in for the time being, and by commissioning the Institute of Medicine to do the study released on Thursday. Dr. Collins confirmed that for now, the Alamogordo chimps would stay where they were.'"

"'11-12-16,'0','After meeting with European Union leaders here, the Russian president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, said his country was “interested in the European Union’s preservation as a dynamic economic and political force” and would consider assistance via the I.M.F. Though Russian leaders and officials face criticism for the conduct of recent elections, they arrived at the meeting in a strong position, knowing that Europe was seeking help from Moscow as well as courting other countries, like China and Brazil.Mr. Medvedev’s economic aide, Arkady V. Dvorkovich, said Russia would be ready immediately to let the I.M.F. keep $10 billion from a commitment made in 2009 that, he said, was due to be reimbursed.A possible second loan from Russia of up to $10 billion was dependent on clearer plans emerging for the financing of a firewall for still-vulnerable euro zone nations like Italy and Spain, Mr. Dvorkovich added.Although such amounts would be relatively modest compared with the hundreds of billions of dollars of rescue reserves that many economists say might be necessary to maintain investor confidence in the euro zone, analysts saw at least symbolic significance in the Russian offer.“There has been a sort of strategic inversion in relations between Russia and the E.U.,” said Thomas Gomart of the Institute for International Relations in Paris. “In 1998, Russia defaulted, and around 14 years later, Russia is in a position to finance Europe. Psychologically, that is a very big change.”While Russia might be willing to pitch in, the head of the European Central Bank on Thursday repeated his recent assertions that the central bank would not respond to widespread calls that it provide a financial firewall for the region’s debt crisis by more aggressively buying government bonds.In a Berlin speech, the bank’s president, Mario Draghi, said that the euro zone’s “firewall” was supposed to be the bailout fund set up by European governments.And yet plans to increase the financial firepower of that bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, to 1 trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) — the target set by European Union leaders — have fallen short. The I.M.F. is expected to help make up some of the shortfall, but the fund is still waiting to hear the details of how the euro zone will put together a new contribution of up to 200 billion euros to the I.M.F.Another European Union summit meeting on the crisis has been tentatively scheduled for the end of January or beginning of February.Where some analysts see the European Central Bank as being more effective lately is in the new medium-term lending program for commercial banks that it announced last week. In the program, which goes into effect next week, the central bank will start providing banks loans for three years, compared with a previous maximum of about one year.The central bank last week also cut its benchmark interest rate target to 1 percent from 1.25 percent.Those moves, more than any new-found confidence in Spain, might help explain the success of Thursday’s Spanish bond auction. Charles Diebel, head of market strategy at Lloyds Banking Group in London, said demand was probably driven in part by banks’ taking advantage of low borrowing costs.“If you can get funding from the E.C.B. at 1 percent and buy bonds from the Spanish government at 5.4 percent, that carries pretty well for three years,” he said. “You’re earning 440 basis points” — 4.4 percentage points. — Mr. Diebel said.But Steven Saywell, head of global currency strategy in London for the French bank BNP Paribas, cautioned against reading too much into Thursday’s developments. “To really turn things around, we’re going to need more aggressive action from the E.C.B.,” Mr. Saywell said. “I don’t think this is a turning point.”The 6 billion euros, or $7.8 billion, of bonds the Spanish Treasury sold Thursday was far above the 3.5 billion euro target it had set for the auction.The sale included 2.2 billion euro of 10-year bonds, priced to yield 5.24 percent — down from the 5.43 percent it had to pay to sell similar securities on Oct. 20.The yield for 10-year bonds of Italy fell 0.22 percentage point, to 6.514 percent, in the open market Thursday as the country’s new prime minister, Mario Monti, called for a vote of confidence Friday on his austerity budget. Mr. Monti hopes to secure support and speed passage of the 30 billion-euro ($39 billion) emergency budget plan that he says is necessary to reduce Italy’s debt burden.The euro ticked back above $1.30 during trading Thursday, up from an 11-month low of $1.2946. But Mr. Saywell predicted the euro would remain weak in the near term, with selling driven both by fears of a breakup of the currency union as well as more prosaic concerns about the economic outlook. The European economy is now widely expected to be mired in recession for at least part of next year.A survey of euro zone purchasing managers, reported Thursday, showed both the services and manufacturing sectors continuing to contract for a fourth straight month in December. Markit Economics said that its composite index rose to 47.9 from 47 in November, but still signaled a contraction. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion.'"
"'11-12-16,'0','For several weeks, people have been watching to see how Mr. Putin would respond. The sour mood began to percolate on Sept. 24, when he revealed his plans to seek the presidency again, frustrating those who had been hoping for liberal reforms. It boiled over last week, after parliamentary elections that were widely seen as fraudulent. Mr. Putin is starting what will be a difficult presidential campaign, not because he faces formidable opponents, but because voters are becoming tired of him.Thursday offered some evidence of how he will approach the protests. After the broadcast, even some of Mr. Putin’s longtime supporters worried that he was underestimating the level of discontent that is taking shape and emboldening the opposition.“He believes that it is a very small minority” protesting the elections, said Nikolai Zlobin, a -based political analyst who attended the question-and-answer session. “That’s a problem, because I think there are a lot of confused people in the society, and it is important for him to try to find a common language with them. My feeling is he feels there is a certain segment of society that just think so differently that it’s not worth spending time trying to convince them to support him.”Public support has been declining gradually for all parts of the government. The ruling party, , lost 77 seats in the Dec. 4 elections despite lackluster competition, and domestic and international observers say that even that result was inflated by fraud.Mr. Putin remains popular by international standards, but his ratings are also in decline. The state-owned All-Russia Public Opinion Center noted a sudden drop in respondents who said they trusted Mr. Putin, from 34 percent in late November to 25 percent on Dec. 10, the day of the biggest protests.Mr. Putin’s dismissive comments took many in Moscow by surprise. The former finance minister Aleksei L. Kudrin, a close ally of Mr. Putin’s for 20 years, said he thought the prime minister was underestimating the seriousness of the protesters’ complaints.“I think that his attitude toward the protests, I am probably not in agreement with it, because hundreds of thousands of people would not have gone out, there is no need to provoke them,” Mr. Kudrin told the RIA Novosti news agency.Mr. Putin offered his critics a modest degree of accommodation. He said he was gratified to see the increasing engagement of young people in politics, saying, “If this is the result of the Putin regime, then great.”Though he made it clear he would not consider nullifying the results of the elections, as protesters have demanded, he said he would consider installing Web cameras in 90,000 polling places to guard against falsification in the March presidential elections. He also proposed restoring direct elections of governors — which were scrapped under his first presidency — though his proposal is a half-measure, allowing candidates to go to a popular vote only after they have been approved by “presidential filter,” as he put it.Mr. Putin lashed out repeatedly at the , most dramatically in response to a question about Senator of , who recently said via that Mr. Putin was seeing the beginnings of an Arab Spring-style uprising. Mr. Putin said that Mr. McCain, as a veteran, “has enough civilian blood on his hands, and he can’t live without these repulsive, disgusting scenes like the killing of Qaddafi,” whose death he said had been caused by an American drone.He said Mr. McCain’s wartime experiences had left him psychologically unhinged.“He went to prison, and not just in prison — they put him in a pit,” Mr. Putin said. “He sat in a pit for several years. Anyone would go crazy.”Mr. Putin offered a long explanation for an episode on Nov. 20 that has now become famous, in which fans appeared to boo Mr. Putin when he stepped into the ring after a event. He said he did not hear any booing himself, but went on to offer three possible explanations.“One of them is that my physiognomy, which is constantly shown on television screens, aroused a certain displeasure,” he said. He went on to say that the fans may also have been booing Jeff Monson, the American wrestler who had just been defeated; he then said that fans may have been booing because they believed that the fight was rigged.“The fact that some of our adversaries, mine in particular, seized on this and started to unravel it,” Mr. Putin said, “well, that is their job, they are paid for it.”Furious antigovernment activists took to the blogosphere on Thursday night, passing around Photoshopped images of Mr. Putin with a condom pinned to his lapel. Anton Orekh, writing on the Web site for the Ekho Moskvy radio station, recommended that the prime minister “sit and calmly think about why this is happening.”“If Vladimir Vladimirovich intends to govern us in the same spirit as before, then the number of wonderful, active, young people in the country will grow even faster,” he wrote. “The citizens with condoms on their clothes will grow to such numbers that they will no longer fit in one square and it will become necessary to rent all the squares and boulevards surrounding it.”'"

"'11-12-17,'0','A recent estimate suggests that the perennially frozen ground known as permafrost, which underlies nearly a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere, contains twice as much carbon as the entire atmosphere.Temperatures are warming across much of that region, primarily, scientists believe, because of the rapid human release of greenhouse gases. Permafrost is warming, too. Some has already thawed, and other signs are emerging that the frozen carbon may be becoming unstable.“It’s like broccoli in your freezer,” said Kevin Schaefer, a scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colo. “As long as the broccoli stays in the freezer, it’s going to be O.K. But once you take it out of the freezer and put it in the fridge, it will thaw out and eventually decay.”If a substantial amount of the carbon should enter the atmosphere, it would intensify the planetary warming. An especially worrisome possibility is that a significant proportion will emerge not as carbon dioxide, the gas that usually forms when organic material breaks down, but as methane, produced when the breakdown occurs in lakes or wetlands. Methane is especially potent at trapping the sun’s heat, and the potential for large new methane emissions in the Arctic is one of the biggest wild cards in climate science.Scientists have declared that understanding the problem is a major priority. The United States Department of Energy and the European Union recently committed to new projects aimed at doing so, and NASA is considering a similar plan. But researchers say the money and people devoted to the issue are still minimal compared with the risk.For now, scientists have many more questions than answers. Preliminary computer analyses, made only recently, suggest that the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions could eventually become an annual source of carbon equal to 15 percent or so of today’s yearly emissions from human activities.But those calculations were deliberately cautious. A recent survey drew on the expertise of 41 permafrost scientists to offer more informal projections. They estimated that if human fossil-fuel burning remained high and the planet warmed sharply, the gases from permafrost could eventually equal 35 percent of today’s annual human emissions.The experts also said that if humanity began getting its own emissions under control soon, the greenhouse gases emerging from permafrost could be kept to a much lower level, perhaps equivalent to 10 percent of today’s human emissions.Even at the low end, these numbers mean that the long-running international negotiations over greenhouse gases are likely to become more difficult, with less room for countries to continue burning large amounts of fossil fuels.In the minds of most experts, the chief worry is not that the carbon in the permafrost will break down quickly — typical estimates say that will take more than a century, perhaps several — but that once the decomposition starts, it will be impossible to stop.“Even if it’s 5 or 10 percent of today’s emissions, it’s exceptionally worrying, and 30 percent is humongous,” said Josep G. Canadell, a scientist in Australia who runs a global program to monitor greenhouse gases. “It will be a chronic source of emissions that will last hundreds of years.”A troubling trend has emerged recently: Wildfires are increasing across much of the north, and early research suggests that extensive burning could lead to a more rapid thaw of permafrost.Standing on a bluff the other day, overlooking an immense river valley, A. David McGuire, a scientist from the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, sketched out two million years of the region’s history. It was the peculiar geology of western North America and eastern Siberia, he said, that caused so much plant debris to get locked in an ice box there.These areas were not covered in glaciers during the last ice age, but the climate was frigid, with powerful winds. The winds and rivers carried immense volumes of silt and dust that settled in the lowlands of Alaska and Siberia.A thin layer of this soil thawed on top during the summers and grasses grew, capturing carbon dioxide. In the bitter winters, grass roots, leaves and even animal parts froze before they could decompose. Layer after layer of permafrost built up.At the peak of the ice age, 20,000 years ago, the frozen ground was more extensive than today, stretching deep into parts of the lower 48 states that were not covered by ice sheets. Climate-change contrarians like to point to that history, contending that any melting of permafrost and ice sheets today is simply the tail end of the ice age.Citing permafrost temperatures for northern Alaska — which, though rising rapidly, remain well below freezing — an organization called the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change claimed that permafrost is in “no more danger of being wiped out any time soon than it was in the days of our great-grandparents.”But mainstream scientists, while hoping the breakdown of permafrost will indeed be slow, reject that argument. They say the climate was reasonably stable for the past 10,000 years or so, during the period when human civilization arose. Now, as people burn immense amounts of carbon in the form of fossil fuels, the planet’s temperature is rising, and the Arctic is warming twice as fast. That, scientists say, puts the remaining permafrost deposits at risk.For several decades, researchers have been monitoring permafrost temperatures in hundreds of boreholes across the north. The temperatures have occasionally decreased in some regions for periods as long as a decade, but the overall trend has been a relentless rise, with temperatures now increasing fastest in the most northerly areas.Thawing has been most notable at the southern margins. Across huge areas, including much of central Alaska, permafrost is hovering just below the freezing point, and is expected to start thawing in earnest as soon as the 2020s. In northern Alaska and northern Siberia, where permafrost is at least 12 degrees Fahrenheit below freezing, experts say it should take longer.“Even in a greenhouse-warmed world, it will still get cold and dark in the Arctic in the winter,” said Mark Serreze, director of the snow and ice data center in Boulder.Scientists need better inventories of the ancient carbon. The best estimate so far was published in 2009 by a Canadian scientist, Charles Tarnocai, and some colleagues. They calculated that there was about 1.7 trillion tons of carbon in soils of the northern regions, about 88 percent of it locked in permafrost. That is about two and a half times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.Philippe Ciais, a leading French scientist, wrote at the time that he was “stunned” by the estimate, a large upward revision from previous calculations.“If, in a warmer world, bacteria decompose organic soil matter faster, releasing carbon dioxide,” Dr. Ciais wrote, “this will set up a positive feedback loop, speeding up global warming.”Katey Walter Anthony had been told to hunt for methane, and she could not find it.As a young researcher at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, she wanted to figure out how much of that gas was escaping from lakes in areas of permafrost thaw. She was doing field work in Siberia in 2000, scattering bubble traps around various lakes in the summer, but she got almost nothing.Then, that October, the lakes froze over. Plumes of methane that had been hard to spot on a choppy lake surface in summer suddenly became more visible.“I went out on the ice, this black ice, and it looked like the starry night sky,” Dr. Walter Anthony said. “You could see these bubble clusters everywhere. I realized — ‘aha!’ — this is where all the methane is.”When organic material comes out of the deep freeze, it is consumed by bacteria. If the material is well-aerated, bacteria that breathe oxygen will perform the breakdown, and the carbon will enter the air as carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas. But in areas where oxygen is limited, like the bottom of a lake or wetland, a group of bacteria called methanogens will break down the organic material, and the carbon will emerge as methane.Scientists are worried about both gases. They believe that most of the carbon will emerge as carbon dioxide, with only a few percent of it being converted to methane. But because methane is such a potent greenhouse gas, the 41 experts in the recent survey predicted that it would trap about as much heat as the carbon dioxide would.Dr. Walter Anthony’s seminal discovery was that methane rose from lake bottoms not as diffuse leaks, as many scientists had long assumed, but in a handful of scattered, vigorous plumes, some of them capable of putting out many quarts of gas per day. In certain lakes they accounted for most of the emerging methane, but previous research had not taken them into consideration. That meant big upward revisions were probably needed in estimates of the amount of methane lakes might emit as permafrost thawed.Most of the lakes Dr. Walter Anthony studies were formed by a peculiar mechanism. Permafrost that is frozen hard supports the ground surface, almost the way a concrete pillar supports a building. But when thaw begins, the ground sometimes turns to mush and the entire land surface collapses into a low-lying area, known as a thermokarst. A lake or wetland can form there, with the dark surface of the water capturing the sun’s heat and causing still more permafrost to thaw nearby.Near thermokarst locations, trees often lean crazily because their roots are disturbed by the rapid changes in the underlying landscape, creating “drunken forests.” And the thawing, as it feeds on itself, frees up more and more ancient plant debris.One recent day, in 11-degree weather, Dr. Walter Anthony and an assistant, Amy Strohm, dragged equipment onto two frozen thermokarst lakes near Fairbanks. The fall had been unusually warm and the ice was thin, emitting thunderous cracks — but it held. In spots, methane bubbled so vigorously it had prevented the water from freezing. Dr. Walter Anthony, six months pregnant, bent over one plume to retrieve samples.“This is thinner ice than we like,” she said. “Don’t tell my mother-in-law! My own mother doesn’t know.”Dr. Walter Anthony had already run chemical tests on the methane from one of the lakes, dating the carbon molecules within the gas to 30,000 years ago. She has found carbon that old emerging at numerous spots around Fairbanks, and carbon as old as 43,000 years emerging from lakes in Siberia.“These grasses were food for mammoths during the end of the last ice age,” Dr. Walter Anthony said. “It was in the freezer for 30,000 to 40,000 years, and now the freezer door is open.”Scientists are not sure yet whether thermokarst lakes will become more common throughout the Arctic in a warming climate, a development that could greatly accelerate permafrost thaw and methane production. But they have already started to see increases in some regions, including northernmost Alaska.“We expect increased thermokarst activity could be a very strong effect, but we don’t really know,” said Guido Grosse, another scientist at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks. He is working with Dr. Walter Anthony on precision mapping of thermokarst lakes and methane seeps, in the hope that the team can ultimately use satellites and aerial photography to detect trends.With this kind of work still in the early stages, researchers are worried that the changes in the region may already be outrunning their ability to understand them, or to predict what will happen.One day in 2007, on the plain in northern Alaska, a lightning strike set the tundra on fire.Historically, tundra, a landscape of lichens, mosses and delicate plants, was too damp to burn. But the climate in the area is warming and drying, and fires in both the tundra and forest regions of Alaska are increasing.The Anaktuvuk River fire burned about 400 square miles of tundra, and work on lake sediments showed that no fire of that scale had occurred in the region in at least 5,000 years.Scientists have calculated that the fire and its aftermath sent a huge pulse of carbon into the air — as much as would be emitted in two years by a city the size of Miami. Scientists say the fire thawed the upper layer of permafrost and set off what they fear will be permanent shifts in the landscape.Up to now, the Arctic has been absorbing carbon, on balance, and was once expected to keep doing so throughout this century. But recent analyses suggest that the permafrost thaw could turn the Arctic into a net source of carbon, possibly within a decade or two, and those studies did not account for fire.“I maintain that the fastest way you’re going to lose permafrost and release permafrost carbon to the atmosphere is increasing fire frequency,” said Michelle C. Mack, a University of Florida scientist who is studying the Anaktuvuk fire. “It’s a rapid and catastrophic way you could completely change everything.”The essential question scientists need to answer is whether the many factors they do not yet understand could speed the release of carbon from permafrost — or, possibly, slow it more than they expect.For instance, nutrients released from thawing permafrost could spur denser plant growth in the Arctic, and the plants would take up some carbon dioxide. Conversely, should fires like the one at Anaktuvuk River race across warming northern landscapes, immense amounts of organic material in vegetation, soils, peat deposits and thawed permafrost could burn.Edward A. G. Schuur, a University of Florida researcher who has done extensive field work in Alaska, is worried by the changes he already sees, including the discovery that carbon buried since before the dawn of civilization is now escaping.“To me, it’s a spine-tingling feeling, if it’s really old carbon that hasn’t been in the air for a long time, and now it’s entering the air,” Dr. Schuur said. “That’s the fingerprint of a major disruption, and we aren’t going to be able to turn it off someday.”'"

"'11-12-17,'0','Reporters accompanying a United Nations diplomat on a rare visit to the area last week saw neighborhoods badly damaged in the last round of fighting — hundreds of homes in the city were destroyed — and a threadbare camp for people displaced by the wars. But there were also plans to rebuild, as well as bustling shops and gas stations without the lines that have formed in other Yemeni cities during the current political crisis.The diplomat, Jamal Benomar, who is the United Nations envoy to Yemen, said the Houthi leader expressed a willingness to participate in a new political process that started last month. The Houthis were not part of an internationally backed agreement to remove Mr. Saleh from power, but the statements by the leader, Abdul Malik al-Houthi, raised the prospect of an end to their armed struggle. “They need to do politics,” Mr. Benomar said after a meeting with Mr. Houthi. “The sooner, the better.”The 11-month Yemeni uprising may have given the movement an opening. The Houthis supported the popular uprising and forged new alliances in protest squares around the country. At the same time, they seized on the political crisis to expand the territory under their control, as their rivals allied with the country’s Islamist opposition tried to do the same.Analysts say that the Houthis are now trying to build on a base of support they have cultivated over years, finding allies among people angered by the government’s indiscriminate attacks during the wars, or impressed with their organizational skills.Majid el-Fahed, a senior project manager with the Finnish conflict resolution organization Crisis Management Initiative, who travels to Saada often, said that despite the relative youth and inexperience of the movement’s leaders, they had been smart administrators, dividing fuel rations so that a quarter was kept for electric generators and some of the rest was distributed to farmers.“I think they want to be part of Yemeni politics so they can be socially effective,” he said.The antigovernment protests that swept through Yemen brought thousands to the streets in Saada for weekly marches from a gate in the old city to a security barracks. In March, as Houthi fighters advanced on the city, the old governor fled.Now the city is administered by an unlikely coalition that includes government troops and defected soldiers, the Houthis and the new governor, a prominent arms dealer who receives a salary from the state. Many people here said that the Houthis were the most powerful members of that coalition and that there was still plenty of confusion — and concern — about their goals.At the same time, the troubles in the north are far from over. Scores of people have been killed in recent weeks during fierce clashes in Damaj, a town on Saada’s outskirts, between Houthi fighters and ultraconservative Islamists called Salafis, one of the many layers of a conflict that has festered over time and could derail any political progress. The Houthis are Zaydi Muslims, an offshoot of Shiite Islam. On one level, the fight is between hard-line religious groups with competing agendas. But analysts say it may also represent a proxy war stoked by unseen hands. At various times, the Salafis have been supported by the Yemeni government, Saudi Arabia or Yemen’s Islamist opposition, they said.Houthis in Saada complain that many of the Salafis are foreigners. At a hospital in Saada city there were several wounded Salafis, some of whom said they were afraid to leave for fear of being attacked by the Houthis. A hospital administrator said it was a Saudi-financed hospital, with a mission to provide care and stay out of politics.In the wards, patients insisted on being heard. They included two Algerians and a student from the United Arab Emirates, who said he had just come to study.“Then, the fighting started,” he said.Some viewed the fighting as a trap for the Houthis, orchestrated to plunge them into a new conflict and keep them out of politics. In a statement released after Mr. Benomar’s visit, Mr. Houthi was looking ahead, saying that “in the context of a fair system,” the movement would consider forming a political party. “This is a step forward,” Mr. Benomar said, after his plane had lifted off from an airstrip in Saada. “It’s a step forward in a long road.”'"
"'11-12-17,'0','Fage (pronounced Fa-yeh), founded in Greece in 1926, opened its first and only American plant in 2008 in Johnstown, about 40 miles northwest of Albany. Americans fancy Greek yogurt, it turns out, and so Fage now wants to spend $120 million to increase its production capacity.No one seems to dispute the worthiness of that project, especially in economically distressed Fulton County, where the unemployment rate stood at 9 percent in October. But as part of the expansion, the company also sought to build a whey pretreatment facility on a parcel of land owned by Johnstown and a neighboring community, Gloversville, next to a wastewater treatment plant they share.In return for its consent, Gloversville asked Johnstown to change the rules for their jointly run sewer system, so that future commercial development just outside their city, near where the Wal-Mart is being built, could tap into it.Johnstown objected. The yogurt got caught in the middle. The governor was not pleased.“The whole year, I’ve said we’re trying to change the perception of the State of New York from an antibusiness state to a state that’s open for business,” Mr. Cuomo said in a telephone interview Friday. “The last thing we should be doing is frustrating businesses.”Mr. Cuomo reached the mayor of Gloversville, Dayton J. King, at about 5:15 on Tuesday night.“He said, ‘I want to talk about yogurt,’ ” Mr. King recalled.Sarah J. Slingerland, the mayor of Johnstown, was home when the local police department called and said the governor was looking for her.“He said, ‘It sounds like you’re very close to an agreement,’ and I said yes,” Mayor Slingerland recalled, “and he said, ‘Well, I would really like this, because of the economic growth and jobs.’ ”Mr. Cuomo also called the head of the yogurt company. “I told him that we would work it out, and pardon any inconvenience, but we would work it out one way or the other; we very much wanted him to stay here and to grow,” the governor said.Mr. Cuomo’s intervention paid off; later Tuesday night, the mayors said they had agreed to settle their dispute. Gloversville would get its sewer hookups; Johnstown would get its yogurt.“It all worked out, so everybody’s happy,” the governor said, adding that he had Fage yogurt in his refrigerator at home. “My daughters,” he said, “are fans.”'"
"'11-12-17,'0','“I’m the only one that puts black heading on top,” said Peter Mazzoli, president of Gravesend Flag Company in Brooklyn. “All these other idiots put a white heading on the fan. I hate to see a white stripe on a mourning fan. The other night I was watching TV and they showed a policeman hanging the mourning drape, and I said: ‘You know what? That’s my fan, but I don’t remember when I sold it to them.’ ”It was Sept. 12, 2001. The twin towers were in ruins. The Ceremonial Unit had about eight mourning fans on hand, and knew they needed more, but no one knew, in those chaotic first days, exactly how many. So somebody ran over to Gravesend and bought 50.Today, much of the rank and file seem willfully oblivious to the mechanics of the bunting, as if knowing would bring bad luck. A veteran detective said, “I believe it’s in the C.O.’s office.” An older police officer said, “Try the quartermaster.” Both wrong.“Some other police department called and asked, when we have a line-of-duty death, was there a policy? A manual we could give them?” said Deputy Inspector Terence Hurson, a precinct commander. “But we didn’t have that. It’s institutional memory.”This is what the institution remembers when the time comes:The buntings are not folded; they are draped on hangers, ready to go. “So it doesn’t get wrinkled,” Lieutenant Giorgio said. They measure six feet long. A 6-foot fan, made correctly, requires 10 feet of fabric, carefully pleated into the half-circle, Mr. Mazzoli said. Some manufacturers try to cut corners by shaving off a foot or two, but that leads to unsightly bunching and puckering in the fan. He sells his mourning fans for $50 apiece, mostly to churches since that big police order 10 years ago.When a member of the department dies, whether on duty or not, an officer in the Ceremonial Unit grabs one or two buntings and drives it over to the precinct. “The mourning drape is supposed to go over the entrance that the person most frequently walked through before he passed away,” Mr. Mazzoli said.Usually, there is not a ladder around, so somebody calls the elite Emergency Services Unit, which puts a man up in a cherry-picker to do the job. The bunting traditionally stays up for 10 days after a death. It is the precinct’s responsibility to get the fan to a dry cleaner before returning it to the Ceremonial Unit, where it is carefully placed back in the locker.Years of 10-day displays under the elements take their toll. Fans tear and fade. “The purple almost goes to a light chartreuse color,” Lieutenant Giorgio said, gently fingering a flag. Eventually, they are removed from service.“We burn them at Rodman’s Neck,” at the police shooting range, he said. “We burn them where we burn the American flag. We felt that’s the only proper way of doing it. Why just throw it in the garbage when we can symbolically burn it? It did represent, at one time, a death.”Officer Peter J. Figoski, 47, spent 22 years at the same station house in East New York, coming and going under the mourning fans for others. The fan that hangs this week arrived within hours of a gunman’s bullet striking him in the head in a dark basement on Monday. Its three brass holes were attached to three letters on the sign out front, from the “o” in “of” to the “e” in “New” to the “o” in “York.”'"

"'11-12-17,'0','The reason Amazon is earning so little while selling so much is that it is spending so much on long-term growth. It’s opening 17 new fulfillment centers — airport hangar-size storage and shipping facilities — this year and aggressively cutting prices. Its profit margin for the quarter was just 2.4 percent, and it said it might be zero for the fourth quarter. (By comparison, Wal-Mart’s margins are 6 percent on revenue of $440 billion. )Amazon seems to be taking customer focus to new levels, willing to run its ever-bigger global business while earning little or nothing in return. To the dismay of some, Mr. Bezos even takes a long-term view of price cuts. “With rare exceptions, the volume increase in the short term is never enough to pay for the price decrease,” he told shareholders in 2005. But that kind of thinking, he added, is “short term. We can estimate what a price reduction will do this week and this quarter. But we cannot numerically estimate the effect that consistently lowering prices will have on our business over five years or 10 years or more.” Selling at low prices may undercut profits, but they create “a virtuous cycle that leads over the long term to a much larger dollar amount of free cash flow, and thereby to a much more valuable Amazon.com,” Mr. Bezos said.Amazon has done little to dampen speculation that it is selling its revamped Kindle e-reader devices and its recently introduced Fire tablet at a loss. Amazon simply doesn’t think like most other companies. When “we think about the economics of the Kindle business, we think about the totality,” Mr. Szkutak said. “We think of the lifetime value of those devices. So we’re not just thinking about the economics of the device and the accessories. We’re thinking about the content.” In other words, profits will come down the road when Kindle users buy content through Amazon.“If everything you do needs to work on a three-year time horizon, then you’re competing against a lot of people,” Mr. Bezos told reporter Steve Levy last month in an interview in Wired. “But if you’re willing to invest on a seven-year time horizon, you’re now competing against a fraction of those people, because very few companies are willing to do that. Just by lengthening the time horizon, you can engage in endeavors that you could never otherwise pursue. At Amazon we like things to work in five to seven years. We’re willing to plant seeds, let them grow—and we’re very stubborn.”Whatever they might say about long-term shareholder value, this is simply too much for many of today’s investors, many of whom are hedge funds, pension funds and institutions who measure their results — and earn their pay — based on quarterly benchmarks. “If you look at the average length of ownership of a stock, the period is declining,” Mr. Devitt said. “Amazon is marching to a different drumbeat, which is long term. Are they doing the right thing? Absolutely. Amazon is growing at twice the rate of e-commerce as a whole, which is growing five times faster than retail over all. Amazon is bypassing margins and profits for growth.”For Amazon, long-term growth confers two major benefits: the kind of economies of scale enjoyed by Wal-Mart and eliminating or weakening competitors. The book retailer Borders has been forced out of business and a rival, Barnes & Noble, is struggling. Best Buy, the electronics retailer, reported this week that earnings plunged 29 percent, despite higher revenue and a surge of Black Friday sales, because the chain had to cut prices and offer free shipping to compete with Amazon. Amazon inflamed many competitors this holiday season by offering extra discounts to shoppers who took mobile devices into stores and then used them to compare prices and order from Amazon.The revamped Kindle line and especially the new Fire tablet illustrate Amazon’s long-term strategy. “Amazon has much greater ambitions than near-term profits or margins,” Ken Sena, an Evercore analyst, said.“Some people are griping that the Fire is sub-par,” Mr. Sena continued. “It’s not an iPad. And some investors are confused. Why would they give it away, even lose money on it? But getting it into as many hands as possible is important to them. They’ll use it to drive higher physical and digital good sales on their site. And these devices also bring Amazon deeper into the local retail opportunity, not to mention the app marketplace potential that exists. Media sales on the device are just the beginning. I think Amazon understands all these components.”The Fire “isn’t meant to be another iPad,” Mr. Devitt noted. “It’s a device to sell Amazon content. All indications are it’s a success. It’s the most gifted item on Amazon. It’s too soon to tell, but it seems more promising than it’s getting credit for.” This week Amazon said it had sold more than a million Kindles a week for the last three weeks.Nearly 15 years after Amazon’s public offering, it’s safe to say that Mr. Bezos and his colleagues have realized their goal of creating a company to tell their grandchildren about. But one of these days Amazon has to deliver on its promise of higher margins and profits, however long term that may turn out to be. “To many investors, long term is a year,” Mr. Devitt said. “For Bezos, he’s looking at a 10- to 20-year time line. When he says long term, he means 2020 or 2030.”'"
"'11-12-17,'0','Mr. Gingrich, whose strong debate performances helped him renew his bid, faces a debate-free final three weeks into the Iowa caucuses. He must now rely on his nascent campaign organization and the strength of his brand to rally support.In South Carolina, which votes on Jan. 21 and where Mr. Gingrich has his largest operation — at least three offices and a staff of nine — his campaign dismissed the significance of Ms. Haley’s endorsement.“We have the whole Tea Party support which got her elected,” said Leslie Gaines, a co-state director for Mr. Gingrich.On his way to Virginia, Mr. Gingrich was greeted by well-wishers at the airport in Omaha, with voters lining up for pictures and autographs. But the supporters, who introduced themselves as travelers from Missouri, Mississippi and Texas, do not live in any of the early voting states.On Saturday, Mr. Gingrich plans to attend a children’s book signing for his wife, Callista, at Mount Vernon (but not sign his own books). That evening, he will sit in the audience while she performs on the French horn in a holiday concert.Mr. Gingrich was criticized last spring by more than a dozen aides who quit the campaign, saying he was not focused enough. Rick Tyler, one of his former aides, said on Friday that his view of Mr. Gingrich’s strategy has drastically shifted. “Newt, despite his detractors and consultants, might actually know what he’s doing,” Mr. Tyler said.Mr. Romney, on other hand, has spent the past few months reeling in, and then rolling out, strategic endorsements from prominent Republican leaders — former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and now Ms. Haley.At a Friday afternoon rally, Ms. Haley bestowed some of her energy and clout on Mr. Romney, packing a firehouse here with a crowd so large that 125 people were left standing outside.“Governor Romney is the one person President Obama continues to go after over and over and over again,” she said. “What does that tell you? I think he’s a little bit scared!”Ms. Haley’s endorsement could help Mr. Romney in a critical, conservative state where he is trailing Mr. Gingrich in most polls. Mr. Romney came in fourth in the state in 2008, winning only 15 percent of the vote.Mr. Romney hopes that Ms. Haley, who has Tea Party credentials and Washington outsider status, can testify that his conservative credentials are stronger than that of Mr. Gingrich.But Mr. Romney may still face a rough slog in the state. Mr. Gingrich has devoted many of his limited resources to South Carolina, which he regards as crucial to his campaign.Mr. Romney had spent the week leading up to the debate attacking Mr. Gingrich — in interviews, television and Web ads, and through surrogates — but during the debate on Thursday, he tamped down his criticisms.One day later, Mr. Romney took nothing for granted. An early morning town hall in Iowa was followed by a quick trip to South Carolina for the Haley endorsement. Ms. Haley plans to appear with Mr. Romney at campaign stops throughout the state on Saturday, and the Romney campaign felt her endorsement was so critical that it chartered a 30-seat plane for the press corps to make sure the national news media did not miss the moment.Mr. Romney has also gained a boost from advertising, which has picked up in intensity and frequency this week, the last before the start of the holiday season when campaigns typically avoid the airwaves. The flow of advertising has been particularly heavy in Iowa, where television viewers and radio listeners have been subject to a nearly nonstop barrage of political commercials, the result of millions of dollars of spending by the campaigns of Gov. Rick Perry, Representative Ron Paul, Mr. Romney and Mr. Gingrich and outside political groups supporting them.Many of the ads have been aggressive, most of them aimed at Mr. Gingrich, hitting him for “serial hypocrisy,” questioning his conservative credentials and painting him as a corrupted creature of Washington.In a plea Friday asking for donations, Mr. Gingrich acknowledged the attacks were taking a toll. “The $9 million in negative advertising launched by Ron Paul, Mitt Romney and their supporters against Speaker Gingrich is starting to have an impact and we need the resources necessary to respond on the air in Iowa,” wrote Michael Krull, the campaign manager for Mr. Gingrich, in an e-mail to supporters.After Mr. Romney’s rally in Greenville, he hopped back on his plane and headed to Charleston, S.C., where he will tape “Fox News Sunday” on Saturday morning between events around the state with Ms. Haley. Mr. Gingrich’s spokesman had said he was doing no television over the weekend, but late in the day Friday, a surprise e-mail landed in reporters’ in-boxes: Mr. Gingrich would sit down with Bob Schieffer for an interview on “Face the Nation.”'"

"'11-12-17,'0','BEIJING — China’s official news agency reported on Friday that Gao Zhisheng, a prominent human rights lawyer who has been missing for more than 20 months, will serve the next three years in prison because he repeatedly violated his probation.The brief statement from a Beijing court provoked fresh outrage among human rights advocates who characterize Mr. Gao’s case as a leading example of abuse of dissidents in China. Although said to be free on probation for the past five years, Mr. Gao has been missing for much of the time since he was sentenced in 2006 for inciting subversion of state power.His older brother, Gao Zhiyi, told the group China Human Rights Defenders that the court’s announcement proves that Mr. Gao has been in police custody even though the public security authorities have insisted that they had no knowledge of his whereabouts. Gao Zhiyi said he last saw his brother in April 2010 in the custody of public security officers; he is worried that his brother may be dead.Renee Xia, one of the directors of the human rights group, said that the court’s declaration “is the clearest acknowledgement to date by the Chinese government that it has secretly detained Gao for the last 20 months despite its repeated denials.”Human rights advocates say secret detentions and disappearances have become a common tactic for Chinese authorities to suppress dissidents, especially since February, when the government began to fear that the Arab Spring uprisings would spread to China. The government is currently considering revising its criminal procedure law in a manner that human rights lawyers say would effectively legalize secret detentions.'"

"'11-12-18,'0','High water is precisely what many people find gushing from buckled streets across Chicago after corroded water mains rupture. One such incident in August opened a gaping hole that swallowed an Acura sport-utility vehicle on a North Side street.Last month aldermen cited the need to replace deteriorating infrastructure as they approved Mr. Emanuel’s plan to sharply raise water and sewer rates for the accelerated program of public works projects.“If we don’t do this, our streets will sink,” Alderman Ariel Reboyras (30th Ward) said.The plan to improve the city’s water-distribution and sewer systems could create about 1,800 jobs a year, winning Mr. Emanuel favor with a unionized work force that has often viewed his budget-slashing zeal with trepidation.But the initiative also comes at a moment when the city’s water and sewer budgets have been increasingly hard-pressed to keep up with even the debts incurred when the city borrowed for its previous, less aggressive infrastructure-replacement efforts, according to bond-market analysts.From Jardine and another plant on the Lake Michigan shore at 79th Street, tap water is pumped to about five million people across the city and in 125 suburbs. Revenues have risen over the past 10 years, thanks in part to rate increases from 2008 to 2010. Water and sewer fees generated almost $650 million for City Hall last year.By cutting the payroll of the Water Management Department, the city has kept operating expenses stable at about $250 million a year. Another $225 million a year has been invested in upgrading the water system and sewers.But the cost of servicing debt issued for those projects has grown sharply, eating up an ever-growing chunk of the revenues that the city gets from water customers. Debt-service payments from the water and sewer budgets will increase next year to almost $250 million, double the level of eight years ago, budget records show.The situation prompted Fitch Ratings to downgrade the credit worthiness of the city’s water fund a year ago. The analysts cited “a gradual erosion of financial flexibility that has occurred in recent years, coupled with the system’s rising debt levels.”Mr. Powers said city officials had crunched the numbers and stood ready to borrow more money to help pay for the intensified water and sewer replacement program. The city plans to spend more than $350 million on the water system and sewers next year, an increase of $130 million over 2011.Most of the first year’s work will be paid for with additional borrowing early in 2012. As revenues from the higher consumer rates pour in, Mr. Powers said, the city will try to pay for much of the work as it proceeds.Water rates will rise 25 percent next year, with further 15 percent increases in each of the next three years.From the two treatment plants on the lakeshore, tunnels buried as deep as 200 feet carry purified lake water to 12 pumping stations throughout the city. The city plans to spend some of the infrastructure money to convert the last four steam-powered pumping stations to run on electricity.The pumping stations send lake water coursing through the water mains. The 10-year plan will supplant an average of 88 miles a year of mains that are at least 100 years old, at a cost of about $2 million per mile.Sewer replacement, which costs $4 million a mile, will also increase next year, to 17 miles from 11 miles. The department wants to continue expanding its efforts to line sewers with resin, to better preserve them and forestall total rebuilding.Mr. Powers said he had begun the process of hiring more laborers, bricklayers, plumbers, heavy-machine operating engineers and truck drivers.About half of the work on water mains has been outsourced to private contractors, he said, while city employees perform about 70 percent of sewer-improvement work. Mr. Powers said he expected that ratio to persist as the workload increased to meet the mayor’s goals.The waterworks plan was “something we have been howling about for years,” said Jorge Ramirez, president of the Chicago Federation of Labor. “It’s a good way to rebuild the middle class.”Of the roughly 1,900 employees of the Water Management Department, more than 600 blue-collar workers are paid $40 to $50 an hour, with another 900 receiving hourly wages of $30 to $40, according to city payroll data.Driven by the desire for such wages, as well as benefits, workers made the department a hotbed of patronage hiring and promotions in Mayor Richard M. Daley’s administration.The department was also involved in bribery and time-card fraud scandals, while a heroin-dealing ring there in 2005 inspired some City Hall observers to jokingly suggest a new slogan to appear on water bills: “We put the H in your H20.”Mr. Powers said that he believed there was room for improved productivity in the department but that he saw no reason to fear that corruption would spoil the mayor’s plan.“Any company at all is going to have some problem children,” he said, “but by and large the work force wants to do the right thing.”'"

"'11-12-18,'0','“The field of American Jewish women’s history as a scholarly enterprise owes its origins to Paula Hyman,” said Hasia R. Diner, a professor of history at New York University and director of the university’s Goldstein-Goren Center for American Jewish History.Colleagues said Dr. Hyman’s work was informed by twin, deep-rooted and sometimes conflicting bonds: to Judaism and to feminism. When she was a graduate student at Columbia in 1972, she and a dozen other Jewish feminists delivered a historic manifesto to hundreds of rabbis gathered for the annual meeting of the Conservative movement’s Rabbinical Assembly.Titled “Jewish Women Call for Change,” it demanded full equality for women in the practice of Conservative Judaism, one of the three major Jewish denominations. The Conservative denomination accommodated modern culture more than the Orthodox branch but less so than the Reform, which ordained an American woman as a rabbi for the first time that year.“Call for Change” addressed the Conservative leaders because they continued to observe many Orthodox rules excluding women: denying them full participation in rituals, denying their right to initiate religious divorces and barring them from becoming rabbis and cantors. The bans on ordination and full participation have since been lifted, while the right to initiate divorce is still denied.Partly to further the cause, Dr. Hyman agreed in 1981 to become dean of undergraduates at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Upper Manhattan, the flagship educational institution of the Conservative movement. Hired by the seminary’s chancellor, Rabbi Gerson D. Cohen, an outspoken supporter of women’s equality, she was the first woman to hold the post. Rabbi Cohen ordained the first female Conservative rabbi in 1985.Paula Ellen Hyman was born on Sept. 30, 1946, in Boston, the oldest of three children of Sydney and Ida Hyman. Her father was an office manager; her mother worked as a bookkeeper. Her interest in Jewish tradition and history led her to enroll simultaneously at Radcliffe College and the Hebrew Teachers College of Boston, now known as Hebrew College.After graduating in 1968 from Radcliffe, she pursued her graduate studies at Columbia University, where she received her Ph.D. in 1975. In 1969 she married Dr. Rosenbaum, who survives her, as do their daughters, Judith and Adina Rosenbaum; her mother; two sisters, Toby and Merle Hyman; and two grandchildren.Influenced by the feminist movement of the 1960s, Dr. Hyman sought to apply “consciousness raising” principles to Jewish traditions that, in her view, made women second-class members of their own cultural communities, said Martha Ackelsberg, a fellow Columbia graduate student and now a professor of government at Smith College. Dr. Hyman organized discussion groups that evolved into the organization Ezrat Nashim (“Women’s Help”), which conceived and presented the “Call for Change.”Dr. Hyman’s early scholarly work focused on Jewish life in France at the turn of the last century following the Dreyfus affair. She subsequently wrote about Jewish assimilation in Europe during the same period.In 1976, she and two colleagues wrote “The Jewish Woman in America,” an unabashedly feminist view of the Jewish immigrant experience, in which Dr. Hyman argued that Jewish women worked as hard as men, accomplished great things and did it all while managing households single-handedly. It was, she said, “the only book for which I received fan letters.”The academic interest sparked by that book produced many of the 700 scholarly articles collected in 1997 in the two-volume historical encyclopedia “Jewish Women in America,” which Dr. Hyman and Dr. Deborah Dash Moore edited.In an essay for the Jewish Women’s Archive, Dr. Hyman described the small dinner party held by some of the original signers of the “Call for Change” manifesto on Oct. 24, 1983, the day the Jewish Theological Seminary opened its rabbinical school to women. “It seemed like a prolonged struggle,” she recalled saying at the time.But “in the context of Jewish history,” she added, “11 years was like the blink of an eye.”'"

But the damage done by those acting as allowed by our ineffective rules costs the public much more.“Our troubled financial times” are the product of a bubble economy fueled by cheap money, an abject failure by rating agencies, regulatory agencies that have been hamstrung by regulations written by financial lobbyists, and a laserlike focus by some bank leaders on yearly bonuses. With the possible exception of the Federal Reserve, no entity in our current financial world focuses on stability, sustainability and success.There has been no serious attempt to address any of these problems. Mr. Madoff’s antics, like those of professional wrestlers, seem just an entertaining diversion. Chris Cannon'"
"'11-12-18,'0','But study their charts more closely and you’ll find that those averages mask remarkable variation. Norway had only a slight decline in per capita G.D.P. — around 1 percent — after its 1987 crisis, and output was back to its previous level in just three years. By contrast, real per capita G.D.P. in Argentina fell more than 20 percent in conjunction with its 2001 crisis, and took eight years to recover.The Depression illustrates the variability vividly. Real per capita G.D.P. fell nearly 30 percent in the United States, and didn’t return to its pre-crisis level for a decade. But in Spain, it fell only 9 percent in the Depression as a whole, and actually rose in the year after its 1931 banking crisis.There was even huge variation within the United States during this period. The Friedman-Schwartz study found four distinct waves of banking panics in the early 1930s. After the first three, output plummeted. But after the last one, in early 1933, output skyrocketed, with industrial production rising nearly 60 percent from March to July. That time was very different.What explains the variations? Crises don’t happen in isolation. They’re often accompanied by other factors, which differ across episodes. For example, financial crises that happen along with currency crises tend to be followed by much more severe recessions.Likewise, some panics follow particularly big declines in house and stock prices, which have damaging effects on their own. The most recent recession would likely have been severe — and the recovery slow — even if the financial system hadn’t been stressed, simply because of the decline in wealth and the climb in household indebtedness.BUT an even larger determining factor is the policy response. Why was the Great Depression so much worse here than in Spain? According to an influential paper by Ehsan Choudhri and Levis Kochin, Spain benefited from not being on the gold standard. Its central bank was able to lend freely and increase the money supply after the panic. By contrast, in 1931, the Federal Reserve in the United States raised interest rates to defend its gold reserves and stay on the gold standard, setting off further declines in output and exacerbating the banking crisis.Likewise, the policy response largely explains why output fell after the American banking panics in 1930 and 1931, but rose after the final wave in early 1933. After the first waves, the Fed did little, and President Herbert Hoover signed a big tax increase to replenish revenue. After the final wave, President Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard, increased the money supply and began a program of New Deal spending.A 2009 study by the International Monetary Fund concluded that fiscal expansion can mitigate the impact of crises. But the Reinhart-Rogoff study points out that policy makers’ ability to take strong fiscal action depends on whether they start with high levels of debt. In the current episode, China and South Korea have recovered faster, partly because they have taken more aggressive fiscal stimulus measures. They could do that because they entered the crisis in good fiscal health.The response to troubles in the banking system also matters. After its banking panic in 1991, Sweden aggressively restored its banks to health. They were nationalized, recapitalized with public funds, and then returned to private control. After three rough years, Sweden grew rapidly, soon returning to its pre-crisis trend.Japan, by contrast, put off cleaning up its banks after its 1992 crisis. For years, it allowed financial institutions to avoid realizing losses by simply rolling over loans to unproductive or failing companies. Partly as a result, it has struggled almost two decades with anemic growth and deflation. And, unlike Sweden, it is still miles from its pre-crisis trajectory.So where does this more nuanced interpretation of the evidence leave us? First, as the extreme cases show, financial crises matter. Left uncontrolled, they can leave an economy in shambles for years. So policy makers need to make the financial system less prone to crises, and to fight panics aggressively when they arise. This is a lesson that European leaders, sitting on the edge of a financial meltdown and dithering over a solution, should keep foremost in their minds. And it’s a cautionary tale for those who’d hinder worldwide attempts at stricter financial regulation.Second, the importance of the policy response in determining the effects of crises argues strongly against complacency here at home. A country as creditworthy as the United States can continue to use fiscal stimulus to help return the economy to full employment. And, as I argued in a previous column, there’s much more the Fed could be doing. Whether we continue to fester or finally embark on a robust recovery depends on whether we choose to use the tools available.Finally, governments around the world, including our own, should remember that it helps to be in sound fiscal shape before a crisis hits. When we’re all finally through the current mess, governments should rededicate themselves to fiscal responsibility. Being careful in good times gives policy makers the ability to fight crises in bad ones.'"
"'11-12-18,'0','Is it Cadillac enough for the A.B.A.?The debate about legal education has focused on tuition costs in the stratospheric layers of the law-school world. But what of the ground floor? Duncan hopes to draw students from economically distressed parts of the country, including the Appalachian of , and sincere efforts have been made to keep overhead to a minimum.But tuition here is still $28,664 a year. With living expenses and various fees, the student handbook warns, the total price tag for a year runs $50,000.The reason, according to Pete DeBusk, a retired businessman and the school’s main benefactor, is the A.B.A. standards. Without them, he says, Duncan could have cut its tuition in half, maybe by two-thirds.“The rules, the regulations,” Mr. DeBusk moans, recalling the day he first met with officials of the A.B.A. four years ago. “Massive. Just massive. ‘We’ve got this standard, we’ve got that standard’ — and the standards don’t ever stop. I realized then that I’d bitten off a big bite, O.K.? And I’m still chewing on it!”Anyone willing to invest $175,000 on a legal education, and hoping to earn a pile of money at a corporate firm, has plenty of options. But let’s say that your ambition is to make a modest living, perhaps in an area that is struggling. Or that you’d rather not enter your mid-20s lashed to a six-figure .If you want a diploma blessed by the A.B.A. — and you don’t have rich parents, a plum scholarship or an in-state public law school with lots of taxpayer support — you are pretty much out of luck. And that is not just a problem for would-be attorneys. The lack of affordable law school options, scholars say, helps explain why so many Americans don’t hire lawyers.“People like to say there are too many lawyers,” says Prof. Andrew Morriss of the University of Alabama School of Law. “There are too many lawyers who charge $300 an hour. There aren’t too many lawyers who will handle a divorce at a reasonable rate, or handle a bankruptcy at a reasonable rate. But there is no way to be that lawyer and service $150,000 worth of debt.”This helps explain a paradox: the churns out roughly 45,000 lawyers a year, but survey after survey finds enormous unmet need for legal services, particularly in low- and middle-income communities. This year, the World Justice Project put the United States dead last among 11 high-income countries in providing access to civil justice.It’s not just that many lawyers are prohibitively expensive. It is that when it comes to legal expertise, there are not a lot of cheaper alternatives — not in the United States, anyway. , on the other hand, has a long menu of options, including a tier of professionals called legal executives, who are licensed after getting the equivalent of a community college degree. Counsel is also available from nonlawyers at a variety of nonprofits. And you can buy a simple divorce over the Internet for a set fee, or pay for customized legal advice, online or by phone.“In the U.S., people and businesses have only one place to go for all their legal help — lawyers who graduated from an A.B.A.-approved law school and who follow mostly A.B.A. rules about how they run their practice,” says Gillian Hadfield, a professor at the Gould School of Law of the . “Everyone else who offers legal advice is engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.”To understand why Americans have one option for legal counsel, and why even start-up law schools are so expensive, you need to understand the various roles played by the A.B.A., say Ms. Hadfield and others.With nearly 400,000 members and a staff of 939, the A.B.A. is the pre-eminent association of the profession. It also drafts and amends the Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which have been adopted by every state except . Then there is the A.B.A.’s gatekeeper role in law school education, through its Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar.Detractors contend that these responsibilities allow the A.B.A. to behave like a guild — limiting competition and keeping the cost of legal education excessively high.In 1995, those accusations were leveled by the Department of Justice in an antitrust suit that charged that A.B.A. standards had artificially inflated faculty salaries. The A.B.A. signed a consent decree, agreeing to a number of strictures intended to pry the process out of the hands of legal academics and end the fixing of salariesSince then, the cost of law school tuition has soared, though at the high end, those prices are not the fault of the A.B.A. They are attributable to the prestige race prompted by U.S. News & World Report’s rankings of law schools, along with the wide availability of .What the A.B.A. can be blamed for, says B. Shepherd, a professor at the Emory University School of Law, are exorbitant prices even at those schools that aspire to affordability. That, he maintains, is all about accreditation.If your dream is to work at , “you can go to Harvard Business School and spend a couple hundred thousand dollars, in tuition and forgone earnings,” he says. “If you just want to move up the management ranks at , you can take part-time evening classes and spend $10,000 for a degree. The part-time school may not be accredited, but this gets to the difference — state law says you can become an attorney only if you attend an accredited law school. There’s no law that says you need to attend an accredited business school in order to practice business.”Professor Shepherd says aspiring lawyers should have the same choices as aspiring executives and managers. Others say the case against the A.B.A.’s standards is that they are one-size-fits-all and overly rigid, which drives up the cost of both a diploma and of legal services.A result is an expensive quandary for potential clients, says Professor Morriss of the University of Alabama. “Maybe you need a plumber,” he says. “But you have to hire a brain surgeon.”Members of the A.B.A. Section say the point of the standards is not to raise the cost of law school, or to limit competition. The point is to ensure that lawyers are well trained and that the public gets quality legal services.”It’s pretty basic, and more or less the accreditation function that you’ll see for any profession,” says John O’Brien, chairman of the Section and dean of the New England School of Law. “You want to make certain that a school that is nationally approved is providing students with what they have a right to receive in terms of education. And at the other end you want to protect the public and make certain that graduates who offer themselves as qualified lawyers know what they’re doing.”Mr. O’Brien goes on to offer a mental exercise for deans. “Look at the standards and ask: ‘What is it that the A.B.A. requires that I wouldn’t be doing anyway?’ The answer is precious little, if anything.”IN early November, Mr. DeBusk and Mr. Beckman met in a lobby of the Duncan School of Law to offer a tour of the premises.Mr. Beckman, the dean, was preparing for a hearing, set for Dec. 2, before Mr. O’Brien’s council, to determine whether provisional accreditation would be granted to Duncan.Provisional accreditation is an intermediate step on the way to full accreditation, and a school can apply for it only after it has been operating for at least a year. For this reason, accreditation isn’t just expensive, it’s also risky.In the case of other professional schools, he says, “you go to the accreditors before you open your doors, and they work with you from the beginning. And if you’re not in compliance, they will tell you. The A.B.A. says you can’t even apply for accreditation until you’ve completed your first year. That’s a huge difference.”Duncan, as it happens, does not need the A.B.A.’s imprimatur. Tennessee is one of the few states that allow graduates of law schools that have only state or regional accreditation to sit for the bar. But to Duncan’s backers, A.B.A. approval is considered crucial.The school is part of Mr. DeBusk’s alma mater, Lincoln Memorial University, and just the latest of many philanthropic projects that he hopes will turn L.M.U. into what he calls “a little Duke.” That means appealing to applicants beyond Tennessee, including those in the Appalachians of , where he grew up, in a Landola trailer home.Mr. DeBusk earned a fortune through a medical device company he founded, DeRoyal Industries. Now, he says, he would like to spend the rest of his life and much of his wealth elevating others in the region.“A lot of people talk about Appalachia,” he says, “but how many people do anything for it?”Duncan’s largest single cost is its faculty, which, as with most A.B.A.-accredited law schools, consumes about half its total budget. This is the only expense that Mr. Beckman declines to detail, other than to say that he has three adjuncts and 16 full-time professors. Adjuncts are basically part-timers and far less expensive. But the A.B.A. prohibits an adjuncts-only faculty by requiring that full-time faculty teach a major portion of the entire curriculum. The standards don’t come right out and state that tenure must be offered, but that is strongly implied. It’s also implied that these professors get time to produce scholarship, such as law review articles. This is expensive. It obligates schools to give researching professors lower teaching loads and hire yet more instructors to cover all the classes that students need.The more you look at a law school’s ledgers, the more life in the legal academy seems a sweet deal. And it’s been getting sweeter. Course loads have shrunk in the last couple of decades; the pay scale is high and has been rising. Median salaries are in the $120,000-to-$150,000 range, but superstars can earn $300,000 or more and the best of the best get pretty special housing deals. Over the summer, the New York University School of Law spent $5.6 million on two apartments in the West Village. A spokesman for the school said it had yet to determine whether the units would be combined and who would live there.“It’s a wonderful life,” says Nancy Rapoport, a professor at the Boyd School of Law at the , , and author of an article for the Indiana Law Journal, “Eating Our Cake and Having It Too: Why Real Change Is So Difficult in Law Schools.”“You’ve got a lot of happy law professors, who don’t want to change anything,” Ms. Rapoport said. “They may not realize how precarious legal education is, and the legal market is, right now. That’s human nature. Everything is going well. Let’s keep it the way it is.”The argument for high salaries has always been that law professors could earn even more money at a law firm. As for tenure, one oft-cited reason for requiring it is that the most sought-after talent demands it, putting a school that doesn’t offer tenure at a disadvantage.“I need to get the best teachers out there,” says Mr. O’Brien, the council chairman, “and the fact of the matter is that in order to do that, to compete for top-quality faculty, I have to offer tenure.”That said, Mr. O’Brien pointed out that the tenure requirement was under review and had been hotly debated for at least a dozen years. What is under consideration is nothing more than giving schools the option of not offering tenure. To David E. Van Zandt, former dean of the School of Law and now president of the New School, this is evidence that the legal academy remains strikingly impervious to change.“The standards are a damper on innovation,” Mr. Van Zandt said. “They are a very powerful force and they are controlled by legal insiders, particularly faculty. And if they can control the regulations so that it benefits them, why not? They are no different than any other interest group out there.”Since the consent decree, the A.B.A. has required that a majority of members on accreditation-related committees be something other than law school faculty members. On Mr. O’Brien’s council, for instance, 10 of the 21 members are either professors or deans. Most of the rest are lawyers or judges.A.B.A. critics have long argued that faculty members, even if technically a minority, hold the most sway on accreditation-related committees because they care most about the committees’ rulings. And whatever safeguards keep the bar association’s Section on Legal Education independent and separate, it is still dominated by A.B.A. members.“Let’s suppose I wanted to start a newspaper in ,” Mr. Beckman, the dean at Duncan, says. “But to get permission I need to go before a council, and is sitting on that council. If I get permission, that means advertisers and resources are potentially going to detract from The Times. Well, there are a finite number of people applying to law school, and applications have been declining. The fact that other law schools get to decide whether we are accredited seems a little bit like a conflict of interest.”Mr. O’Brien maintains that the accreditation-related committees are scrupulously fair.“I think the council that I sit on, and the Standards Review Committee that weighs all this, are legitimately trying to figure out what is best for legal education,” he says. “I don’t think they are looking to feather the nest of faculty. I have a lot of faith in the people on these committees. These are people with tremendous integrity.”THE A.B.A. won its role in legal education after a messy battle that began early in the 20th century. At the time, dozens of profit-making night schools were springing up, offering a more practical curriculum at a fraction of the tuition charged by established schools. From 1890 to 1930, the number of law schools tripled, and most of the increase came from night schools, according to Mr. Shepherd of Emory University and William G. Shepherd, authors of “Scholarly Restraints? A.B.A. Accreditation and Legal Education.”To say that these night schools and their graduates appalled the A.B.A.’s core membership hardly captures the horror. Thousands of new lawyers were suddenly flowing into the market, many of them poor immigrants. Some of these night-school graduates were accused of incompetence, though notably those accusations came from the legal establishment, both in the field and in academia. The dean of described night schools as a “rank weed” and urged their closure.The A.B.A. spent more than 30 years working toward that goal. In its way stood a formidable obstacle named Gleason Archer. A native of who started as a cook for lumberjacks, Mr. Archer founded the Suffolk Law School in , and by 1928 it was one of the largest law schools in the world, with 4,000 enrollees.“Opportunity’s open door” was Suffolk’s motto. The school catered to middle- and lower-class men who worked during the day.“I’d run up in my overalls with greasy hands,” wrote George Fingold, a Suffolk graduate who served as attorney general of in the 1950s. “I’d wash and change into clean clothes and then run to class. For me, Suffolk Law was my last hope to make something of myself.”The A.B.A. made little headway against night schools, and for years its list of approved institutions was all but ignored — until the Depression. With legal work evaporating, it wasn’t hard to persuade those scraping by in the profession that it was time to curtail production of new competitors.By 1935, the A.B.A., with an assist from the Association of American Law Schools, had persuaded nine states to adopt rules that required a degree from an approved law school. In the next six years, 32 more states followed. Victory for the A.B.A. was complete when the G.I. Bill mandated that federal loans for returning soldiers could be used only at A.B.A.-approved law schools.In 1952, the federal government designated the A.B.A. as the official accrediting body of law schools. By then, dozens of unaccredited schools had already closed. Suffolk was nearly one of them. The school almost failed during , and in 1948 its board yielded to the inevitable and fired Gleason Archer. A decade later, Suffolk was granted A.B.A. accreditation.Mr. Archer’s vision of low-cost legal education did not vanish. It lives on in places like the Nashville School of Law, a night school that started as the Nashville Night Law School in 1911. Nashville’s graduates are not recruited by large corporate firms. Most will remain in Tennessee, because only a few states deem a diploma from a school that lacks A.B.A. accreditation as a ticket to practice.But tuition costs $21,000 — in total, for all four years it takes to complete the degree. The reasons? Nobody has tenure. There are no full-time professors. The library costs $65,000 a year.“Our mission from Day 1,” says M. Townzen, associate dean, “was to provide a quality, affordable education to those who might not otherwise be able to attend law school.”The graduates get high marks from local judges, including Lawrence H. Puckett of the 10th Judicial District of Tennessee. “Some of our more outstanding practitioners have come through the Nashville School,” he said. “Many of the teachers are judges that I know, and I’m sure they are excellent instructors. But I think it’s also the quality of students. They persevere while also holding down a job. That speaks highly of their character.”One recent Nashville graduate is Tad Wintermeyer, who was a 26-year-old pilot and airplane mechanic when he enrolled in 2005. His monthly cost for tuition “was like an expensive utility bill,” he says. In 2009, he left with a J.D. and no debt. He took judicial appointments as a public defender, which paid about $25,000 his first year of practice.“Almost all of my clients were indigent, or low income, or on some kind of government assistance,” he says. “It was incredibly rewarding work.”More recently, he started his own practice, renting a $300-a-month space at Airport. Some of his clients now pay his standard $150-an-hour fee, and he does free legal work for veterans of the and wars, whom he has met through his role as a judge advocate general in the Fourth Regiment of the Tennessee State Guard.“I would not be able to make the significant contribution of my time to pro bono legal service and as a volunteer member of the State Guard,” he wrote in an e-mail, “if I had to worry about a mountain of school debt hanging over me.”What Mr. Wintermeyer has given up in prestige, interstate mobility and income, he says, he has gained in peace of mind, not to mention the freedom to donate his time. There are, of course, thousands of graduates of A.B.A.-accredited schools who are every bit as satisfied with their degrees.But compare Mr. Wintermeyer’s circumstances with those of Keri-Ann Baker, who graduated from the Loyola University School of Law in in 2004. Tuition was about $33,000 a year, Ms. Baker says, and she left with $200,000 in loans — about half spent on tuition, the other half on books, fees and living expenses. She quickly abandoned her long-held ambition to become a prosecutor because the pay in the county where she and her husband settled was $42,000 a year. She now earns $90,000 a year at a midsize corporate firm. It is barely enough money.“Right now, loans control every aspect of my life,” she said. “Where I practice, the number of children I’ll have, where I live, the type of house I can live in. I honestly believe I’ll be a grandparent before I pay off my loans. I have yet to make even a dent in them.”THIS has been a difficult year for the A.B.A. It has been peppered with insistent letters by members of Congress — most notably Senators , Democrat of California, and , Republican of — over a number of accusations of failings. Among the contentions is that the organization has not done enough to prevent law schools from overstating the current job prospects of graduates.The A.B.A. has lobbed back lengthy and detailed letters to Capitol Hill, which appear to have done little to lower the temperature. Threats of Congressional hearings have surfaced in the news media.In this volley of correspondence, the A.B.A. has noted that it would be an antitrust violation to cap or limit the number of law schools. That is true, but it suggests that the debate about legal education is focused in the wrong place. What ails the law school market isn’t a lack of regulation, says Clifford Winston, a senior fellow at the and co-author of a book, “First Thing We Do, Let’s Deregulate All the Lawyers.” He says it’s the near-total absence of competition.“The A.B.A. is a powerful group that has a strong status-quo bias,” he says. “Getting them to turn things around is obviously quite difficult because they’re looking out for their own interests.”Still, Ms. Hadfield at U.S.C. calls herself an optimist. She thinks federal and state governments could set up other accrediting agencies and licensing bodies to oversee training and licensing of other types of legal providers. (In , eight different bodies license legal services.)Her vision isn’t a free-for-all, where anyone can hang a shingle; it is a range of options that would entail an array of educational degrees and a broad spectrum of prices and formats for legal services.“The more we talk about this,” she says, “the more we can dislodge the idea that the highest value is to provide a state bar licensed lawyer from an A.B.A.-accredited school to everyone who needs legal help.”ON Dec. 2, Mr. Beckman and six colleagues from Duncan traveled to a hotel in , P.R., where the A.B.A. held its latest council meeting. The school had 15 minutes at a hearing to offer its arguments for provisional accreditation.“This is just a pet peeve,” Mr. Beckman said last week, “but there is all this talk about the cost of legal education, and they make us fly to and meet at the Ritz-Carlton?”After his presentation, Mr. Beckman and others answered a number of questions, including a few about the job market for lawyers in east Tennessee. This bothered Mr. Beckman because, for antitrust reasons, employment prospects are not part of the A.B.A.’s standards. He pointed that out to the council.“They didn’t really respond,” he says.Nor did they hint at whether they would give Duncan a thumbs-up. In the past, law schools have learned a few days after their hearings. But since Dec. 2, there has been nothing. “The last thing we heard — and they didn’t mean this to be rude or anything — was at the end of the meeting in Puerto Rico,” Mr. Beckman says. “They said, ‘You can let yourselves out.’ “'"
"'11-12-18,'0','Recently at PowerHouse Arena in Dumbo, a loft-like store for arty bibliophiles, David Friedlander, a handsome guy whose career has a 21st-century way of resisting easy description, married Jacqueline Schmidt, an ethereal redhead — a dancer once, a graphic artist now — who seems to run on earnest optimism.It would be easy to say that the couple, in their mid-30s, abhorred the idea of a traditional wedding, but Mr. Friedlander and Ms. Schmidt are not the sort of people who are in the business of abhorring things. They did not want their wedding “to be just about us,” the groom told me, but rather, about the world of creativity and social purpose that they inhabit.During the reception, Mr. Friedlander asked his guests to please recycle their cups, “because we’re really in a serious situation with .” There was no guest list in the formal sense; the reception was open to anyone who wished to attend. Friends came, and friends of friends, whom the couple had never met. Before the ceremony in the bookstore, Ms. Schmidt walked into the at Main and Front Streets and told strangers they were welcome to drop by.The history of social life in New York includes many nights that warrant noting — the first of Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor’s balls for the city’s 400 wealthiest and most distinguished residents in 1892; any 2 a.m. at Max’s Kansas City 80 years later; ’s inaugural White Party in in 1999. All of those proceedings revealed their particular cultural moments, and the Schmidt-Friedlander wedding tells us something as well. Few events have so perfectly distilled the essence of a certain New York lifestyle as it is practiced right now, one steeped in proselytizing, bohemian entrepreneurialism.When guests arrived on Saturday night two weeks ago, they were greeted with name tags that asked them to declare a commitment. Lest they not take the request seriously, the hosts had additional cards printed that asked them to “Name something you are really committed to.” The cards contained further imperatives: “Name one action you can take in the next 24 hours that is aligned with your commitment.” Other cards prompted guests toward a treasure hunt in which they were encouraged to meet new people.Ms. Schmidt, who once served as the creative director of Moomah, the children’s cafe in Tribeca that caters to parents in denial about some of the distasteful aesthetics of child-rearing, made the cards in her favored style of heavy stock, neutral paper and quaint typefaces. Through her company, Screech Owl Design, Ms. Schmidt makes beautiful, twee paper products that would seem to demand an existence inside a Miranda July snow globe. Synergistically, Powerhouse is among the many places where Ms. Schmidt’s work is sold.'"
"'11-12-18,'0','NEW YORK is unquestionably an international capital of the arts, but it can also be a frustrating backwater when it comes to contemporary opera. Yes, in February the Metropolitan Opera mounted John Adams’s “Nixon in China”: a groundbreaking work at its premiere 24 years ago, since embraced as canon most everywhere but here. In November the Met revived a brilliant staging of Philip Glass’s “Satyagraha,” a 1979 opera that proved its worth elsewhere first.New York City Opera, meanwhile, showed real gumption in March with “Monodramas,” a boldly conceived, brilliantly executed triptych of works by Schoenberg, Morton Feldman and John Zorn. (I missed City Opera’s other contemporary offering, Steven Schwartz’s “Séance on a Wet Afternoon,” but the critical response was not encouraging.)True, small, determined companies produced a steady stream of newly composed pieces on shoestring budgets. But a current Carnegie Hall residency by the distinguished Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho reminds us that none of her widely admired operas have been produced here. Of major recent works by Harrison Birtwistle, Hans Werner Henze, Aribert Reimann and Unsuk Chin, there is no trace. “St. François d’Assise,” Messiaen’s towering expression of mysticism and faith? As if!So while the Met served up bread and circuses, and City Opera fumbled with smoke and mirrors, the year’s most important premiere was at the Juilliard School. There, in November, a student production of “Kommilitonen!” (“Young Blood!”), written by the veteran English composer Peter Maxwell Davies on a commission from Juilliard and the Royal Academy of Music in London, showed how vital and exhilarating contemporary opera could be.Mr. Davies, invigorated by writing for young performers, produced a score that was brimming with potency, its abrasive vocabulary and polystylistic clamor leavened with passages of deeply affecting lyricism. A deft libretto by David Pountney, the director, wove together three historic student protests — in Munich during World War II, in China during the Cultural Revolution and in the segregated Mississippi of 1962 — in a manner that warned and inspired, largely without hectoring.As one-note spectacles and directorial incomprehension drew critical barbs at the Met, Mr. Pountney’s economical, imaginative staging was pitch perfect. The singers and players, conducted by Anne Manson, performed at a level that would do any professional company proud.'"
"'11-12-18,'0','Five years ago no world-class choreographer was more sheerly prolific than Mr. Morris. Now Alexei Ratmansky is more so. In 2011 premieres by this Russian choreographer kept popping up all over the ballet map. So far he’s at his finest in the amalgamation of dance and characterization that ballet people call “demi-character.” His two-act Shostakovich comedy “The Bright Stream,” originally created for the Bolshoi Ballet, was a shot in the arm for American Ballet Theater, which acquired that hit this year.And when the Mariinsky Ballet — which delivers most repertory as if consigning it to the time-honored marble halls of yesteryear — brought Mr. Ratmansky’s two-act “Little Humpbacked Horse,” with a score by Rodion Shchedrin, to the Metropolitan Opera House, this St. Petersburg company was transformed. It became, as never before, bubbly, communicative, happily endearing. Vladimir Shklyarov’s performance as the irrepressible Ivan is among the year’s most enchanting memories.History of another kind occurred when David Hallberg, whom it’s fair to hail as the world’s purest academic stylist in ballet today, announced in September that he was joining the Bolshoi Ballet. Since one of his reasons for going was to develop his partnership with the Bolshoi ballerina Natalia Osipova, whom he has danced with at American Ballet Theater, it was a shock when the news broke in November that Ms. Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev were leaving the Bolshoi for the Mikhailovsky Theater of St. Petersburg. These are stories that will go on playing into 2012 and beyond.And they will play in particular at Ballet Theater, where Ms. Osipova, Mr. Hallberg, and Mr. Vasiliev are scheduled to dance in its spring season at the Metropolitan Opera House, as they did this past year. Mr. Vasiliev, in his first season with Ballet Theater, was a late arrival, replacing the injured Herman Cornejo. What’s so startling about Ms. Osipova and Mr. Vasiliev is that they’re more archetypically Bolshoi than any other stars in the last 20 years: they consume space out of all proportion to their frames, they jump a mile in the sky as if by nature, and they commit themselves to performance with life-enhancing intensity. Unlucky Moscow, lucky New York.Still, if there was a single performance I would single out from Ballet Theater’s spring season, it would be the “Giselle” Mr. Hallberg danced with another of this spring’s luminaries, Alina Cojocaru, the Romanian-born star of the Royal Ballet in London. Ms. Cojocaru, dancing three ballets with the company, proved herself a rare artist. Her combination of fragility and radiance proved invariably heart catching; her way of playing to her colleagues gave the stage world a greater reality. The amplitude with which she yearningly opened herself into the night air as Giselle was momentous. Mr. Hallberg, partnering her for the first time, was classicism aflame.In Seattle, Pacific Northwest Ballet staged a historically informed “Giselle” in June that at most points in the action drew from texts older than those we usually see and, revitalizingly, used brisker tempos than those we’ve been accustomed to hearing. On opening night the luminous Carla Körbes confirmed her place as one of the foremost ballerinas in America. The new-old steps were especially fascinating, but characterizations and dramatic connections were also transformed. Giselle herself was more outgoing, her rival Bathilde more touching, generous but guardedly correct; and Myrtha, queen of the spectral wilis (danced with exceptional skill by Carrie Imler on opening night) became a yet more complex role, as in love with dancing as Giselle herself.Between January and June, New York City Ballet made its greatest advances in 20 years with its Balanchine repertory. The spring’s Balanchine Black and White season was a particular highlight, with “Apollo” (Stravinsky, 1928) and “Episodes” (Webern, 1959) both returning to repertory after several seasons’ absence. The company has two good young interpreters of Apollo, interestingly unalike: Chase Finlay (tall, blond, pliant and alive with discovery) and Robert Fairchild (dark haired and purposeful).Better yet, City Ballet kept exhibiting its finest crop of ballerinas for many seasons: notably Sara Mearns, Tiler Peck, and Teresa Reichlen, but with Ashley Bouder, Sterling Hyltin and Janie Taylor all exceptional in certain roles as well. There’s no cause for complacency here. There are still off nights, patches of dampening repertory, and works that have been too sketchily rehearsed. The last half of the year looked less bright for the company, and all its new ballets were stale. But City Ballet’s highs this year kept bringing the world’s greatest ballet repertory back into full dimension.'"
"'11-12-18,'0','With a population of 140,000, Battambang is the country’s second-largest city, though few tourists make it here. Those who do are rewarded with one of the country’s greatest collections of historic structures, from decaying Angkorean temples surrounded by lotus ponds to modernist cinemas built during the country’s 1960s construction boom. They also gain access to one of the country’s richest artistic communities: Battambang has produced generations of artists, a legacy that residents are busy building on.“People are starting to feel proud of their city again,” said Mr. Sak.I first visited Battambang in 2006 and fell in love with its crumbling charm and lush, picturesque countryside. Its dark, potholed streets and seedy guesthouses, though, weren’t so lovable. But when I heard that a preservation movement was under way, which included new boutique hotels, art galleries and restaurants, many housed in historic buildings, I decided to go back.The floods that hit Cambodia in the early fall delayed my plans. Though Battambang was mostly spared, several streets in the city were underwater, as were sections of the 180-mile route from Phnom Penh, the capital. (Conditions have since improved.) When I finally arrived in November, I spent my first night swathed in Old World charm at La Villa, a seven-room boutique hotel in a stunning two-story home built by a wealthy local tradesman in the 1930s and restored in 2005. Antique armoires, four-poster beds, richly patterned floor tiles and vintage ceiling lamps fill the space. Each night, the hotel’s restaurant serves tender steaks and fish curries to a mature European crowd seated at candlelit tables shaded by hundred-year-old trees.The next morning I headed to the other side of the river and explored the Heritage Protection Area, a compact district defined by the municipal government in 2009. It’s populated by about 800 historical buildings, the largest collection in the country. I ducked into a squat, roughly 150-year-old Chinese temple with curved gables; the roof was partly collapsed but it was still active. Since most worshipers come in the afternoon, though, I had it to myself, snapping photos of the tattered red Chinese lanterns and colorful paintings on the walls.Nearby is Psar Nath, the city’s main market, housed in a faded yellow Art Deco edifice with a tiered roof and clock tower built in 1936. Shoppers closely inspect goods from glittering wedding apparel to recently killed chickens.Peaceful as the town might be today, Battambang’s architectural vestiges bear testament to a tumultuous past. Over the last two centuries it has been ruled by Thailand and France. It enjoyed a brief period of freedom during the heady, post-independence days of the 1950s and ’60s before the Khmer Rouge came to power in 1975. Battambang province was one of the regime’s last strongholds — peace wouldn’t arrive until 1997, when the city began to pick up the pieces.Nevertheless, Battambang has produced some of the country’s most famous artists: the 1960s chanteuse Ros Sereysothea, whose popularity persists decades after her death; the late painter Vann Nath; and Chhom Nimol, the frontwoman of the Los Angeles-based indie rock band Dengue Fever.“Even during Angkorean times, there was a strong, talented group here who wanted to create their own kingdom,” said Theanly Chov, 26, a painter who manages the nine-month-old Sammaki, one of the new galleries that exhibits young local artists. “The combination of cultures — Cambodian, Chinese, Thai, French — makes the city open-minded to art.”Last year, the local government restored a majestic mansion built for the last Thai governor in 1905. On the city’s narrow streets, private owners are sprucing up 1920s and ’30s shop houses and corner buildings and turning some of them into bars and cafes. And a few of the early 20th-century traditional wooden houses on stilts in and around the city are now open for tours.In 2001, an Australian-Khmer couple, John and Sinouin Parker, transformed one of those homes into the Riverside Balcony Bar, which features an all-wood, open-air veranda. At sunset, a symphony of crickets mesmerizes, as the fading light bathes the surrounding river and towering palm trees.Anna Milligan, originally from Washington State, runs Café Eden in a renovated riverfront shop house. A year ago, Ms. Milligan opened the boho-chic nonprofit cafe, boutique and art space.While snacking on French fries and peanut butter bars, visitors can gaze upon works by local artists, many of whom are graduates of Phare Ponleu Selpak, an arts school established in 1994 by a group of young Cambodians who met in a refugee camp during the 1980s. Tourists are welcome on the school grounds, a 10-minute tuk-tuk drive from the city center down a narrow road on the city’s outskirts, where teenagers play traditional Cambodian instruments and sinewy boys and girls practice juggling, tumbling and modern dance moves for the public performances the school hosts several nights a week.Phare has also become renowned for its fine arts program, which has trained many of the country’s rising young painters and sculptors, like Mao Soviet, who opened the Make Maek Gallery with his wife, Phin Sophorn, also an artist, in September.“Many local artists graduate from Phare and produce a lot of work, but then go to Phnom Penh or Siem Reap because there has been no space to show art,” said Mr. Soviet, a 31-year-old with disheveled hair. Make Maek is out to change that, organizing eight shows throughout the year for local and visiting international artists. The gallery has also spawned an artist-in-residency program.To raise local awareness about the arts and to lure visitors to the gallery, Make Maek holds an event called “Make Light” every Saturday night, distributing sparklers to neighborhood children and curious passers-by for a half-hour street party, raucous by sleepy Battambang standards. (The city’s street lighting still leaves much to be desired.)One of the guests at a recent “Make Light” event was Darren Swallow, a 46-year-old Welshman who has lived in Battambang since 2005. An active promoter of the local art scene and a founder of Sammaki, Mr. Swallow has organized several exhibitions of the city’s artists around Cambodia.“There’s still a ways to go here, but there’s such talent and energy,” he said. “It’s not hectic — you can really live for the moment in Battambang. And that moment stretches into a week for a lot of people.”IF YOU GOBattambang is a four- to five-hour drive from Phnom Penh by private car ($60; arrange through your hotel) or a six- to eight-hour boat ride from Siem Reap, starting at $20. (The U.S. dollar is the de facto currency in Cambodia.) The small, pedestrian- and bike-friendly town is easy to navigate. Note that local drivers generally know the name of a business, not the street address.La Villa’s spacious rooms ooze history and charm (855-53-730-151; lavilla-battambang.net) and start at $60 per night.The year-old Bambu Battambang Hotel (855-53-953-900; bambuhotel.com), a 10-minute walk from La Villa and a few minutes’ drive from the town center, has a resortlike feel. The 16 rooms, from $80 a night, are spread across four raised wooden houses.At the eco-friendly Sanctuary Villa (Chrey Kong Village; 855-972-167-168; sanctuaryvilla.derlengtours.com), just outside of town, the seven silk-accented bungalows surround a saltwater pool; rates from $86 per night.A mile from the town center, the eco-hotel Au Cabaret Vert (855-53-656-2000; aucabaretvert.fr), opened a year ago, has a restaurant that serves French fare. Doubles, $66.Khmer Delight (one block south of Psar Nath; 855-12-671-911; entrees from $3) is a reliable spot for cheap, well-made local food, while Pomme d’Amour (63 Street 2.5; 855-12-415-513; apple-of-love.com; entrees from $5) offers creative French-Khmer fusion cuisine. Café Eden (85 Street 1; 855-53-73-1525; cafeedencambodia.com; entrees from $2.50) serves some of the best comfort food you’ll find in Cambodia. The Riverside Balcony Bar (about a mile south of the town center along the west bank of the Sangker River; 855-53-730-313) is easily Battambang’s most atmospheric spot for dollar drafts.WHAT TO SEE AND DOFor a self-guided walking door of Battambang’s buildings, download the two free maps released last year by the nonprofit organization Khmer Architecture Tours (ka-tours.org). Som Sangva Sak (855-12-599-890) conducts private architectural city tours and trips to outlying temples in the countryside starting at $20 for a half day.The old wooden houses of Wat Kor are three miles outside of town; visitors can tour two homes with the French-speaking owners. English speakers should bring a guide.In January, the village’s first boutique hotel opens, Maisons Wat Kor (855-98-555-377; maisonswatkor.com; doubles from $70). Its eight rooms are in three buildings modeled on their historic neighbors.Check out works by local artists at Sammaki Gallery (87 Street 2.5; 855-17-968-050; sammaki.kinyei.org) and Make Maek Gallery (66 Street 2.5; 855-17-946-108; makemaek.org).Visitors are welcome at Phare Ponleu Selpak (Anch Anh Village; 855-53-952-424); hourlong circus performances take place five times a week, starting at 7 p.m.; tickets are $8.'"

"'11-12-18,'0','But there is still a nagging sense that movies — and the public discussion of movies — are not what they used to be. That kind of nostalgia informed a lot of the recent writing about Pauline Kael on the 10th anniversary of her death this year, and it also shows up in a lot of movies. Cultural nostalgia in general was the subject of Woody Allen’s “Midnight in Paris,” which just missed my Top 20, but backward-looking movie love informed some of the most interesting releases of the year: Michel Hazanavicius’s “Artist” and Martin Scorsese’s “Hugo,” which both evoked the glories of the silent era; Steven Spielberg’s “War Horse,” which evoked the glories of old-fashioned, wide-screen epic filmmaking; and “Super 8,” which evoked the glories of Steven Spielberg. I’m ordinarily suspicious of antiquarianism, but I have to say that in most of these cases I found the impulse to explore the cinematic past refreshing, as much about recovering the idea of the new as about worshiping the old.DARGIS The movies are not what they used to be and haven’t been since people started watching them on television in the 1950s, a process that made the sacred cinema object more profane. The de-sacralization continues and now seems nearly complete, which is why I cherish the ecclesiastical rituals of moviegoing even more. I like the convenience of streaming movies, but it’s transporting to sit in the dark, alone and with other people, watching bigger-than-life images. It can be especially affecting when the audience is with a movie, as they were when I caught “Warrior” a few months after it opened, and everyone burst into sustained applause at the end.I can’t imagine, for instance, watching “War Horse” on a television, much less an iPhone: this is a self-consciously old-fashioned movie, shot in gorgeous film, which deserves to be seen projected on a big, bright screen and not via a thinner-looking “digital cinema package.” (This is the studios’ term for the compressed and encrypted digital files they use to store and distribute content, i.e., movies.) The use of the past in, say, “The Artist,” a cute gimmick stretched to feature length, is very different from how Mr. Spielberg (in “Tintin” and “War Horse”) and Mr. Scorsese (in “Hugo” and last year’s “Shutter Island”) self-consciously invoke and engage the cinema of earlier eras.Both these filmmakers, two of the greatest of the movie-brat generation, are preoccupied, in their respective ways, sometimes nostalgically, with older movies, both European and Hollywood. (The movie brats are New Hollywood directors schooled in cinema who emerged in the 1970s; the other great being Francis Ford Coppola.) That nostalgia is sometimes inscribed both in the filmmaking and in the story, as with “Raging Bull,” a (largely) period piece shot primarily in black and white and very much a film about Mr. Scorsese’s own love of movies, with one of his touchstones, for instance, the black-and-white cinematography of “Sweet Smell of Success” (1957). With “Raging Bull” Mr. Scorsese even started a campaign to raise awareness about the fragility of color film.The heart of “Hugo” is Mr. Scorsese’s ode to the early filmmaker Georges Méliès, a homage that’s also a tribute to cinema, which gives the movie a sense of urgency, particularly because what cinema was, for much of its history, has been eclipsed by the convenience of televised and now streaming images. Film history also matters in “War Horse,” and that’s partly why it’s so involving. It isn’t just about war and loss, which makes tears flow; it’s also about movies as they once were (and can be, as this film proves). When Mr. Scorsese was asked about the influence of Samuel Fuller’s “Shock Corridor” (1963) on “Shutter Island,” he said of the earlier film, “It’s in me.” Looking at “War Horse” you can see how John Ford’s “How Green Was My Valley,” among many other films, is in Mr. Spielberg.SCOTT Although I admired the visual bravura of “Hugo” and was touched by its sincere affection for Méliès and his work (the gorgeous restoration of his masterpiece “A Trip to the Moon” that was shown at the Cannes and Telluride film festivals was surely a cinematic highlight of the year, maybe the century), I was not as enthralled as perhaps I should have been. Or as enraptured as Mr. Scorsese clearly wanted me to be. The many breathless invocations of “the magic of cinema” lessen the magic, and the busy, showoffy historicist aesthetic prevents a deep and powerful register of feeling from developing (except in Ben Kingsley’s marvelously melancholy face).“War Horse,” in contrast, uses its saturation in older styles of moviemaking to stir up the sort of simple and emphatic emotions that have always been central to the collective moviegoing experience. Mr. Spielberg’s formidable technical command is very much in evidence, but it is placed in the service (as it was in “E.T.”) of forceful and almost naïve sentiment. In other words, the movie does not seem to be, as “Hugo” is, primarily about its director’s bottomless love of movies.Still, I am happy to have seen so many senior auteurs pushing themselves in ambitious and surprising new directions. A year with noteworthy new work from Mr. Spielberg, Mr. Scorsese, Mr. Allen and Clint Eastwood — as well as Jean-Luc Godard (“Film Socialisme”), Pedro Almodóvar and Raúl Ruiz, who made more than 100 films in his life and saved one of his very best, “Mysteries of Lisbon,” for last — cannot be a bad year. And there was also a lot of ferment on the younger end of the generational spectrum, and quite a few exciting movies that were no less ambitious for being modestly scaled, intimately focused and absorbed in the present.Steve McQueen’s “Shame,” with the ubiquitous Michael Fassbender as a sex-addicted yuppie (is that still what they’re called?), has received a lot of attention for its frankness, but I think it and its admirers confuse moralistic misery with honesty. I found more of that — more real tenderness, anguish, longing and humor — in Dee Rees’s “Pariah,” about a Brooklyn teenager coming out; in Andrew Haigh’s “Weekend,” about a one-night stand that turns into something more; and in Radu Muntean’s “Tuesday, After Christmas,” about the catastrophic impact of adultery on a marriage. I like to be deceived by movies, to be beguiled by fantasies and seduced by magical thinking, but I also like movies that feel like they’re telling the truth.DARGIS There’s more to “Hugo” than Mr. Scorsese’s passion for movies, though there’s nothing wrong with that. It is also an argument for cinema, for cinema as a constituent part of modern life, which means it’s also a way of telling the truth. “Hugo” largely concerns its title character, who’s at once a watcher (like the viewer) and something of a director in the sense that his observations of the habitués in the train station where he lives resemble little movies. (I think he’s a proxy for the young Mr. Scorsese.) These vignettes or cine-fragments show us how Hugo views the world, how he makes sense of it and, importantly, they also show him the way to finding his place in it. As that great philosopher of film, Stanley Cavell, has written, “It is through fantasy that our conviction of the worth of reality is established; to forgo our fantasies would be to forgo our touch with the world.”I like Mr. Fassbender, though I don’t at all like “Shame,” which is British film miserabilism at its most miserable. The obviousness of that movie contrasts vividly with another much-talked-about if little-seen American movie from this year, “Margaret,” from Kenneth Lonergan. To recap briefly, Mr. Lonergan had a difficult time finishing the movie; received editing help from Mr. Scorsese; entered into legal wrangling; and a 2 hour 29 minute cut — not Mr. Lonergan’s longer preferred cut — received a cursory, perhaps contractually obligated theatrical release by Fox Searchlight. It was reviewed, somewhat favorably, if often with hesitations and qualifications, and then disappeared after four weeks only to become the subject of a passionate campaign to have it reshown to critics for awards voting.I saw the movie finally a few weeks ago and was surprised by how much I liked it, despite its unevenness. I really admire its ambition. It makes such a stark contrast to so much American independent cinema, less in terms of budget and production scale than in its towering ambition toward that most fascinating subject: another human being. Part of what Mr. Lonergan has in mind is nothing less than the inner life of a teenager, Lisa (Anna Paquin): not just her boy problems and mother troubles but the entirety of her being at a certain moment in post-Sept. 11 time on the Upper West Side, New York, the United States, the World, the Universe.SCOTT Yes, cinema is an integral part of modern life, but that does not mean that modern life is all cinema, which is part of the structuring fantasy of “Hugo.” And movies that construct dreams primarily out of other movies — “Hugo” and “Inception,” but also “Captain America” and “Sucker Punch” — often close off other avenues of imagination and leave vast realms of the modern unconscious unexplored, or even obstructed. Mr. Scorsese, following Brian Selznick’s wide-eyed and meticulous picture book, makes a strong case for Méliès’s visionary originality. But (since we’re quoting philosophers) why shouldn’t Mr. Scorsese, like his predecessors, enjoy an original relationship to the universe? Why should we, because we happened to arrive late in the short history of cinema so far, settle for secondhand, recycled dreams?“Margaret” is most certainly a movie that fights, like its young heroine, to free itself from received wisdom and genre conventions. I’m afraid it scores, at best, a Pyrrhic victory. There are scenes as wild and insightful as anything on screen this year: the fatal bus accident that sets the story in motion; the awkward, funny, ruthlessly serious sex scene involving Ms. Paquin and Kieran Culkin; the angry, precocious classroom political debates. But then, after about 90 amazing minutes, it all falls apart. The writing becomes more shrill, the scenes choppier, the themes at once hectically muddy and overemphatic. And a story that seemed so wonderfully expansive dwindles back into anecdote.“Margaret” was not the only movie that tried to take account of that feeling of bigness, of mystery, that lurks within ordinary experience. “The Tree of Life” went the furthest in connecting the individual soul with its cosmic correlatives, and even though I’m skeptical of Terrence Malick’s cosmology, I believe in his movie completely. And I have faith in “The Future” as well, a mopey hipster breakup movie bent by Miranda July’s deadpan rigor into a DIY sci-fi epic, a surreal foray into the inner lives of its passive, wounded characters, including the cat who serves as its conscience and narrator.Speaking of which: What a year for animals! Uggie, the dog from “The Artist,” may have the Oscar buzz at the moment, but we should not forget the goat in “Le Quattro Volte,” the ape men and the amorous catfish in “Uncle Boonmee” and Caesar, the noblest ape on the planet.DARGIS Oh, and let’s not forget the magnificent horses in “War Horse,” though I wish I could forget the poor cat Ms. July’s character lets die as she tries to find the meaning of life while examining her navel lint. It’s funny that Ms. July’s husband, the director Mike Mills, has such a memorable dog in his movie “Beginners,” a Jack Russell terrier named Arthur who talks, via subtitles, to his human, Oliver (Ewan McGregor). “Beginners” didn’t fully work, but the scenes between Oliver and Arthur were true and soulful, and it’s lovely that Cosmo, the dog who played Arthur, was a rescue. Thank goodness he didn’t star in Ms. July’s movie or he would have never made it out alive.SCOTT In the end, though, no one, human or beast, gets out alive, except perhaps in “The Tree of Life,” which leaps on the wings of celestial music from Waco, Tex., into eternity. It is surely a sign of these anxious times that, while some filmmakers looked back in fondness at the picturesque past, others squinted into the future and saw the end of everything. Apocalypse now, indeed, starring Kirsten Dunst (“Melancholia”), Michael Shannon (“Take Shelter”), Matt Damon (“Contagion”) and James Franco (“Rise of the Planet of the Apes”). A year from now, if we’re still around, we can talk about what it all means.“Bridesmaids” (Paul Feig); “A Brighter Summer Day” (Edward Yang); “Cedar Rapids” (Miguel Arteta); “A Dangerous Method” (David Cronenberg); “The Descendants” (Alexander Payne); “The Future” (Miranda July); “The Help” (Tate Taylor); “Incendies” (Denis Villeneuve); “Into the Abyss” (Werner Herzog); “Margin Call” (J.

"'11-12-19,'0','In a blog post, Mr. Tripathi describes the days after the theft as a “vortex.” Fresh in his mind was a similar, albeit smaller, breach at Massachusetts General Hospital just months earlier in which a hospital employee left detailed clinical records for 192 patients on a subway. The breach had cost the hospital $1 million in settlement fees.“We’re a nonprofit with 35 people on staff,” says Mr. Tripathi. “A million-dollar fine would have decimated us.”Mr. Tripathi says his nonprofit had just enacted a policy requiring that all patient files be encrypted, but had yet to decide on an encryption provider. All that stood between a determined computer thief and his patient data was a few passwords.Mr. Tripathi went to work assembling a crisis team of lawyers and customers and a chief security officer. They hired a private investigator to scour local pawnshops and Craigslist for the stolen laptop. The biggest headache, he says, was deciphering how much about the breach his nonprofit needed to disclose.Health organizations are required by federal law to report data breaches that affect more than 500 people to the Department of Health and Human Services. The department’s Office of Civil Rights publishes the equivalent of a data breach “Wall of Shame” on its Web site — which today includes 380 breaches affecting more than 18 million people.Mr. Tripathi said he quickly discovered just how many ways there were to count to 500. The law requires disclosure only in cases that “pose a significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to the individual affected.” His team spent hours poring over a backup of the stolen laptop files. Of the nearly 14,000 patient records on the stolen laptop, most records did not warrant disclosure. In 2,777 cases, for instance, a record listed only a patient’s name.Complicating matters were liability rules. In the eyes of the law, Mr. Tripathi’s nonprofit is a contractor that acts on behalf of health providers. The legal burden of protecting patient data actually falls on his clients: the physicians and hospitals who entrusted his nonprofit with their files.“The laws create a perverse outcome,” he says. “It was our fault, but from a federal perspective, it wasn’t our breach.”Mr. Tripathi narrowed down the group of patients whose data put them at serious risk for identity theft to 998 people across seven physician practices. Only one practice broke the 500-patient threshold requiring disclosure on the Department of Health and Human Services Web site.His office got to work notifying the affected patients of the data breach. They offered free credit monitoring — though less than 10 percent took them up on the option — spending a total of $6,000.In the aftermath, Mr. Tripathi says his company destroyed all patient data on mobile devices and temporarily prohibited employees from removing patient data from clients’ offices. The company now mandates that all data be encrypted, and employees are required to tell health providers what data they will need to access and how they plan to use it.He never found the stolen laptop, and the incident, all told, cost his nonprofit $288,000.In many ways, Massachusetts eHealth Collaborative got off easy. In October, a desktop computer containing unencrypted records on more than four million patients was stolen from Sutter Health, a nonprofit health system based in Sacramento. A rock was thrown through a window to gain access to the computer. The theft is now the subject of two class-action suits, each of which seeks $1,000 for each patient record breached.“Breaches are going to be one of the big challenges as more physicians and hospitals adopt electronic health records,” Mr. Tripathi says. “We’re entering a brave new world.”'"
"'11-12-19,'0','It is hard to begrudge Apple for wanting to give its employees a break. But the App Store freeze at Christmas, and the crunch time leading up to it, underscore Apple’s power in the world of mobile apps and the lengths developers are willing to go to meet its demands.In short, Apple is a powerful gatekeeper, and for more than a week it is keeping the gate closed.“If you are a developer and want to sell an app for the iPhone, you have to go through Apple,” said Charles S. Golvin, an analyst at Forrester Research who tracks the wireless industry.“That’s not true of Android or most other outlets,” he added. “I can’t think of another company that has such a dominant lock on the channel to sell to an audience.”Android, the smartphone software made by Google, has the second-biggest app economy after Apple. And it does not have Apple’s stringent and sometimes inscrutable board of testers and reviewers, who can reject any app that, in their judgment, does not meet the company’s technical or content standards.Android developers can sell their apps through a variety of third-party outlets like Amazon.com and GetJar, as well as the Google-run Android Marketplace, which is happy to accept new apps any day of the year.But developers say that although Android phones are now bigger sellers than iPhones, it is still more lucrative to build apps for Apple products.The stakes are higher than ever this year because AT&T is no longer the only carrier in the United States selling the iPhone, so there are more potential customers. Apple declined to comment on the App Store freeze.Bryan Duke, a part-time app developer in Las Vegas, has seen firsthand how much of a difference one day can make.One of his apps is an air hockey game that costs 99 cents and usually averages about 300 downloads a day. But on Christmas Day last year there were 1,834. Apple keeps 30 percent of the revenue.“It’s typical to see a jump on any major holiday, but Christmas is the biggest one,” Mr. Duke said. “I’m certainly hoping for a nice big Christmas bump this year.”Flurry, a mobile analytics firm, estimated that in the period from Dec. 23 to Dec. 26 last year, 240 million applications were downloaded to Apple mobile devices, or about 20 percent of the total downloads for the month.The promise of a Christmas bonanza was enough to motivate David Barnard, the founder of App Cubby, a developer in Austin, Tex., to jump into creating a notifications app, just days before the deadline.Mr. Barnard and his small team have built apps like Tweet Speaker, which reads Twitter messages aloud, and Mirror, which turns the iPhone screen into a mirror with the help of the front-facing camera.“If we can get that snowball rolling and get it right, we can ride the momentum,” he said. “We’re going to give it a shot.”John Shahidi, chief executive of RockLive, a mobile application developer in Los Angeles, said his company started working on a soccer game in August, with an eye toward Christmas.“We needed the extra time as insurance to make sure that we are visible in the App Store and have time for any updates,” he said. Inevitably, though, there was a rush at the end. “I can’t tell you the last time I’ve slept eight hours,” he said.Although RockLive’s app, called Heads Up, sailed through Apple’s review process and went on sale this month, Mr. Shahidi said he was keeping an eye out for any bugs or problems that might require a software update. Fixes also need to be submitted before Thursday to have a chance of clearing Apple’s hurdles in time.Otherwise, a flawed application could lead to bad user reviews in the App Store, causing sales to suffer.It is not just the smaller developers that are hoping to profit from the Christmas rush. Big software makers, which have more flexibility in pricing, develop strategies like putting some applications on sale and pushing out fancy new ones to attract downloads.Electronics Arts, the giant game company that sells titles like Tetris and The Sims for Apple devices, said it was offering 36 new games and updates for the holidays, including The Sims FreePlay.Steven Stamstad, vice president for global marketing at the company, said it started planning 18 to 24 months in advance to make sure it capitalized on the season.Mr. Stamstad compared the company’s preparations to the way the movie studios planned for summer blockbusters. “We do a considerable amount of planning in terms of development, launches and putting items on sale,” he said.Some developers simply prefer to avoid the nail-biting stress of trying to get into the store before the shutdown, then hoping nothing goes wrong and that their app gets noticed amid the hundreds of other new ones flooding the market.“In my experience it’s a good thing to avoid launching at Christmas, because a lot of the big companies are launching games,” said Oliver Cameron, who is working on an address book application called Everyme. “It’s easy to get drowned out in the store.”Instead, Mr. Cameron said he planned to wait until the relative quiet of early January.'"
"'11-12-19,'0','A wise man — me, in fact — said back in September, after Ms. Amaro first appeared, that Mr. Cowell would be performing a public service if he ended the show on the spot and gave her the prize. Everyone else who heard her various performances also felt she would most likely end up in the finals. Yet Mr. Cowell chose to cut her back in mid-October, only to chase her down at her home and invite her back into the contest. Anyone who bought this bit of theatrics — well, those with a bridge to sell, take note.This utter lack of subtlety also has been evident in the show’s performances, many of which were tricked out with so many dancers, backup singers and lighting effects that the actual competitor was sometimes hard to find, or hear. There’s a reason the best Broadway musicals have only a few big production numbers; two hours’ worth of them would drain the magic out of the form.It often seemed as if the overblown musical numbers were an attempt to mask the lack of chemistry or fireworks among the four “X Factor” judges: Mr. Cowell, Paula Abdul, Nicole Scherzinger and L. A. Reid. Mr. Cowell chose a format in which each judge “mentored” a group of singers (though we never really got to see any of that mentoring) and was in a sense competing against the other three. But these four judges are not witty or well spoken enough to create the kind of sparring that is a pleasure to watch. By season’s end all of them, Mr. Cowell included, looked as if they would rather be somewhere else.That vibe apparently transmitted to many potential viewers. Before the premiere Mr. Cowell had said an audience smaller than 20 million would be a disappointment, but the show never came close to that, with 11 million or so viewers becoming the norm after the initial curiosity wore off. Those numbers, though, were good enough to secure it a second season. And its reputation may benefit from the success of the eventual winner. Any of the three finalists could become a Carrie Underwood story, Ms. Underwood, of course, having been discovered by “American Idol.”How could such a poorly executed show produce these stellar finalists? America’s star-making machinery, so dependent on connections and back-stabbing skill, has never been very good at finding and promoting every deserving artist. Some of our finest stage actors never make it out of the black boxes of Off Off Broadway. Great writers never do get anyone to publish their works.So even a clumsy effort like “The X Factor” can find a few gems with relative ease. As for which of these three will come away with the top prize, in a sense it hardly matters; they are all on the map now, as are the other performers who almost made the finals. But if you want to know who will win — spoiler alert — I’ll tell you:WHY MELANIE AMARO WILL DEFINITELY WIN ‘THE X FACTOR’ Because she’ll sell the most records. Ms. Amaro, a 19-year-old from Florida, has the kind of pure, powerful voice that not only is made for this type of competition but also could translate into a genre-crossing recording career. She has the makings of a pop diva, a country belter in the Martina McBride mold and probably a few others. With smart handlers she could put out the kinds of records that sell in multiple demographics.WHY JOSH KRAJCIK WILL DEFINITELY WIN ‘THE X FACTOR’ Because he’ll sell the most concert tickets. Mr. Krajcik, 30, is from Ohio, home of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and he looks and sounds like a rocker: shaggy and compelling, both in appearance and in voice. He is reminiscent of Joe Cocker and has the same ability to rock out on one number and switch to scratchy balladry on the next. That’s the kind of versatility you need to sustain a two-hour stage show.WHY CHRIS RENE WILL DEFINITELY WIN ‘THE X FACTOR’ Because he’ll sell the most Pepsi. Throughout the show Pepsi has never let more than a few minutes pass before reminding viewers that it is the series’s main sponsor. Pepsi cans have adorned the judges’ table. A gimmick in which viewers chose the songs contestants would sing was called the Pepsi Challenge. And, most glaringly, we have been reminded repeatedly that the winner will have the supreme honor of recording a Pepsi commercial. Mr. Rene, 28, who is from California, isn’t a great singer, but he comes across as a likable guy — the kind of guy who, if he said, “Hey, wanna buy a Pepsi?” would cause you to pull out your wallet.'"
"'11-12-19,'0','“He was just a schoolkid when he was arrested,” she said as she waited for him outside the tomb of Yasir Arafat. “We want him to go back to school. Only education is the way forward.”After the buses arrived, escorted by Red Cross jeeps, the freed prisoners went first to Mr. Arafat’s tomb and then to the celebration awaiting them next door. President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority left Sunday for a visit to Turkey, so the reception at the presidential compound was to be brief.The first phase of the exchange, which took place in October, involved hundreds of Palestinians serving life sentences, many of them Hamas members convicted of killing Israelis. Israel released a total of 1,027 prisoners.This second phase involved what the Israelis call light security prisoners. None had been convicted of killing or wounding anyone, and none were members of Hamas or Islamic Jihad.About half of the prisoners were serving four years or less, and a third of them two years or less, often for offenses like throwing stones or incendiary bombs or possessing weapons. About 10 percent had sentences of 10 years or more, mostly for throwing or planting bombs or attempted murder. Ten percent are younger than 18; three of the prisoners are 14 years old.Some Palestinians expressed anger that the release took place at night, making it hard to celebrate, and said that those being freed were not the ones they would have chosen.“This is not a serious part of the exchange,” Issa Qaraqe, the Palestinian minister of detainees for the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, said in a telephone interview. “Many of those being released were due to get out within months anyway, and there are women left behind and prisoners who have been there a long time. If Israel had wanted to make a real good-will gesture, the list would have been totally different.”Under the deal, Israel picked the prisoners released in the second group, with the only condition being that they be security prisoners and not those convicted of common crimes.In Gaza, a spokesman for Hamas, Salah al-Baradweel, said Israel seemed to be punishing Gaza by freeing so few prisoners from there:  41 of the 550. Mid-level Hamas officials were slated to receive the freed detainees. Ihabal Ghussein, spokesman for the Hamas Interior Ministry, said a larger celebration would come later.Mr. Shalit, who was 19 when he was abducted while on active duty near the Gaza border in 2006, emerged thin and pale when the first phase of the exchange took place. He is now home with his family in northern Israel and undergoing occupational therapy and debriefing by the military, according to Israeli news media reports.He has not yet spoken publicly of his years held in Gaza.He became a focus of intense popular attention in Israel, where tens of thousands of citizens pressured the government to make the deal it ultimately did. In a recent video appearance made for a celebration by the organizers of the campaign to free him, Mr. Shalit still appeared to be quite thin. He spoke shyly and breathed heavily as he expressed his gratitude to those who worked to free him.Mr. Shalit decided not to make a personal appearance at the event, apparently because handling crowds after five years in a small, closed space remained difficult for him.A magazine article a week ago in the mass-selling newspaper Yediot Aharonot, based on interviews with his friends, said Mr. Shalit had been riding his bicycle, playing table tennis in his backyard and displaying a healthy appetite for his mother’s cooking.Mr. Shalit has had corrective surgery on his hand and elbow, where seven pieces of shrapnel had been lodged since his abduction.'"
"'11-12-19,'0','MOSCOW — An oil drilling rig that was being towed in a storm sank Sunday off the coast of Sakhalin Island, Russia, with 67 people on board, most of whom are still missing.Rescuers found 14 survivors, 4 bodies and two life rafts floating empty in the frigid Pacific Ocean, off Russia’s east coast just north of Japan. The rig was not operating when it listed in high waves and sank.The two ships that had been towing the rig, an icebreaker and a tugboat, found the 14 survivors, according to a statement from the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations.Later, reports by the Interfax news agency said rescuers pulled four bodies from the sea, and found the two empty life rafts, leaving 49 people unaccounted for by early Sunday evening.Officials said search teams would work into the night, despite high seas, and that the crew had access to survival equipment, including life vests. The ministry of transport said the rig sank quickly, within about 20 minutes, at about 2 a.m.'"

"'11-12-20,'1','Dan Frazer, a character actor whose Hell’s Kitchen upbringing prepared him for a long run of roles as a blue-collar type or a cop, most notably as the beleaguered supervising officer Capt. Frank McNeil on “Kojak,” died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 90.His death was confirmed by his daughter, Susanna Frazer.Mr. Frazer was steadily employed on television from the 1950s into the ’90s, in both dramas and sitcoms, including “The Phil Silvers Show,” “Car 54, Where Are You?,” “Route 66,” “The Untouchables,” “The F.B.I.,” “Barney Miller” and “Law & Order.”He had roles in a half-dozen films, including “Lilies of the Field,” the 1963 drama for which Sidney Poitier won an Academy Award. Mr. Frazer played an itinerant priest alongside Mr. Poitier’s construction worker, who happens upon a farm run by nuns.Mr. Frazer was also in two of Woody Allen’s early comedies. In “Take the Money and Run” (1969), he played Mr. Allen’s thieving character’s psychiatrist. In “Bananas” (1971), he was a priest again, peddling New Testament cigarettes in a send-up of a TV commercial. “New Testament cigarettes — I smoke ’em,” Mr. Frazer’s priest says, exhaling smoke and sticking a thumb skyward. “He smokes ’em.”“Kojak,” starring Telly Savalas in the title role as Lt. Theo Kojak and broadcast from 1973 to 1978, gave Mr. Frazer his most enduring role. Mr. Frazer’s Capt. Frank McNeil often wore the fretful look of a strait-laced boss who may not always know what the unorthodox Kojak is up to but who gives him his head, knowing that Kojak, like him, is an honest cop.Daniel Thomas Frazer was born in the West Side neighborhood in Manhattan that used to be called Hell’s Kitchen on Nov. 20, 1921, the youngest of 10 children of Daniel and Catherine Frazer. His father was a bricklayer and ironworker who helped build the Empire State Building.'"
"'11-12-20,'1','The decision could potentially affect far more phones than those made by HTC because the underlying target of the suit is Google, creator of the Android system that now powers more than half of all smartphones sold worldwide. Apple is suing several other makers of Android devices, as is Microsoft, and companies that make Android products are returning the favor in most instances through countersuits.“It’s an important victory for Apple, but it’s just one of many battles,” said Alexander Poltorak, chief executive of the General Patent Corporation, an intellectual property strategy firm, adding that the ruling will pressure other Android phone makers to license the technology from Apple or make changes to avoid patent infringement issues.The ruling by the six-member commission, which can take action against unfair trade practices by companies whose products are imported into the United States, will prevent HTC from selling phones in the United States that infringe the patent starting April 19.To take effect, President Obama’s trade representative must sign the order. He could decide to overrule the commission’s finding, though such actions are rare. It also can be appealed.Apple has also sued HTC in federal court accusing it of patent infringement, while HTC has filed suits of its own against Apple with the trade commission and in federal court.The patent battles reflect the intense competition in the smartphone market. In the third quarter of 2011, phones running the Android system accounted for 52.5 percent of devices sold worldwide, up from 25.3 percent in the period of 2010. Apple’s share of this market fell to 15 percent, from 16.6 percent, in the same period.Apple’s late chief executive, Steven P. Jobs, was outspoken in saying that Google had improperly copied many of the iPhone’s innovations, telling his biographer that he was going to “destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product.”After the ruling on Monday, Kristin Huguet, an Apple spokeswoman, said, “We think competition is healthy, but competitors should create their own original technology, not steal ours.”Grace Lei, HTC’s general counsel, said in a statement that the company was happy the commission ruled against Apple on other patents involved in the case. “We are very pleased with the determination and we respect it,” Ms. Lei said.A Google spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.The growing complexity of mobile devices has greatly expanded the range of patents that can be used as weapons in the business, and their robust sales have made them a lucrative target.Florian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst in Germany and author of a popular blog on patents estimates that the number of patent lawsuits related to the mobile business worldwide is approaching 100.In addition to antenna designs and other traditional patents that are held by cellular companies, relative newcomers to the business, like Apple and Microsoft, are using patents that originated from computer products. Apple applied for one of the patents at issue in the HTC case — for detecting phone numbers and other forms of data — in 1996, 11 years before the iPhone was released.“Convergence threw them all together and opened up new product opportunities,” said James E. Bessen, an economist and lecturer at the Boston University School of Law.The HTC Corporation sold more than 12 million cellphones in the third quarter, according to Gartner. That made the company the world’s seventh-largest seller of cellphones, ahead of Motorola and just behind Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry. Its  phones include the Droid Incredible, an Android phone sold by Verizon Wireless and the HTC Titan, which has the Windows Phone operating system and is sold by AT&T.HTC said it would comply with the commission’s ruling by removing a feature that currently gives users a list of options whenever they receive, say, a phone number in a message on their smartphones. The users will no longer get a menu giving them the choice to save the phone number in their contact lists, dial the number or send a text message to it. Instead, HTC said it would give them only the option of dialing the number.United States Customs and Border Protection will determine whether HTC’s changes are sufficient to comply with the ruling.Apple is thought to have sued HTC, along with Samsung, another maker of Android phones and tablets, rather than Google itself because those companies profit directly from the sale of Android products. Patent lawyers say a frontal assault on Google would be a tougher legal challenge because the company gives away its Android operating system to hardware makers, making money instead through advertising from Internet services on Android phones.Oracle has sued Google directly, accusing it of patent infringement through Android. The British telecom provider BT on Monday said it also sued Google, in part over alleged patent infringements in Android.Patent lawsuits among technology companies typically end up being settled or avoided entirely through cross-licensing deals, with the weaker party often agreeing to pay a licensing royalty on every product sold containing the technology in question. Microsoft, for example, signed licensing agreements with HTC, Samsung and other companies in which Microsoft receives an undisclosed royalty from the sale of their Android devices.Apple appears less motivated by getting royalties from the companies it is suing, though some patent experts believe that could be posturing on its part. Mr. Jobs’s criticisms took on more urgency as Android began to gain a bigger share of the smartphone market during the last two years.But when he expressed those criticisms to his biographer, Walter Isaacson, he said he told Eric E. Schmidt, now the executive chairman of Google and a former Apple board member, that he didn’t want money from Google.“If you offer me $5 billion, I won’t want it,” Mr. Jobs told Mr. Schmidt, according to the book, “Steve Jobs.” “I’ve got plenty of money. I want you to stop using our ideas in Android, that’s all.”Mr. Mueller, the patent analyst, says he believes Apple is unlikely to settle with its Android rivals because it has the most of any company to lose from the rise of Android. “The Apple rhetoric from the beginning was about theft of intellectual property,” said Mr. Mueller, who has done research work for Microsoft, a Google competitor. “That’s a lot more combative.”Google has amped up its own rhetoric as well. In early August, David Drummond, the company’s senior vice president and chief legal officer, decried “a hostile, organized campaign against Android by Microsoft, Oracle, Apple and other companies, waged through bogus patents.”Less than two weeks later, though, Google announced a plan to acquire the cellphone maker Motorola Mobility Holdings for $12.5 billion, a move that was viewed partly as an effort to bolster Google’s weak patent portfolio in the mobile business. That deal is still pending.While the subject of Android was clearly an emotional issue for Mr. Jobs, there’s no evidence yet that his death in October has altered Apple’s willingness to reach a compromise with makers of Android products.'"
"'11-12-20,'1','Statins, among the most commonly prescribed drugs for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, also appear to reduce the risk for death in patients hospitalized with the flu.A study published last week in The Journal of Infectious Diseases analyzed data on 3,043 men and women who were hospitalized with influenza in 10 states; their average age was 70. About a third of them were taking statins, and more than half had been vaccinated against the flu.Among those hospitalized, 151 died within 30 days of the test that confirmed they had the flu. After controlling for race, sex, underlying disease, flu vaccination status and other factors, the researchers found that those on statins had a 41 percent reduced risk of death compared with those who were not taking the medicine.How a statin might protect against flu is still unclear. “The basic mechanism is that it is down-regulating the body’s overactive immune response to flu,” said Dr. Ann R. Thomas, an author of the study and a physician with the Oregon Public Health Division.Dr. Thomas added that this observational study is not the last word. “It may be that people on statins are healthier at the outset,” she said. “The next step is to do a randomized clinical trial.”'"
"'11-12-20,'1','Babies born only three weeks prematurely face an increased risk of behavioral and emotional problems as preschoolers, a new analysis has found.The study, published online last week in The Archives of Disease in Childhood, compared 916 babies born at 32 to 35 weeks of gestation with 543 born at term, 38 to 41 weeks. When the children were 4 years old, parents completed a questionnaire including 99 items about behavior and emotional problems and one open-ended item for recording problems not mentioned on the form.Preterm boys suffered more sleep and attention troubles than their full-term peers, but the effect in girls was more dramatic. Preterm girls were significantly more emotionally reactive, depressed and withdrawn than full-term girls, and over all they had about 20 percent more sleep problems, attention problems and aggressive behaviors.“We used to think that a few weeks of prematurity wouldn’t matter,” said the senior author, Dr. Sijmen A. Reijneveld, an epidemiologist at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. “But these data show that a child born slightly prematurely is likely to have more problems.” In some circumstances, he added, it might be medically necessary to induce a slightly preterm birth, “but there are additional risks.”According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 12 percent of babies in the United States are born before 37 weeks of gestation.'"
"'11-12-20,'1','The breakdown in relations between Prime Minister and Mr. Hashimi and his Iraqiya Party arrived at an inopportune moment for the administration, coming so close to the troop withdrawal. American officials have spent years trying to urge Iraq’s Shiite-dominated government to work with the country’s Sunni minority, and are wary of having things fall apart now.Mr. Obama said last week, in remarks welcoming troops back to Fort Bragg, N.C., that Iraq’s future would now be “in the hands of the Iraqi people.” But having removed its combat troops, it was unclear whether the United States retained enough influence to limit sectarian tensions that some analysts say could drag the country back into the chaos and violence of past years and even split it along geographical lines.The government made its case against Mr. Hashimi in a half-hour television broadcast that was as aggressively promoted as a prime-time special. In grainy video confessions, three men said they had committed murders on Mr. Hashimi’s behalf. They said they had blown up cars, attacked convoys with silenced pistols and were rewarded with envelopes containing $3,000 in American bills.To government critics, the charges seemed to be part of a wide-reaching consolidation of power by Mr. Maliki. Amid the anxiety stirred by the American departure and unrest in neighboring , Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, has tightened his grip on this violent and divided nation by marginalizing, intimidating or arresting his political rivals, many of whom are part of Iraq’s Sunni minority.Hundreds of people have been swept up over the last two months in arrests aimed at former members of ’s outlawed . In recent weeks, security forces also arrested at least 30 people connected to a former prime minister, , a secular Shiite and caustic critic of Mr. Maliki, according to Mr. Allawi’s office. And on Sunday, Mr. Maliki asked Parliament to issue a vote of no confidence in his own deputy, Saleh al-Mutlaq, a Sunni prone to hyperbole who had compared Mr. Maliki to a dictator in an interview.“Any leading Sunni politician seems now to be a target of this campaign by Maliki,” said Reidar Visser, an expert on Iraqi politics. “It seems that every Sunni Muslim or secularist is in danger of being labeled either a Baathist or a terrorist.”Mr. Hashimi has not often been described as either. Sometimes abrasive and always self-interested, he was one of the first Sunni leaders to embrace the political process after the American invasion, and lost three siblings to terrorist attacks during the height of the sectarian war.“He was someone who tried to be conciliatory with the Shiite Islamists at a time when others did not do so,” Mr. Visser said. “Now, Maliki is going after him.”An aide to Mr. Hashimi denounced the charges as a witch hunt. “This is a coup over all partners, on political process, on the Constitution,” said the aide, who identified himself only as Abu Aya. “This is the new dictatorship.”Any resolution seems a distant hope. The Iraqiya coalition, a large political bloc led by Mr. Allawi that includes Mr. Hashimi, Mr. Mutlaq and many other prominent Sunnis, stopped attending sessions of Parliament on Saturday. On Monday, there were not enough lawmakers to reach a quorum, so Parliament was adjourned until Jan. 3.On Monday night, Iraqiya members called for the president of Kurdistan, , to intervene and reprise a role the Kurds played in bringing together discordant factions and helping to resolve the long stalemate that collapsed after last year’s national elections.The recent tumult has put Baghdad’s political elite on edge.Inside the concrete-ringed Green Zone, the heart of Iraq’s government and home to the American Embassy, Iraqi Army tanks and Humvees have proliferated. Freshly reinforced platoons of soldiers are standing guard over intersections, and security forces have pushed to the edge of the compounds of Mr. Hashimi and other Sunni leaders.“It’s crisis after crisis,” Mr. Mutlaq, the deputy prime minister, said in an interview. “None of the political parties want Maliki to be in this position anymore, but Maliki is controlling everything. Through his police, his army, his security measures. Everyone is afraid.”After days spent hinting at the allegations against Mr. Hashimi, the Iraqi government chose a familiar platform to formally make its case: the televised confession. It played three confessions from Mr. Hashimi’s guards, and promised more in the days to come.Their statements were rich with dates and names, but it was impossible to verify any of the details or to know whether security forces had used threats or force to extract information. In June, said Iraq’s use of televised confessions “seriously undermines the right to a fair trial.”In the first, a man who identifies himself as Abdul Karim Mohammed al-Jabouri said that he had been working as a bodyguard for Mr. Hashimi for a few years when the vice president approached him about some dangerous but important new work. Mr. Jabouri said he signed on.He said he would then receive orders from one of Mr. Hashimi’s subordinates. He and other guards would get a call telling them to pick up an improvised bomb from Mr. Hashimi’s offices and plant it in a busy traffic circle. Other times, they were told to assassinate an official in the Foreign Ministry using silenced pistols.After one bombing, Mr. Jabouri said, he returned to Mr. Hashimi’s offices.“The vice president called us and he thanked us,” Mr. Jabouri said. “He gave us an envelope with money, and I thanked him.”Abu Aya, the Hashimi aide, said on Monday night that the men in the video confessions appeared to be guards who worked in the vice president’s office. Some 10 guards for Mr. Hashimi have been arrested in the last week, according to officials with Mr. Hashimi, the government and security forces, and on Monday morning, Iraq’s high court barred Mr. Hashimi from leaving the country as the terrorism allegations were investigated.At the end of the broadcast, Gen. Adel Daham, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, waved a white sheet of paper in front of a bank of microphones. It was the arrest warrant for Mr. Hashimi, he said, signed by five judges.“It is clear in front of you,” he said.'"
"'11-12-20,'1','He added, “Any time there is some uncertainty there, that kind of frightens the market a little bit.”The Dow Jones industrial average closed off 100.13 points, or 0.8 percent, at 11,766.26. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 1.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.3 percent.Bank of America dropped to $4.99, a decline of more than 4 percent. Morgan Stanley was down 5.5 percent, to $14.16.While Mr. Draghi warned of a difficult year for banks, credit crunches are already visible in some countries like Ireland, Vitor Constâncio, the vice president of the E.C.B., told reporters in Europe on Monday. Meanwhile, slower economic growth is likely to lead to an increase in bad loans, which will further weaken lenders.Keith B. Hembre, the chief economist and chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, said it was difficult to tie the day’s market movements to what was going on in Europe but said there was “overarching concern in my view” considering that there had been strong demand for the E.C.B. funding program, suggesting that banks margins could be pinched.“Just in terms of the market performance today it is a little similar to Friday, when you have a pop at the open and then lost ground,” Mr. Hembre said. “There is somewhat of a European influence in that. It is not like there is any real dominant news story.”Stocks had a choppy day on most major European exchanges, falling early, then rebounding in midsession before ending mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed slightly higher, or about a quarter of a point. The index in Paris, the CAC 40, was up less than 0.1 percent, while the German DAX was down 0.5 percent. The FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.4 percent.United States bonds were down 4 basis points to 1.81 percent in yield. German government bonds, which along with the United States Treasuries are considered to be among the most secure investments in the world, were little changed, suggesting investors were calm after the shock of the Korean news wore off. They closed up 3 basis points to 1.875.The dollar gained against other major currencies. The euro fell to $1.3017 from $1.3046 late Friday in New York.In Asia, the Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 1.3 percent. The Sydney market index S.&P./ASX 200 fell 2.4 percent.

"'11-12-21,'1','TRIPOLI, Libya — Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, the son and presumed heir of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, is alive and well and being held by a rebel militia outside the Libyan capital, according to an American human rights organization that was granted rare access to him. But the group said that Mr. Qaddafi had been denied access to legal counsel as he awaited trial on charges of crimes against humanity.No date has been set for his trial, nor is it clear whether he will be tried in Libya, whose justice system is in disarray, or by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. The international court issued a warrant for his arrest in June, but the Libyan authorities are insisting that he be tried on Libyan soil.A representative of Human Rights Watch, a New York-based advocacy group, saw Mr. Qaddafi on Sunday in the mountain town of Zintan southwest of the capital, where he has been held since he was captured on Nov. 19. Fred Abrahams, a researcher for the group, said that he had met with Mr. Qaddafi in private for 30 minutes, and that the Zintan fighters were treating their captive “with care.” Still, Mr. Abrahams said, Mr. Qaddafi complained of “total isolation” from his family and said he wanted to see a lawyer but had so far been denied access to one.“The new Libya should be about giving prisoners and detainees their rights,” Mr. Abrahams said. “They should give him the rights that his father denied to Libyans for so long. That would be a legal and moral victory for the new Libyan authorities, to say, ‘We will not behave like you.’ ”Though friends and supporters have not been allowed to visit Mr. Qaddafi, several high-ranking officials in Libya’s interim government have been to see him. They include the country’s general prosecutor, a former justice minister and Prime Minister Abdel Rahim el-Keeb, whom Mr. Qaddafi dismissed as “the so-called prime minister” during their meeting, Mr. Abrahams said.Rumors have circulated about the treatment of Mr. Qaddafi at the hands of the Zintan fighters, who were believed to be resisting efforts by the central government to take over his case. The office of the general prosecutor in Tripoli, Abdelaziz al-Hasadi, has jurisdiction, and gave Human Rights Watch clearance to visit Mr. Qaddafi. Mr. Abrahams was then taken to Zintan, where militia commanders appeared to be cooperating with the central authorities.'"

"'11-12-21,'1','If the House had actually voted on Tuesday on the two-month extension of the payroll tax cut in the Senate’s bill, there is a chance that it would have passed. There is a chance a truly ugly legislative wreck could have been avoided and that the take-home pay of 160 million workers would not be reduced in less than two weeks.But the House refused to vote on the compromise. Instead, it voted on a piece of parliamentary trickery devised by Speaker John Boehner and his lieutenants to ensure the tax cut couldn’t possibly pass. The measure simply sent the tax-cut issue back to a nonexistent conference committee. Unlike the bipartisan Senate vote, this one was supported only by Republicans and was designed to produce only one possible outcome.As a result, it looks increasingly likely that the payroll tax cut will end on Jan. 1, along with extended unemployment insurance for three million jobless workers. After the vote, President Obama urged Mr. Boehner and House Republicans to put politics aside and extend the tax cut for two months while negotiators work on making it last for a full year. But he was immediately repudiated by Mr. Boehner, appearing with his caucus, who said the Senate would have to return to Washington and negotiate.In a year full of dangerous standoffs, led by extremist House members, this one may be the most intractable.Many House Republicans never wanted the president’s tax-cut proposal to pass, in part because it might contribute to economic growth in an election year. But they could not be seen as voting against it, so they used one of Congress’s many methods to kill a bill without appearing to have done so. Earlier in the month, they passed a one-year extension full of provisions designed to sink it, including big cuts to discretionary spending, a significant reduction to jobless benefits and utterly irrelevant provisions allowing industries to spew more pollution and forcing a decision on the Keystone XL oil pipeline.They wanted the Senate to vote down that bill so the House wouldn’t be blamed. Instead, the Senate approved a two-month extension, hoping to use that time to reach agreement on how to pay for the next 10 months. The blame has returned to the House side.Assigning blame, or avoiding it, has come to replace actual governing in the Congress. If the tax cut dies, Democrats will accuse Republicans of killing it, and they will be absolutely right to do so. It might even help them regain the House next year among an electorate disgusted with partisan gridlock. But the cost to individual families and the nation is too high a price to pay.'"
"'11-12-21,'1','“Their only chance is a revolt,” Mr. Zyuganov said in a speech on Saturday as he accepted his party’s nomination for president. “The gist of the situation is that both the authorities blatantly tramping upon the people’s rights and the ultraliberals eager to take advantage of the people’s anger are doing the same dirty business.”Perhaps his trickiest political pirouette, however, will be trying to convince Russian voters that the Communists have a real plan for moving the country forward and do not simply want to rewind the clock to the Soviet Union. It will be no small feat, given that the party’s platform is largely built on nostalgia, and that many Russians, no matter how unhappy they are with the current government, seem to have concluded that life is better in a market economy.This was clear at the rally on Dec. 10 that drew upward of 50,000 people to protest the election results.On the way to the demonstration, Communists carrying the red hammer-and-sickle flag marched past Bentley and Ferrari car dealerships and a Zegna boutique selling Italian fashions, and along a street lined with billboards inviting Russians to visit Cancún, Mexico.When Yevgeny Kopyshev, the leader of the Union of Soviet Officers, ended a speech by calling for the return of Soviet power, the crowd booed him off the stage.Given such sentiments, a big effort is under way to rebrand the Communist Party for members of a new generation, some of whom were not yet born when the Soviet Union fell.“Return the Stolen Homeland!” is a core slogan, and party leaders are promising to renationalize critical industries, including oil, minerals, railroads and utilities, and to create a new network of state-owned banks.But party officials also say that they learned from the Soviet collapse and that much of the economy would remain in private hands. They say democratic institutions would be promoted, including free elections.The party’s delicate balancing act is reflected on its Web site, which is heavy on Soviet-era imagery — clenched fists and red flags — but also includes the Central Committee’s bank account information so that supporters can send in donations.Some political analysts say they doubt that the party’s modernization effort can succeed.“I think Communists are now having their brightest hour,” said Konstantin V. Kiselyov, a political scientist at the Institute of Philosophy and Law in Yekaterinburg. “But it’s not the traditional Communist ideas that will be spread, but the desire to vote for this party as an opposition one.”In appealing to young voters, Mr. Zyuganov, 67, may be his own biggest obstacle.He very much looks the part of an old-school, bull-faced Communist Party boss. He was among the hard-liners in the Communist leadership who opposed Mikhail S. Gorbachev’s reforms in the 1980s, became the party’s first secretary in 1993 and ran unsuccessfully in presidential elections in 1996, 2000 and 2008.The party’s weaknesses were on full display this week, when the Communists held a rally near the Kremlin.Although they had a permit for 10,000 participants, fewer than 3,000 turned out. Many who attended not only represented old-style Communism, but also were just plain old: hunched-over men in their 70s and 80s, handing out pamphlets with titles like “Communist of Leningrad.”Still, there were some young people who said they hoped for a Communist resurgence.“Many mistakes were made during the Soviet period which had to be corrected, but that did not mean that the great country had to be destroyed,” said Aleksandr Golikov, 34, a teacher from Zelenograd, outside Moscow.“There are other, more attractive slogans, like ‘Nationalization of Natural Resources,’ ” Mr. Golikov said. “There is no other country where the natural resources belong to a handful of oligarchs. People in the richest country of the world live in poverty. This is something we should not tolerate.”Irina Turkhan, 30, who attended the rally with her boyfriend, Mikhail Turov, 28, said many young people were supporting the Communists because of economic hardships.“Pensioners are forgotten,” Ms. Turkhan said. “Students, at least many of them, have to pay for their education — same with medical services.”The couple moved to Moscow to find work as programming engineers, but even with a job, the cost of living is too high.“I have a good salary, but I pay half of it as mortgage,” Ms. Turkhan said. “We cannot afford to have children.”More emblematic of the crowd was Iosif Abramson, 84, of St. Petersburg, who conceded that the party had dwindled in recent years.“The leadership have stepped away from Marxism, and they exist thanks to the brand name,” Mr. Abramson said. But he also said there was hope for a revival. “Putin’s administration is pushing young people toward leftist organizations,” he said.Leonid N. Dobrokhotov, an adviser to Mr. Zyuganov, said the Communists were positioned to gain support even before the elections incited public anger, because of United Russia’s steadily declining popularity.Mr. Dobrokhotov said that many aspects of the past — a stronger education system, free housing — now seemed appealing to young Russians. “Maybe there were some problems in the Soviet Union, but it was a superpower and the people had a real foundation to be proud,” he said.Mr. Dobrokhotov likened the current situation to 1917, when disparate opposition groups — Liberals, Bolsheviks, Mensheviks — joined forces in the Russian Revolution.“Everybody wanted to live without the czar, but they had a completely different idea about the future,” he said. “Nobody likes Putin, but the liberals and the Communists have absolutely different ideas about the future.”'"
"'11-12-21,'1','SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Oracle, the business software maker, stumbled in its second quarter as it struggled to close deals, a signal of possible trouble ahead for the technology sector.The company’s earnings statement, released on Tuesday for the three months ending in November, suggested that cutbacks in technology spending have begun at major companies and government agencies. Management reinforced that perception with a forecast calling for meager growth in the current quarter, which ends in February.The statement alarmed investors, causing Oracle shares to slide more than 8.5 percent in after-hours trading.Sales of Oracle’s new software licenses edged up only 2 percent from the same time last year. Analysts had expected a double-digit gain in new software licenses. Wall Street focuses on that part of the business because selling new software products generates a stream of future revenue from maintenance and upgrades.Part of the problem with sales was that technology decision-makers delayed signing contracts during the final few days of the quarter, according to Safra A. Catz, Oracle’s president and chief financial officer. That could be an indication that companies and government agencies are treading more carefully as Europe’s debt problems linger.“Clearly, this quarter was not what we thought it would be,” Ms. Catz told analysts in a conference call on Tuesday. She said the company was hoping some of the deals postponed in the last quarter would be completed within the next two months.'"
"'11-12-21,'1','New York’s top court officials issued new guidelines this week declaring that Family Courts across the state are open to the public, restating a rule issued 14 years ago but sometimes not followed by the courts themselves.“Courtrooms in the Family Court are open to the public,” A. Gail Prudenti, the state’s chief administrative judge, said in a memorandum on Monday. The memorandum reminded Family Court judges that, though they are permitted to exclude people from sensitive cases, they are required to justify any closing with findings “based upon supporting evidence.”The new guidelines follow an article in The New York Times last month that described court officials across New York City routinely barring entry to courtrooms, some of which were locked or had “do not enter” signs.Judge Prudenti said in an interview on Tuesday that administrative judges in the state had conducted an extensive review of Family Court policies over the last month, including reviewing signs that might have included misleading information.After The Times’s report, the state’s chief judge, Jonathan Lippman, directed the review.In the interview, Judge Prudenti said top court officials had been distressed to learn of problems with enforcement of the open-courts rule, announced in 1997 to increase accountability in the problem-plagued court. “The chief judge and I were deeply concerned that the rule was not being followed,” she said.Family courts, which include domestic violence, foster care and child neglect cases on their dockets, have been described for decades as overburdened, with too few judges and too many cases.'"
"'11-12-21,'1','Nike’s quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates, as it attracted shoppers, especially in emerging markets, despite higher prices.Worldwide orders for the Nike brand, a closely watched measure of demand in coming months, grew 13 percent to 8.9 billion at the end of the quarter.In China, orders scheduled for delivery from December 2011 through April 2012 rose 31 percent, with a 12 percent rise in other emerging markets.In November, Nike’s rival Adidas raised its sales outlook on strong demand in emerging markets, and Puma said in October that China and Latin America contributed most to overall sales growth.But for Nike, orders rose 16 percent even in North America, and were up in all other markets except Japan.“The brand continues to show very strong demand,” said Matt Arnold, consumer discretionary analyst for Edward Jones. “The strength is just impressive, helping propel the stock higher.” The company said margins dropped 2.6 percentage points as costs of labor and raw materials rose, but came in more or less in line with what most analysts had expected.'"
"'11-12-21,'1','Wonder why a new uptown butcher is called Harlem Shambles? The noun shamble comes from an old word for butcher shop. Timothy Forrester, who owns this bright, spacious store with his brother, Mark, brings in carcasses from local farms and does all the butchering on the premises. Everything is grass-fed and antibiotic- and hormone-free. Dry-aging is evident in the look of the deeply crimson beef; a boneless strip steak was tender, with beefy flavor.Tim Forrester (at right in the photo with the employees Howard McArthur, center, and Rico Cirignano) sells some unusual European-style cuts, like the bavette, or flap steak, similar to flank steak.

"'11-12-21,'1','General Mills said Tuesday that its net income fell 28 percent in its fiscal second quarter as revenue gains could not keep pace with rising costs.The company maintained its full-year outlook and said it expected strong sales and profitability gains in the second half of the fiscal year. However, it cautioned that its gross margins would be lower during that time given continued cost pressures and its recent acquisition of the lower-margin Yoplait.General Mills, which makes Cheerios cereal, Nature Valley granola and Hamburger Helper, remains one of the most popular food brands in grocery stores. But like most of its peers, it has struggled with higher costs for things as diverse as ingredients and labor. The company forecast cost increases of 10 to 11 percent for the year and has raised its prices to offset that pressure.Net income was $444.8 million, or 67 cents a share, compared with $613.9 million, or 92 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Excluding charges tied to its Yoplait deal and other items, earnings were 76 cents a share.“We knew it was going to be a tough environment and it is, but the year is shaping up as we anticipated,” said Don Mulligan, the company’s chief financial officer.The company, based in Minneapolis, reported that its biggest revenue increase was in its international business. General Mills, which already distributed Yoplait products in the United States, announced in July that it was acquiring a controlling stake in the company. This was the first full quarter with the yogurt brand under its ownership, which lifted its international sales 55 percent.'"
"'11-12-21,'1','The journals, the panel, researchers and government officials have been grappling with the findings for several months. The Dutch researchers presented their work at a virology conference in in September.Scientists and journal editors are generally adamant about protecting the free flow of ideas and information, and ready to fight anything that hints at censorship.“I wouldn’t call this censorship,” Dr. Alberts said. “This is trying to avoid inappropriate censorship. It’s the scientific community trying to step out front and be responsible.”He said there was legitimate cause for the concern about the researchers’ techniques falling into the wrong hands.“This finding shows it’s much easier to evolve this virus to an extremely dangerous state where it can be transmitted in aerosols than anybody had recognized,” he said. Transmission by aerosols means the virus can be spread through the air via coughing or .Ever since the tightening of security after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, scientists have worried that a scientific development would pit the need for safety against the need to share information. Now, it seems, that day has come.“It’s a precedent-setting moment, and we need to be careful about the precedent we set,” Dr. Alberts said.Both studies of the virus — one at the Erasmus Medical Center in , in the Netherlands, and the other at the University of Wisconsin-Madison — were paid for by the National Institutes of Health. The idea behind the research was to try to find out what genetic changes might make the virus easier to transmit. That way, scientists would know how to identify changes in the naturally occurring virus that might be warning signals that it was developing pandemic potential. It was also hoped that the research might lead to better treatments.Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the research addressed important public health questions, but added, “I’m sure there will be some people who say these experiments never should have been done.”Dr. Fauci said staff members at the institutes followed the results of the research and flagged it as something that the biosecurity panel should evaluate.The lead researcher at the Erasmus center, Ron Fouchier, did not respond to requests for an interview. The center issued a statement saying that researchers there had reservations about the panel’s recommendation, but would observe it.The researcher, Yoshihiro Kawaoka, was out of the country and “not responding to queries,” according to a spokesman for the university. But the school said its researchers would “respect” the panel’s recommendations.David R. Franz, a biologist who formerly headed the Army defensive biological lab at Fort Detrick, Md., is on the board and said its decision to intervene, made in the fall, was quite reasonable.“My concern is that we don’t give amateurs — or terrorists — information that might let them do something that could really cause a lot a harm,” he said in an interview.“It’s a wake-up call,” Dr. Franz added. “We need to make sure that our best and most responsible scientists have the information they need to prepare us for whatever we might face.”Amy Patterson, director of the office of biotechnology activities at the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Md., said the recommendations were a first.“The board in the past has reviewed manuscripts but never before concluded that communications should be restricted in any way,” she said in a telephone interview. “These two bodies of work stress the importance of public health preparedness to monitor this virus.”Ronald M. , a microbiologist at the and past president of the American Society for Microbiology, who has advised the federal government on issues of germ terrorism, said the hard part of the recommendations would be creating a way to move forward in the research with a restricted set of responsible scientists.He said that if researchers had a better understanding of how the virus works, they could develop better ways to treat and prevent illness. “That’s why the research is done,” he said.The government, Dr. Atlas added, “is going to struggle with how to get the information out to the right people and still have a barrier” to wide sharing and inadvertently aiding a terrorist. “That’s going to be hard.”Given that some of the information has already been presented openly at scientific meetings, and that articles about it have been sent out to other researchers for review, experts acknowledged that it may not be possible to keep a lid on the potentially dangerous details.“But I think there will be a culture of responsibility here,” Dr. Fauci said. “At least I hope there will.”The establishment of the board grew out of widespread fears stemming from the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States and the ensuing strikes with deadly germs that killed or sickened 22 Americans.The Bush administration called for wide controls on biological information that could potentially help terrorists. And the scientific community firmly resisted, arguing that the best defenses came with the open flow of information.In 2002, Dr. Atlas, then the president-elect of the American Society for Microbiology, objected publicly to “anything that smacked of censorship.”The federal board was established in 2004 as a compromise and is strictly advisory. It has 25 voting members appointed by the secretary of health and human services, and has 18 ex officio members from other federal agencies.Federal officials said Tuesday that the board has discussed information controls on only three or four occasions. The first centered on the genetic sequencing of the H1N1 virus that caused the 1918 flu pandemic, in which up to 100 million people died, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in human history.“We chose to recommend publication without any modifications,” Dr. Franz, the former head of the Army lab, recalled. “The more our good scientists know about problems, the better prepared they are to fix them.”This fall, federal officials said, the board wrestled with the content of H5N1 papers to Science and Nature, and in late November contacted the journals about its recommendation to restrict information on the methods that the scientists used to modify the deadly virus.“The ability of this virus to cross species lines in this manner has not previously been appreciated,” said Dr. Patterson of the National Institutes of Health. “Everyone involved in this matter wants to do the proper thing.”'"
"'11-12-21,'1','Another sector is data storage centers, which are growing because of increased Internet usage, which seems to be recession-proof. Mr. Chitty mentioned mortgage and real estate-related debt instruments and health care assets as other areas that could flourish in the coming year despite a poor economy.Entertainment Properties Trust, a REIT that invests primarily in megaplex theaters, has benefited from a shift toward inexpensive entertainment in hard economic times. “Theaters have tended to be a touch countercyclical — not wildly, but a touch,” said David Brain, the chief executive of Entertainment Properties Trust, “and that proved itself in this most recent recession” in which 2009 was a record year for the trust. The REITs lumped together into the specialty basket are actually a diverse group of companies with unusual lines of business that can provide singular opportunities for investors, real estate experts said.While the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts no longer has a “specialty” category, it places some of the more unusual trusts into a sector called “diversified,” said Ronald C. Kuykendall, the group’s vice president of communications.Some REITs considered specialty in the past, like those investing in self-storage properties, health care assets and timber, have become individual sectors in themselves, Mr. Kuykendall said.“If a sector gets large enough that it has a significant enough market capitalization, like timber REITs or self-storage, that becomes a sector,” Mr. Kuykendall said, rather than falling into the “diversified” class.Breaking out of the specialty category has been a boon for the self-storage trusts, said Clint Halverson, a senior director of investor relations for Extra Space Storage Inc., a real estate investment trust based in Salt Lake City, said. The four self-storage REITs now have an equity market capitalization of $27 billion.“Whereas before when we were lumped into specialty,” he said, “you had to market your brand more to investors. It was a little bit more work to get your name out there, and you had to clarify the story and help investors to understand the value proposition in your stock.”Because REITs that invest in real estate outside the mainstream are often structured differently from traditional ones, financial planners and institutional investors have more research to do in formulating their real estate portfolio strategies. For example, specialty trusts often have an operating business linked with their real estate assets, said Thomas M. Ray, the president and chief executive of the CoreSite Realty Corporation, a REIT that invests in data centers based in Denver.“Many of the specialty REITs have more of an operational component to them than the traditional four food groups in real estate,” Mr. Ray said. “Because that operating component is so much more important and larger in many of the specialty sectors, then expertise and specialization matter.”For instance, CoreSite acquires, builds and operates data centers, which house the huge servers necessary to store data for businesses with growing Internet needs. Those unfamiliar with operating these types of businesses might have difficulties predicting the cash-flows of a business doing so.A lack of consistent and long-term performance measures and the small size of some of the niche markets also can make specialty REITs harder to grasp for investors, he said.“More of the specialty REITs came on the scene in the last 10 years or so,” Mr. Ray said, “so you have newer products in these specialty REITS that people need to get to know better, and I think that process is still under way.”But for the data center REITs, a growing track record is helping overcome investors’ lack of experience and misgivings regarding the riskiness of the nontraditional real estate sector. Of the three data center REITs, with a total equity market capitalization of about $8 billion, two are well north of $1 billion, and “that is somewhat of a bright line for some large institutional investors,” Mr. Ray said. “Some investors say, ‘If you’re less than a billion, it’s harder for me to get the size of position I want and harder for me to move in and out of the stock.’ ”'"
"'11-12-21,'1','Throughout the months of this cancer experience, Mr. Cody reports the details of his life and mind — details that, because he has a blazing intellect and can really write, are mostly extraordinary. He is drawn to life and, at the same time, to self-destruction, like a large-hearted moth to an absurd flame.A lot of the best writing in “[sic]” is filtered through Mr. Cody’s musical sensibility. These passages can steal your breath. In one he considers “deceptive resolutions” in music, moments when sound flows in an unexpected direction. What does it feel like when one such deceptive resolution occurs in Beethoven’s Kreutzer Sonata, when an E chord leads to F chord instead of the expected A chord?It feels electric, Mr. Cody tells us. It’s as if “you’re suddenly staring through a small square window into the eyes of the girl you know you’ll marry.” That’s just an uncommonly lovely thing to have written, and this book is full of similar observations.When a female doctor wears scarlet slippers, against the advice of the hospital’s “color psychologists,” of course he falls in love with her. Her slippers, he writes, “ordained their owner, then, as an iconoclast, a purveyor of audacity: this is the color of blood, ambition, Che Guevara, the Roman Catholic Church, and the stop sign.” This relationship gets weird, and ends grotesquely.The couplings in “[sic]” are frequently furtive and dark. One of its sex scenes is burned, permanently, into my mind’s retina. It’s when Mr. Cody has sex with a fellow cancer patient, a model who has lost her hair and has been bald for some time. She has been told, more than once, that she has six months to live.While they’re busy, she catches him staring at her “perfect breasts,” which have earlier been, we soon learn, cut off in a double mastectomy. Before this surgery, she had them cast and “mounted on the wall like the trophy of a hunter.” So those are what he is staring at. “People in white jackets,” Mr. Cody says, “had been removing parts of her body for years.”This scene is as apocalyptic as it is beautiful. “Her dear chest, and my dear hands, meeting there,” he writes. “And I would never tell her this, but I felt as if my hands were gripping the eyestones of a skull.” There never seems to be, in this book, the snuffing of an honest perception.Yet, it’s worth adding that an uneasy element of trust is required. There’s a blanket statement facing the first page that warns that “names and scenarios of all persons figured herein” have been altered for privacy reasons. I am willing to give Mr. Cody the benefit of the doubt. You may be less willing.Quoting from “[sic]” makes me feel like a hack: it’s too easy; the margins of my copy are filled with scratches of admiration. This book works on you in less tangible ways. Its lack of sanctimony and rejection of treacle are notable, for one thing.“[sic]” builds like an orchestral work, pumped full of internal resonances, a dream sequence that functions as a bridge, and intentional, darkening repetition. There is a set piece about bone-marrow extraction that moves over you like a terrible weather system.Part of this book’s mission is the search for an answer to a question the author puts this way: “What’s the proper position of art within a life?” This book is striated with fragments of culture, all of them made meaningful. Mr. Cody has considered things to say about everyone from Ezra Pound and Hugh Kenner to Paul Klee, John Lennon, Mickey Rourke, Joss Whedon, Eric Hobsbawm and David Foster Wallace. He calls the final chord of “A Day in the Life,” from “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band,” in a typical aside, “the greatest E major chord in the history of Western music.”Mr. Cody searches for reasons to live amid what he calls “the guilt of the ill,” the way that “if a person finds himself or herself in a situation for no reason, he or she will go to quite extraordinary lengths to create a reason.” The good news is that thus far, his publisher told me when I asked, his treatment has been successful.Quite early in “[sic]” Mr. Cody explains that “I’m not really a writer, I’m just writing this one thing and that’s it.” That first clause is a prevarication, and the second I hope is untrue. But if it’s not, this one-off contains more wounded life than some pretty good writers get between pages during their entire careers.He makes you think to yourself, as he does late in this book, “My goodness I do love being alive.”'"
"'11-12-21,'1','Other well-known names in North American real estate, including Hines Interests of Houston, Tishman Speyer of New York and Ivanhoé Cambridge of Montreal, are developing projects in China, all with Chinese partners.To gain access to the huge Chinese market, they have had to brave significant language and cultural barriers, nurture close relationships with receptive local partners, and deal with layers of bureaucratic complexity as well as opaque and unpredictable regulatory and legal systems.“You don’t want to get involved in a legal action because it won’t go anywhere,” said Daniel Winey, a managing principal at Gensler, an international architectural firm with a long track record in China. Gensler was the design architect for the Shanghai Tower, a supersize 121-story office, hotel and retail building now under construction in the architecturally striking Pudong section of Shanghai.Many private equity investors that flocked to China in 2007, when real estate prices in the United States were soaring, have since left the country.In China, real estate specialists point out, what gets built depends more on the government’s current goals and policies than on market forces. “It’s such a policy-driven market that you have to time not just the market cycles but also the policy cycles,” said Martin Lamb, the director of Asia Pacific real estate investment for Russell Investments. In recent months, the government has been trying to bring down home prices by tightening credit (though lately this policy appears to be easing). The Chinese have also been encouraging more development of mixed-use communities outside the urban cores and more consumer spending — and developers have been responding accordingly.Hines, the developer of the Galleria malls in Houston and Dallas, completed the first phase of one mixed-use development — the 45-acre California Place in New Jiangwan Town in Shanghai — before selling its stake last year to two Hong Kong developers. In June, Tishman Speyer, whose properties include Rockefeller Center, began development of the Springs, an even larger project north of Pudong.Portman Holdings of Atlanta and its partners have nearly finished transforming Jian Ye Li, a cluster of 1930s traditional-style residential buildings in Shanghai, into a mix of luxury apartments and furnished housing for temporary stays. Portman was the designer and one of the developers of China’s first mixed-use development, the 1990 Shanghai Center, where the Portman Ritz-Carlton hotel is located.Of the commercial property sectors, retail seems to offer the greatest opportunities for foreign investors. American developers have played only a minimal role in the tightening office market in Beijing and Shanghai. Hines developed the new 21st Century Tower, a 49-story office building in Pudong with a Four Seasons Hotel, but sold its stake last year to a Hong Kong company.Western hotel brands are rapidly adding to their management contracts in China, but few foreign companies are developing or investing in the hotels themselves, said David Ling, in charge of China and Southeast Asia for the consulting company HVS Global Hospitality Services.But some foreign retail developers are venturing into second- or even third-tier cities — populous places where the modern shopping center is often a novelty. That strategy is not without risks. “There’s not a lot of historical data to do your planning,” said Sanjay Verma, Cushman & Wakefield’s chief executive for Asia and the Pacific.Retailing specialists say local mall developers are not currently seeking foreign capital but can profit from Western expertise in design, merchandising and attracting the right mix of tenants. “Partnering with somebody with experience will help them on leasing and builds up the confidence of the retailer,” said Siu Wing Chu, a senior director at the international brokerage Savills.Ivanhoé Cambridge, the current owner and operator of Mary Brickell Village in downtown Miami, says it has had success in teaming up with the Bailian Group, the Chinese department store chain, to redevelop La Nova, a lackluster 861,000-square-foot shopping center in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province. Ivanhoé Cambridge made the center more inviting and persuaded its partners to focus on so-called fast fashion.When the center opened last April, 129,000 people showed up, said Richard Vogel, a senior vice president at Ivanhoé Cambridge. In the first week, shoppers virtually emptied the H&M and Zara stores, said Mr. Vogel, who is based in Shanghai. “They had to schedule additional deliveries to keep their shelves filled,” he said.In 2008, the private equity firm Blackstone bought a vacant shopping mall in Shanghai, called Channel One, and brought in tenants like H&M, Zara and Sephora before selling it to a Hong Kong investment company.“Private equity companies have been net sellers over the past 12 months,” said Chris Brooke, the president and chief executive of CBRE in China. Though Simon blamed the absence of a mature consumer market for its frustrating experiences in China, other retail specialists say the giant mall company encountered other problems that are common there, including a difficult relationship with its state-owned partner. (Simon declined to be interviewed for this article.)Before joining Russell Investments, Mr. Lamb was in China to develop shopping centers anchored by Walmart stores. Just getting a copier was an exercise in frustration that required three different licenses, he said. “Once we had Chinese employees, one of them said, ‘You should have asked me. My brother would have gotten it for you,’ ” Mr. Lamb said.In China, he said, a contract is considered more of a guide than a legally binding document “We were always told, ‘If you have a dispute with your tenant, take them out to dinner,’ ” he said.Despite the potential pitfalls, companies with the breadth of a Simon or a Taubman have the potential to succeed in China, but others may face insurmountable challenges, because China’s fast-growing development companies see no need to share their profits, said Jack Portman, a vice chairman of his family’s company. “If you’re not already there with existing relationships, it’s probably too late,” he said. “Unless you have something special to contribute, they don’t need it.”'"

"'11-12-21,'1','MOM was the Eagles, and eggplant macaroni was herShe had lots of other hits, a vast and varied culinary songbook, but her fans wanted her standout classic first and foremost and wouldn’t be denied it. She couldn’t stop performing that dish.She made eggplant macaroni every Eve, which was her holiday, the way Thanksgiving was Aunt Carolyn’s and Easter Aunt Vicki’s. Eggplant macaroni fulfilled the Bruni family dogma that there must, in any holiday feast, be a headliner. Noodles, tomato, cheese: these were the building blocks — the nonnegotiable foundation — of a meal worth savoring. Without them it all came crashing down.But Mom, an Irish-Scottish addendum to this proudly Italian clan, nursed some heretical thoughts, and over the years grew bored with her ritual assembly of eggplant macaroni, a layered casserole of sauced mezzani, which are somewhat like penne, and thin slices of fried eggplant. She yearned to branch out. She didn’t dare abandon eggplant macaroni outright, but thought that by supplementing it, she might later be able to subtract it.One Christmas Eve she made beef , the pastry golden, the beef a rosy pink. On the kitchen island that served as the buffet table she placed a gorgeous silver platter with thick, glistening slices of it.By evening’s end, the platter had barely been touched. The casseroles holding the eggplant macaroni had been cleaned out.The next year she switched from beef Wellington to lobster tails stuffed with crab meat. Same outcome.And so it went, as she cycled through new luxuries and non-Italian traditions, all the way through her last Christmas, in 1995. She never stopped trying. Never succeeded. But never despaired, because deep down she understood.You see, after Christmas, when she snacked on leftovers, it wasn’t the beef or the lobster she turned to. It was the eggplant macaroni, from an extra casserole dish of it that she had set aside, so that she would have plenty of her own in the days to come. FRANK BRUNI1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.

"'11-12-21,'1','The rabbi’s followers and lawyers said they told federal investigators that a former aide to the rabbi, an Israeli named Ofer Biton, 39, had pocketed millions of dollars in donations that were intended for the rabbi’s charity.Mr. Biton’s lawyer in New York, Jeffrey A. Udell, denied the accusations. He said Mr. Biton did not have “any involvement whatsoever in any plot” against Rabbi Pinto.The rabbi’s followers have also charged that Mr. Biton and Ronn Torossian, a public relations agent based in , engaged in a scheme in which they leaked purportedly damaging information about the rabbi to reporters. Then, the followers said, Mr. Biton pushed to have Mr. Torossian put on retainer to help put an end to the bad publicity.Mr. Torossian, who first attended services in Rabbi Pinto’s congregation in 2008, was contacted several times in recent weeks about the assertions of the rabbi’s followers, but would not comment.On Tuesday, after this article was published on the Web site of , Mr. Torossian asked to be interviewed. He said he had no knowledge that he was being investigated, and he accused Rabbi Pinto of mounting a vendetta against him.“My safety and that of my family has been threatened by this gang repeatedly, as I have documented to authorities,” he said. “I have kept this matter quiet to protect my privacy and to preserve the safety of my family. I am afraid of this gangster and this cabal of liars.”Mr. Torossian, 37, has a reputation as an aggressive publicist prone to sending off vitriolic e-mails. In 2008, his firm, 5W Public Relations, was accused of posting fake comments on a blog in an effort to defend a client, , which at the time was ensnared in a scandal over conditions at its kosher meatpacking plant.Some of the fake comments, crude and arrogant, were written under the name of a critic of the plant. Mr. Torossian’s firm later acknowledged that the posts had come from “a senior staff member.”Mr. Torossian has ties to gossip columnists because of his work representing hip-hop celebrities like . He has also represented Israeli officials and Jewish organizations.As evidence that Mr. Torossian was trying to damage the rabbi’s reputation, the rabbi’s followers pointed to news coverage over the last two years and a gossip item in September in The Daily News. The item said the rabbi had dodged a camera crew from “Nightline” that wanted to question him about his financial affairs. (“Nightline,” an ABC News program, has not broadcast anything about the rabbi.)Federal investigators in , who spoke on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that they were examining the roles of Mr. Biton and Mr. Torossian in the disappearance of the money from the rabbi’s congregation, but they would not provide details.Several followers of Rabbi Pinto said in interviews that they had been questioned by F.B.I. agents about Mr. Biton and Mr. Torossian.Rabbi Pinto declined to be interviewed for this article, but he allowed his lawyers to answer questions about the case.A scion of two dynasties of Moroccan Jewish scholars who were revered as mystics, Rabbi Pinto is often mentioned as a candidate for chief rabbi of Israel, where he first established his congregation, Shuva Israel.Despite his success in New York, he has been criticized by some Orthodox rabbis who say the frenzied atmosphere around him can sometimes be cultlike, with people lining up for hours to receive his blessings.Rabbi Pinto made headlines in Israel during the summer over a public feud with his father-in-law, ’s chief rabbi, Shlomo Ben Hamo, who accused him of trying to conceal his ownership of two apartments in . Rabbi Ben Hamo quickly retracted his accusation, but the two men remain estranged.In New York, Rabbi Pinto’s base is in a building at 122 58th Street that Shuva Israel bought for $28.5 million, financed largely by donations from followers.In addition to young scholars in black hats, his congregation includes people in the retail and jewelry trades, as well as real estate titans: Ofer Yardeni, a founder of Stonehenge Partners; Isaac Tshuva, owner of ; and George Klein, a longtime Republican power broker.The rabbi also has ties to politicians in the United States and abroad. Before he resigned after a scandal over inappropriate posts on , Representative , a New York Democrat, met with the rabbi. Two other congressmen, Michael G. Grimm, a New York Republican, and Eric Cantor of , the Republican majority leader, have also met him. Mr. Weiner and Mr. Cantor are Jewish; Mr. Grimm is not.Rabbi Pinto took on Mr. Biton as an aide and interpreter in 2005. Both men have Moroccan Jewish roots. Mr. Biton previously had been involved in the slot machine business in and currently owns a store in New York City that sells pornography, according to court and municipal business records.Mr. Biton became a gatekeeper for the rabbi in New York, setting up meetings for him and supervising financial affairs for Shuva Israel, the rabbi’s followers said.Mr. Biton “was in charge of all the people working for the rabbi to collect money for donations,” said Yossi Azour, a developer who is a follower of the rabbi.“Ofer,” he continued, “was supposed to deliver it to the bank account.”Mr. Azour and other followers said the rabbi himself never handled donations.Lawyers involved in the case estimated that millions of dollars donated to Shuva Israel and intended for charitable work appeared to be missing. Federal officials said the F.B.I. was investigating whether Mr. Biton had siphoned off some of the money he was given by donors and other staff members for deposit in the congregation’s accounts.Some of the rabbi’s aides said they became suspicious of Mr. Biton in 2009 after people who had made donations were not given receipts, and the number of contributions reported by the New York office did not match what officials in Israel were hearing anecdotally.“We talked to people, and they said they gave donations to the rabbi and we didn’t get a donation,” said Michal Cohen, an Israeli lawyer who served as a top administrator at Shuva Israel. “A lot of money was missing.”The rabbi’s relations with Mr. Biton and Mr. Torossian ruptured in March 2010. The rabbi had been staying temporarily in an apartment in the Essex House in Manhattan, a rental that Mr. Biton had helped to arrange, but the rabbi decided to stop renting it.One night, Mr. Biton and Mr. Torossian confronted the rabbi over the decision, according to Ms. Cohen, who said she was there at the time.Ms. Cohen said she heard Mr. Torossian demand $500,000 from the rabbi, as well as five months’ rent for the Essex House apartment. Mr. Torossian threatened the rabbi with a spate of negative publicity if he did not agree, she said.“It was a very bad situation,” she said.The rabbi’s followers contributed at least $380,000 to meet the demand, Ms. Cohen, Mr. Azour and other followers said.Most of the money came from Mr. Azour, according to interviews and an examination of copies of the checks. The checks were made out to RDT, a consulting firm run by Mr. Torossian.Mr. Torossian, asked on Tuesday whether the endorsements on the backs of the checks were in his handwriting, said, “I won’t comment on that.”“There are many different reasons that people pay money,” he said.Mr. Torossian acknowledged that the meeting with the rabbi had occurred, but said Ms. Cohen was not there. He said he had an audio recording of the meeting, but he declined to provide a copy of it.Mr. Biton, in a brief interview on Tuesday, denied any wrongdoing. “Everything you see in this article is a lie,” he said.Meanwhile, information intended to discredit Rabbi Pinto continues to appear. Over the last year, administrators and editors at have repeatedly blocked hostile posts about the rabbi. One commenter, who referred to himself as “Babasalichai,” wrote that the rabbi was perceived by some as a “somewhat shady businessman.”The Wikipedia administrators investigated “Babasalichai” and other similarly negative commenters by examining their Internet addresses and other evidence.They reached a conclusion about the sources of the hostile posts: “Even if they’re not all the same person,” a Wikipedia editor known as Dweller wrote on April 5, 2011, “they are all employees of Torossian.”'"

The yield rose to 1.93 percent, from 1.81 percent late Monday.Many analysts also noted that wild swings were a predictable feature of the end of the year as managers balanced underperforming elements in their portfolios at a time of low trading volume. And even after an impasse over extending a payroll tax cut was announced Tuesday in , the markets held on to their gains.“The market just seems to have no memory from one day to the next,” Mr. Flam said. “To drive a move of this magnitude, you would expect there to be some sort of resolution on the bigger-picture issues.”The in the euro zone and the prospects of sluggish economic growth have ganged up on the financial markets in recent months. But the data has sometimes broken through the gloom, pointing to a recovery that is sluggish but at least is not stalled.On Tuesday in the United States, government data showed that housing starts in November hit their highest level since April 2010. They reached 685,000, a seasonally adjusted annualized pace surpassing forecasts of 635,000 and up more than 9 percent compared with October. Building permits also exceeded expectations, reaching 681,000, data from the Commerce Department showed.And a survey released on Tuesday by the Ifo research group in showed that the business climate for trade and industry in Germany, which is Europe’s largest economy, continued to improve in December. “The German economy seems to be successfully countering the downturn in Western Europe,” the report said.Stanley , the chief strategist for the Silvercrest Asset Management Group, said that the economic reports in the United States and from Europe showed they were “not doing as badly as expected, and this morning the housing data came out much stronger than expected.”In addition to recent higher expectations for growth, he said, “all of these things combined have given a measure of comfort” to investors.The Euro Stoxx 50 index closed 2.7 percent higher. The major indexes were up 3.1 percent in Germany, 2.7 percent in and 1 percent in . The German 10-year bond rose 8 basis points to yield 1.95 percent.In the euro zone bond market, where sovereign debt concerns have been overriding, the Spanish auction of three-month bills priced to yield 1.74 percent helped sentiment, an analyst said.“We are still a long way from a fix to Europe’s problems, but any ease in funding pressures among member economies is certainly a welcomed development,” said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company, referring specifically to Spain.As rose and the United States dollar retreated about 0.5 percent on its index, energy and materials stocks on the broader market surged nearly 4 percent.

"'11-12-22,'1','When the proprietor of a Brooklyn coffee shop was reported missing nearly two months ago, his neighbors fanned out to look for him. Storefronts and subway stations were plastered with signs. A Facebook group popped up looking for clues, and local blogs and newspapers followed the case.On Wednesday, the search came to a gruesome end when the man’s body was identified in Lehigh County, Pa. The man, Joshua Rubin, 30, had been fatally shot, and his body was then set on fire, authorities said.The body had been found near a remote stretch of road in South Whitehall Township on Nov. 1, the authorities said, the day after a member of Mr. Rubin’s family member reported him missing.Unable to identify the body using fingerprints, local officials distributed an artist’s rendering of what the man might have looked like, haunting sketches of a man with large eyes and a wide mouth. But DNA finally revealed his identity.The Lehigh County district attorney’s office said that his death had been ruled a homicide.It was just this fall that Mr. Rubin opened his coffee shop, the Whisk Bakery Cafe, nestled in a large corner storefront, at 1119 Newkirk Avenue, on the first floor of a co-op building in Ditmas Park. On his Web page at the fund-raising site IndieGoGo, Mr. Rubin wrote that he hoped the coffee shop would “serve as a creative outlet for community members.” His goal was to raise $5,000 to buy audiovisual equipment for film screenings and musical performances, the site said.“It was a great cafe, a community space,” said Chris Houghton, co-op board president in the building that hosted Mr. Rubin’s shop. “He was getting a following. People seemed to love it.”On Wednesday evening, a notice of overdue rent was on the metal grate that covered the storefront. It said that the business owed $2,700 a month for four months, or $10,800. Later, a man appeared at the coffee shop and ripped the notice down.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','Michigan officials ordered a formal review of the City of Detroit’s finances on Wednesday after a preliminary examination by the state found “probable financial stress.”“We continue to implore the mayor and City Council to come together on the development of a workable recovery plan,” Andy Dillon, Michigan’s state treasurer, said in a written release announcing the results of the informal examination. “While it appears some progress is being made by the city, the review process must continue, given the city’s financial condition and the distinct possibility that it may run out of cash in early 2012.”Michigan’s continuing look at the finances of Detroit, its most populous city, creates the possibility that the state could ultimately send an outside emergency manager to take control of the city’s spending — a move that many Detroit leaders vehemently oppose. Such a formal review is a required step before an emergency manager may be assigned, but Mr. Dillon said that the review by no means ensured that an outside manager would be brought in, and that the city might still solve its troubles on its own.Leaders in Detroit have said that without significant spending cuts, they will run out of money by April, and have a shortfall of about $45 million by June. State officials who looked at the city’s books found an alarming situation: no deficit elimination plan, a mounting debt problem and trouble making required payments to pension plans, in addition to the looming cash shortfall.Dave Bing, Detroit’s mayor, has regularly said that city leaders, labor unions and others in Detroit could fix the problem through cuts and systematic changes on their own. “We will continue to negotiate with union leadership with a goal of forging an agreement soon,” Mr. Bing said Wednesday.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','Cleveland Browns quarterback Colt McCoy hasn’t shaken symptoms from a concussion sustained nearly two weeks ago, one that has reformed the N.F.L.’s game-day procedures on head injuries.McCoy was not cleared to practice again Wednesday, keeping him sidelined since he was blasted in the face mask by Pittsburgh’s James Harrison on Dec. 8. Browns Coach Pat Shurmur said McCoy was evaluated by team doctors and did “a little physical activity” as he continues to recover.McCoy has not been seen at the team’s training facility this week. He will miss his second straight game Saturday at Baltimore.The Browns are being extra careful in their treatment of McCoy. Their failure to check him for a concussion on the field or sideline at Heinz Field prompted the league to institute a policy of having an independent certified trainer in the press box at games to monitor for head injuries and help identify players who need to be tested.Harrison returned to practice after a one-game suspension and said the Browns should be disciplined for their handling of McCoy.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','The N.H.T.S.A. examined the Leaf and other electric vehicles after the initial Volt fire but last month said its testing “has not raised safety concerns about vehicles other than the Chevy Volt.”A General Motors spokesman, Robert D. Peterson, said the Volt’s battery was “fully encased by the steel floor pan or rails” and that the company chose to use material for the cover that did not conduct electricity. But the Ford Motor Company is following Nissan in putting a steel case around the pair of batteries that power an electric version of its Focus compact car, which it started building this month. The decision about the battery casing was made long before the Volt’s problems were known.Although the N.H.T.S.A. has not yet crash-tested the electric Focus, Ford executives say internal testing has resulted in no damage to the actual battery cells. “Given that this is new technology, we chose to put that extra level of protection in,” said Derrick Kuzak, Ford’s group vice president for global product development.Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, said he expected G.M. to recall the Volt to protect its battery more as Nissan and Ford do. Because G.M. has sold only about 6,000 Volts, doing so would cost a fraction of a typical recall, he said, but the bigger problem is repairing the damage to its image.“Whenever you come out with an alternative vehicle, there will be problems with it,” Mr. Ditlow said. “But when you have a significant portion of the company’s success in the future based on a particular technology, you want to make sure you get it right, and they didn’t. Nissan clearly was ahead of G.M. in this.”Mary Barra, G.M.’s senior vice president for global product development, said the company was studying whether it needed to make the Volt’s battery “more robust,” but she insisted that the car, which went on sale a year ago, was “fully developed” and not rushed into dealerships prematurely.“If we have to do something, we will,” Ms. Barra said this month. “The one thing you don’t want to do is jump to conclusions.”The Volt has been widely praised by reviewers and owners, but even a small flaw threatens to give the company a black eye. The Web site of the conservative radio talk radio host Rush Limbaugh depicts a crumpled Volt engulfed in flames, and a Republican congressman, Jim Jordan of Ohio, has called for a subcommittee hearing about the battery problems in January.G.M. has defended the car, pointing out that no real accidents have resulted in a fire, but it has offered to lend a replacement vehicle to any Volt owners concerned about their safety. About 33 people have taken the company up on its offer, and G.M. has been working to satisfy a smaller number of owners who have asked to sell their Volt back.In early June, a Volt caught fire three weeks after it was heavily damaged in a government crash test. The N.H.T.S.A. said the test, which simulates the car rolling over after striking a pole on one side, damaged the Volt’s battery and ruptured part of the liquid-cooling system that regulates the battery’s temperature.The federal agency intentionally damaged three additional Volt batteries, one of which caught fire a week later. A second one emitted smoke and a brief spark.G.M. officials have said they believe that the rotation allowed coolant to leak and later crystallize, possibly creating a short circuit. The N.H.T.S.A. did not disconnect the battery before storing the car, as G.M. has been training emergency personnel to do, because G.M. did not finish developing its postcrash protocol until July, after the fire occurred.Any time a Volt is in a crash that deploys its air bags, G.M. learns of the incident through the car’s OnStar communication system. If the incident is deemed severe, G.M. sends engineers to examine the battery and drain it. Nissan says it does not need to respond to crashes in person but recommends that a damaged Leaf be taken to a Nissan dealership for repairs.The Leaf also differs from the Volt in that its battery does not have a liquid-cooling system. Mr. Yakushi said laminated circuitry reduced the amount of heat produced.The electric Focus and Tesla Roadster, a battery-powered car sold by California-based Tesla Motors since 2008, do have liquid-cooling systems. Tesla says it encloses each battery pack’s 6,831 cells in steel to protect them and dissipate heat.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','A French doctor and a California sales manager on Wednesday became the latest to be sentenced after being convicted in a recent federal crackdown on insider trading at hedge funds.Dr. Yves Benhamou was sentenced to time served and three years supervised release after he cooperated with an insider-trading investigation and pleaded guilty to leaking secrets to a hedge fund manager about the biotech company Human Genome Sciences. Dr. Benhamou served as an adviser on a clinical drug trial.In a separate case, a former Silicon Valley sales manager, James Fleishman, was sentenced to two-and-a-half years of imprisonment and two years supervised release for helping to convey inside information to hedge funds. The confidential information included revenue or margin numbers from executives at companies, including Advanced Micro Devices and Dell.In imposing Mr. Fleishman’s sentence, Federal District Judge Jed S. Rakoff emphasized the need for deterrence. He said prosecutors in New York had been bringing insider-trading cases for 30 to 40 years, “and yet the prosecutions have not done enough to deter this serious and sophisticated crime.”Mr. Fleishman, 42, worked for Primary Global Research, a so-called expert networking firm.

"'11-12-22,'1','“If you have been kissed under the mistletoe and it was bought, there’s a 95 percent chance it came from us,” said Robert Tiemann, the owner.But not this year.“There’s not enough mistletoe in the State of Texas to run a commercial operation,” said Mr. Tiemann, who is known as Speedy.He estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the plants in the state have been compromised by the drought, which has been the worst in Texas history. Many retailers and wholesalers in New York have had to reach out to suppliers as far west as California to get the plant.But even before this year, mistletoe seemed to be losing its allure. Indeed, some (perhaps especially those who have had to dodge unwanted advances beneath it) are unmoved by this year’s shortage.“It’s an ugly little bush,” said Gardel Prudent of Gardel’s Greene Garden in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, who will not carry mistletoe this year.THE rise in prices brought on by the drought apparently sealed the plant’s fate in Mr. Prudent’s eyes. He said it would have cost him about $5 for a finger-size sprig. With the minimal markup that he could charge, he said, he wouldn’t have made any profit.Craig Core, the owner of Suburban Wholesale Florists and Supplies in Chatham, N.J., said that even before the drought, he had noticed a decline in sales for what he describes as a “cheap novelty item.”“We wind up throwing it away,” said Mr. Core of the leftovers he has at season’s end. “People would rather buy a wreath or a plant than a gray berry.”But Mr. Core will not have that problem this year. For the first time, his 50-year-old business, which distributes to hundreds of retail florists in the area, is not carrying the plant. Because he makes so little money on mistletoe, he said, he decided not to stock even the fake kind.Charlotte Moss, the designer, pointed out that artificial mistletoe can be “unbelievably real.” But Ms. Moss, who remembers shimmying up a tree in her native Virginia to get fresh mistletoe, said that she still prefers the actual thing.“There are a lot of things I can handle that are faux, but somehow for something with a tradition, it should be the real deal,” she said. “Otherwise the kiss doesn’t have the same impact.”But like Ms. Min, Ms. Moss was unable to find a good batch of real mistletoe this year, and so she had none for the elaborate holiday display at her Upper East Side town house. Still, she thinks the plant will be back next year — at a higher price.“Things have their cycles,” she said. “Buy your mistletoe futures now.”The United States Department of Agriculture does not gather data on mistletoe. And there are few details readily available about the overall business of harvesting mistletoe, which characteristically grows on trees and sometimes must be shot with a gun to be retrieved or pulled down with a long pole and hook.Years ago, the vibrant green leaves and pearly berries brightened graves and farmhouses at wintertime in places like Oklahoma, where it became the state flower at the turn of the last century. But no longer.Michael George, a Manhattan florist who recently covered a pair of three-feet-wide globes in greens and artificial mistletoe to promote a dating Web site, said the plant is not as crucial to romance as it once was.“In 1901 you needed to be under the mistletoe to steal a kiss in public,” said Mr. George. “In 2011, you can do just about anything you want in public and it goes unnoticed.” When asked about the shortage, Mr. George was confident there would be no love lost.“I don’t think it will affect the number of kisses,” he said.Many people don’t know what real mistletoe looks like, even if they think they do.During her lunch break on Monday, Ines Ruiz, 60, browsed International Garden, a florist in Manhattan’s flower district. Nodding to what she thought was mistletoe, she said she might buy some for her house.“My family’s coming over, maybe I’ll just put it up and make everybody kiss each other,” she said, giggling.But the salesman corrected her: she was looking at holly.When he showed her the mistletoe, a puny cluster of a few dime-size leaves in a plastic bag, she was shocked.“No, I don’t like it like that,” she said. “Why is it all broken?”“It’s more expensive this year,” added Nelson Argueta, the salesman.Mr. Argueta also told her she would have to hang the mistletoe in its plastic bag to prevent the plant from disintegrating.Ms. Ruiz decided not to make the purchase.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','SOON after moving to this city in 2006, James Welsh became smitten by its energy. “It has a thriving cultural scene, and you have beaches in summer and nearby mountains for snowboarding in winter,” said Mr. Welsh, a 33-year-old Englishman. He decided that his fairly peripatetic existence — he has lived in London, Nepal, Paris, New York and Boston — would come to an end and that he would make Barcelona his home.Mr. Welsh, who is single and works for an online printing firm he founded, began his search in El Poblenou, a neighborhood that is now brimming with tech entrepreneurs, artists and designers. Back then, Mr. Welsh said, “The area was still a little off the radar.”He stumbled onto a floor-through loft with an enormous terrace. The large rectangular apartment — about 1,300 square feet — takes up the entire second floor of an old three-story building, and because the previous owner had removed most of the interior walls, it had an open feel.“It was all very minimal, which was great for me,” said Mr. Welsh, who paid about 600,000 euros (about $775,000) for the flat and the terrace, which is roughly the same size as the interior.Still, Mr. Welsh wanted to make some changes — the loft was dark and lacked enough storage space. He hired Yolanda Yuste López and Tobias Laarmann, principals in a Barcelona-based architecture firm, Ylab Arquitectos. The pair drew up a plan, and Mr. Welsh approved most everything.'"

"'11-12-22,'1','HERE is a holiday enigma, wrapped in a big Christmasy bow.If the perfect gift can be defined as something someone would love to have but would never buy for himself, what does it mean if, as it turns out, he is perfectly willing to buy that something for himself after all? Would we then have a present on our hands that was, at best, past perfect?Especially, that is, if the presents in question are great socks. Is any gift more foolproof? High-quality socks are indeed the kind of small luxury a man can secretly and blissfully appreciate all day long but that can seem like a perverse expenditure when he is faced with a $35 price tag for them. (Corollary enigma: Is a status symbol a status symbol if no one else sees it?)Granted, as brain-imaging scans would surely reveal, the cerebellum’s gift-receiving quadrant does not light up with quite the same intensity upon unwrapping a packet of black cashmere socks as it does upon finding, say, a gold Cartier Tank, no matter how they cushion one’s sole.But socks have become far less pedestrian of late. Those festive cousins of the trusty charcoal-gray sock — crazily colored and/or patterned hosiery (soccus ludicrous) — are no longer destined for the back of the sock drawer. Far from it. Not since the 1980s, when men last considered daring socks an outlet for personal expression, have so many guys gone feet first into style, and had so many great options for doing it.“Men have really been embracing socks lately,” said Eric Jennings, the men’s fashion director at Saks Fifth Avenue, who added that he was surprised by the strength of the trend. “The more novelty, the brighter or bolder the pattern or color, that’s what men are buying. A year ago it was compression underwear. Now it’s these crazy socks.”'"
"'11-12-22,'1','Ms. Finkle is not the only small-business owner looking to the new year as an opportune time to sell. There is a pent-up pipeline of owners who have had to put off selling in recent years because of the economy. And now that many of these companies have at least one year of profits on the books, they are more attractive to potential investors.“A lot of these companies are having record profits because they reduced their overhead in the downturn and now sales are coming back,” said John D. Emory Jr., chief executive of Emory & Company, a Milwaukee-based investment banking company that specializes in selling businesses with $10 million to $100 million in annual revenue. “A lot of owners have told me they want to start a sale process in the first half of 2012, hoping to complete the sale before the end of 2012. Many owners, especially the leading edge of the baby boomers, wanted to sell in 2008, 2009 or 2010 and would have sold in those three years had the economy stayed strong.”Those looking to sell are taking steps to appeal to buyers: trimming costs, diversifying revenue, upgrading financial statements and making the chief executive’s role less essential. And they are braced for the sales process to take longer than they would like.For most owners, the business represents their largest asset, and taxes constitute their largest single expense, said Mackey McNeill, a certified public accountant in Covington, Ky. “The ability to negotiate the best possible selling price and to minimize taxes determines the owner’s financial fate,” Ms. McNeill said.To illustrate the impact of the expiring capital gains tax cut, Ms. McNeill created hypothetical companies that would sell for $5 million and $10 million each, assuming typical values for equipment, depreciation, real estate, inventory and good will. According to her calculations, and assuming Congress does not act, the owner would save $150,000 in taxes by selling a $5 million company in 2012 instead of 2013. For a $10 million business, the savings would be $325,000. These assumptions cover both S corporations and limited liability corporations, Ms. McNeill said. They would not be valid for a company operating as a C corporation.The tax savings are an important factor in Joel Lederhause’s quest to sell a majority stake in DiscountRamps.com, a retailer of loading, hauling and transport equipment based in West Bend, Wis. “We won’t continue to grow 15 to 20 percent a year unless we have some outside capital influx,” Mr. Lederhause said. “We want some money to go into the company to accelerate its growth, and take a portion of our sweat equity off the table.”The company, which projects $22 million in sales this year, keeps about $6 million in finished goods in its warehouse, which limits its growth potential. DiscountRamps.com offers 11,000 different products, and keeps at least one of each item in stock. With an infusion of capital, Mr. Lederhause said, the business could grow to more than $100 million in five years by expanding its product lines into promising new markets.To make the company more attractive to investors, he has focused on cutting costs and maximizing profitability. As a result, gross sales have grown only 6 to 8 percent in recent years, but profits have quadrupled. “The economy hasn’t slowed our growth,” he said, “and that’s one thing that we can point to when we go out to potential investors.”Steps taken include replacing outside contractors with well-trained staff; reducing credit card, shipping and interest costs; renegotiating payment terms with vendors; and replacing software systems with free open-source alternatives. He also made sure to understand the company’s financial statements backward and forward and to put the growth plan in his head onto paper. Documenting a vision for the company, he said, “is a lot harder than you think.”To prepare for the sale of PartyPail, an Internet retailer, Edward Hechter and his wife, Lisa Jacobson, co-owners, have diversified the company’s revenue streams, added detail and structure to the books and cross-trained senior staff — all steps aimed at making the owners less integral to the business. “As a business owner, you should always be prepared to sell,” Mr. Hechter said, not only to take advantage of an opportunity but to protect your family and staff in case you are incapacitated. Despite the recession, the company’s revenue grew to $3.1 million in 2010, from $2.35 million in 2009 and $850,000 in 2008. Revenue of more than $4.4 million is projected for 2011.Mr. Hechter says he believes that a clear investor presentation is critical to any acquisition. Members of his management team restructured the income statement to break out the profit or loss from each of the six e-commerce sites that PartyPail operates. They also refined the cash flow model to better project capital requirements and revenue. Finally, they started accruing annual expenses throughout the year and setting aside cash in anticipation of those costs to smooth out the financials and not have “bad” months when lump sums were deducted.As part of a business survival plan, he has started inviting the marketing director and general manager into vendor and supply chain partner meetings, so they are more intimately familiar with how the business works. As a test of how well the company can operate without him and his wife in the office, they took six weeks away last summer, primarily on family vacations. The test went off without a hitch.“I have a quote on my wall from my Grandma Tillie: ‘Success is when opportunity and preparation intersect,’ ” Mr. Hechter said, referring to the possibility of selling his company. “There’s no telling what will happen,” he said, adding, “Business owners don’t have the luxury of saying, ‘I’m going to change jobs.’ ”'"
"'11-12-22,'1','The crisis has also come at an inopportune time: Many on the extensive American Embassy staff here have gone home for the holidays. Ambassador , who left the country after a ceremony last week to mark the end of the war, cut short his trip to rush back to Baghdad, and was meeting with senior Iraqi leaders, as was , the director of the and former military commander in Iraq, who arrived on Tuesday, an American official said.If the crisis continues to intensify, the Obama administration is likely to draw new criticism for failing to negotiate an extension of the American troop presence in Iraq. While an agreement negotiated by the administration of President called for a final departure at the end of 2011, both countries spent the summer trying to negotiate an extension — something that military leaders and many analysts argued was needed to secure Iraq’s fragile democracy and protect the gains achieved in a war that cost nearly 4,500 American lives and close to $1 trillion.“This is an absolutely critical moment,” said Kenneth M. Pollack of the Saban Center for Policy at the and an advocate for a continuing American troop presence. “It is critical for the White House’s Iraq policy. The underlying theme of their Iraq policy is that Iraq is a success and it is relatively stable and it does not need American troops to continue the move forward. This crisis is a clear and unmistakable challenge to both of those premises.”In the coming days, America’s ability to shape outcomes in Iraq, already flagging in the period leading up to the troop withdrawal, will be sharply tested. The largest American Embassy in the world is here. The United States is spending nearly $1 billion a year to train Iraq’s police, and is spending billions more arming Iraq’s military with tanks, fighter jets and other weapons.Even with all combat troops departed, 157 military personnel remain in the country, overseeing military sales to Iraq that amount to $10 billion in weapons contracts, $3 billion of which is paid by the .“I’m a glass-half-full guy, so I’m not looking at the doomsday possibility,” said Lt. Gen. Robert L. Caslen, who heads the embassy’s Office of Security Cooperation. He added that “there is more common sense in the government and more ability of our international community to help coach the Iraqis to make wise decisions on how they govern.”Yet the huge weapons sales and enormous diplomatic mission still may not carry much weight when it comes to the hard task of reconciling Iraq’s divisive sectarian politics.“Trying to include all the major elements in one government was always a prescription for , or at least food fights,” , the ambassador here last year, said by telephone.He added, “This Shia-Sunni divide is big and it’s never gone away and it’s going to take generations to go away. There’s a lot of hostility there. It’s up to us to try to be helpful to try to get Maliki to try to do the right thing.”Mr. Maliki, a Shiite, also issued a warning to his rivals — and, incongruously, to his coalition partners — in Iraqiya, the largely Sunni bloc of lawmakers that includes Mr. Hashimi: If they do not end their boycott of Parliament and the Council of Ministers, he will move to form a majority government that would exclude them from power.If Iraqiya’s ministers do not show up at future sessions, he said, “we will appoint replacements.”The news conference was the first time the prime minister had spoken directly to the nation since the controversy erupted several days ago.The crisis began when the Shiite-dominated government issued its arrest warrant for Mr. Hashimi, the top Sunni politician, on terrorism charges. Mr. Maliki offered to defuse tensions by calling for a conference of Iraq’s political elite to discuss the matter. But his efforts at conciliation seemed to end there, and Iraqiya rejected calls to meet and said it would pursue a long-shot no-confidence vote against Mr. Maliki.The arrest has cast a spotlight on Iraq’s judicial system, which for almost nine years has been pushed by American diplomats, military personnel and civilian experts toward a system based on evidence rather than confessions. Yet the government has made its case to the public against Mr. Hashimi by broadcasting videotaped confessions that Mr. Hashimi has said were fabricated and that others contended were made under duress.The timing of the decision to seek Mr. Hashimi’s arrest — the government is said to have been compiling a case against him for years — has further inflamed the situation. “The timing of the release of such details and accusations against Hashimi raises question marks, since Maliki said he had the documents against Hashimi three years ago,” said Muhammad al-Khafaji, a lawmaker from the Sadrist bloc and an ally of Mr. Maliki. “Why didn’t Maliki release them to the public before this time? I think the timing was chosen on purpose.”If there is one ray of hope, it is that public life in Iraq is one of perpetual crisis, and that seemingly intractable conflicts have been resolved before. But some analysts say this is the worst political instability here in years, certainly the gravest since it took nearly eight months to form a government after last year’s parliamentary elections. And, of course, the American military is no longer here.In calling for the Kurds to turn over Mr. Hashimi, Mr. Maliki risked alienating a powerful minority that operates in its own semiautonomous region and whose support he would need to form a new government without Iraqiya. While in the north, Mr. Hashimi is largely out of reach of Mr. Maliki’s security forces, and could easily flee the country.“We demand the Kurdistan region hand him over,” Mr. Maliki said, adding, “If he escapes, this will create problems.”Iraq faces a number of difficult political problems that in sum could derail the national unity government created last year to give meaningful roles for Iraq’s Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds. This, in turn, raises fears of a return to sectarian and factional violence — although so far it appears that the infighting has remained confined to politics.There has been no recent spike in attacks. But the latest problems have laid bare the sectarian fissures still pervasive in society.The minority Sunni population, which had dominated Iraq’s affairs under , feels increasingly marginalized.In addition to seeking Mr. Hashimi’s arrest, Mr. Maliki has recently sought a vote of no-confidence from Parliament against another Sunni leader, a deputy prime minister, Saleh al-Mutlaq, for calling Mr. Maliki a “dictator” in a television interview.“Although Maliki is going after political rivals, his impulsive actions have the same consequences to Iraq’s stability as if he were targeting the Sunni community as a whole,” said Ramzy Mardini, an analyst at the Institute for the Study of War in Washington. “The Iraqiya bloc is simultaneously Maliki’s main political rival and represents the Sunni community.”'"
"'11-12-22,'1','TOKYO — Decommissioning the wrecked reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant will take 40 years and require the use of robots to remove melted fuel that appears to be stuck to the bottom of the reactors’ containment vessels, the Japanese government said on Wednesday.The predictions were contained in a detailed roadmap for fully shutting down the three reactors, which suffered meltdowns after an earthquake and tsunami struck the plant on March 11. The government had previously predicted it would take 30 years to clean up after the accident at Fukushima, the world’s worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl in 1986.The nuclear crisis minister, Goshi Hosono, acknowledged that no country has ever had to clean up three destroyed reactors at the same time. Mr. Hosono told reporters the decommissioning faced challenges that were not totally predictable, but “we must do it even though we may face difficulties along the way.”The plan’s release follows last week’s declaration by Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda that the plant had been put into the equivalent of a “cold shutdown,” a stable state that suggested the runaway reactors had finally been brought under control. Critics, however, immediately challenged that statement, saying it was impossible to call the reactors stable when their fuel had melted through the inner containment vessels, and appeared to be attached to the concrete bottom of outer containment vessels.Still, the government appears ready to move ahead with the next stage of the cleanup. According to Wednesday’s roadmap, the plant’s operator, Tokyo Electric Power, will spend the next two years removing spent fuel rods from storage pools located in the same buildings as the damaged reactors. At least one of those pools, which are highly radioactive, was exposed by hydrogen explosions that destroyed the reactor buildings in the first days of the accident.The most technically challenging step will be removing the melted fuel, a process that the government said will take 25 years and require new types of robots and other new technologies that have not even been developed yet. After the removal, fully decommissioning the reactors will take another 5 to 10 years, according to the roadmap.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','Although airlines for now will receive most of the permits they will need free, the European Union estimates that ticket prices could rise by as much as 12 euros ($15.65) on some long-haul flights to cover the cost of the additional permits required.Airlines for America, an industry lobby group and one of the plaintiffs in the case, said that its members would be required to pay more than $3.1 billion to the European Union from 2012 to 2020. It said its members would comply with the system under protest but would also review options for pursuing the case in Britain’s High Court, which had referred the original complaint to the European court in 2009.“The court did not fully address legal issues raised and has established a damaging and questionable precedent,” the airline group said in a statement.In a letter dated Dec. 16, Hillary Clinton, the United States secretary of state, and Ray LaHood, the secretary of transportation, said Washington would be “compelled to take appropriate action” if Brussels proceeded, though the letter did not specify what form that might take.In a statement on Wednesday, Krishna R. Urs, the State Department’s deputy assistant secretary for transportation affairs, expressed Washington’s disappointment but did not broach the subject of retaliation.“We continue to have strong legal and policy objections to the inclusion of flights by non-E.U. air carriers” in the system, Mr. Urs said. “We do not view the court’s decision as resolving these objections.”He added: “The path the E.U. has chosen is hampering progress towards a multilateral solution that is more likely to bear fruit in terms of concrete progress in limiting greenhouse gas emissions from aviation.”The court’s decision, and the pressure from Washington, leave American airlines in an uncertain legal limbo, particularly following a bill approved this year by the House that would bar them from participating in the European system.A similar bill was introduced this month in the Senate but was not expected to be brought to a vote until after the new year.China has also made known its displeasure with the European directive. This year it threatened to suspend purchases of jets made by the European manufacturer Airbus if Chinese airlines were included. A group of Chinese carriers has also threatened to bring a lawsuit, possibly in Germany, where the authorities will oversee the application of the system to several Chinese airlines.Experts say the Chinese could argue that the European law violates the Kyoto climate agreement by requiring airlines from developing nations, which are exempt from emissions cuts under the treaty, to bear the same burdens as carriers from wealthier nations.Algeria has already begun a case in France contesting the system, according to the Arab Air Carriers Organization, an industry group that includes the country’s main carrier, Air Algérie.Exempting foreign airlines, however, would anger European carriers that would still be required to participate.“European airlines and the European economy must not get caught in the political crossfire or be put at a competitive disadvantage,” Mike Ambrose, director general of the European Regions Airline Association, said. “If these tensions erupt into full-scale trade conflict, there will be no winners — least of all the environment.”The European initiative involves folding aviation into the six-year-old emissions trading system, in which polluters can buy and sell a limited quantity of permits, each representing a ton of carbon dioxide. The legislation requires that airlines account for their emissions for the entirety of any flight that takes off from — or lands at — any airport in the bloc.The goal, European officials have said, is to speed up the adoption of greener technologies at a time when air traffic, which represents about 3 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions, is growing much faster than gains in efficiency.Governments and airlines have been in negotiations for more than a decade over the creation of a global cap-and-trade system under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organization, an arm of the United Nations. The organization’s 190 member states passed a resolution in 2010 committing the group to devising a market-based solution, though without a fixed timetable.Impatient with the pace of those talks, the European Commission moved ahead with its own plan, which was passed two years ago with the support of national governments and the European Parliament.At an I.C.A.O. meeting last month, 26 member states, including China, Russia and the United States, formally showed their dissatisfaction with the European system — a sign that they could push for a formal dispute procedure at the organization.European officials have said repeatedly that they would prefer a multilateral solution and are prepared to amend their cap-and-trade system if and when the I.C.A.O. reaches a global aviation emissions agreement.The ruling clears the way for the European system to take effect next month. However, airlines will not have to hand over the first batches of emissions permits until the spring of 2013 to compensate for flights made in 2012. That could leave room for a compromise to be negotiated over the next year.The emissions rules apply from the moment an aircraft begins to taxi from the gate, either en route to or from a European airport, and they cover emissions for the flight from start to finish — not just the portion that occurs in European airspace.According to Airlines for America, on a typical flight from San Francisco to Heathrow Airport in London, 29 percent of the total emissions take place in United States airspace. A further 37 percent occurs in Canadian airspace and 25 percent over the high seas. Less than 9 percent of the emissions from such a flight would actually take place in European Union airspace.In its ruling, the court noted that the European directive did not apply “as such” to aircraft flying over the high seas or over the territory of the member states of the European Union or third countries.“It is only if the operators of such aircraft choose to operate a commercial air route arriving at or departing from an airport situated in the E.U. that they are subject to the emissions trading scheme,” the court said.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','Two nutrient-dense vegetables combine forces in this delicious filling. Mushrooms are an excellent source of vitamins and many minerals, particularly selenium, copper, potassium, phosphorous, zinc, and manganese – and they contain a powerful antioxidant called L-ergothioneine. They’re used medicinally throughout Asia for their immunity-boosting properties. They also contain more protein than most other vegetables, and their meaty texture makes them a perfect choice for vegetarians. Cabbage possesses phytochemicals like sulforaphane, which protects the body against cancer-causing free radicals, and indoles, which help metabolize estrogens. It’s also an excellent source of vitamins K and C, and a very good source of  dietary fiber, vitamin B6, folate, manganese and omega-3 fatty acids.1. Heat a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the mushrooms and sear, stirring often or tossing in the pan, until they are lightly colored and beginning to sweat, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the scallions and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute, until tender. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds to a minute.2. Season the mushrooms with salt and pepper and stir in the cabbage. Cook, stirring often, until the cabbage is tender, about 5 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste and stir in the cilantro and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the salsa (to taste).3. Heat the tortillas. Top with the mushroom/cabbage mixture, sprinkle with cheese if desired, and serve.'"
"'11-12-22,'1','“Men today say they feel they have to look better to be competitive,” said Celeste Hilling, the founder and chief executive of Skin Authority, a brand of skin creams that introduced a men’s line in 2010.Sales of premium skin-care products for men jumped 5 percent that year, and have risen another 12 percent so far in 2011, according to the NPD Group, a market research firm. Women buying products for men account for only 25 percent of those sales: most of the time, men buy these products for themselves.Looking to capitalize on the trend, manufacturers are again filling shelves with creams designed for men. This time, though, they are trying to avoid the too-prissy mistakes of the previous decade.“The man today purchasing these products is so different than eight years ago,” Ms. Hilling said. “These guys who always thought it was vain or too metrosexual” to splurge on beauty products “now think it’s almost a badge they wear to say, ‘I’m a modern guy because I care about my skin.’ ”A common theme among the new crop of men’s products is that they are multitaskers. Sunscreens double as moisturizers, and toners double as conditioners. Indeed, all the items in the Skin Authority Man line, including a daily sunscreen and a toner, are labeled “age-defying,” an acknowledgment that most men are not likely to buy a separate wrinkle reverser.“Men are very utilitarian,” Ms. Hilling said. When it comes to beauty routines, “they are willing to do two steps, not eight, like a woman.”Many men are wary of any product that will add time to their morning routine. They also tend to be more skeptical of over-the-top promises made by manufacturers. Even claims to halt aging can serve as a turnoff, said Blake Yeh, founder of Organic Regimens, another new line.“The biggest thing in my view is guys want it to work, and it has to work right away,” said Mr. Yeh, whose products include an Ultra Smooth Shave Formula and a Microfine Face scrub. “We’re just more impatient than our female counterparts, who are willing to try something that will make them look younger in a couple months. Guys want it, and they want it now.”To avoid that pitfall, some products are now taking their cues direct from frat culture. Witness the new morning-after Rescue Gel produced by Nickel, a men’s skin-care line that has evolved into a chain of spas. This blue-tinted cream loaded with caffeine, coffee extract and soy protein was designed as the beauty equivalent of a hangover cure.“It’s made for the morning when you didn’t sleep the night before,” said Steven Morales, a spokesman at the Nickel Spa in Chelsea. “The soy protein helps tighten the skin, and the caffeine helps bring blood to the surface.”Nickel is hardly the first company to produce a cream for men that uses caffeine to reduce puffiness. Kiehl’s, for example, makes the same promise for its Facial Fuel Energizing tonic, but is just a bit less direct in its marketing language.There are other signs that men are open to incorporating new products and techniques if the items will make them look or feel younger. Sales of Botox and other fillers for men increased 10 percent in 2010, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. And college campuses are rife with the smell of body sprays made by Axe and Old Spice, a category that did not even exist in the United States a decade ago.But while men have periodically shown an interest in expanding their skin-cream horizons, they are likely to reverse themselves.“As much as everyone was getting involved in the category back in 2003 and 2004, we didn’t see that men were so quick to change their behavior,” said Karen Grant, the senior beauty industry analyst with the NPD Group. “The majority of men still don’t know they have a skin-care issue. Because of that, they’re not necessarily feeling that they need to use a product specifically designed for their face.”Even with his $600 a year habit, Mr. Sullivan said he still uses Irish Spring in the shower. And for every man like him, there are many more like Jaime Llorca, an engineer from Barcelona, Spain, who now lives in Red Bank, N.J.Two years ago, a female friend took him to a CVS to buy premium skin products.“I used them for maybe two, three months,” he said, and then never bought them again. The problem was not that he didn’t like or couldn’t afford the products.“I just didn’t see a difference,” he said.'"

"'11-12-23,'1','Last year’s winners were Delaware, the District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Rhode Island and Tennessee — with Florida and New York each receiving $700 million.Since then, Hawaii has struggled to carry out its plans after receiving a $75 million grant. On Wednesday, it became the first state to receive a letter from the federal Education Department warning that its Race to the Top grant was being given “high risk status” — meaning that the state is in danger of losing its grant if it does not show improvement.“If things don’t change, Hawaii is going to end up in a tough spot,” Education Secretary Arne Duncan said Thursday in a conference call with reporters to announce the latest grants. “I think it’s our obligation to be very clear on that.”But Mr. Duncan said that he was pleased with the overall progress being made by states to improve education. “I’m very hopeful about where we’re going,” he said.The new round of federal money provided cheer for state education officials, many of whom are under pressure to increase student test scores and performance amid reductions in state education spending.This month, federal officials also awarded grants for early learning and child care programs.In New Jersey, which barely missed out in last year’s competition, in part because of a technical error on its application, Christopher D. Cerf, the acting education commissioner, said the money would enable the state to “aggressively pursue important pieces of our statewide reform agenda,” which include the development of a new teacher evaluation framework and school accountability system.“This award today will help us to accelerate the tide of reform across New Jersey,” Mr. Cerf said.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','On Dec. 8, the residents of Fair Oaks Street in the Mission woke up to the news that a brutal rape had taken place in the early morning on their normally placid street.By the end of the day, the San Francisco Police Department confirmed a rumor that was making the rounds via e-mail: there was a serial rapist in the neighborhood. Police said the same assailant was responsible for a similarly violent rape and robbery that occurred on Nov. 18 at 24th Street and Potrero Avenue.The e-mail, written on Dec. 7 and posted to a confidential e-mail list for workers at San Francisco Women Against Rape, a victims’ services group, went viral.But like much chatter passed around via word of mouth, electronic or otherwise, the e-mail contained some false information. Specifically, a grisly detail — that the rapist was breaking the victims’ necks — was untrue, according to the police at a community gathering in mid-December.“There were no broken necks,” Michael Biel, a police department commander, said at the packed meeting of approximately 250 residents.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani lashed out against his country’s powerful military on Thursday, warning of conspiracies against the civilian government. His accusations threw a spotlight on swirling rumors that the military might have plotted a coup after being humiliated by the American raid that killed Osama bin Laden.Mr. Gilani, usually a soft-spoken politician, complained Thursday that “conspiracies are being hatched to pack up the elected government.” Later, speaking on the floor of the National Assembly, he said that his government had supported the Pakistani military during several crises, including the Bin Laden case, but that the same generals had turned against the civilian government.“They cannot be a state within a state,” Mr. Gilani said. “They are answerable to the Parliament.”The rumors of a coup plot have been building for months, since an American businessman of Pakistani origin wrote an op-ed article for The Financial Times saying that a Pakistani diplomat asked him to deliver a memo to Adm. Mike Mullen, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, after Bin Laden was killed. He described the memo as saying that the civilian government sought help in preventing a possible coup, offering in exchange to dismantle part of the Inter-Services Intelligence spy agency.Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the Pakistani Army chief, and Lt. Gen. Ahmad Shuja Pasha, the ISI chief, have insisted that the Supreme Court investigate the memo.The furor grew last week when the British newspaper The Independent published a blog post with more hints. The post quotes the same businessman, Mansoor Ijaz, as saying that American intelligence sources told him General Pasha traveled to the Persian Gulf after the Bin Laden raid to muster support for a coup in Pakistan. The ensuing media and political storm raised calls for General Pasha’s resignation. Husain Haqqani, the former envoy to the United States who was accused of being behind the memo to Admiral Mullen, was forced to step down. Mr. Haqqani denies involvement, and denies accusations that he gave visas to hundreds of American spies.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','The financial-aid enhancements have had a profound effect on the quality of athletic recruits. Rosters are now fortified with top athletes who would have turned down the Ivy League in the past because they would have been asked to pay $20,000 to $30,000 per year more than at other colleges.“We’re seeing a significant change in the caliber of the student-athlete,” said Steve Bilsky, the ’s athletic director, one of more than 50 Ivy League administrators and coaches interviewed. “It’s not even the same population because the pool has widened. We see a considerable number of student-athletes turning down athletic scholarships from places like Stanford, Northwestern or to come to Penn.”Andy Noel, Cornell’s athletic director, said: “Eighty percent of our best recruits in the current freshman class would not have come here 10 years ago because we couldn’t match other schools’ offers. The impact has been enormous. And will continue to be.”A recruited Ivy League athlete must have the academic credentials to survive the stringent and highly selective admissions process at each institution. Coaches have little sway in the admissions process, although they do provide a list of potential athletes to admissions officials. Across the league, about 13 percent of each university’s incoming class is composed of athletes chosen from coaches’ lists.But the new, plentiful financial aid awards have permitted Ivy League coaches to compete head-to-head in the same recruiting arena as some big-time scholarship programs. And in sports like baseball, soccer, wrestling or lacrosse, where most athletic scholarships are split into partial scholarships worth a half or a quarter of the cost to attend, it is not uncommon for an Ivy League financial aid package to be superior to the athletic scholarship.At most Ivy League institutions, families earning less than about $65,000 annually are now asked to make no contribution to their children’s education. Families making $65,000 to $180,000 might be expected to pay 10 percent to 18 percent of their annual income on a sliding scale. Ten years ago, such families would have been expected to pay almost twice as much, and their child would probably have accumulated a debt of about $25,000 after four years.The current guidelines vary from institution to institution and can be affected by multiple factors, but each Ivy League member has significantly increased aid packages and has shown noteworthy largess. And in another unprecedented move, a vast majority will match the aid package offered by another Ivy League member. That makes the financial aid awards in the Ivy League generally the most generous of any group of colleges or universities in the .“When I was a senior in high school, I had about 20 basketball scholarship offers from all over,” said Shonn Miller, now a star 6-foot-7 freshman forward at Cornell. “But when they said I could come to Cornell for $2,000 a year, it made my decision pretty easy. I mean, are you kidding me?“With the finances out of the way, a lot of good players are taking the education, the prestige and the athletics in one package.”Christian Webster, the second-leading scorer on Harvard’s basketball team last season, made the same choice even when the cost to attend Harvard was $20,000 a year, including room and board.“It’s a sacrifice, but it’s doable,” said Webster, a junior who was ’s high school player of the year in 2009 and had about 25 full athletic scholarship offers. “It’s not free, but it’s also not the full price of $50,000 or more. To me, it was a 40-year life decision, not a four-year decision.”Around the Ivy League, financial-aid initiatives adopted in the last few years and directed at all students have significantly altered the decision-making of as many as 700 top recruited athletes. Erica Reetz, an outside hitter on Yale’s two-time defending Ivy League championship volleyball team, was weighing full athletic scholarship offers from colleges near her Wisconsin home as a high school senior.But when Yale’s financial aid office offered her $33,000 to attend, she could not accept soon enough.“Now I was going to Yale for the same cost as any other kid going to a state school,” Reetz said.The Ivy League gradually stepped away from the upper tier of college athletic competition beginning in the late 1950s, most conspicuously in football. As other larger universities gave away thousands of athletic scholarships and relaxed admissions standards for superior athletes, the Ivies retreated to focus on play against peer institutions with similar academic and athletic philosophies. Regional and national team championships were still won but more rarely, especially in major sports.For decades thereafter, if elite athletes were also standout students, they were increasingly lured away by places like , Vanderbilt or Duke, which offered athletic scholarships and academic excellence.“It got to the point where the only elite athletes we could reasonably recruit were either relatively poor or very wealthy,” said Rob Koll, Cornell’s wrestling coach for the last 19 years. “That’s because in either case, money was out of the equation. One kid was going to get full aid from us and the other kid’s family wasn’t much concerned by the cost.“The new financial-aid policies level the playing field with middle-class recruits. Of course, we still lose recruits all the time.”Indeed, no one is predicting that Ivy League football teams will be competing for a national championship any time soon. For starters, they have not been allowed to compete in the postseason for decades. There are other rigorous institutional checks, with Ivy League presidents routinely wielding complete authority over athletics. Last month, Ruth Simmons, the Brown president, announced she was cutting the number of recruited athletes admitted by 20 spots. And getting aid at an Ivy League university is not like accepting an athletic scholarship; it involves filling out arduous federal financial aid forms, writing admission application essays and taking multiple standardized tests.Still, Ivy League coaches have enthusiastically entered the recruiting wars with a new zeal, and one of the first things they do is direct recruits to the financial aid calculator on their institutions’ Web sites. After students enter personal data, the costs to matriculate are revealed in less than 10 minutes.“That calculator is the greatest thing,” said Erin Appleman, Yale’s volleyball coach. “Parents call me right back and say, ‘Hey, we can pay that much.’ ”Appleman, like more than a dozen other coaches interviewed, said at least half of her recent recruits were from middle-class families who would not have attended Yale, or any Ivy League university, even five years ago.“I can tell the demographics of my team are changing because not everyone is going to for spring break,” she said, laughing. “The middle-class kids are going home.”'"
"'11-12-23,'1','For those funds that don’t, there are warning signs. Some 213 of them closed shop in the third quarter, according to HFR. That’s the most since early 2010, though still far from the 778 closed in the fourth quarter of 2008.Over all, hedge funds look well positioned to get a pass for their poor 2011 showing. But while big investors may give them another chance, they shouldn’t be surprised if markets continue to be erratic in 2012 and prized managers again struggle to prove their worth.Before the euro crisis, talk of currency unions was becoming common around the world. The Persian Gulf states had a plan, and there were serious suggestions for South America and Asia. Right now, exhausted European governments might advise would-be unifiers not to bother. But if the crisis lifts and Angela Merkel’s “more Europe” ideas bear fruit, monetary unions could well come back into fashion.There are good reasons to maintain currency autonomy, as any euro-skeptic economist can explain. When countries with their own fiscal authorities join forces monetarily, the projects can easily end in tears especially if weak members cannot get help from strong ones in a downturn. But such discussions of “optimal currency areas” are academic. They do not take into account the persuasive power of monetary facts on the ground.Sure, the euro zone was born too soon to survive on its own. Like an infant marsupial, a new currency needs the warmth only a mother can provide. The mother — the biggest countries at the core of the euro — proved a bit immature.. But she now may be forced to grow up for the sake of her offspring. The crisis is forcing members of the euro zone to make some adult decisions about fiscal policy and bank support.The delicate health today of the European single currency should not obscure its conceptual appeal. Compared with the sum of its national parts, a robust euro zone would be more efficient. It would be better able to negotiate and compete with global economic powers, too. The stronger members gain access to a larger home market. Weaker members are obliged to live up to high fiscal and regulatory standards.These advantages are appealing to Bahrainis, Argentines and Thais. Each region will have to find its own way of moving toward monetary union. But if they wish to emulate the euro story, they should take note of the hundreds of precursor rules that built a single market for goods, labor and capital. And realize that plenty of patience is required. Hasty edifices will surely collapse.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','Defense lawyers, who are usually the ones within tissue-supplying range, say that in court, as in life, there is no easy answer. “You can’t do much about it,” said Ronald P. Fischetti, a defense lawyer who has handled his share of weeping politicians and red-eyed white-collar criminals. “You can put your arm around him,” Mr. Fischetti offered.Mr. Kruger’s lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said that sitting next to his sobbing client was an ordeal, particularly because he could sense the ridicule coming. Many people, he said, “have watched too much TV and believe everything is rehearsed and staged.”Of course, one man’s sincere tear is another man’s sniveling manipulation. So there are many perspectives to any courtroom cry fest. The most important one is likely to be the one from the bench. From up there, the emotion can look intense, said Stephen G. Crane, who was a judge in New York for 27 years.Still, he said he could not recall an instance in which tears changed his mind about how long an offender needed to be sent up the river.But judges are people too. “You feel embarrassment for the defendant; I did, anyway,” Mr. Crane said. “What goes through your mind is: ‘He feels poorly because he got caught.’ ”Down where the people sit, it can be much more difficult to spot tears unless the spigot is really gushing. But in high-profile cases, some news reporters have the eagle eye needed to justify headlines like the one in The New York Post on Wednesday after Mr. Kruger’s guilty plea: “Crybaby Sen. Going to Jail.”From the prosecution side of the courtroom, weepers do not typically get much response, given the sphinxlike stare of most prosecutors. It is not that prosecutors fail to notice the waterworks, explained Rita M. Glavin, a white-collar defense lawyer and former Justice Department official. But, Ms. Glavin said, there are times when a prosecutor’s blank face masks disgust for crocodile tears.“The thought going through your mind is: ‘You got to be kidding me,’ ” she said. “But you don’t show it.”Many lawyers say they would be shocked — shocked — at any suggestion of planned bawling, though some have been known to have had a “to cry or not to cry” conversation with a client.But some lawyers did concede that they were sometimes among the courtroom skeptics. Ira Lee Sorkin, best known for representing Bernard L. Madoff (who, Mr. Sorkin said, did not cry in court), mentioned that it can be uncomfortable to sit next to a client who is a crier. “In some cases,” he said, “your concern is whether he’s faking it.”Several lawyers expressed disgust at the notion of strategic crying. Thomas C. Green, who has represented members of Congress and other officials in unfortunate circumstances, said such a strategy to win sympathy would lack finesse.“There’s a more elegant way than sobbing in the courtroom,” Mr. Green said.Alan Vinegrad, a former United States attorney in Brooklyn who is now a defense lawyer, agreed. “Look,” he said, “the bottom line is it has to be genuine. If there’s any hint it’s anything other than completely genuine, it’s probably going to backfire.”But whatever the courtroom vantage point on a crying jag, there was general agreement in interviews this week that sitting through one is a moment when no one is sure what to do.In 2000, Dana C. Giacchetto, who had been described as a money manager to stars like Leonardo DiCaprio and Courteney Cox, staged a marathon weep-in when he pleaded guilty in federal court in Manhattan to a $9 million fraud. His lawyer, Mr. Fischetti, remembered this week that he let it go on and on, through choked-out poetry, historical allegories and bouts of tears punctuated by Mr. Giacchetto’s heaving efforts to regain his composure.Next to Mr. Fischetti at the defense table was his paralegal, Phyllis Malgieri, now a law partner. Mr. Giacchetto’s sob after sob, she said, “was like a Shakespearean play,” riveting like a car crash. Being so close, she said, only amplified the awkwardness.“I just sat there with my arms folded in front of me, saying, ‘Oh my God, what is he doing?’ ” she said. “It was so far-fetched to me.”Eventually, Mr. Fischetti brought the crying to a close. “Dana, sit down,” he said. Mr. Giacchetto was sentenced to more than four years in prison.Some lawyers say judges are not entirely immune to the theater. One lawyer, Ephraim Savitt, remembered a proceeding before a federal judge in Brooklyn, David G. Trager, who died this year.Mr. Savitt represented an imprisoned member of the Russian mob, a hardened narcotics trafficker who was asking for early release from prison because he had cooperated with the authorities. After the legal back-and-forth, the client was confused. He asked Mr. Savitt what had just happened.“I said, ‘Joe, you’re a free man,’ and this big, tough guy just burst out in tears,” Mr. Savitt said. Judge Trager, he added, “looked a little like he was tearing up himself.”'"

"'11-12-23,'1','To Tahesha Calder, her bond with her young son was slipping away. It seemed as if whenever she had a chance to see him, he was asleep.“I would bring him to the day care sleeping and pick him up at my mother’s house sleeping,” Ms. Calder said. “It used to bother me so much.”It was three years ago, and Ms. Calder and her son, Orion Bakare, were living in an apartment in the Williamsbridge section of the Bronx. She was employed as a caseworker for mentally ill and homeless patients at the Interfaith Medical Center in Brooklyn. Though the work was satisfying, she said, the long commute from her apartment meant she had little time to spend with Orion, now 4.Struggling to balance motherhood and work, Ms. Calder decided to make a change. Confident she would be able to find similar work closer to home, she left her job of four years in 2008. She was blindsided when the bottom fell out of the economy.Ms. Calder, 31, said that the downturn had caused many programs in her field to lose financing, and that jobs became impossible to get. Her savings quickly dried up. She had been raising Orion with only minimal support from his father, she said, and could no longer afford her son’s day care or the rent for their one-bedroom apartment. She moved in with her mother, nearby.“You’re living on your own and you move back into your mother’s — it was a drastic change,” Ms. Calder said.For a year, she and Orion made do, until the crowded conditions in the three-bedroom apartment — her younger brother and younger sister also lived there — put a strain on her relationship with her mother.“I have a great relationship with my mother from a distance, but we can’t be in the same house,” Ms. Calder said. “My son needs his own space. I need my own space.”With no other options, Ms. Calder said, she and Orion entered New York City’s shelter system. She recalled that at the Prevention Assistance and Temporary Housing Intake Center in the Bronx, where she awaited placement, she saw a woman wailing as workers from the city’s Administration for Children Services took away her children. Ms. Calder said the experience terrified her.She and her son were sent to a shelter in Manhattan that was teeming with rats, which stole their food, Ms. Calder said. But after three weeks, she said, the Department of Homeless Services determined they were ineligible to remain in the shelter and suggested they live with Ms. Calder’s mother. Not wanting to return to her mother’s apartment, Ms. Calder found her way to an abandoned building in the Bronx, where she and Orion lived as squatters for a few days. That was a low point, she said.Another occurred when she returned to her mother’s home to pick up some of Orion’s things and she, her mother and her younger sister had a terrible fight, Ms. Calder said.Ms. Calder received an order of protection against her mother and sister and was allowed to re-enter the city’s shelter system. She and Orion were placed at Concourse House in the Bronx, where they have now lived for over a year.“When I came here, I started to cry,” Ms. Calder said. “It was like I was in the Taj Mahal compared to where I was before. Then Orion said, ‘Mommy, is this our home now?’ That almost killed me.”Orion, standing recently between the twin beds that take up most of the room he shares with his mother in the shelter, has one wish: “I want to move into a pretty house.”She has her mind set on getting them out, improving her résumé and completing the training to obtain certification in alcoholism and substance-abuse counseling. She also pursued an internship as a counselor, but could not afford the clothing required. Her only monthly income is $264 a month in public assistance and $279 in food stamps.In May, she turned to the City Bar Justice Center’s Legal Clinic for the Homeless, an affiliate of the Children’s Aid Society, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and received $200 from the fund to buy clothes.Ms. Calder has renewed her job search. She said she sent out more than 30 résumés in the past few months.“The economy is hard,” she said. “I need to do more networking. I know I’m capable of doing the job. I know I can convince a person to stop using; I’m pretty persuasive.”Ms. Calder and her mother have reconciled, and Orion is attending preschool. His teachers have told Ms. Calder he is academically advanced, she said.“I’m pretty proud of him,” she said.She prays that their hard work will pay off.“When your kid wants something and you can’t get it for them,” she said, “that is the most heartbreaking thing in the world.”'"
"'11-12-23,'1','The political crisis, which has elevated a broad debate over whether Mr. Maliki has become autocratic, began when several of Mr. Hashimi’s security guards were detained and accused of involvement in bombings and other terrorist attacks. Videotaped confessions were then broadcast on Iraqi television, followed by the issuing of a warrant for Mr. Hashimi’s arrest. By then, he was in Kurdistan.In a nearly 40-minute interview, Mr. Hashimi said that he had not talked with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is overseeing the administration’s relations with the Iraqi government. Ambassador James F. Jeffrey had called him, said Mr. Hashimi, who added that he had “no clue” about the results of recent talks between American officials and Mr. Maliki.Mr. Hashimi said that the Obama administration needed to take care in supplying arms and training to Iraq’s security forces that its efforts do not inadvertently enhance Mr. Maliki’s ability to suppress his opponents.There have been repeated reports that the prime minister has placed political loyalists in the intelligence services and the military. Mr. Hashimi said that the United States needed to help ensure that Iraq’s officer corps was professional and not seeded with sectarian partisans.“It will be risky, in fact, to sell high quality and technology armaments because at the end of the day, these armaments will be used as Saddam Hussein has used high-technology weaponry,” he said.“We have to ensure that our army is professional, patriotic and nonsectarian,” he added. “When we are sure about that definitely we should go ahead with supplying weaponry and supplying advanced training programs.”Discussing the accusations against him, Mr. Hashimi said that Mr. Maliki presented a folder three years ago to Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, with much of the supposed evidence against him. He said it had been deemed to include “stories without any physical evidence.”“Why now?” he said, referring to the arrest warrant. “Because the Americans are leaving the country and he is trying in fact to get rid of his political rivals. Simple as that.”Obama administration officials have been trying for a long time to encourage Mr. Maliki to preside over an inclusive government that gives adequate representation and authority to Sunnis and Kurds. But the administration was also unable to foster an arrangement in which Mr. Maliki shared power for military and security policy with Ayad Allawi, the leader of the Iraqiya Party, a largely Sunni bloc of lawmakers that includes Mr. Hashimi.According to Mr. Hashimi, a “serious and tangible remedy” would be to replace Mr. Maliki. The potential successors he mentioned included Ibrahim Jaafari, Iraq’s prime minister in 2005 and 2006. He left the post under pressure from Bush administration officials who viewed him as a poor manager and too sectarian.Mr. Hashimi also mentioned Adel Abdul Mahdi, a former vice president, as a possible successor. Mr. Abdul Mahdi has long been a favorite of some American officials, but he is generally thought to be too independent to garner much support from the Iranians, who have influence over the Shiite coalition. Mr. Hashimi also cited Ahmad Chalabi, who encouraged the United States to oust Mr. Hussein; Mr. Chalabi is close to Iran and regarded with deep suspicion by American officials.“We will live with any other nominees,” Mr. Hashimi said.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','Known as Man-Portable Air Defense Systems, or Manpads, the missiles are a class of weapon that includes the well-known Stinger. The version loose in large quantities in Libya, the SA-7, is an earlier Eastern bloc generation.Assistant Secretary of State Andrew J. Shapiro raised the American desire to arrange a purchase program in a meeting this month with Libya’s new defense minister, according to American officials familiar with the proposal.The United States has committed $40 million to secure Libya’s arms stockpiles, much of it to prevent the spread of Manpads. No budget has been designed for a purchase program, and the price to be paid for each missile and its components has not been determined, the official said.If Libya agrees to a program, prices will probably be set by Libyan officials after testing the market, he added.The official, along with others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because the program, if approved, would be classified.Although such efforts are often called “buyback” programs, in this case even the label raises sensitivities, officials said.After providing Stinger missiles to Afghan forces fighting the Soviets in the 1980s, the United States organized a buyback program, trying to reduce the chance that the missiles would be used against international civilian air traffic or Western military planes.In Libya, the program would not technically be a buyback, as these weapons were not provided by the West, American officials said. They were purchased from Eastern bloc suppliers during Colonel Qaddafi’s long period of arms acquisition.Matthew H. Schroeder, a researcher who covers proliferation of Manpads at the Federation of American Scientists, said that such purchase programs had taken missiles out of circulation in and .“These programs have netted Manpads in the past, in at least quantities in the low hundreds,” he said. He emphasized that he did not know any details of the American plans for Libya, and that he could not comment on them.The American government has estimated that Libya’s military imported 20,000 of the missiles during Colonel Qaddafi’s reign; the number now missing is a fraction of that. Precise estimates are impossible, officials say, because no one is sure how many the military still possessed at the outset of the uprising or later after months of fighting.Some of the missiles were fired in training and in war. Others were disassembled by rebels, who used their tubes as makeshift launchers for other looted ordnance. Many of the missing missiles were looted, either by rebels or would-be profiteers. Many more were destroyed in bunkers that were hit in airstrikes.Since the war’s end, the State Department has paid for teams of private security contractors who have been canvassing the country, examining former government arms depots and meeting with anti-Qaddafi militia commanders to try to account for and secure the remaining stock.The United States has also sent teams to the countries bordering Libya to encourage increased inspections and vigilance for missile trafficking.So far, the survey teams have accounted for about 5,000 missiles, the State Department said, including those destroyed or fired, held by militia groups or disabled by the teams.Officials caution that given the large number of missiles presumed missing, and the limited ability of Libya’s interim authorities to police their borders or to control the militias, not all the missiles will be accounted for or secured.The goal, they said, is to reduce the chances of large numbers turning up on the black market by finding and collecting as many missiles as they can, and ensure that as many others as possible are stored safely.“We’re buying down risk,” Mr. Shapiro said in an interview last month, before the discussions for a purchase program began. During that interview, he explicitly refused to comment on any efforts to purchase the missiles. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment again this week.Many factors have made precise accounting difficult, including the poor record-keeping of the Qaddafi military. The survey teams have not found detailed ledgers of inventory, or how many were issued to units or fired in training, where the missiles were kept or even whether the stock was rotated and inspected.“We have found no databases, nothing,” said Nicholas A. Spignesi, a State Department official who supervised the effort in Libya in November.The decision to seek Libya’s agreement for a missile-purchase program is a recognition that the efforts so far have had their limits.As part of the assessment of problems in recent months, survey teams have found that significant quantities of the missiles are in the hands of the hundreds of armed militias in Libya. But the militias have shown little interest in turning the weapons in, participants said.An official familiar with the proposal said that putting money or other forms of aid on the table in exchange for the missiles might create incentives for the militias.The official said that the Libyan government could offer cash for missiles and missile components, or “in-kind support,” like jobs or other equipment for fighters looking to return to civilian life.Although there have been news media reports of the more modern Russian SA-24 Manpads in Libya, there is no evidence yet to support the claims, American officials said. The SA-24s purchased by Libya were part of a vehicle-mounted system, the evidence suggests, and were not configured for shoulder firing. No SA-24 grip or paperwork for grip stocks have been found.Several people involved in the effort said there had been an internal debate about the merits of a purchase program, which could lead to many missiles’ being turned in, but may also make some groups hold out for higher prices.“It is a delicate balance on when you do it and when you don’t do it,” one official said.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','Toys “R” Us announced on Thursday new deals on dozens of items for Friday and Saturday, including ‘buy one, get one half off” on popular toys like Legos. A sampling of other promotions: Up to 70 percent off toys at Amazon; up to 50 percent off gifts at Restoration Hardware; 40 percent off almost everything at American Eagle Outfitters, Talbots, Limited and Wet Seal; and 30 percent off everything at J. Crew.“There’s been kind of a waiting game with retailers,” Gerald L. Storch, the chief executive of Toys “R” Us, told CNBC last week. “And it looks like the consumer wins.”Paul Lejuez, an analyst at Nomura Equity Research, surveyed mall deals over the weekend and said he was concerned. “It looks like 40 percent is the new level you have to be at, 40 percent off, to drive traffic. Those that weren’t at that level weren’t getting their fair share,” he said.Going into the holiday season, inventories had grown more than three times as fast as sales at several retailers, including American Eagle Outfitters, Aéropostale, Gap Inc., Urban Outfitters, Chico’s and Talbots. “If inventory is growing ahead of sales growth, there is a need to be more promotional to move the goods,” Mr. Lejuez said.Although sales over Thanksgiving weekend were surprisingly strong, Mr. Lejuez said they seemed to have cut into shopping that more typically would occur in December. Sales were sluggish the first two weeks after Thanksgiving, though they improved in the third week, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers.In e-mail inboxes, the promotional cadence is rapid. Retailers sent about 5.6 e-mails each last week on average, according to the e-mail marketer Responsys. That was a 26 percent increase over the same week last year, and matched the record high hit during the week of Cyber Monday this year.Stores including Macy’s and Toys “R” Us are offering 24-hour shopping in the days before Christmas, and many stores moved “Super Saturday,” a promotion that falls on the final Saturday before Christmas, back a week hoping to spur sales.The deals are a boon for people who have put off shopping.“Last-minute Christmas shopping,” posted a Twitter user named Samra Tekeste. “Literally everything is on sale, LOL. Knew my procrastination would come in handy some day.” Another Twitter user with the handle BossNugget suggested that the King of Prussia mall near Philadelphia hang up a sign saying “It’s Almost Christmas, and Everything Is on Sale.”The big discounts mean that retailers are willing to sacrifice profits for revenue.“More and more each year, sales become less of the issue, and it’s more about what retailers have to do to get those,” Mr. Lejuez said. “There’s a little more pressure on that out-the-door price than we would have thought, and, I think, what the market would have anticipated.”And, after Christmas, the value of most merchandise slides.“The inventory is worth so much less in two weeks,” said the chief executive of a retailer, who asked not to be named because he did not want to reveal his store’s strategy. “With that kind of inventory, you’ve got to get rid of it. Whatever the margin is today, it’s that much lower next week and the week after when traffic stops.”'"

"'11-12-23,'1','As Gov. Rick Perry pushes his job creation initiatives on the presidential campaign trail, he often touts the Texas Enterprise Fund, an economic development program that the governor’s office says is bringing 59,000 jobs and $14.7 billion in capital investment to Texas.But the number of jobs his office credits the program with creating has been scrutinized by Mr. Perry’s opponents, who say the fund’s contributions to the Texas economy have been far overstated. And a national nonprofit has said the Enterprise Fund lacks the accountability measures to ensure it is creating quality jobs.Mr. Perry helped create the program in 2003 with the goal of luring new companies to Texas by providing grants. Companies undergo an 11-step “due diligence” process before a contract is signed, and the governor, lieutenant governor and speaker of the Texas House must all approve, said Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry.The contracts require companies to meet job-creation milestones each year and maintain those jobs for an extended period of time. The governor’s office said companies that are subsidized through the fund created or maintained a combined 33,460 new jobs in 2010. Although 28 of the companies failed to meet their job targets, and at least four of those contracts were terminated, 25 reported a job surplus, which led to a total of 9,795 more jobs than the contracts required.But Craig McDonald, the executive director of Texans for Public Justice, which tracks money and political influence in Texas politics, said the job growth cited by the governor’s office is misleading. A report released by Mr. McDonald’s group last month said that amendments to recipients’ state contracts, lowering targets or postponing deadlines, “undercut the job promises.”'"
"'11-12-23,'1','In the collection’s Americana contingent, a matchbook promotes lakefront “restricted camps” that excluded Jews. A Life magazine illustration by the cartoonist Harrison Cady shows tiny Jews tying up a Gulliver representing New York society, with ribbons labeled “real estate,” “jewelry” and “haberdashery.”Peter Ehrenthal and his son Michael, a co-owner of the gallery, have not decided what to do with the collection after the Israel exhibition, but hope to find a museum willing to keep it together. They have a few objects on view at the gallery: a German tankard depicts soldiers banishing Jews to Palestine, and in a bronze relief a Jew begs for mercy at a customs post.During previews at the Wolfson Museum, older visitors have come away shaken, said the curator, Nurit Sirkis Bank. “They are offended, they have tears in their eyes,” she said. “But they say it is so important to exhibit this material.”J. Clarence Davies, a prominent real-estate broker who marketed the Bronx’s early subdivisions, tried to make sure that no one forgot the architecture that had come before. “Every time he has heard of plans to tear down some old building, he has sent photographers to get pictures of the old and the new,” a newspaper reported in 1929.Between the 1890s and 1930s, he acquired 16,000 images of the city dating to the 1650s. (The oldest image is from a Dutch book with a print showing American Indians paddling past the New Amsterdam fort.) Mr. Davies seems to have sought press coverage for his purchases: in 1913, a newspaper reported, he paid $1,800 for the Dutch volume.In the 1920s he planned to create a museum for his collection, then decided to give it all to the Museum of the City of New York, which was then still under construction. Eight decades later the institution is still sorting through his donations.The museum has received substantial public and private grants to keep the Davies material accessible. This year the National Endowment for the Humanities gave $222,370 for conservation, digitization and indexing projects. The museum’s new show, “The Greatest Grid: The Master Plan of Manhattan, 1811-2011,” contains a dozen Davies documents, including 19th-century maps of new streets and advertisements for rectangular plots with and without existing buildings.A newly restored 1885 canvas shows a nostalgic panorama of what blocks around Broadway and Bowery looked like in the 1820s, with horse-drawn carriages rolling past front porches on gabled houses. The museum also owns personal memorabilia from Mr. Davies. The 1913 inventory of his collection runs to 375 pages, and he packed scrapbooks with prints and photos organized block by block. There is unfilled space between images of taverns and farms and their skyscraper replacements because he had prepared to keep collecting.“He left room on the pages, in case he got more,” said Lacy Schutz, the museum’s director of collections access.City-states in ancient Greece all ran their own coin mints, where metalworkers engraved dies to stamp reliefs on gold and silver. The designs ranged from crude X’s to portraits of rulers, animals and goddesses that are detailed down to individual feathers and chandelier earrings.Minute scrollwork was molded around the edges, to make the contours hard to copy. “Even then they had to come up with a counterfeiting-detecting method,” said Paul Inho Song, director of coins and medals at the Bonhams auction house.Bonhams and the British coin auction house A. H. Baldwin & Sons are each holding early-January sales in New York that feature ancient Greek coin collections, covering five centuries B.C. and territories scattered from modern-day Libya to Pakistan.For the Baldwin sale, on Jan. 4, estimates for the 642 lots range from $250 for a silver coin embossed with helmeted goddesses to $650,000 for a gold coin marked with a bearded satyr and a horned griffin. Baldwin is not identifying the seller of what the company is calling the Prospero Collection. It did disclose that the coins had spent decades in storage.On Jan. 6 Bonhams will offer 107 lots from a Texas couple who collected avidly during the last decade. Estimates range from $70 for a half-inch-wide silver speck stamped with a gorgon face to $125,000 for one of a handful of surviving gold coins that depict Alexander the Great’s illegitimate son Heracles wearing a lion-skin cape. (Another version made from similar dies is estimated at $50,000 in the Baldwin sale.)The market has been healthy lately, with buyers emerging in Asia, Mr. Song said. Rarity is a significant factor, and ongoing archaeological digs can sometimes drastically increase the known numbers of a particular coin. “There’s always a chance that they’ll find another hoard, which generally tends to depress the prices,” he said.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','Cameron Crowe may be the last of the Hollywood romantics. He’s best known for his stories about love and longing, for films that immortalize the moment when characters bare their hearts, as when John Cusack serenades a girl with a boom box in “Say Anything” and Renée Zellweger tells Tom Cruise he had her at hello in “Jerry Maguire.” These are images of such excruciating sincerity that they invite, almost demand cynicism. Yet it’s their openness that makes them work. And while his films depend on the familiar image of the couple in love, these are relationships that exist within a larger tribe, a band, a family and now, with “We Bought a Zoo,” a menagerie.What Mr. Crowe’s films also share is his delicate touch with actors. Ms. Zellweger has never been better than in “Jerry Maguire,” which found both Mr. Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. at their most appealing. Matt Damon, the star of “We Bought a Zoo,” is a stronger actor than those with whom Mr. Crowe often works, and the combination might initially seem off. Mr. Crowe leans toward lightness while Mr. Damon, who can do glib as well as the next star, likes to roam around in the shadows, so that even his comedies carry a sting (as with “The Informant!”). But this seriousness, which complicates his boyishness with pathos, gives ballast to a movie that might have drifted along on charm.When “We Bought a Zoo” opens, his character, Benjamin Mee, is struggling to hold on to his family and his Los Angeles journalism career after the recent death of his wife, Katherine (Stephanie Szostak). Benjamin has yet to get a grip on being a single parent to 14-year-old Dylan (Colin Ford) and 7-year-old Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones, a natural), but he seems strangely at ease, whether he’s fumbling with school lunches or warding off predatory moms bearing trays of condolence lasagna. He’s so self-assured that when his editor doesn’t respond to his story pitches, Benjamin just up and quits with a smile.The confidence with which Benjamin breezes out the door (in a job-shedding profession like journalism, no less) immediately signals that you’re not in Kansas anymore, or anywhere resembling the real world. He rationalizes that it’s for the good of his children, who are the same two reasons most people would cling to their jobs.In classic movie logic, he doesn’t agonize about how he’ll keep his children housed, fed and clothed; he doesn’t even scramble for new work. Instead, he sells their home and buys a picturesquely dilapidated house with mountain views that not only comes with a lion, tigers and bears, but also a lovely zookeeper, Kelly Foster (an appealing Scarlett Johansson). The zoo, to judge by the shy glances, is more of an ark.There are complications, though this being a Cameron Crowe movie they’re soon worked out. The zoo, having fallen into disrepair, has been closed and is being kept going by the sheer good will of employees like Kelly. Benjamin starts writing checks and, with the help of the staff (the cast includes Patrick Fugit and Angus Macfadyen), the zoo squeaks and roars back into shape. The enclosures are repaired and expanded, the bills and employees paid. Little Rosie takes to her new home swimmingly even as Dylan sulks and stomps about, initially unreceptive to Kelly’s attentive cousin, Lily (Elle Fanning). Benjamin, meanwhile, continues to keep it together, his facade of confidence occasionally dinged by a bit of slapstick, child trouble and some palpably anguished nights.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','KABUL, Afghanistan — There have been few causes that Ahmad Nader Nadery, the prominent Afghan human rights activist, shied away from over the past decade: he spoke out on the killings of civilians by NATO and Taliban forces, on election fraud by President Hamid Karzai’s supporters, even on land grabs by rich and well-connected Afghans whose houses now dominate central Kabul’s broken streets.But this week, Mr. Karzai and his closest aides seemed to have had enough of Mr. Nadery. He was effectively forced out of the leadership of a national human rights commission, according to Afghan rights activists and Western officials. The decision appeared final, although there remained a slight chance it could be reversed, they said.Mr. Nadery, 36, has long been an irritant to Afghanistan’s elite. But the final straw for the Karzai administration appeared to be a report that he has championed, which exhaustively details atrocities committed here over three decades of war, the officials and activists said. The officials asked not to be identified because they are lobbying the Karzai administration to be more open about its decision — and to reconsider it. The activists also said they were worried that speaking out publicly could jeopardize their safety.Mr. Nadery’s ouster from the C, which is appointed by the government but acts independently, raised fresh questions about the Karzai administration’s commitment to human rights, which have been a major focus of the international effort here for the past decade. In that time, a small but vocal community of activists has grown up, and Mr. Nadery was at their forefront.Lately, though, the activists have found themselves under increasing pressure on two flanks. On one side is a government dominated by former warlords whom Mr. Karzai cannot afford to alienate; on the other, the Taliban and their allies, with their own checkered history on human rights. As the United States starts to cut back its forces and financing and pushes the government to negotiate with the Taliban, hard-won rights for women and minorities face an uncertain future.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','CAIRO — The prime minister named by Egypt’s military rulers complained in a news conference on Thursday that other civilian political leaders had shunned him as though he were the agent of a foreign “occupation.”“Some of the senior colleagues in politics whom I completely respect, it has come to the point that when they ask to sit with the prime minister of Egypt, they ask to do it outside of the official building as if they’re meeting the high commissioner of the occupation,” Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri said in a news conference, pleading for peace in the streets in order to stanch the economic damage to the Egyptian economy.Mr. Ganzouri was responding to the nearly two months of protests against military rule that were interrupted by about three weeks of peace as Egyptians voted in the early rounds of the first parliamentary elections since the ouster of Hosni Mubarak. After the military laid out a plan to hold on to significant power long after the election of a new Parliament, a new protest movement modeled on the one that brought down Mr. Mubarak has sprung up around Tahrir Square to demand a swift handover of power. And the Egyptian political elite — liberal and Islamist — has lined up squarely behind the protesters’ demands.The military, however, has responded with a brutal crackdown, reinforcing fears that they aim to keep power. Over the last week, the military police and security forces have beaten or wounded hundreds of demonstrators, humiliated women by ripping off their clothes, attacked doctors in field clinics, and killed at least 17 people. Most died of gunshot wounds. Their deaths follow the loss of at least 42 lives last month in prolonged street fighting with protesters.Mr. Ganzouri’s news conference appeared to be part of an escalating propaganda war over the violence. Some activists believe that the public has grown increasingly impatient with them, in part because many Egyptians remain unaware of the scale of the crackdown and in part because they long for stability. Mr. Ganzouri said he regretted any loss of life, but he placed blame for the clashes exclusively on the protesters, who he said had danced as they set a historic archive on fire.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 5/32, to 100 14/32. The yield fell to 1.95 percent, from 1.97 percent late Wednesday.Cyclicals, which have come under pressure recently from uncertainties over global growth, were the day’s top gainers, with financials gaining 2.1 percent, followed by energy up 1.1 percent and materials, up 0.9 percent.Banks were among the top performers in European and American equity markets. Traders said the European Central Bank’s cheap loans to lenders would help ease their funding strains.Analysts said the European Central Bank’s first-ever tender of ultra-cheap three-year loans Wednesday was not giving much support to the euro. Doubts remained over how much of the funds will be lent to help the ailing euro zone economy or used to buy sovereign debt of struggling economies as banks deleverage and cut back exposure to government bonds.“European leaders are not fixing the crisis and they are not doing the things necessary to fix it,” said Paul Dietrich, chief executive and co-chief investment officer at Foxhall Capital Management in Orange, Conn. “They talk, but they’re not backing up the talk with anything like what we did in the United States. And it’s not the sovereigns that is causing this crisis, but the banks themselves.”The euro edged up less than 0.1 percent to $1.3051, off the session peak of $1.3119, according to Reuters data. It remains within a cent of a one-month low hit last week.Investors warned that a year-end rally would not necessarily translate into elevated expectations for 2012 because many of the issues that hit the market this year, like slow growth and Europe’s debt crisis, remained unresolved.“Next year will be a tug of war between better economic data here and the prospects for emerging market growth to pick up on one hand, with the European debt crisis on the other side of the rope,” Mr. McDonald said.The CBOE Volatility index, a gauge of investor fear, fell 1.26 percent and is down about 13 percent so far this week, putting it on track for four weeks of declines.Lower volume ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s Day holidays has left the market susceptible to heightened volatility this week.Micron Technology jumped 15.7 percent to $6.41 as investors looked past limp quarterly results announced late Wednesday and focused on a potential 2012 rebound in long-stagnant memory chip demand and prices.Tibco Software, the business software maker, climbed 8 percent to $23.76 after it forecast first-quarter revenue above estimates and said fourth-quarter profit and revenue soared.American Greetings slumped 21.1 percent to $13.39 after third-quarter profit dropped nearly 40 percent and it warned of higher expenses in 2012.'"
"'11-12-23,'1','“Some people are saying these proposals emerged under pressure of Bolotnaya, but this is not so,” said Mr. Naryshkin, who until recently was Mr. Medvedev’s chief of staff. “I can say that these ideas were being prepared back in the summer and were actively discussed at the level of the president and the prime minister.”The changes Mr. Medvedev outlined on Thursday have been sought for many years by the capital’s liberal establishment. They would roll back steps Mr. Putin took a decade ago, when he began gutting the institutions that served as a counterweight to the presidency.He put the country’s three influential television networks under state control, in two cases by driving their billionaire owners out of the country and opening criminal cases against them. He strengthened his control over Russia’s vast territory by eliminating the election of governors in favor of direct appointments, ensuring the loyalty of regional kingpins. He raised the threshold for political parties to get into Parliament, guaranteeing a small and docile spectrum of public politicians.Mr. Medvedev said his proposals were inspired by popular discontent with the political system. “I’d like to say that I hear all those who are speaking about the necessity of change,” Mr. Medvedev said. “I understand them. All active citizens must be given every legal opportunity to participate in political life.”He did not, however, address recent accusations of fraud in the December parliamentary elections, which have built rapidly into a challenge to the legitimacy of the entire government. And he reiterated Mr. Putin’s suggestion that the protests were being instigated by enemies of Russia, both foreign and domestic.“The right of people to express themselves through all legal avenues is guaranteed,” Mr. Medvedev said. “But attempts to manipulate citizens of Russia, to deceive them, to inflame social tensions is unacceptable. We will not allow provocateurs and extremists to drag society into its adventures. And we will not permit interference in our affairs by outside forces.”Even if they are put in place, the changes come too late to apply to the two momentous election cycles — December’s parliamentary elections and March’s presidential contest — that determine the makeup of the government for the next five years. Three veteran opposition leaders posted their own demands on the Web site of the Ekho Moskvy radio station, including delaying the presidential elections until May and allowing a large spectrum of opposition candidates to take part.Others questioned whether Mr. Medvedev had the clout to ensure that his proposals would not be shelved or diluted. His presidency has been long on liberal proclamations and short on concrete change.His promise to bring back the direct election of governors comes a few days after Mr. Putin outlined a watered-down version of the same step, in which nominees would face a popular vote only after receiving the president’s approval.Though Mr. Medvedev probably hopes to be remembered as a reformer, he has been guided throughout by his loyalty to Mr. Putin and a “character that does not permit bold steps,” said Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.“He doesn’t have the personal capacity to follow through,” Mr. Trenin said. “In that sense, people would say he is a tragic figure; other people would say he is a pitiful figure. I think he realizes he might have missed his chance as president.”The proposals provoked nervousness within United Russia, the governing party of Mr. Putin, for which public support has dropped sharply in recent months.Andrei Vorobyov, vice speaker of the lower house of Parliament, said Mr. Medvedev’s plan to streamline the introduction of new political parties would risk the hasty creation of parties by oligarchs to seize power. He suggested that new parties be required to “earn their reputation,” perhaps by barring them from elections unless they had existed for three years.Mr. Pozner, the television host, said even government critics should acknowledge that the proposals would be positive.He recalled a private meeting seven years ago during which he argued with Mr. Putin for the creation of a public television station like the British Broadcasting Corporation. He said Mr. Putin doubted that a government-financed station could maintain editorial independence.“He said, ‘Well, you’re a very nice man, but you’re very naïve,’ and that was the end of it,” Mr. Pozner said. He said the idea had never even been raised before the parliamentary assembly until Thursday, and reflected the state of mind of leaders who were, above all, pragmatists.“The situation has changed very rapidly — I would even say radically — over a very short period of time, I would say beginning on Sept. 24,” when Mr. Putin revealed plans to regain the presidency, Mr. Pozner said. “I think these proposals reflect the changes that, in their minds, are necessary for them to stay in power.”'"

"'11-12-24,'0','One version of the money looks like a real dollar bill, but its (obviously fake) denomination is three dollars, it carries a rainbow flag, and it bears the words, in small print: “When the Salvation Army ends its policy of religious bigotry and discrimination against gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people, then, and only then, will this be a real dollar bill.”Greg Henchar, a Floridian who with his partner runs Rainbow411.com, a gay-friendly business directory, says he created the $3 bill a year ago. The blogger John Aravosis has published on his Web site a similar piece of red-kettle literature — he does not know who created it — that says “Voucher” across the top and begins, “This holiday season I am supporting organizations that do not discriminate in any way.” And about a dozen YouTube videos promote a Salvation Army boycott; the most popular, posted over a year ago, has been watched over 100,000 times.The Salvation Army originated in a series of revival meetings led by the Methodist preacher William Booth in 1865, in the East End of London. Booth left the institutional church because he believed it did too little for the poor. Today, the Salvation Army operates in 122 countries, offering services including drug and alcohol rehabilitation, shelters and soup kitchens. Although Salvation Army missions lack many trappings of Christian churches — they do not offer communion, for example — they house nondenominational worship services, and their treatment programs rely on the Bible.The Salvation Army’s “Position Statement” on homosexuality, found on its Web site, reads in part: “The Salvation Army does not consider same-sex orientation blameworthy in itself. Homosexual conduct, like heterosexual conduct, requires individual responsibility and must be guided by the light of scriptural teaching. Scripture forbids sexual intimacy between members of the same sex. The Salvation Army believes, therefore, that Christians whose sexual orientation is primarily or exclusively same-sex are called upon to embrace celibacy as a way of life.”The Salvation Army’s national office does not employ registered lobbyists, but its leaders have occasionally made news by meeting with government officials. In 2001, The Washington Post obtained a Salvation Army document that said the administration of President George W. Bush had promised to honor a Salvation Army request: that religious charities receiving federal money be exempt from local gay antidiscrimination laws. The day the request became public, the Bush administration said it was being denied.And in 2004, in response to a City Council ordinance requiring that organizations with city contracts offer benefits to gay employees’ partners, the Salvation Army threatened to stop operating in New York City. In 2006, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg did not have to enforce the ordinance, which had been enacted over his veto; the Salvation Army never left New York City.George Hood, a Salvation Army spokesman, said all revenue from Salvation Army thrift stores is used locally. But he said a small percentage of money dropped into the red kettles finds its way to Washington — where it helps to pay the salaries of politically active staff members like Mr. Hood. Every local unit pays 10 percent of its revenue to a state or regional division — there are 40 divisions in the United States — and every division pays 10 percent of its revenue to one of four national territories, each of which foots a quarter of the national budget.In other words, of a dollar dropped into a red kettle in New York City, a quarter of a penny ends up at national headquarters, where conversations with the government — not lobbying, Mr. Hood says — may take place.Despite the boycott, the red kettles have had three straight record years for fund-raising, Mr. Hood says. As to the complaint of discrimination based on sexual orientation, he says it is against Salvation Army policy. “If they were legitimate clients looking for food, they should have been helped,” he says of Mr. Browning and his ex-boyfriend.In a statement sent by e-mail later, Mr. Hood adds that “gay couples are to be treated in the same way we treat heterosexual couples.”“Whether they are provided overnight lodging,” he says, “is determined solely on capacity and availability of beds.” Most beds in Salvation Army shelters are for men, but the Salvation Army has “been going through a transition of facilities over the past several years to expand bed space for women and also to isolate some private rooms for couples, whether they be homosexual or heterosexual.”'"
"'11-12-24,'0','Paul M. Smith, who argued in the Supreme Court on behalf of Mr. Lawrence, said the decision “laid the foundation for all the good things that have happened since,” including decisions from state courts endorsing same-sex marriage and the repeal of the military’s policy forbidding gay men and lesbians from serving openly.The logic of the Lawrence decision, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in dissent, supported a constitutional right to same-sex marriage.The case began on Sept. 17, 1998, when police investigating a report of a “weapons disturbance” entered Mr. Lawrence’s apartment. They said they saw Mr. Lawrence and Tyron Garner having sex and arrested them for violating a Texas law prohibiting “deviate sexual intercourse with another individual of the same sex.”The two men were held overnight and each fined $200. Texas courts rejected their constitutional challenges to the state law, relying on the Bowers decision.In a new book, “Flagrant Conduct: The Story of Lawrence v. Texas,” which will be published in March by W. W. Norton & Company, Dale Carpenter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, writes that the conventional understanding of what happened that night is flawed.In interviews for the book, police officers gave contradictory accounts of the sex act they saw. Mr. Lawrence, for his part, told Professor Carpenter that he and Mr. Garner, who died in 2006, had not had sex, then or ever, and were seated perhaps 15 feet apart when the police arrived.“If the police did not observe any sex,” Professor Carpenter wrote, “the whole case is built on law enforcement misconduct that makes it an even more egregious abuse of liberty than the Supreme Court knew.”What is clear is that the arrest infuriated Mr. Lawrence.“I don’t think he appreciated the constitutional issues,” said Mr. Katine, a Houston lawyer who represented Mr. Lawrence. “He was upset about how he was treated, physically and personally, that night. The fire stayed in him. When he was vindicated in the Supreme Court, he felt he got justice.”Suzanne B. Goldberg, who represented Mr. Lawrence as part of her work at Lambda Legal, a national gay rights advocacy group, said Mr. Lawrence “was not your typical test-case plaintiff.”“He had not been active in the gay rights movement or even out as a gay man to all of his co-workers and family,” said Professor Goldberg, who now teaches at Columbia Law School.  “Instead, this was something that happened to him.  The police came into his bedroom and put him into the middle of one of the most significant gay rights cases in our time.”John Geddes Lawrence Jr. was born on Aug. 2, 1943, in Beaumont, Tex. He served four years in the Navy and worked as a medical technician until his retirement in 2009. In addition to Mr. Garcia, he is survived by his brother, Charles W. Lawrence, and a sister, Mary Jane Rodriguez, both of Kountze, Tex.Mr. Lawrence attended the Supreme Court argument in his case, his lawyers recalled, mingling with the people who had waited in line all night to see it, alive with excitement, pride and a sense of history. “He was willing to be the real-life face of injustice,” Mr. Katine said.Mr. Lawrence reflected on his case years later in an interview with Professor Carpenter. “Why should there be a law passed that only prosecutes certain people?” he asked. “Why build a law that only says, ‘Because you’re a gay man you can’t do this. But because you’re a heterosexual, you can do the same thing’?”'"
"'11-12-24,'0','He said that he told another F.B.I. agent who had attended the un-Mirandized interrogation that he, Agent Sidaros, should not “be permitted to know any of the contents of what was discussed.”His testimony this week came in a hearing requested by lawyers for the Eritrean man, Mohamed Ibrahim Ahmed. The lawyers, Sean M. Maher and Sabrina Shroff, contend that all statements Mr. Ahmed made after being taken into custody in November 2009, including those after he was said to have waived his Miranda rights in the “clean” sessions, were not voluntary and should be ruled inadmissible.Mr. Ahmed, 37, was brought to Manhattan to face charges that include providing material support to Al Shabab, a terrorist group based in Somalia. The case highlights the Obama administration’s position that it can delay advising a terrorism suspect of his rights and seek critical information about terrorists, without sacrificing the ability to pursue a criminal prosecution.Agent Sidaros testified that such intelligence interviews were now “commonplace.”“It is typical procedure,” he said, “in cases where a suspect or a subject is arrested in a foreign country that an intelligence interview is conducted to determine whether” there is any information about terrorist threats.A key issue in the case will be the separation American officials say they tried to keep between the un-Mirandized interview, which occurred on Dec. 31, 2009, and the Mirandized sessions, which began on Jan. 5, 2010.Prosecutors have said that Agent Sidaros reviewed a summary of earlier interrogations by Nigerian officials, but they said he was told only a few details about the Dec. 31 intelligence interrogation — that it had occurred, was conducted in English and had lasted about three hours.A prosecutor, Jocelyn E. Strauber, told Judge P. Kevin Castel that Agent Sidaros, before he conducted the first Mirandized interview on Jan. 5, had met a number of times with officials who had participated in the Dec. 31 un-Mirandized interview.But the agent “deliberately avoided asking any questions or gaining any information” about the intelligence session’s content, she said.At one point, the judge questioned how the agent could have cordoned himself off from such information.“It becomes highly relevant how many times he met, and for how long, with these U.S. officials, doesn’t it?” the judge asked. “Because it becomes implausible if he had a series of four or five meetings with them, and they discussed nothing other than what was in a printed piece of paper that the Nigerians had prepared, and nothing else.”The hearing will resume next month, after which the judge is expected to rule on whether Mr. Ahmed’s statements to the authorities should be admitted.'"

"'11-12-24,'0','The small city of Central Falls, R.I., has been duly paying its general-obligation debtholders in Chapter 9 this year, bolstered by a new state law giving those investors priority over everybody else.Jefferson County, by contrast, is taking advantage of the automatic stay granted in bankruptcy, which bars creditors from demanding payments or grabbing collateral. Officials say they stopped sending cash to the county’s paying agent in November and will not send any money this month, either.Bankruptcy experts have long known that in theory a municipality could use the stay to revoke its full faith and credit pledge, but they have not watched a big distressed city or county go through with it. “You’ve got a case here where the rubber has hit the road,” said Kenneth N. Klee, a bankruptcy lawyer representing Jefferson County, whose debt grew out of poorly conceived efforts to finance a court-ordered rebuilding of its sewer system.The county’s nonpayment is not its only surprise. Like many places, it used newfangled instruments to circumvent constitutional limits on how much debt it could legally issue. In Alabama, counties are required to hold a referendum before issuing any general-obligation bonds. So Jefferson County has not issued such bonds since the 1950s. Instead, it issues warrants, which look nearly identical but do not require the referendum.Official disclosures promote the county’s warrants as “general obligations,” toward which “its full faith and credit have been irrevocably pledged.” Sounds good, but what does it really mean? Conventional wisdom has it that if a government defaults on a general obligation, its creditors can take it to court, where the judge will order it to raise taxes — as much as it takes, no matter how painful.But that now appears to be a hollow threat in Jefferson County. Counties in Alabama do not have the legal authority to raise taxes. Only the state can do that.“There’s a lot of uncertainty, generally, about what full faith and credit means,” said David A. Skeel Jr., a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. “There’s a whole debate about whether these obligations are ever enforceable. And this is even apart from the weird situation you’re referring to, where the county is pledging its full faith and credit but doesn’t really have the ability to do that.”Mr. Klee, the county’s bankruptcy lawyer, said about 40 percent of America’s counties appear to be in the same boat, issuing full faith and credit debt even though they have no legal authority to raise taxes, as the term implies.In Jefferson County, Alabama’s most populous, which includes Birmingham, officials say they had to stop paying even their general obligations because they were draining the cash they needed for essential services.“Jefferson County made a very different decision than Rhode Island did,” Mr. Klee said. “Rhode Island put bondholders ahead of its citizens, and Jefferson County is not going to do that.”He called the notion that a full faith and credit pledge was inviolate, and that a debtor must honor it even in bankruptcy, “a myth and a scare tactic.”“It’s a very reasonable step on the part of the county commissioners to conserve the money to deal with the crisis within the county,” he said, adding that he hoped that in the end the general-obligation debtholders would be paid in full, but he did not know if there was enough money. Finding out could take years.Most of Jefferson County’s $4.1 billion of debt is, in fact, the revenue type, which does not raise such profound questions because investors know that type can default.The big question is the general obligations, and the debtlike devices — warrants in Jefferson County’s case — that look like general-obligation debt but turn out to be something else upon closer inspection. The county has a smaller amount, roughly $200 million, of that type outstanding. A little more than half of it, $105 million, had a payment due in November. But that is when Jefferson County filed for bankruptcy, so it invoked the automatic stay and stopped sending the cash.So far, there has been no outcry because those payments were due to just two financial institutions, JPMorgan Chase and Bayerische Landesbank. Both have been following the events in Jefferson County closely and were not caught by surprise.But come April, another group of investors is owed a payment on a separate batch of general-obligation warrants worth about $96 million.County officials said they do not know who holds that debt, but believe some are individual investors, who could be stunned to find themselves caught short after being told they were buying the county’s best paper.That group of warrants is insured by a unit of MBIA, but it is unclear what would happen if investors filed a claim.Other insurers, with policies on the county’s revenue debt, have already sued JPMorgan, Jefferson County’s lead underwriter, accusing it of committing improprieties and failing to disclose an engineering report that said early on that the county was getting in over its head.Mr. Klee said that if investors were shocked to find their supersafe debt could stop paying, they should blame the banks and bond professionals who sold it to them without explaining what could happen in the event of a bankruptcy. He also suggested they take their complaints to the Alabama State Legislature and ask it to appropriate the money to service the debt.But that could be a lost cause in the age of “no new taxes” and Occupy Wall Street. The State Legislature is averse to backstopping Jefferson County, either as an act of fiscal irresponsibility or a backdoor bailout for the banks.“The issue of full faith and credit,” Mr. Klee said, “is whose full faith and credit?”'"

"'11-12-24,'0','It is incredibly sad that one person with his own one-man hate group can tap into anti-Muslim sentiment and lead reputable companies to make foolish judgment calls.At least two advertisers — Lowe’s, the home-improvement retailer, and Kayak.com, the online travel firm — have pulled commercials from “All-American Muslim,” a new reality series on the TLC cable channel, since the show was condemned by David Caton, an anti-Muslim and anti-gay activist, and the shell organization he founded and runs, the Florida Family Association.Businesses have a perfect right to decide how to spend their advertising dollars. But, in pulling out as they did, Lowe’s and Kayak sent a distasteful message to their customers, their employees, and to the larger public.“All-American Muslim” tracks the lives of five Muslim-American families in Dearborn, Mich., a suburb of Detroit. Mr. Caton has called on companies to end their sponsorships, arguing that the show is dangerous and misleading “propaganda” because it portrays Muslims as “ordinary folks” just like other law-abiding Americans, not as extremists and terrorists.Both Lowes and Kayak deny that they were moved to act by Mr. Caton’s campaign, citing instead the show’s controversial nature and, in Kayak’s case, reservations about its quality. “All-American Muslim” may not be the best TV show, but the controversy was manufactured by one man.

"'11-12-24,'0','“We’re seeing the results we asked for,” said Federico Ziga, president of the Ciudad Juárez restaurant association. “Not everyone agrees on the cause, but the results are there.”IN a wide-ranging interview at his office here, Chief Leyzaola said he had long aimed to destroy the “narco dream” by showing that the authorities could take away “their guns, their cars, their drugs, their money.” Like a boxer or wrestler, he treats his tough-guy image as a necessary tactic. In Tijuana, he punched a dead cartel gunman in the face as bystanders watched. There and here, he insists on calling criminals “mugrosos,” or slimeballs.“You can’t apply a strategy from a desk,” he said, sitting behind a desk with just a few papers and a fruit smoothie. “You have to apply it in the street.”Specifically, he says he has calmed Juárez by dividing the city into sectors and locking down troubled areas, starting with the central business district where La Linea was based. For months at a time, he said, he deployed the police to stop and question everyone going in and out of certain neighborhoods.Critics contend that while the effort destroyed La Linea, an especially violent gang implicated in the 2010 massacre of teenagers at a house party and the killing of a United States Consulate worker, it has also led to unjustified arrests for anyone young or poor who looks like trouble.“It’s a systemic violation of human rights,” said Gustavo de la Rosa, a Chihuahua State human rights investigator. “More than 5,000 illegal detentions were reported in the months of October and November.”Chief Leyzaola has also been accused of personally beating prison inmates with a two-by-four after a riot at the local jail in July. An American who has since been released said he saw the chief hitting inmates.More recently, two other prisoners accused the chief and seven other officers of killing a friend after the three men were arrested together in November.Though his office did not respond to requests for comment on these specific beating and homicide allegations, Chief Leyzaola has not denied using arrests and “intense, harassing patrols” to break the link between petty criminals and organized crime. Young people, he said, must understand the consequences of claiming to be a big shot.Many residents do not seem to mind. They had been complaining for years about local thugs taking advantage of anarchy and fear to extort their neighbors. Even human rights advocates like Mr. de la Rosa have acknowledged that there are “pervasive interests” determined to take down Chief Leyzaola, who survived his latest assassination attempt in June.YET, his legal problems continue to pile up. Mr. Leyzaola is now scheduled to appear before a judge to address allegations tied to his time in Tijuana. A recent report from the Human Rights Commission there argued that he and several subordinates tortured four police officers suspected of corruption in 2010. An earlier report linked him to the deaths of five people accused of killing police officers in 2009.He has denied those allegations, insisting that the claims are an effort to smear him. He also denies having anything to do with the case of four young men here in Juárez who were found dead in a tunnel a few weeks after witnesses saw them detained by the police on March 26.“I had only 10 days on the job when this started,” he said. “What did we do in this case? I was the one who insisted that those responsible are punished.”Chief Leyzaola (who failed to mention that only a few of the 15 officers accused in that case have been arrested) says he is mainly struggling with a young and ill-equipped police force. He has already fired about 200 officers, and he said more were likely to be purged. In addition to the challenge of recruiting — the department now has about 2,300 officers, he said, down from 3,000 a few years ago — he highlighted the challenge of training the ones he hires: “About 1,800 of the 2,300 officers have no more than two years of service.”Many say they are inspired by their boss. Inside the police station lobby, they point proudly to a wall of newspaper clippings on arrests. Such strong morale is certainly a rarity in many Mexican police departments. But experts say that Chief Leyzaola has yet to grasp the limits of his show-how-tough-we-are approach.“Policing is not about personalities — it’s about procedures and institutions,” said David A. Shirk, director of the Trans-Border Institute at the University of San Diego. “When Leyzaola is gone, as he inevitably will be at some point, what will be left behind? That’s the key question.”Transparent processes for investigations and promotions matter more than tough talk or even high profile arrests, experts say. And while crime is down in both Tijuana and Juárez, it is not clear how much this has to do with Chief Leyzaola. Mr. Shirk said it likely had more to do with cartel dynamics — a truce or shift in power, with one group gaining an overwhelming edge. Some Sinaloa cartel members on trial in the United States have said they tried to work with Mexican and American authorities so they could defeat La Linea.Mr. de la Rosa added that the drop in crime might also just be exhaustion. Thousands of presumed cartel hired killers have died here over the past few years.But no matter what the cause, or the fallout, Chief Leyzaola seems unlikely to play a role any different from what he knows.“I’m a soldier; I’m a nationalist,” he said, leaning forward in his chair, as if addressing a television camera. “I have one objective: to fight delinquency.”'"
"'11-12-24,'0','I appreciated Ross Douthat’s thoughtful column about the death of Christopher Hitchens, but I feel the need to clear up a common misconception about atheism, reiterated by Mr. Douthat when he writes that “rigorous atheism casts a wasting shadow over every human hope and endeavor.”One need not believe in God to believe that life has meaning. Indeed, when one considers the abundance of meaning and fulfillment to be had in art, literature, friendship, love, family, and respect and compassion for one’s fellow human beings, the whole concept of God starts to look superfluous.This, not some flailing and unnecessary defense against the seductions of religion, was the core of Mr. Hitchens’s argument all along.'"
"'11-12-24,'0','For this week’s column, I asked a group of people whose opinions have impressed me to ponder this conundrum. Next week, I will share some final thoughts and 2012 predictions from the group of five strategists and investors that I have spoken to each quarter. My hope is that in mixing theory and practice, the two columns will offer investors a better sense of both how they should and will act next year.THE ENVIRONMENT When Standard & Poor’s downgraded the credit rating of the United States in August, investors rushed to buy Treasury bonds, the very asset that had just become less creditworthy. This might seem utterly irrational, but it did not surprise Daniel Kahneman, the psychologist who won the Nobel in economic science for work that became the foundation of behavioral economics.“Treasuries just feel safe,” he said. “When you’re worried, you go to the safe thing. It’s quite a normal reaction.”I called Mr. Kahneman because I had been reading his new book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” (Farrar Strauss & Giroux) and was fascinated by his division of people’s thinking into two systems. System 1 is fast; it’s intuition. System 2 is slower and moderates System 1; it’s the ability to reason.But what do we do if our System 1 thinks everything looks bleak next year and our System 2 agrees?“My System 1 also says it is going to be a bad year,” Mr. Kahneman said.But feeling that does not equate to shunning the market. “I’m not really sure that the situation is very different from what it usually is,” he said. “The same advice about prudence that would carry you in other years would carry you in next year.”Practicing a prudent strategy is tougher than it sounds, particularly given the extremes of the last five years. To go from housing and stock markets that were always going up to a housing market that is bumping along the bottom and a stock market that goes up and down seemingly at random is tough to take.Daniel Egan, head of behavioral finance for the Americas at Barclays Wealth, said that from Jan. 1 to Aug. 1 the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index moved up or down at least 2 percent on 8 percent of trading days. From Aug. 1 to Dec. 20 that number more than tripled, with 27 percent of trading days having moves greater than 2 percent one way or the other. And 13 percent of the days in the second period had swings greater than 3 percent, compared with none in the first period.“This is the worst kind of environment to attempt market timing in,” Mr. Egan said. “Odds are, you’ll miss the rally when one or more uncertainties — euro, U.S. fiscal policy, U.S. election — resolves itself, leaving you with the volatility but not the return you’d hoped for.”SIZING THINGS UP One thing behavioral research has shown is that people who lose a lot of money in a particular asset class will often shun it or at least underweight it as an investment in the future.“Individuals who got burned by T-bills in the 1970s and were burned by inflation underweighted T-bills the rest of their lives,” Mr. Egan said. “2008 being a credit crisis, people are going to have an experiential prejudice against banks for the losses they experienced.”He added that people who believed real estate was an investment that would always go up were likely to have similar biases.Assessing these objectively will be crucial for investors who want to make reasoned decisions. Meir Statman, professor of finance at Santa Clara University, said investors needed to step back and think about how the fear of losing even more money was directing their decisions.“Fear makes us think the world is coming to an end; it makes us think that stocks will never go up and always go down,” he said. “This is where logic is going to have to intrude.”One helpful tip from Michael Mauboussin, chief investment strategist at Legg Mason Capital Management and the author of “Think Twice: Harnessing the Power of Counterintuition” (Harvard Business Press), was to assess the experts providing the advice and understand the likelihood that their predictions will be right.“In some realms, experts will predict very well,” Mr. Mauboussin said. “If you turn on the weather, you can be sure if you need an umbrella. When we’re dealing with economic, political and social areas, we cannot predict as well.”Robert Seaberg, managing director of planning services at Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, advocates that people be a bit more realistic in their thinking about investments.“The world now is more about risk management than about investing,” Mr. Seaberg said. “Forget the home runs. Guard against the really big losses, and go for singles and doubles. You win more games than you lose.”ACTION OR INACTION The collective wisdom of this group is almost entirely to take the long view and stay the course next year.“My advice to individual people is the less attention you pay to this stuff, the better you are going to be,” Mr. Mauboussin said. “You need to have a prudent strategy, a risk tolerance and a time horizon and then don’t get too caught up in it.”Of course, the long horizon sounds great if you are at the beginning of it. If you are among the baby boomers in retirement or about to be there soon you may scoff at this. But Mr. Statman, who turns 65 this year, said the last thing people of his generation needed to do was try to find a way to get their money back. They need to live with less.“The saddest stories I read about are of baby boomers trying to recover their losses by going into risky investments, and they end up in Ponzi schemes or very miserable positions,” he said.As for Mr. Kahneman, he has no plans of adjusting a strategy that has served him well. “I made one big decision, which was how much I want to have in equities and how important it was for me to be protected from inflation,” he said. “Then I leave it to other people. I don’t even want to know how things are going day to day.”If it’s good enough for a Nobel laureate, it might be good enough for you.'"

"'11-12-25,'0','GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Roughly 24 hours before tipping off the N.B.A. season at Madison Square Garden, the Knicks conducted one final practice Saturday and took stock of the team that they hope will compete for a championship.“It should be an exciting year,” Coach Mike D’Antoni said. “We’re looking forward to it. I know the players are looking forward to playing. It should be great.”D’Antoni said the Knicks would probably use the same starting lineup they did in the two-game preseason on Sunday when they face the Boston Celtics, who swept the Knicks out of the opening round of the playoffs last season in four games. They may, however, be without the backup point guard Mike Bibby.Bibby, a 13-year veteran who signed with the Knicks on Dec. 11, injured his back when he collided with the Nets’ Stephen Graham in the teams’ preseason game Wednesday. Bibby sat out practice Friday, but he participated on a limited basis Saturday. He will probably be a game-time decision.Either way, the Knicks will probably maintain the starting lineup that features Tyson Chandler at center, Amar’e Stoudemire at power forward, Carmelo Anthony at small forward, Landry Fields at shooting guard and Toney Douglas at point guard.The lockout-abbreviated training camp has added to the difficulty in preparing for the season. D’Antoni has simplified the offense and says he plans to add layers of complexity as the season progresses. On Saturday, he put the Knicks through what appeared to be a fairly thorough practice, not sparing a moment even though it was Christmas Eve.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','“We’ve been waiting for a couple years,” Mr. Medenica said in a telephone interview. “We’re thrilled that this ruling has now come down and confirmed that our legal analysis was correct all along.”As a result of the new policy, New York Lottery officials said they planned to add two additional jackpot games, Powerball and Sweet Million, to its current online lottery subscription service, and would allow New York residents to buy single-draw tickets online for the first time.Mr. Medenica said it would take several months for the lottery to finalize the new offerings, and he said officials would “take a very cautious initial approach” in rolling out additional online options.Michael Jones, the superintendent of the Illinois Lottery, said the request for clarification was prompted by research the state commissioned several years ago that indicated online sales could drive up participation. “When you look at the Internet, which is what everybody uses these days to buy everything, it seemed like a very, very logical thing to use the Internet to increase the player base,” Mr. Jones said. “States were in dire financial problems — the ability to use the lottery to raise revenue in a nontax way was a significant thing for states to do.”He also said that online sales would enable the lottery to regulate purchases. “Right now we can’t guard against someone walking into a lottery retailer and buying too many tickets and behaving excessively,” Mr. Jones said. “Now with credit card purchases, we can guard against excessive play.”Illinois could begin selling lottery tickets online in as soon as three months, he said.The District of Columbia and Nevada have both approved limited forms of Internet gambling, and New Jersey has been considering legislation allowing sports betting and other forms of Internet gambling.Steven Grossman, the Massachusetts state treasurer and the chairman of the state’s Lottery Commission, called the opinion a “turbocharged opportunity to engage new markets.”“This will put additional pressure on Congress and others to allow online poker and other Internet gambling,” Mr. Grossman said.Estimates of the size of the online gambling industry vary widely, from as low as $6 billion to as high as $100 billion. But even at the lower end, Mr. Grossman said, “that’s tens of billions of dollars that goes offshore.”In a separate request in July, Senators Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, and Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, asked the Justice Department to clarify its position on Internet gambling, seeking either to affirm that federal law prohibits gambling over the Internet or to make sure that Congress has a role in drafting any expansion of online betting.In a reply letter that was also issued Friday, the Justice Department said that while the new policy “differs from the department’s previous interpretation of the Wire Act, it reflects the department’s position in Congressional testimony at the time the Wire Act was passed in 1961.”The new policy merely reverses the Justice Department’s longstanding position that all forms of online gambling are illegal in the United States. It does not necessarily pave the way for national rules governing online gambling.But experts in gambling law said Saturday that the new policy does imply that states can band together to allow gambling across state borders. The exception would be online sports betting, which is explicitly prohibited under federal law.“The next step,” said Mark Hichar, a partner and head of the gaming law group at the law firm Edwards Wildman in Boston, “could be for states to enter into compacts with each other to have interstate Internet wagering,” as some do now for horse racing.The decision was cheered by states that have been contemplating gambling for the first time. But some gambling interest groups, like the American Gaming Association, which represents casino operators and makers of gambling equipment, said the opinion makes clear the need for a federal law establishing consistent regulatory standards.“This is quite a Christmas present,” said I. Nelson Rose, a distinguished senior professor at Whittier Law School and a consultant to gambling companies and governments. “It says, ‘Keep it in your state and it’s legal.’ Given the continuing budget crisis, and so many states looking for ways to raise money, it’s really a major decision.”Virginia A. Seitz, an assistant attorney general in the Justice Department’s office of legal counsel, wrote in the opinion that the prohibition in the Wire Act of using interstate communications for gambling applies only to betting on a “sporting event or contest.”As long as the gambling operator and the customer are within the same state, the opinion says, and the betting activity does not include sporting events, a state’s own laws apply. Another federal law, the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, made it illegal for financial institutions to process payments for online wagers.Taken together, the two laws allowed the Justice Department to invoke its authority over interstate communications as a means of blocking all Internet gambling.Online gambling has been a focus in the Justice Department for years, but it burst into public view in April, when federal prosecutors charged the operators of three of the most popular online poker sites with fraud and money laundering.The three sites, Full Tilt Poker, PokerStars and Absolute Poker, are based in Antigua and the Isle of Man, where online gambling is legal. That had made it difficult for American authorities to crack down on the operations, which had millions of United States customers.But the Justice Department charged that the companies had used United States banks to process their transactions, violating the 2006 law that governed payment processing.Those payment restrictions do not apply to transactions within a single state, however. With the ruling that the Wire Act applies only to sports betting, the way is clear for in-state online poker and other games.Some gambling experts believed that the Justice Department’s position that the Wire Act prevented any Internet gambling conflicted with a federal appeals court decision, and therefore the new opinion simply confirmed what was already law.But states have been reluctant to rely on the appeals court decision, handed down in 2002 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, because, in addition to the Justice Department’s continued crackdown, other federal and state court opinions offered conflicting directions.The Justice Department previously tried to crack down on Internet gambling by going after companies that facilitated advertising for the gambling sites. In December 2007, Microsoft, Google and Yahoo paid a combined $31.5 million to settle federal charges that they promoted illegal gambling by serving ads for the gambling operations to other Web sites.'"

He directed several productions at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, including Gounod’s “Roméo et Juliette,” with Mirella Freni and Franco Corelli, in 1967; Bellini’s “Norma,” with Joan Sutherland, in 1970; Massenet’s “Werther,” with Corelli and Mr. Deiber’s future wife, Ms. Ludwig, in 1971; and Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande,” with Judith Blegen and Barry McDaniel, in 1972.His operas were known for being not only well sung but also well acted, Fabrizio Melano, a director who assisted Mr. Deiber on “Werther” and “Pelléas,” said in an interview.“He was a wonderful actor, and he had wonderful rapport with actors,” Mr. Melano said. “He also knew music very well, so he could transfer that rapport to singers. He could not only demonstrate, but he understood what they were going through. Not every stage director can.”Mr. Deiber was born on Jan. 1, 1925, in La Broque, a village in the Alsace region of France, near the German border. His father chopped and sold wood. During World War II he was a member of the French Resistance and imprisoned briefly in Paris, Ms. Ludwig said.Mr. Deiber studied violin and voice before becoming an actor, first appearing with the Comédie-Française in a small role in “Cyrano de Bergerac” in 1942. He played Bernardo in “Hamlet” the following year and joined the company in 1944.His first two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Ludwig, whom he married in 1972, he is survived by a son, Philippe, and a granddaughter.The Met production of “Werther” was full of drama behind the scenes. Corelli, the recipient of letters threatening him physically by an irrational opera fan, according to René Segher, a biographer of his, canceled his appearance on opening night within minutes of the curtain. His replacement, Enrico Di Giuseppe, was a head shorter than Corelli, and Ms. Ludwig had to look frantically for a pair of flat shoes to change into.Still, Ms. Ludwig remembers the production for another reason entirely: it was where she met her husband.“I didn’t know the part, and it was in French, and I didn’t speak French,” she said in an interview. “And so he came to my apartment and he taught me the part in French. And so we married.”'"
"'11-12-25,'0','The manager, Glenn Stevenson, 65, looks up from his clipboard in a way that signals he has too much counting to do, and not enough time. A churchgoing man whose work attire includes a Detroit Tigers cap, he has been with Focus: HOPE for 21 years. He knew both the priest, who died in 1997 at the age of 67, and the housewife, who died at 79 in August. And, yes, he confirms, they’re here.“Their spirit will always be with us,” Mr. Stevenson says, before turning back to his tallying with the purpose of someone who feels he’s being watched.The story of Focus: HOPE is part of Detroit lore, beginning with how Father Cunningham, an English teacher, and Ms. Josaitis, a mother of five, united after the devastating race riots of 1967 to fight poverty and champion racial harmony. He gave up teaching to run a poor parish, she and her husband, Don, moved their family into the city — at a time when other white people were moving out in haste — and the two of them started to shake things up.They published a study revealing how inner-city food and drug stores charged more for goods of poorer quality. They lobbied the Department of Agriculture to share the country’s stockpiled food with the country’s very poorest. They broadened their vision to include job-training programs and contract work that filled up old manufacturing plants along Oakman Boulevard.Over the years, they became known as the saints of Detroit, which irritated them and sold them short. They were compassionate, relentless and wonderfully flawed. In other words, human.Father Cunningham once rejected a well-intentioned businessman’s offer to donate secondhand computers because, he said caustically, the people of Focus: HOPE were not second-class citizens. And Ms. Josaitis could be so hard on employees — “I know I’m riding my broom, but,” she’d say — that some of them gave her a broom equipped with a seat and a horn.The two co-founders could have booming quarrels, then abruptly switch to a pleasant discussion about where to stop for lunch. They loved each other, friends say, and knew instinctively that with his never-say-never vision and her never-say-never managerial skills, anything was possible, including the almost magical appearance of much-needed food.Focus: HOPE was in on the ground floor 40 years ago when the federal government began the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, devised to provide poor women and children with basic, nutritious food. Before long, the Detroit operation was the largest of its kind, and leading the fight to include poor people over 60, which is now this obscure federal program’s central purpose.These days, the federal program putters along, costing $177 million a year to serve parts of 39 states, two Indian tribal organizations and the District of Columbia. Focus: HOPE, meanwhile, is struggling, like the city it serves. The distressed economy has forced recalibrations and cutbacks. A few weeks ago the organization laid off dozens of employees and suspended several job-training classes.But the supplemental food program grinds on. It is the Focus: HOPE original, the constant, overseen for the last 20 years by a 57-year-old man who will lunch on McRib sandwiches five days in a row, no matter that part of his job is to promote a balanced diet. His name is Frank Kubik, and he is all Detroit.Mr. Kubik got laid off from Chrysler in 1979, then struggled for more than two years to find a job. One miserable moment sticks most in his mind: standing in a line of job seekers outside a building, being covered in snow, and seeing people inside laughing at him and his fellow unemployed.He finally took a low-paying job unloading the train cars of food for Focus: HOPE, figuring he’d stay for six months. It’s been 30 years. Thirty years of knowing that seniors prefer orange juice to tomato juice for washing down their pills; that canned tomatoes are less popular than canned beans; that a two-pound block of cheese can go a long way. Thirty years, all because of the examples set by a priest and a housewife.“They blew me away,” Mr. Kubik says, as rainwater drips from his office’s leaky ceiling and Father Cunningham watches from a Mass card taped to a bookshelf.It is a familiar refrain here, echoed by Mr. Stevenson in the warehouse, who remembers how Ms. Josaitis often teased him about his messy desk (she was teasing, wasn’t she?). By Jonetta Johnson, 50, the floor manager, who has been here ever since Father Cunningham told her, more than 30 years ago, “You need something to do.” By others. It’s Father William this and Eleanor that, still.On another biting December day, people arrive by car, bus and foot for food. They enter a storelike setting that carries an air of common dignity once insisted upon by a priest and a housewife — and, now, by a successor who has not forgotten the humiliation of standing in line for a job, covered in snow.Guiding their carts past the glittering Christmas tree, the customers make their selections down an aisle of opened boxes that overflow like cardboard cornucopias. Tomato juice. Grape juice. Canned beef chunks. Canned apricots. Spinach. Pasta. Corn. Rice. Cheese. The things that sustain us.'"

"'11-12-25,'0','Some years it would be nice if there really were a Santa Claus. Imagine it. No lists, no shopping, no gift-wrapping, no bills, no shipping costs, an extremely low carbon footprint — and on Christmas morning the miraculous appearance of presents that find just the right balance between desire and a sort of disciplinary justice.Picture a world in which what you get is what you want divided by what you deserve, and you can see the appeal of a real Santa, no matter what it would do to the gross domestic product of toy-producing and toy-consuming countries.It would be wonderful, too, to be woken in the earliest hours of the morning by the heralding of angels proclaiming peace on earth. Not just the laying down of arms and an end to war, but an end to the conditions that cause war: gross inequality, intolerance, the endless, destructive struggle over natural resources, and the ease with which we dehumanize our fellow humans. Imagine in its place good will and, more important, the deeds that create and embody good will.But no matter how we might wish for these things, they must all be done by us alone — the shopping and the pursuit of equity, the gift-wrapping and the acceptance of our shared humanity, celebrating the spirit of Christmas and ending the violence and hatred that we seem to spawn so prolifically as a species. This is a day of glad tidings, secular and sacred.The message may be divine, but the work that lies ahead, finding peace on earth and good will toward others, is wholly human, wholly our own.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','AT&T’s decision to drop its bid for T-Mobile is a victory for the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, which steadfastly opposed a deal that would have locked the wireless market into a duopoly and been bad for consumers. But the battle to defend competition in telecommunications is hardly over.As regulators moved to block the AT&T deal, Verizon Wireless was buying big chunks of spectrum from the nation’s largest cable carriers and signing agreements with them to sell each other’s services to consumers around the country.The deals could have the positive effect of putting to use spectrum that cable companies bought at auction in 2006, and encouraging Verizon to roll out new high-tech wireless services. But the potential for these agreements to curtail competition in both wireless and wireline industries is troubling, and should be examined by the Justice Department and the F.C.C.Verizon — Verizon Wireless’s main shareholder — relieved itself of the need to expand FiOS, its high-speed, fiber optic network, beyond the 18 million homes it set out to reach six years ago, a rollout that cost $23 billion. For the other 114 million homes in the country, it can simply bundle its wireless service with the cable and wireline broadband services of its partners. The agreement between Verizon and the cable carriers includes a joint venture to develop technology to integrate the wireline and wireless platforms.Verizon’s cable deals squashed hopes that cable carriers’ purchases of wireless spectrum would lead to more competition against the dominant players, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. And it puts in doubt whether FiOS will ever be a serious competitor to cable, reducing the likelihood that video transmitted over broadband could break up cable’s regional oligopolies.When Congress deregulated telecommunications 15 years ago, it was counting on a burst of competition among phone companies, cable carriers and other high-tech newcomers. Instead, we have seen a relentless push for consolidation within and across technological platforms, carving the market into national and regional oligopolies.Promoting vigorous competition may require Congress to enhance regulators’ oversight of cross-platform deals. Antitrust suits are hard to win on all but the most obviously anticompetitive mergers in which the companies are in precisely the same business. Antitrust law may not be able to prevent wireless, wireline and cable from merging into one industry. And the F.C.C. has defined broadband as mostly outside its scope, and so has limited powers to regulate that pivotal market.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','This misstep is bad news for Mr. Gingrich on several levels. Virginia is his adopted home state. Failing to gather enough signatures in one’s backyard creates an image problem, at the very least.“It’s a disaster for him,” said Larry J. Sabato, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. “This sends yet another signal to Republicans that Gingrich is not able to organize.”He added that such a lack of organization “suggests you’re not a serious candidate.”The failure to get on the ballot in Virginia could also shake the confidence of voters in states that go to the polls before Virginia does. Why, his supporters in those states might ask, should I throw my vote away on someone who might not be competing in other critical states?Also, Virginia is the country’s 12th-largest state in population. It will be offering up a trove of delegates on March 6, and now they are out of reach for Mr. Gingrich. He has been leading in the polls in Virginia, and his brand of conservatism is a natural fit for the state.This failure to qualify for the ballot comes at a bad time for Mr. Gingrich as he faces headwinds in Iowa, where the caucuses start the nominating contest on Jan. 3, and it comes as he remains behind in the polls in New Hampshire. His strength appears to be in South Carolina, but in Virginia, there will be no Southern candidate on the ballot.Both Mitt Romney and Representative Ron Paul, whose organizations have been laboring in the signature-gathering vineyards for months, were able to get on the Virginia ballot.Rival campaigns quickly seized on the setback as a sign of disorganization within the Gingrich campaign. Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney, called it “cringe-worthy.”“It’s a gut-check moment for Republicans,” Mr. Fehrnstrom said. “Winning campaigns have to be able to execute on the fundamentals. This is like watching a hitter in the World Series failing to lay down a bunt.”Still, it is hard to predict the practical effect of Mr. Gingrich’s absence from the Virginia ballot. The state is one of 10 that vote on March 6, known as Super Tuesday. Eleven states will have voted by then, including big ones like Colorado, Florida and Michigan (and not counting Missouri, where delegates are not at stake).If those earlier states have not winnowed the field, then Super Tuesday becomes all the more important. Because the Republicans will be picking most of their delegates proportionally this year, instead of winner-take-all, the candidates who are in the top tier now — Mr. Romney, Mr. Paul and Mr. Gingrich — are likely to be competing for each and every delegate in what is expected to be a protracted primary fight.Mr. Gingrich does have a safety card on Super Tuesday. Georgia, which he represented in Congress, votes that day, and if all goes well for him, he should win most of its delegates. He can only hope that they make up for a shutout in Virginia.But whether or not there is any practical effect, Mr. Gingrich immediately began suffering a psychological effect as pundits and people posting on Twitter questioned anew his ability to organize and his credibility, in light of his earlier declaration that he would make the ballot.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','He does not need money. Since entering the league as the No. 1 overall pick in the 1998 draft, Manning has signed three contracts with the Colts worth a total of $236 million and earned millions more in endorsements.He does not crave fame. Manning does not use popular social networking sites and has increasingly done his charity work behind the scenes.He does not have to build a Hall of Fame résumé. Manning already owns one Super Bowl ring more than inductees like Dan Fouts, Dan Marino and Fran Tarkenton, and Manning ranks third in career touchdown passes and passing yards.He has two other reasons to worry: he wants to stay healthy enough to play with his new twins.“Last week’s decision on my CT scan and the X-rays, the doctors’ interpretation, was a good sign for my overall health and that was important to me,” Manning said recently on CBS’s pregame show. Referring to his family, he added: “Ashley and I have new twins, have 8-month-old twins, and it’s important for me to be in good health to play with them, to roll around on the floor and have some fun, so that was encouraging to me. The football thing will answer itself in the next few months.”It is clear the Colts still want to keep their franchise quarterback, too.Indianapolis holds a $28 million option that must be paid to Manning in early March or he could become a free agent. The team could also redo the contract to make it more salary-cap friendly and perhaps keep some of Manning’s old pals around in 2012.On Thursday night, the team owner Jim Irsay said health, not money, would dictate whether Manning would still be with the Colts next season.Irsay told NFL Network that he did not see money becoming an issue. “I paid him $26 million this year, and he didn’t play,” Irsay said, adding “In terms of if he’s healthy and if he’s ready to play, I see him back with us.”Still, there are risks.Over his lifetime, Manning runs a 15 percent to 20 percent chance of injuring a disk directly above or below the two that were fused in September, Cohen said.Dr. Andrew Hecht, the director of spine surgery at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, concurs with Cohen, though he said Manning ran no greater risk of injury than any other player on the field. Hecht has not treated Manning, either, but has worked with Jets players.“There are numerous players playing in the N.F.L., Major League Baseball, the N.H.L. and professional basketball that have had successful one-level fusions in the neck,” Hecht said. “If it’s solidly fused, there’s no risk.”But finding comparisons to Manning’s case is tough. Few athletes rely so much on throwing a ball, and even fewer have performed at such a high level for more than a decade.Until this injury, it did not seem anything could slow Manning.Two years ago, he led the Colts to a 14-0 start, the second Super Bowl appearance of the Indianapolis era and collected his record fourth Most Valuable Player Award. Last season, losing teammates to injury left and right, Manning essentially willed the Colts to a seventh A.F.C. South title in eight years and one defensive stop short of advancing in the playoffs.This year, with Manning, Indianapolis was supposed to be a Super Bowl contender. Without him, it took 14 games just to get a victory, but there has been promising news in recent weeks.On Dec. 1, Manning was told the bones had healed and he could begin increasing his workout activity. Last Wednesday, 12 days after the most recent diagnosis, Manning pulled on his pads, strapped on a helmet and walked onto the practice field for a workout. He took snaps from center Jeff Saturday and threw passes to running back Joseph Addai, receiver Anthony Gonzalez and another receiver from the practice squad as Bill Polian, the team vice chairman, and Coach Jim Caldwell watched.“I’ve probably been around some competitors that are equal to him, but no one that competes more than him,” the offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen said. “He loves the competition, the preparation, everything about it.”The questions have forced the Colts to start looking for a successor to Manning, a process that has grown far more complicated.Until winning two games in five days, Indianapolis was the heavy front-runner to get the No. 1 pick in April’s draft. Most analysts expect that slot to be used on Stanford quarterback Andrew Luck.Although a loss next week at Jacksonville could still give the Colts the top overall selection, a win may move them back one or two spots, probably removing Luck from the equation.“We have had conversations, obviously, during this whole year,” Irsay said. “This is really about, is he going to be able to come back and really be the old Peyton Manning and play at a very high level.”'"
"'11-12-25,'0','Digital equipment now exists to measure riders’ progress, but the New York races use an antique set of British rollers from the 1960s, a contraption of pins and pulleys whose low-tech look and loud colors recall a Coney Island ride.Cyclists face the crowd, balancing their own fixed-gear track bikes on the rig’s four sets of thick plastic rollers. The rollers spin with the bike wheels, keeping the riders in place and driving the arrows that track their progress in time with their pedaling. Spectators watch the races — often 500- or 1,000-meter sprints that are over in less than 30 seconds — from directly in front of the bikes.“The blue roller broke a few years ago after a crash,” said David B. Perry, who runs the Bike Works shop on the Lower East Side and is the soft-spoken impresario of the New York roller scene; it took months to fix because the parts had to be specially made.“It’s an example of how old this thing is,” he said of the machine, which he bought for $7,800 at a Sotheby’s auction in 2000.This is the 10th year that Mr. Perry has rented it out for events in New York. “Those first ones were really, really rowdy,” said Andy Shen, who along with Mr. Schmaltz organized the competition in early December, a fund-raiser for the junior racing program of the Century Road Club Association. “We’ve had to tone things down because Dave was worried about people getting too close to the racers and damaging his rollers.”Even so, the races remain raucous, with spectators drinking and occasionally placing lighthearted bets on the riders. During the recent competition, Mr. Perry’s rollers were on a small stage in the back of Parkside Lounge, at Houston and Attorney Streets. He and several others stood near the racers to help them if they crashed.Beneath purple streamers and a spinning mirror ball, the vibe was more rock concert than bike race. Classic guitar riffs blared as a USA Cycling official shouted the results of each competition. (A quirk of these races is that they are officially sanctioned.)“It’s New York City’s Christmas party for cycling,” said John Eustice, a former professional rider and a promoter of the Harlem Skyscraper Cycling Classic, an outdoor race held each summer.Nearby, Mr. Landis, his hair down to his shoulders, smiled widely as he mingled. He retired after admitting to using performance-enhancing substances and accusing his former teammate Lance Armstrong of doping as well; he is now training to become a Nascar driver. But he declined to discuss his new car-racing career or his part in the Tour de France scandals.During the evening, Mr. Landis posed for photos but did not ride the rollers. “I was never very good at it,” he said. “These guys know what they’re doing.”Indeed, the final race was a nail-biter between two strong riders: Matthew Diefenbach, 47, who competed in this year’s masters track nationals, and Bobby Lea, 28, the Olympian.As the cyclists’ legs pumped with frantic speed, the machine whirred like a table saw, and the arrows — red and blue — spun snuggly together, neither rider gaining advantage on the other.A final burst sent Mr. Diefenbach crashing off his rollers just as his red arrow passed the finish. The crowd bellowed its approval, but the extra effort was not enough. Mr. Lea’s blue arrow had gotten there first.His prize: a novelty beer bottle, and bragging rights till next year.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','David Orr, in his poetry column, provides a cogent overview of the old, but always worth asking, question of whether a poem is more than what can be paraphrased (“Ways of Saying,” Dec. 11). He notes that this is not merely a two-sided argument, and shows that the debate is further complicated when a translator comes between the reader and the poet — as is the case with the Spanish poet Luis de Góngora’s long poem “The Solitudes,” translated by the masterly Edith Grossman. Just as translation of poetry is deemed by some to be impossible, using prose to explain poetry strikes many of us who are poets as foolhardy. But, ah, the nobility of the quest. I suspect Góngora and his shipwrecked young man would join me in toasting Orr: Salud y amor y tiempo para disfrutarlo. We have been fools once in our lives.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','It’s not quite a pairing to rival the spaghetti western, but it’s not far off: In Navigli, a trendy neighborhood in Milan, one of the most popular restaurants is an American-style steakhouse. With red-and-white-checkered tablecloths, walls crowded with black-and-white photos and a butcher counter up front, the five-year-old Joe Cipolla approximates a vintage meat-and-potatoes joint.The name comes from a (possibly apocryphal) gangster, an Italian-American with a passion for cooking who ran St. Louis in the 1920s, at least according to the restaurant’s telling. (The restaurant is so enamored of the mafia aesthetic that its Web site begins with an animation of mobsters in chef’s toques firing off machine guns.)But this is meat and potatoes done Italian style, so there is, of course, a selection of cheeses, salumi and bruschetti; a lengthy wine list; and a traditional Sicilian ricotta cake for dessert. The main draw, though, is beef: big, aged hunks of it are on display by the entrance, next to the grills — the chef Simone Melles’s preferred method of cooking. The menu offers a global tour: cuts from Argentina and New Zealand, and even a “USA prime choice,” all served by the gram.Despite our protestations that we’d had our fair share stateside, the waitress steered us to the American cuts, which she assured us were the restaurant’s most popular, and, weakened by her friendly demeanor, we acquiesced.Midwesterners (mob-affiliated or not) would be proud: this steak, served sizzling in a cast-iron pan, was perfectly cooked — tender and juicy (not that easy to find in Europe, according to the transplanted Midwesterner in our group). A side of fries cut thin was perfectly salted; an order of mixed vegetables — fennel, radicchio, peppers, grilled with a brush of olive oil — was delectable. The portions were not Peter Luger-size, but they were large enough that no one would yearn for a helping of pasta; the restaurant has only one anyway, a paccheri (an oversize version of rigatoni), served with meat ragù.'"

"'11-12-25,'0','“The Dolphin in the Mirror”is an odd, sometimes lumpy amalgam, part intellectual autobiography, part popular science, part cultural history and part polemic about the sometimes scandalous treatment of dolphins by humans. The result isn’t always entirely to the point — several pages are dedicated to the anonymous reviews that kept Reiss’s most important work out of top peer-reviewed journals, and to gloating about the popular attention that work eventually received — but it’s held together by a hope Rudy would well understand: that telling stories about dolphins can change the way people treat them and think about them.One comes away from Reiss’s book agreeing that “dolphins are among the smartest creatures on the planet” and that they merit not just our attention but our care and protection. Which isn’t to say that Reiss doesn’t sometimes seem to let her emotions get the best of her. When she writes that “bubble play” — dolphins’ apparently learned habit of entertaining themselves by blowing bubble rings from their blowholes — bears “all the hallmarks of the expression and transmission of culture,” one strains hopefully to believe her. But when she adds that dolphins seem “to have some grasp of the physics” behind these bubbles, the effort is too much. Many pitchers don’t grasp the physics of the curveball’s curve.The most interesting strand in Reiss’s book is her cultural history, which suggests that “from the earliest records of civilization, humans have felt a deep affinity with dolphins.” Reiss writes that this affinity “reached its zenith in ancient Greece,” where dolphins were considered “closer to the gods than any other creature, half divine themselves, and messengers between the human and divine realms.” In THE BEAR: History of a Fallen King (Belknap/Harvard University, $29.95), the French historian Michel Pastoureau makes a similar claim for another animal. He writes that as far back as the Upper Paleolithic era, some 30,000 years ago, evidence suggests that “the bear was no longer considered an animal like other animals, that it occupied a special place between the worlds of beasts and men, and that it may have served as a mediator with the beyond.” The oldest known statue made by human hands, dating back at least 15,000 years, depicts a bear, and it seems that bear cults existed throughout northern and western Europe for millenniums. As late as the early Middle Ages, the bear, not the lion, was considered king of the beasts. (King Arthur’s name, Pastoureau reminds us, is “directly related to the word for bear.”) Around 1240, a Parisian bishop, William of Auvergne, noted that the offspring of bears and humans — the two species being considered interfertile, and the abduction and rape of women by bears being a plausible occurrence — were “not at all monsters (monstri) but fully human (veri homines), and that they must be acknowledged and accepted as such, and baptized and raised as other children.”The chief subject of Pastoureau’s fascinating book, which has been translated from the French by George Holoch, is not the prominent place bears once held in the human imagination but the manner in which they fell from that place. Pastoureau believes this was the concerted work of the medieval Roman Catholic Church, which saw the elimination of “the last remnants of the ancient bear cults” as central to establishing and maintaining hegemony over the regions of Europe whose popular imagination still tended toward the ursine.The first and simplest step was eliminating the animal’s physical presence. In the eighth century, Pastoureau writes, “Charlemagne organized great campaigns of bear massacres in Germany.” But equally great efforts were made to demythologize the bear, with prominent feast days scheduled to replace the many pagan festivals. Over time, the cultural treatment of the bear went from regal to diabolic, with the lion replacing it as the king of the beasts. One advantage of the lion was that it wasn’t actually indigenous to Europe, so its legend could be more easily manipulated.This last fact serves as a reminder that stories can have a darker side, that they can separate us from animals as easily as they can connect us, that the elevation of one animal to the sphere of particular human concern is likely to come at the expense of another. And the best stories are likely to complicate our relationships, not simplify them.As its title suggests, Jenny Diski’s WHAT I DON’T KNOW ABOUT ANIMALS (Yale University, $26) begins in a place of uncertainty. It more or less ends there too. Those who follow Diski’s frequent essays in The London Review of Books know she can make something wonderful from her confusion. Diski writes not as a “border crosser” but as an urban “post-domestic.” (In other words, she was raised after the time when domestic animals, other than pets, were a daily part of our lives.) “All the animals I knew in the early years of my life,” she notes, “were stuffed.” That she describes the mute presence of these inanimate creatures in much the same terms that Rudy and Reiss use to discuss their own childhood border crossings should give us pause. For Diski, “the difference between animals and humans was where the real story lay.”Not being a border crosser myself, I find her confused wonder in the face of the “otherness” of animals more convincing than the insistence of Rudy and Reiss that they have special access not just to animal behavior but to animal mind. Elsewhere Diski writes, “I knew the difference as difference, but difference wasn’t a barrier.” Which is to say, we don’t have to understand animals in order to care about them or in order to feel obliged to treat them in a certain fashion. Finally, stories can take us only so far. As Diski notes, when it comes to animals — when it comes to life — “narrative is infinitely pliable.”'"

They do admirably.”Beginning in the late 1960s, Mr. Deiber increasingly turned his attention to opera. In 1970 he became part of a management change at the Paris Opera, in charge of rejuvenating its stage productions. He directed several productions at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, including Gounod’s “Roméo et Juliette,” with Mirella Freni and Franco Corelli, in 1967; Bellini’s “Norma,” with Joan Sutherland, in 1970; Massenet’s “Werther,” with Corelli and Mr. Deiber’s future wife, Ms. Ludwig, in 1971; and Debussy’s “Pelléas et Mélisande,” with Judith Blegen and Barry McDaniel, in 1972.His operas were known for being not only well sung but also well acted, Fabrizio Melano, a director who assisted Mr. Deiber on “Werther” and “Pelléas,” said in an interview.“He was a wonderful actor, and he had wonderful rapport with actors,” Mr. Melano said. “He also knew music very well, so he could transfer that rapport to singers. He could not only demonstrate, but he understood what they were going through. Not every stage director can.”Mr. Deiber was born on Jan. 1, 1925, in La Broque, a village in the Alsace region of France, near the German border. His father chopped and sold wood. During World War II he was a member of the French Resistance and imprisoned briefly in Paris, Ms. Ludwig said.Mr. Deiber studied violin and voice before becoming an actor, first appearing with the Comédie-Française in a small role in “Cyrano de Bergerac” in 1942. He played Bernardo in “Hamlet” the following year and joined the company in 1944.His first two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Ludwig, whom he married in 1972, he is survived by a son, Philippe, and a granddaughter.The Met production of “Werther” was full of drama behind the scenes. Corelli, the recipient of letters threatening him physically by an irrational opera fan, according to René Segher, a biographer of his, canceled his appearance on opening night within minutes of the curtain. His replacement, Enrico Di Giuseppe, was a head shorter than Corelli, and Ms. Ludwig had to look frantically for a pair of flat shoes to change into.Still, Ms. Ludwig remembers the production for another reason entirely: it was where she met her husband.“I didn’t know the part, and it was in French, and I didn’t speak French,” she said in an interview. “And so he came to my apartment and he taught me the part in French. And so we married.”'"
"'11-12-25,'0','“The Dolphin in the Mirror”is an odd, sometimes lumpy amalgam, part intellectual autobiography, part popular science, part cultural history and part polemic about the sometimes scandalous treatment of dolphins by humans. The result isn’t always entirely to the point — several pages are dedicated to the anonymous reviews that kept Reiss’s most important work out of top peer-reviewed journals, and to gloating about the popular attention that work eventually received — but it’s held together by a hope Rudy would well understand: that telling stories about dolphins can change the way people treat them and think about them.One comes away from Reiss’s book agreeing that “dolphins are among the smartest creatures on the planet” and that they merit not just our attention but our care and protection. Which isn’t to say that Reiss doesn’t sometimes seem to let her emotions get the best of her. When she writes that “bubble play” — dolphins’ apparently learned habit of entertaining themselves by blowing bubble rings from their blowholes — bears “all the hallmarks of the expression and transmission of culture,” one strains hopefully to believe her. But when she adds that dolphins seem “to have some grasp of the physics” behind these bubbles, the effort is too much. Many pitchers don’t grasp the physics of the curveball’s curve.The most interesting strand in Reiss’s book is her cultural history, which suggests that “from the earliest records of civilization, humans have felt a deep affinity with dolphins.” Reiss writes that this affinity “reached its zenith in ancient Greece,” where dolphins were considered “closer to the gods than any other creature, half divine themselves, and messengers between the human and divine realms.” In THE BEAR: History of a Fallen King (Belknap/Harvard University, $29.95), the French historian Michel Pastoureau makes a similar claim for another animal. He writes that as far back as the Upper Paleolithic era, some 30,000 years ago, evidence suggests that “the bear was no longer considered an animal like other animals, that it occupied a special place between the worlds of beasts and men, and that it may have served as a mediator with the beyond.” The oldest known statue made by human hands, dating back at least 15,000 years, depicts a bear, and it seems that bear cults existed throughout northern and western Europe for millenniums. As late as the early Middle Ages, the bear, not the lion, was considered king of the beasts. (King Arthur’s name, Pastoureau reminds us, is “directly related to the word for bear.”) Around 1240, a Parisian bishop, William of Auvergne, noted that the offspring of bears and humans — the two species being considered interfertile, and the abduction and rape of women by bears being a plausible occurrence — were “not at all monsters (monstri) but fully human (veri homines), and that they must be acknowledged and accepted as such, and baptized and raised as other children.”The chief subject of Pastoureau’s fascinating book, which has been translated from the French by George Holoch, is not the prominent place bears once held in the human imagination but the manner in which they fell from that place. Pastoureau believes this was the concerted work of the medieval Roman Catholic Church, which saw the elimination of “the last remnants of the ancient bear cults” as central to establishing and maintaining hegemony over the regions of Europe whose popular imagination still tended toward the ursine.The first and simplest step was eliminating the animal’s physical presence. In the eighth century, Pastoureau writes, “Charlemagne organized great campaigns of bear massacres in Germany.” But equally great efforts were made to demythologize the bear, with prominent feast days scheduled to replace the many pagan festivals. Over time, the cultural treatment of the bear went from regal to diabolic, with the lion replacing it as the king of the beasts. One advantage of the lion was that it wasn’t actually indigenous to Europe, so its legend could be more easily manipulated.This last fact serves as a reminder that stories can have a darker side, that they can separate us from animals as easily as they can connect us, that the elevation of one animal to the sphere of particular human concern is likely to come at the expense of another. And the best stories are likely to complicate our relationships, not simplify them.As its title suggests, Jenny Diski’s WHAT I DON’T KNOW ABOUT ANIMALS (Yale University, $26) begins in a place of uncertainty. It more or less ends there too. Those who follow Diski’s frequent essays in The London Review of Books know she can make something wonderful from her confusion. Diski writes not as a “border crosser” but as an urban “post-domestic.” (In other words, she was raised after the time when domestic animals, other than pets, were a daily part of our lives.) “All the animals I knew in the early years of my life,” she notes, “were stuffed.” That she describes the mute presence of these inanimate creatures in much the same terms that Rudy and Reiss use to discuss their own childhood border crossings should give us pause. For Diski, “the difference between animals and humans was where the real story lay.”Not being a border crosser myself, I find her confused wonder in the face of the “otherness” of animals more convincing than the insistence of Rudy and Reiss that they have special access not just to animal behavior but to animal mind. Elsewhere Diski writes, “I knew the difference as difference, but difference wasn’t a barrier.” Which is to say, we don’t have to understand animals in order to care about them or in order to feel obliged to treat them in a certain fashion. Finally, stories can take us only so far. As Diski notes, when it comes to animals — when it comes to life — “narrative is infinitely pliable.”'"

No lists, no shopping, no gift-wrapping, no bills, no shipping costs, an extremely low carbon footprint — and on Christmas morning the miraculous appearance of presents that find just the right balance between desire and a sort of disciplinary justice.Picture a world in which what you get is what you want divided by what you deserve, and you can see the appeal of a real Santa, no matter what it would do to the gross domestic product of toy-producing and toy-consuming countries.It would be wonderful, too, to be woken in the earliest hours of the morning by the heralding of angels proclaiming peace on earth. Not just the laying down of arms and an end to war, but an end to the conditions that cause war: gross inequality, intolerance, the endless, destructive struggle over natural resources, and the ease with which we dehumanize our fellow humans. Imagine in its place good will and, more important, the deeds that create and embody good will.But no matter how we might wish for these things, they must all be done by us alone — the shopping and the pursuit of equity, the gift-wrapping and the acceptance of our shared humanity, celebrating the spirit of Christmas and ending the violence and hatred that we seem to spawn so prolifically as a species. This is a day of glad tidings, secular and sacred.The message may be divine, but the work that lies ahead, finding peace on earth and good will toward others, is wholly human, wholly our own.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','The manager, Glenn Stevenson, 65, looks up from his clipboard in a way that signals he has too much counting to do, and not enough time. A churchgoing man whose work attire includes a Detroit Tigers cap, he has been with Focus: HOPE for 21 years. He knew both the priest, who died in 1997 at the age of 67, and the housewife, who died at 79 in August. And, yes, he confirms, they’re here.“Their spirit will always be with us,” Mr. Stevenson says, before turning back to his tallying with the purpose of someone who feels he’s being watched.The story of Focus: HOPE is part of Detroit lore, beginning with how Father Cunningham, an English teacher, and Ms. Josaitis, a mother of five, united after the devastating race riots of 1967 to fight poverty and champion racial harmony. He gave up teaching to run a poor parish, she and her husband, Don, moved their family into the city — at a time when other white people were moving out in haste — and the two of them started to shake things up.They published a study revealing how inner-city food and drug stores charged more for goods of poorer quality. They lobbied the Department of Agriculture to share the country’s stockpiled food with the country’s very poorest. They broadened their vision to include job-training programs and contract work that filled up old manufacturing plants along Oakman Boulevard.Over the years, they became known as the saints of Detroit, which irritated them and sold them short. They were compassionate, relentless and wonderfully flawed. In other words, human.Father Cunningham once rejected a well-intentioned businessman’s offer to donate secondhand computers because, he said caustically, the people of Focus: HOPE were not second-class citizens. And Ms. Josaitis could be so hard on employees — “I know I’m riding my broom, but,” she’d say — that some of them gave her a broom equipped with a seat and a horn.The two co-founders could have booming quarrels, then abruptly switch to a pleasant discussion about where to stop for lunch. They loved each other, friends say, and knew instinctively that with his never-say-never vision and her never-say-never managerial skills, anything was possible, including the almost magical appearance of much-needed food.Focus: HOPE was in on the ground floor 40 years ago when the federal government began the Commodity Supplemental Food Program, devised to provide poor women and children with basic, nutritious food. Before long, the Detroit operation was the largest of its kind, and leading the fight to include poor people over 60, which is now this obscure federal program’s central purpose.These days, the federal program putters along, costing $177 million a year to serve parts of 39 states, two Indian tribal organizations and the District of Columbia. Focus: HOPE, meanwhile, is struggling, like the city it serves. The distressed economy has forced recalibrations and cutbacks. A few weeks ago the organization laid off dozens of employees and suspended several job-training classes.But the supplemental food program grinds on. It is the Focus: HOPE original, the constant, overseen for the last 20 years by a 57-year-old man who will lunch on McRib sandwiches five days in a row, no matter that part of his job is to promote a balanced diet. His name is Frank Kubik, and he is all Detroit.Mr. Kubik got laid off from Chrysler in 1979, then struggled for more than two years to find a job. One miserable moment sticks most in his mind: standing in a line of job seekers outside a building, being covered in snow, and seeing people inside laughing at him and his fellow unemployed.He finally took a low-paying job unloading the train cars of food for Focus: HOPE, figuring he’d stay for six months. It’s been 30 years. Thirty years of knowing that seniors prefer orange juice to tomato juice for washing down their pills; that canned tomatoes are less popular than canned beans; that a two-pound block of cheese can go a long way. Thirty years, all because of the examples set by a priest and a housewife.“They blew me away,” Mr. Kubik says, as rainwater drips from his office’s leaky ceiling and Father Cunningham watches from a Mass card taped to a bookshelf.It is a familiar refrain here, echoed by Mr. Stevenson in the warehouse, who remembers how Ms. Josaitis often teased him about his messy desk (she was teasing, wasn’t she?). By Jonetta Johnson, 50, the floor manager, who has been here ever since Father Cunningham told her, more than 30 years ago, “You need something to do.” By others. It’s Father William this and Eleanor that, still.On another biting December day, people arrive by car, bus and foot for food. They enter a storelike setting that carries an air of common dignity once insisted upon by a priest and a housewife — and, now, by a successor who has not forgotten the humiliation of standing in line for a job, covered in snow.Guiding their carts past the glittering Christmas tree, the customers make their selections down an aisle of opened boxes that overflow like cardboard cornucopias. Tomato juice. Grape juice. Canned beef chunks. Canned apricots. Spinach. Pasta. Corn. Rice. Cheese. The things that sustain us.'"

"'11-12-25,'0','GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Roughly 24 hours before tipping off the N.B.A. season at Madison Square Garden, the Knicks conducted one final practice Saturday and took stock of the team that they hope will compete for a championship.“It should be an exciting year,” Coach Mike D’Antoni said. “We’re looking forward to it. I know the players are looking forward to playing. It should be great.”D’Antoni said the Knicks would probably use the same starting lineup they did in the two-game preseason on Sunday when they face the Boston Celtics, who swept the Knicks out of the opening round of the playoffs last season in four games. They may, however, be without the backup point guard Mike Bibby.Bibby, a 13-year veteran who signed with the Knicks on Dec. 11, injured his back when he collided with the Nets’ Stephen Graham in the teams’ preseason game Wednesday. Bibby sat out practice Friday, but he participated on a limited basis Saturday. He will probably be a game-time decision.Either way, the Knicks will probably maintain the starting lineup that features Tyson Chandler at center, Amar’e Stoudemire at power forward, Carmelo Anthony at small forward, Landry Fields at shooting guard and Toney Douglas at point guard.The lockout-abbreviated training camp has added to the difficulty in preparing for the season. D’Antoni has simplified the offense and says he plans to add layers of complexity as the season progresses. On Saturday, he put the Knicks through what appeared to be a fairly thorough practice, not sparing a moment even though it was Christmas Eve.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','Digital equipment now exists to measure riders’ progress, but the New York races use an antique set of British rollers from the 1960s, a contraption of pins and pulleys whose low-tech look and loud colors recall a Coney Island ride.Cyclists face the crowd, balancing their own fixed-gear track bikes on the rig’s four sets of thick plastic rollers. The rollers spin with the bike wheels, keeping the riders in place and driving the arrows that track their progress in time with their pedaling. Spectators watch the races — often 500- or 1,000-meter sprints that are over in less than 30 seconds — from directly in front of the bikes.“The blue roller broke a few years ago after a crash,” said David B. Perry, who runs the Bike Works shop on the Lower East Side and is the soft-spoken impresario of the New York roller scene; it took months to fix because the parts had to be specially made.“It’s an example of how old this thing is,” he said of the machine, which he bought for $7,800 at a Sotheby’s auction in 2000.This is the 10th year that Mr. Perry has rented it out for events in New York. “Those first ones were really, really rowdy,” said Andy Shen, who along with Mr. Schmaltz organized the competition in early December, a fund-raiser for the junior racing program of the Century Road Club Association. “We’ve had to tone things down because Dave was worried about people getting too close to the racers and damaging his rollers.”Even so, the races remain raucous, with spectators drinking and occasionally placing lighthearted bets on the riders. During the recent competition, Mr. Perry’s rollers were on a small stage in the back of Parkside Lounge, at Houston and Attorney Streets. He and several others stood near the racers to help them if they crashed.Beneath purple streamers and a spinning mirror ball, the vibe was more rock concert than bike race. Classic guitar riffs blared as a USA Cycling official shouted the results of each competition. (A quirk of these races is that they are officially sanctioned.)“It’s New York City’s Christmas party for cycling,” said John Eustice, a former professional rider and a promoter of the Harlem Skyscraper Cycling Classic, an outdoor race held each summer.Nearby, Mr. Landis, his hair down to his shoulders, smiled widely as he mingled. He retired after admitting to using performance-enhancing substances and accusing his former teammate Lance Armstrong of doping as well; he is now training to become a Nascar driver. But he declined to discuss his new car-racing career or his part in the Tour de France scandals.During the evening, Mr. Landis posed for photos but did not ride the rollers. “I was never very good at it,” he said. “These guys know what they’re doing.”Indeed, the final race was a nail-biter between two strong riders: Matthew Diefenbach, 47, who competed in this year’s masters track nationals, and Bobby Lea, 28, the Olympian.As the cyclists’ legs pumped with frantic speed, the machine whirred like a table saw, and the arrows — red and blue — spun snuggly together, neither rider gaining advantage on the other.A final burst sent Mr. Diefenbach crashing off his rollers just as his red arrow passed the finish. The crowd bellowed its approval, but the extra effort was not enough. Mr. Lea’s blue arrow had gotten there first.His prize: a novelty beer bottle, and bragging rights till next year.'"

He notes that this is not merely a two-sided argument, and shows that the debate is further complicated when a translator comes between the reader and the poet — as is the case with the Spanish poet Luis de Góngora’s long poem “The Solitudes,” translated by the masterly Edith Grossman. Just as translation of poetry is deemed by some to be impossible, using prose to explain poetry strikes many of us who are poets as foolhardy. But, ah, the nobility of the quest. I suspect Góngora and his shipwrecked young man would join me in toasting Orr: Salud y amor y tiempo para disfrutarlo. We have been fools once in our lives.'"
"'11-12-25,'0','AT&T’s decision to drop its bid for T-Mobile is a victory for the Justice Department and the Federal Communications Commission, which steadfastly opposed a deal that would have locked the wireless market into a duopoly and been bad for consumers. But the battle to defend competition in telecommunications is hardly over.As regulators moved to block the AT&T deal, Verizon Wireless was buying big chunks of spectrum from the nation’s largest cable carriers and signing agreements with them to sell each other’s services to consumers around the country.The deals could have the positive effect of putting to use spectrum that cable companies bought at auction in 2006, and encouraging Verizon to roll out new high-tech wireless services. But the potential for these agreements to curtail competition in both wireless and wireline industries is troubling, and should be examined by the Justice Department and the F.C.C.Verizon — Verizon Wireless’s main shareholder — relieved itself of the need to expand FiOS, its high-speed, fiber optic network, beyond the 18 million homes it set out to reach six years ago, a rollout that cost $23 billion. For the other 114 million homes in the country, it can simply bundle its wireless service with the cable and wireline broadband services of its partners. The agreement between Verizon and the cable carriers includes a joint venture to develop technology to integrate the wireline and wireless platforms.Verizon’s cable deals squashed hopes that cable carriers’ purchases of wireless spectrum would lead to more competition against the dominant players, AT&T and Verizon Wireless. And it puts in doubt whether FiOS will ever be a serious competitor to cable, reducing the likelihood that video transmitted over broadband could break up cable’s regional oligopolies.When Congress deregulated telecommunications 15 years ago, it was counting on a burst of competition among phone companies, cable carriers and other high-tech newcomers. Instead, we have seen a relentless push for consolidation within and across technological platforms, carving the market into national and regional oligopolies.Promoting vigorous competition may require Congress to enhance regulators’ oversight of cross-platform deals. Antitrust suits are hard to win on all but the most obviously anticompetitive mergers in which the companies are in precisely the same business. Antitrust law may not be able to prevent wireless, wireline and cable from merging into one industry. And the F.C.C. has defined broadband as mostly outside its scope, and so has limited powers to regulate that pivotal market.'"

On Sunday, he shot 11 of 19 from the field and added 5 rebounds and 6 assists.James Harden added 19 points, and the Thunder held the Orlando star Dwight Howard to 11 points. The Thunder lost to Dallas last season in the Western Conference finals, but they are expected to be one of the league’s top teams this season.They led throughout, were ahead by 18 at the end of the third quarter and really were never in danger of losing. Meanwhile, the Magic looked like a team that was still dealing with the distraction of Howard and his trade demands, which have dominated the headlines in Orlando since the lockout ended.N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern weighed in on the Howard situation Sunday, saying before the game: “That’s the beauty of the soap opera. How it plays out, we’ll wait and see.”1011 2011-12-26 But he did not disavow their support. “If they want to endorse me, they’re endorsing what I do or say — it has nothing to do with endorsing what they say,” said Mr. Paul, who is now running strong in for the Republican nomination.The libertarian movement in American politics has long had two overlapping but distinct strains. One, backed to some degree by wealthy interests, is focused largely on economic freedom and dedicated to reducing and regulation through smaller government. The other is more focused on personal liberty and constraints on government built into the Constitution, which at its extreme has helped fuel militant antigovernment sentiment.Mr. Paul has operated at the nexus of the two, often espousing positions at odds with most of the Republican Party but assembling a diverse and loyal following attracted by his adherence to libertarian principles.Mr. Paul’s calls for the end of the system, a cessation of aid to and all other nations and an overall diminishment of government power have natural appeal among far-right, niche political groups. Aides say that much of the support is unsolicited and that it is unfair to overlook the larger number of mainstream voters now backing him.But a look at the trajectory of Mr. Paul’s career shows that he and his closest political allies either wittingly or unwittingly courted disaffected white voters with extreme views as they sought to forge a movement from the nether region of American politics, where the far right and the far left sometimes converge.In May, Mr. Paul reiterated in an interview with of MSNBC that he would not have voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawing segregation. He said that he supported its intent, but that parts of it violated his longstanding belief that government should not dictate how property owners behave. He has been featured in videos of the John Birch Society, which campaigned against the Civil Rights Act, warning, for instance, that the threatens American sovereignty.In the mid-1990s, between his two stints as a congressman, Mr. Paul produced a newsletter called The Ron Paul Survival Report, which only months before the bombings encouraged militias to seek out and expel federal agents in their midst. That edition was titled “Why Militias Scare the Striped Pants Off Big Government.”An earlier edition of another newsletter he produced, The Ron Paul Political Report, concluded that the need for citizens to arm themselves was only natural, given carjackings by “urban youth who play whites like pianos.” The report, with no byline but written in the first person, said: “I’ve urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self-defense. For the animals are coming.”Mike Holmes, former editor of The American Libertarian, who has known Mr. Paul from libertarian circles since the 1970s, contended that the newsletters did not “rise to the level of hate speech.” He added: “It goes more to the level of social commentary. There was no use of any ‘N’-words. It amounted to the style of foul-mouthed punks trying to get inside the gang of paleoconservatives.”Those newsletters have drawn new scrutiny through Mr. Paul’s two recent presidential campaigns. The New Republic posted several of them online in 2008 and again recently, including a lament about “The Disappearing White Majority.” The conservative Weekly Standard ran an article highlighting the newsletters last week.Mr. Paul has long repudiated the newsletters, contending that they were written by the staff of his company, Ron Paul & Associates, while he was tending to his obstetrician’s practice and that he did not see some of them until 10 years later. “I disavow those positions,” he said in the interview. “They’re not my positions, and anybody who knows me, they’ve never heard a word of it.”But production of the newsletters was partly overseen by Lew Rockwell, a libertarian activist who has been a close political aide and adviser to Mr. Paul over the course of decades. At the same time that he was a director for Mr. Paul’s company, Mr. Rockwell called on libertarians to reach out to “cultural and moral traditionalists,” who “reject not only affirmative action, set-asides and quotas, but the 1964 Civil Rights Act and all subsequent laws that force property owners to act against their will.”Mr. Rockwell and Mr. Paul came to know each other as followers of the free-market Austrian economists Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich A. Hayek, who argued against socialism and centralized economic planning, a spokesman for Mr. Paul said. They joined with the libertarian theorist Murray Rothbard in the 1970s and 1980s during the early attempts to forge libertarianism into a national party.Mr. Rockwell was listed in business filings as a director of Ron Paul & Associates from its founding in 1984 through its dissolution in 2001, and was a paid Paul campaign consultant through at least 2002, according to federal campaign records. He was Mr. Paul’s chief of staff during the congressman’s first period in Congress, which began in the 1970s, and championed his successful bid in 1988 for the Libertarian Party’s presidential nomination.During that nominating battle, a flier produced by Mr. Paul’s opponents accused him of gay-baiting by reporting in one of his newsletters that the government was “lying” about the threat of and that the virus could be transmitted through “saliva, tears, sweat.” It said that some “AIDS carriers — perhaps out of a pathological hatred — continue to give blood.”Mr. Paul said Friday “that was never my view at all,” and again blamed his staff. Still, that same year he was quoted in The Houston Post as saying that schools should be free to bar children with AIDS and that the government should stop financing AIDS research and education.As the Libertarian standard bearer, Mr. Paul won less than 1 percent of the vote. After the election, as libertarians searched for ways to broaden the appeal of their ideology, Mr. Rockwell and Mr. Rothbard advocated a coalition of libertarians and so-called paleoconservatives, who unlike hawkish “neocons” were socially conservative, noninterventionist and opposed to what they viewed as state-enforced multiculturalism.In the Rothbard-Rockwell Report they started in 1990, Mr. Rothbard called for a “Right Wing Populism,” suggesting that the campaign for governor of by David Duke, the founder of the National Association for the Advancement of White People, was a model for “paleolibertarianism.”“It is fascinating that there was nothing in Duke’s current program or campaign that could not also be embraced by paleoconservatives or paleolibertarians,” he wrote.Arguing that too many libertarians were embracing a misplaced egalitarianism, Mr. Rockwell wrote in Liberty magazine: “There is nothing wrong with blacks preferring the ‘black thing.’ But paleolibertarians would say the same about whites preferring the ‘white thing’ or Asians the ‘Asian thing.’ ”Their thinking was hardly embraced by all libertarians. “It was just something that we found abhorrent, and so there was a huge divide,” said Edward H. Crane, the founder of the , a prominent libertarian research center.Mr. Crane, a longtime critic of Mr. Rockwell, called Mr. Paul’s close association with him “one of the more perplexing things I’ve ever come across in my 67 years.” He added: “I wish Ron would condemn these fringe things that float around because of Rockwell. I don’t believe he believes any of that stuff.”Mr. Paul said in the interview that he did not, but he declined to condemn Mr. Rockwell, saying he did not want to get in the middle of a fight. “I could understand that, but I could also understand the Rothbard group saying, Why don’t you quit talking to ?” he said.Mr. Paul described Mr. Rockwell and Mr. Rothbard as political provocateurs. “They enjoyed antagonizing people, to tell you the truth, and trying to split people,” he said. “I thought, we’re so small, why shouldn’t we be talking to everybody and bringing people together?”Nonetheless, Mr. Paul’s newsletters veered into language that would most likely appeal to Mr. Duke’s followers, including the suggestion in 1994 that Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, was responsible for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.He said he did not discuss the content of the newsletters with Mr. Rockwell because readers never complained. “I was pretty careless about what was going in my own newsletter — that was my biggest fault,” he said.Mr. Rockwell did not respond to interview requests. Carol Moore, a libertarian opponent of his at the time, said he and his allies had “all evolved” and moderated their views since.Still, the newsletters had a lasting appeal with the audience Mr. Rockwell and Mr. Rothbard talked about reaching.Mr. Black of Stormfront said the newsletters helped make him a Ron Paul supporter. “That was a big part of his constituency, the paleoconservatives who think there are race problems in this country,” Mr. Black said.“We understand that Paul is not a white nationalist, but most of our people support him because of his stand on issues,” Mr. Black said. “We think our race is being threatened through a form of genocide by assimilation, meaning the allowing in of third-world immigrants into the .”Mr. Black said Mr. Paul was attractive because of his “aggressive position on securing our borders,” his criticism of affirmative action and his goal of eliminating the Federal Reserve, which the Stormfront board considers to be essentially a private bank with no government oversight. “Also, our board recognizes that most of the leaders involved in the Fed and the international banking system are Jews.”Mr. Paul is not unaware of that strain among his supporters. Mr. Crane of the Cato Institute recalled comparing notes with Mr. Paul in the early 1980s about direct mail solicitations for money. When Mr. Crane said that mailing lists of people with the most extreme views seemed to draw the best response, Mr. Paul responded that he found the same thing with a list of subscribers to the Spotlight, a now-defunct publication founded by the holocaust denier Willis A. Carto.Mr. Paul said he did not recall that conversation, which was first reported in the libertarian publication Reason, and doubted that he would have known what lists were being used on his behalf. Yet he said he would not have a problem seeking support from such a list.“I’ll go to anybody who I think I can convert to change their viewpoints — so that would be to me incidental,” he said. “I’m always looking at converting people to look at liberty the way I do.”1012 2011-12-26 The institute was founded by conservative activists in 1988, with the blessing of its namesake, Barry M. Goldwater, the longtime Arizona senator and conservative icon. It was primarily a public policy shop that issued reports, until 2007, when it added a crack litigation outfit. The institute’s aggressive lawyers strike fear in the hearts of the state’s public officials.“While the organization may have veered somewhat from Barry Goldwater’s conscience of conservatism to that of libertarianism, there is little doubt they are a political and legal force in Arizona, perhaps becoming the most influential state think tank organization in America,” said Jason Rose, a Scottsdale publicist active in conservative circles.Mr. Rose has represented Joseph M. Arpaio, the Maricopa County sheriff who finds himself under fire by the Justice Department and an array of other critics. Among the sheriff’s detractors has been the Goldwater Institute, which does not hesitate to go after Republicans. “Our view is that the role of the sheriff is to effectively enforce the law, and we’ve been sharply critical of his department fulfilling its most basic function,” Mr. Bolick said.Some of Goldwater’s legal causes can seem rather small-time. Lawyers at the institute’s Scharf-Norton Center for Constitutional Litigation defended the right of a voter to wear a Tea Party T-shirt to the polls in Flagstaff, fought restrictions aimed at limiting tattooing in Tempe and Mesa, and, in the toe-nibbling case, helped a salon owner who clashed with the state’s cosmetology regulators over using special fish imported from China to eat the dead skin off customers’ toes.The institute, which partially won the fish pedicure case on appeal, went after the Arizona Board of Cosmetology again this month after the agency interfered with a business that provided at-home spa treatments to cancer patients and others“Defendants’ actions irrationally, arbitrarily, and excessively restrict the ability of plaintiffs to operate a legitimate business,” the Goldwater Institute lawyers wrote in their spirited brief on behalf of Lauren Boice, the owner of Angels on Earth Home Beauty business, in the Tucson area.Mr. Bolick sees a connection between those clashes and broader matters, like the dispute over matching funds in Arizona’s campaign finance reform system that the institute fought before the Supreme Court. All of the disputes, he said, are linked to what he considers limits on liberty.The Goldwater Institute is eager to defend “entrepreneurial freedom,” no matter what the business. Tattoo artists may not appear to be the typical clientele for a conservative legal team, but Mr. Bolick was so instinctively against the City of Tempe’s attempts to close a tattoo parlor that after he won the case, he became one of the parlor’s first clients and had the scorpion inked on his right index finger.The institute’s legal battles stir plenty of out-of-court controversy, which is one of the points.John McCain, who holds the Senate seat Mr. Goldwater long occupied, has lashed out at the institute for holding up the purchase of the Phoenix Coyotes hockey team by a Chicago businessman. The National Hockey League bought the team out of bankruptcy in 2009, and the City of Glendale, which hosts the team, wants to sell more than $100 million in municipal bonds to facilitate the deal and ensure that the team stays there.The institute has threatened to sue Glendale if the deal goes through, prompting Mr. McCain to say that it has lost touch with Mr. Goldwater’s ideals.“He always worked very hard to help our economy, to make sure that businesses and industries were attracted to our state,” Mr. McCain said in an interview on local sports radio. “He was proud of our growth. Frankly, I don’t believe that he would agree that we should not realize what the real world is. The real world is that people and places compete for professional teams.”But Mr. Bolick and his colleagues have been aggressive in going after government subsidies for businesses, wherever they occur. “We’re accused sometimes of being in the lap of business, which elicits a belly laugh from me,” Mr. Bolick said, indicating that prominent Arizona business owners have lobbied the institute’s board of directors — which includes Barry Goldwater Jr., the senator’s son and a former California congressman — to try to head off litigation.The institute’s influence extends well beyond Arizona, where it says it has won 10 court battles, lost 4 and is in the midst of 12 others. The institute has also helped conservative groups in half a dozen other states, among them Maine, Michigan, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio and Wisconsin, start similar legal units to fight for conservative principles within their borders.That may mean plenty of angst for liberals in those states. It will probably be a headache for fellow conservatives, too. “Barry Goldwater called them as he saw them, and we try to do that too,” Mr. Bolick said. “He took on people in his own party when he saw the need to do so, and we do, too.”Local governments in Arizona now consult experts at Goldwater before embarking on financing schemes. Their goal is to avoid receiving a legal brief in the mail typed out with Mr. Bolick’s fierce right finger.1013 2011-12-26 While the rest of the world engaged in merriment and good cheer, hackers used the holidays to attack a United States research group that puts out a daily newsletter on security issues.On Saturday, hackers who say they are members of the collective known as Anonymous claimed responsibility for crashing the Web site of the group, Stratfor Global Intelligence Service, and pilfering its client list, e-mails and credit card information in an operation they say is intended to steal $1 million for donations to charity. The hackers posted a list online that they say contains Stratfor’s confidential client list as well as credit card details, passwords and home addresses for some 4,000 Stratfor clients. The hackers also said they had details for more than 90,000 credit card accounts. Among the organizations listed as Stratfor clients: Bank of America, the Defense Department, Doctors Without Borders, Lockheed Martin, Los Alamos National Laboratory and the United Nations.The group also posted five receipts online that it said were of donations made with pilfered credit card details. One receipt showed a $180 donation from a United States Homeland Security employee, Edmund H. Tupay, to the American Red Cross. Another showed a $200 donation to the Red Cross from Allen Barr, a recently retired employee from the Texas Department of Banking. Neither responded to requests for comment.Mr. Barr told The Associated Press that on Friday he discovered that $700 had been transferred from his account to charities including the Red Cross, Save the Children and CARE, but that he had not been aware that the transfer was tied to a breach of Stratfor’s site.Stratfor executives did not return calls for comment on Sunday. In an e-mail to subscribers Sunday morning, Stratfor’s chief executive, George Friedman, confirmed that the company’s site had been hacked and said his company was working with law enforcement to track down the parties responsible.“We have reason to believe that the names of our corporate subscribers have been posted on other Web sites,” Mr. Friedman wrote in the e-mail. “We are diligently investigating the extent to which subscriber information may have been obtained.”1014 2011-12-26 Marisol Santiago was worried about the hard, teardrop-shaped spot under her dog’s eye. The dog, Princess, is a schnauzer, and tends to get infections. Ms. Santiago, 42, cleans the spot each day with hot water and disinfectant, but cannot afford to take Princess to the veterinarian.Princess is the latest in a long line of dogs found on the street or given to Ms. Santiago by friends. She and her youngest daughter, Samantha Concepción, 18, ticked off the dogs’ names: Rascal, Pirate, Chance, Alaska....Ms. Santiago considers it a blessing these days to be able to worry only about her dog. In August 2010, mother and daughter were racked by depression after Ms. Santiago learned she had lung cancer. After hearing the diagnosis, Samantha, a shy girl with black ringlets, confiscated her mother’s last pack of cigarettes and threw them away, one by one.Around the time that Ms. Santiago’s doctors told her to “avoid stress,” the teenager and her mother were faced with eviction from their two-bedroom apartment in the Melrose neighborhood of the Bronx.“I was imagining myself gone and Samantha with no place to live,” Ms. Santiago said.Ms. Santiago, a bubbly, petite woman whose apartment is decorated with photos of the four children she has raised, has had health problems stretching back more than a decade. A metal rod runs down the length of her calf, visible like an artery under her skin. Doctors installed it after a car crushed her leg in a hit-and-run accident in 1998. After the surgery, she said, she could not return to her job as a security guard at a nursing home in Queens, a job she loved.Ms. Santiago, who is divorced, said she got by on $697 a month in Supplemental Security Income disability benefits and $367 in food stamps. She pays $199 a month in rent for the subsidized apartment she shares with Samantha.Still, life was relatively affordable, she said, until another daughter moved in two years ago with her infant daughter. Samantha broke into a smile as she recalled having her niece in the house. “She’s cute; she’s a little diva,” she said. But the arrangement strained the family finances, Ms. Santiago said.The city’s Housing Authority raised the rent to $303 a month to reflect the daughter’s welfare benefits, Ms. Santiago said, and the rent stayed elevated even after the daughter moved out last year. It took more than six months of paperwork for Ms. Santiago to prove that the daughter had found a new home.Ms. Santiago said it was hard to help support her family while she was getting chemotherapy. “I wanted to help everyone,” she said. But by August that year, she was $1,900 behind in rent.The Housing Department later agreed to lower the rent, but told her she would be evicted if she could not pay the arrears, she said.Ms. Santiago turned to the Department of Social Services, and after a manager heard her story and saw her hair falling out in patches, she said, the department paid $1,488.50 of the amount owed. Ms. Santiago was also given a list of other places that might help, including Catholic Charities Archdiocese of New York, one of the seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.The organization drew $411.50 from the fund to cover the rest of Ms. Santiago’s back rent so she could stay put while finishing Medicaid-supported radiation and chemotherapy treatments at Montefiore Medical Center. Ms. Santiago said she refused to let Samantha accompany her to those appointments.“She didn’t need to see that,” she said. Ms. Santiago’s mother, 68, went with her instead.This past July, doctors declared that her cancer was in remission. Now, Ms. Santiago’s hair is growing back like a thick cap over her head.Samantha, who missed so many classes staying home to take care of her mother that she did not graduate, returned to high school this fall to repeat her senior year. She plans to get her diploma, or her G.E.D. certificate, if she lands a spot in Job Corps in Buffalo. She wants to be a pharmacy technician, she said, “because it seems like a good way to help people.”Ms. Santiago said that watching her daughter studying again helped motivate her to pursue her G.E.D., and that she was “in a rush” to do all the things she never did. She wants to become a veterinarian’s assistant.Now that Samantha is back at school, Princess is Ms. Santiago’s only constant companion at home while she studies. Her dream is to move her family to a safer neighborhood, maybe in Connecticut. She said she witnessed a shooting outside her window a few years ago: a 15-year-old was killed for his expensive sneakers.“We have nice neighbors,” she said, “but around here, we are more likely to get killed by a bullet than by cancer.”1015 2011-12-26 Austin Davis threw two touchdown passes and No. 22 Southern Mississippi (12-2) earned a team-record 12th win by holding off Nevada, 24-17, in the Hawaii Bowl on Saturday in Honolulu.1016 2011-12-26 The actress and singer Demi Lovato, who sought help last year for an eating disorder, criticized the Disney Channel, her former employer, on Friday over televised jokes about that condition. “Eating disorders are not something to joke about,” she wrote on Twitter in all-capital letters after hearing a character on the show “Shake It Up” say, “I could just eat you up, well, if I ate.” Ms. Lovato, right, was the star of the Disney Channel’s “Sonny With a Chance” until the spring, when she told People magazine that being in front of a camera “would make me nervous.” She is now concentrating on a music career. One of her fans told her about a similar comment made on “So Random,” which succeeded “Sonny With a Chance,” and Ms. Lovato shared it with 5.3 million followers. A Twitter account operated by Disney Channel replied to Ms. Lovato two hours later, “We hear you and are pulling both episodes as quickly as possible and re-evaluating them.” The channel’s account added, “It’s NEVER our intention to make light of eating disorders!”1017 2011-12-26 In 2009 Mr. Nohl, who runs a Berlin consulting company, Security Research Labs, published the algorithms used to encrypt voice and data conversations on GSM digital networks, which are used in Europe and elsewhere.In an interview, Mr. Nohl said he had made sure to conduct his latest research to avoid the illegal theft of data and communications by intercepting the phone transmissions of a colleague during field tests. In random tests, he said, he ended interceptions just one or two seconds after they began.The technique he uses focuses on deciphering the predictable, standard electronic “conversations” that take place between a cellphone and a mobile network at the beginning of each call. Typically, Mr. Nohl said, as many as 40 packets of coded information are sent back and forth, many just simple commands like, “I have a call for you,” or “Wait.”Most operators vary little from this set-up procedure, which Mr. Nohl said allowed him to use hacking software to make high-speed, educated guesses to decipher the complex algorithmic keys networks use to encrypt transmissions. Once he derived this key, Mr. Nohl said, he was able to intercept voice and data conversations by impersonating another user to listen to their voice mails or make calls or send text messages on their mobile accounts.Mr. Nohl said operators could easily fix this vulnerability in the GSM system, which is found in older 2G networks used by almost every cellphone, including smartphones, with a simple software patch. His research found that only two operators, T-Mobile in Germany and Swisscom in Switzerland, were already using this enhanced security measure, which involves adding a random digit to the end of each set-up command to thwart decoding. (For example, “I have a call for you 4.”)“This is a major vulnerability in most networks we tested, and the irony is that it costs very little, if nothing, to repair,” Mr. Nohl said. “Often it is just a question of inertia on the part of operators, or they have other priorities, such as building their networks.”Philip Lieberman, the chief executive and president of Lieberman Software, a company in Los Angeles that sells identity management software to large businesses and the U.S. government, said much of the digital technology that protects the privacy of cellphone calls had been developed in the 1980s and 1990s and is now ripe for attack.That said, Mr. Lieberman added that the kind of interception being done by researchers like Mr. Nohl demands a level of skill and sophistication that is beyond the abilities of most individuals.“Your digital mobile calls are generally well protected from people like yourselves, who are not in the position to crack them,” Mr. Lieberman said in an interview. “However, the technology to do this type of surveillance, which was once possible only by government intelligence agencies, is rapidly becoming affordable to more and more people.”In compiling his research, which was conducted from Sept. 1 through the past week, Mr. Nohl measured a network’s vulnerability to three attacks: the interception of voice and text messages, the impersonation of a cellphone user’s identity to make calls or hear voice mails and the tracking of a cellphone user’s location through the Internet and the cell network. He then ranked the operators in the three categories by compiling a risk scale, with 100 percent representing the best possible security and zero representing none.In protecting against the illicit interception of voice and text messages, the operators Orange Switzerland and TDC Sunrise in Switzerland and True Move in Thailand performed most poorly, according to his study. Deutsche Telekom’s T-Mobile in Germany and Slovakia and Swisscom’s Natel in Switzerland had the best security.In preventing the impersonation and use of another’s mobile account details for calling, texting or other purposes, Telefónica’s O2 network in the Czech Republic, Belgacom Proximus in Belgium and Orange Switzerland provided the least security, while T-Mobile Slovakia, T-Mobile Germany and SFR in France had the best, the study showed.In guarding against the tracking of a cellphone user’s geographic position through the Internet and global positioning satellites, T-Mobile Slovakia and two Moroccan operators, Wana and Medi Telecom, had the weakest safeguards, according to the research. Vodafone Italy, T-Mobile Germany and Vodafone Germany had the best security, according to the study. The tracking of cellphone users is not tied to the interception of identities but to a network’s ability to be tricked into disclosing the calling cell where the user is located.Many operators who performed poorly in the survey did not respond to requests for comment for this article. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Telekom, Alexia Sailer, said the company declined comment because it did not have details. A spokesman for Sunrise Communications in Zurich, Tobias Kistner, said the company would study the research and make any necessary security improvements.France Télécom, the owner of Orange, said “Orange puts a high priority on customer and network security and invests significantly to ensure our customers are well protected.”A spokesman for Telefónica in the Czech Republic, Hany Farghali, said the company used the latest security defenses and had experienced no security breaches in its network so far.The GSM Association, a London organization that represents operators, said it also would await details of Mr. Nohl’s study, adding that it welcomed research designed to improve GSM technology.“GSM networks use a range of encryption and authentication technologies and other features to make it difficult for criminals to fraudulently access and/or eavesdrop on customer communications or to identify and locate customers,” the association said in a statement.Mr. Nohl said he had based the choice of countries for his study on the ability of him and his team to travel. His Berlin firm advises businesses, European governments and mobile operators, he said, on how to erect better digital communication defenses.As consumers begin using cellphones for retail purchases and online banking, the potential damage from theft may increase, he said. Generally, however, the digital security tools used by banks and retailers, Mr. Nohl said, are far superior to those used by mobile operators and should thwart most attacks.But services that let consumers make purchases by text or top up mobile account balances by sending text messages could be vulnerable, he said.While the research was limited mostly to Europe, Mr. Nohl, a German citizen who received a doctorate in computer science at the University of Virginia, said the level of security provided by U.S. network operators was on a par with European operators, meaning there was also room for improvement.In Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, the level of mobile security varies widely and can be much lower. Operators in India and China, Mr. Nohl said, encrypt digital traffic poorly or not at all, either to save on the network’s operating costs or to allow government censors unfettered access to communications.1018 2011-12-26 The Federal Aviation Administration has its reasons for preventing passengers from reading from their Kindles and iPads during takeoff and landing.

Missouri (8-5) won its final football game as a member of the Big 12. The Tigers will join the Southeastern Conference next season.Franklin ran for 142 yards and threw for 132. Kendial Lawrence ran for 108 yards for the Tigers.1029 2011-12-27 The cables on the ship were designed to carry as much as 660 megawatts of electricity — about 5 percent of the power consumed in New York City on the hottest summer days — to Midtown Manhattan from the main power grid west of the Hudson. The power could replace some of the supply that would be lost if Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo succeeds in his quest to shut down the Indian Point nuclear plant, 35 miles north of Midtown.The New York Power Authority, which buys electricity for many city and state agencies, strongly supported the cross-Hudson cable plan. But the $850 million project is a privately financed venture, managed by PowerBridge, the same company that ran a cable from New Jersey to Long Island in 2007.PowerBridge has sold most of the capacity on the cable to the power authority. But it can sell additional capacity to Consolidated Edison or other power providers. The laying of the cable accounts for about $175 million of the total cost, said Edward M. Stern, the chief executive of PowerBridge.The electricity that is to run through the cables, three of them bundled together with two thinner fiber-optic wires, is from the grid that serves New Jersey and several other states. It is usually significantly less expensive than electricity made in the city.But first, the men on the ship — they are all men and almost all Italian — must get the cables buried. That was why Mr. Figueroa was deep in the water, feeling his way around a plow that had been lowered to the river bottom.After plunging into the 48-degree water about 700 feet from the west end of 53rd Street, Mr. Figueroa reported his observations through a microphone inside his bright yellow helmet. He had a camera too, but it was virtually useless in the murk of the Hudson.In the “dive shack” — a steel freight container filled with hoses and gauges — on a barge tethered to the ship, two supervisors listened to Mr. Figueroa’s transmissions. Beside them stood a member of the Giulio Verne’s engineering crew, who translated the information into Italian and relayed it to the control room on the ship’s main deck.Inside the control room, Mr. Aleo and his engineers kept up a spirited debate as they surveyed the 21 computer screens mounted on one wall. Some displayed video of the situation underwater from different angles; some showed data about the angle of the plow and the tension on the cables passing through it into the riverbed.The discussion rarely ceased, with one notable exception: Every hour, a crew member circulated with a pot of espresso and a stack of two-inch-tall plastic cups.If an army travels on its stomach, an Italian ship’s crew floats on a steady stream of coffee. They eat well, too. On Thursday, lunch was fettuccine alla bolognese with an antipasto spread, oranges and, of course, espresso.The Christmas tree in the mess hall served as a reminder that the crew would miss the holidays with their families. Their work in the Hudson was not likely to wrap up until just before or after New Year’s Day.“Unfortunately, it’s not the first Christmas we have passed on this ship,” Mr. Aleo said.The ship has traveled the world, laying cables across seas from Sardinia to Australia, he said. Mr. Aleo said that the length and depth of those crossings presented more vexing technical challenges than the Hudson project, which will run only a few miles underwater, from West 52nd Street to Edgewater. The construction on the two sides of the river is not scheduled to be completed until mid-2013. So, on Thursday afternoon, when the brief lull between the strong tides of the Hudson passed before the crew of the Giulio Verne could get the plow moving upriver, Mr. Stern, the chief executive, remained sanguine.“I’ve waited four years, I can wait another few hours,” he said, leaning against the ship’s rail, BlackBerry in hand.On Friday, the plow, using jets of water to cut through the silt and clay, began threading the cables into the trench at the tortoise-like pace of about 325 feet per hour. Almost immediately, it ran into some industrial junk. But after finding a way around it, the crew resumed laying the cables.They expected to reach New Jersey before the end of this week.1030 2011-12-27 The federal government’s investor visa, created in 1990, gives foreigners a chance at green cards if they invest $1 million to build a business in the United States that creates at least 10 jobs. Investing in an area with high unemployment would cut that price in half.The program, known as EB-5, has led foreigners to invest in projects around the country, like factories, resorts, shipyards and other enterprises in designated poor areas in need of jobs. A report in The Times last week found that EB-5 applications have nearly quadrupled in two years, to more than 3,800 in the 2011 fiscal year.But the program has spawned cynical practices that are stretching the rules and violating the spirit of the law. Some participants in New York, the report found, are pouring money into development zones that are misleadingly labeled as high-unemployment areas to qualify for the lower $500,000 investment threshold, but are not poor or underdeveloped.For example, a $750 million office tower in the mid-Manhattan diamond district has raised 20 percent of its financing through the EB-5 program. This was made possible through a trick of mapmaking in which state officials counted the number of unemployed people in the census tract next door, which includes Times Square, to justify calling the whole area a high-unemployment zone.Likewise, the gerrymandered lines of the development zone in Lower Manhattan near Wall Street skirt the wealthy enclaves but cross the East River to enfold a public-housing project in Brooklyn. Visa-seekers have used this district in three separate projects to qualify for the $500,000 discount.Federal officials issue the visas but they say they have to defer to the state when it comes to drawing boundary lines. State officials say they are following the guidance of federal regulators. The surest fix would be for Congress to amend the 21-year-old law to tighten the rules to stop gerrymandering and make sure investments are steered to places that truly need development.1031 2011-12-27 Four of the N.B.A.’s five Christmas games generated higher viewership this year over last year, perhaps not a surprise because they opened the lockout-shortened season.The Chicago Bulls’ victory over the Los Angeles Lakers, on ABC at 5 p.m., generated the most average viewership (11 million) but fewer than the Miami Heat-Lakers game (13 million) in the comparable time period last year.The other games had higher ratings than those in the comparable time slots last year: Miami’s easy win over Dallas, which began at 2:30 p.m. on ABC; the noon game, the Knicks’ 106-104 win over the Boston Celtics on TNT; Oklahoma City’s 97-89 victory over Orlando on ESPN; and the finale, the Los Angeles Clippers’ 105-86 win over Golden State at 10:30 p.m. on ESPN.

It beat Camper by less than two minutes after a trek that lasted 15 days. Telefónica trailed Camper much of the past two days but overtook it about eight miles before the finish at an undisclosed port in the Indian Ocean.The leg started in Cape Town, but organizers kept locations of the boats secret for the final part of the first stage to avoid pirates off Somalia. The boats are to be shipped to a spot off the United Arab Emirates. The leg will be completed with a sprint into Abu Dhabi. The race covers more than 45,000 miles with stops in 10 countries on five continents, ending in July in Galway, Ireland.1033 2011-12-27 Victims of a data breach at the intelligence analysis firm Stratfor apparently are targets for a second time after speaking out about the hacking. Stratfor said on its Facebook page that some people who offered public support for the company after it revealed it was hacked “may be being targeted for doing so.” The loose-knit hacking movement Anonymous claimed Sunday via Twitter that it had stolen thousands of credit card numbers and other personal information belonging to the company’s clients. The company has resorted to communicating through Facebook while its site remains down and its e-mail is suspended.1034 2011-12-27 Spain will slide back into recession early next year, the new economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said Monday, with the current quarter and the first quarter of 2012 both contracting 0.2 to 0.3 percent. Mr. de Guindos said the outlook for next year was poor. “Let nobody be fooled, the next two quarters are not going to be easy either in terms of growth or employment,” he said. Spain, which has the fourth largest economy among the 17 countries that use the euro, began to emerge from a nearly two-year recession last year. It had two successive quarters of growth in 2011 before posting zero growth in the third period. Mr. de Guindos took office last week as part of the new conservative Popular Party government. He said then that he was confident the country would emerge from its severe economic crisis and return to prosperity and its former status as a job creator. Spain has the highest unemployment rate, 21.5 percent, in the euro zone.1035 2011-12-27 Among the stock markets that were open worldwide on Monday, most climbed, while the dollar maintained losses against higher-yielding peers amid speculation that the United States economy would continue to recover.Benchmark equity gauges in Japan, India, Russia and Brazil rose 0.1 percent or more, while many financial markets were closed for Christmas and Boxing Day observations.The dollar weakened 0.2 percent against the euro, to $1.3074. The Chinese renminbi hit 6.3160 to a dollar, the strongest level since 1993, on speculation that Chinese policy makers would tolerate appreciation to stem capital outflows.Reports on Tuesday will detail home prices in 20 United States cities, and forecasts suggest that the pace of price declines slowed further. Other recent data point to an American economy that is slowly regaining its strength. Consumer confidence is projected to have risen to a five-month high, and data last week showed durable goods orders jumped in November by the most in four months, while sales of new homes increased to a seven-month high.“The U.S. economy is improving more than expected,” said Hideyuki Ishiguro, assistant manager at the investment strategy department at Okasan Securities in Tokyo. “Pessimism is easing among American consumers due to a recovery in the job market and some stability in the stock market.”1036 2011-12-27 Seeking to stanch its losses, Sony on Monday said it would end its flat-panel joint venture with Samsung, which was set up in 2004 to capture the boom in televisions with liquid-crystal displays. Samsung, based in South Korea, will pay about $940 million for Tokyo-based Sony’s 50 percent stake; Sony aims to save on manufacturing costs while still buying panels from Samsung.For retailers, the picture is not much better. This month, Best Buy reported a 29 percent drop in net income for the third quarter, in part because the retail chain had slashed prices on televisions and other electronics.Perhaps even more ominously for the long term, the future of televisions appears to be more about what content they can provide, like Netflix and iTunes, than new hardware features like flat screens or 3-D technology. It is an area where television manufacturers have struggled with little success to get an edge, even as Apple and Google vow to upend the industry.“Everybody is fighting for a limited amount of consumer dollars,” said Gregg Richard, president of PC Richard and Son, which has 66 electronics and appliance stores. “We are selling more TVs, more units, at lower retail prices.”It does not help that consumers are reluctant to pay much more for the latest features, like 3-D and Internet connectivity. Instead, they are likely to wait patiently for a few months until the price inevitably comes down.“People used to pay additional to get a Sony Trinitron,” said Riddhi Patel, director of television systems at IHS iSuppli, a market research firm. “But the industry has trained the consumer that any time there is a new technology, if they wait six months the price will come down.”Paul Gagnon, director of North America TV research for DisplaySearch, which tracks the market, noted that a 60-inch LCD television by Sharp was now selling for as little as $799 — about half of what it was selling just a year ago. “Absolutely amazing,” he said.The slump is a hangover of sorts for an industry that binged on years of double-digit growth, as consumers rushed to replace old television sets with flashy new models with new features like high definition and flat screens.There were roughly 32 million television sets sold in North America in 2004, for an average cost of $400, Mr. Gagnon said. The average size of a television was 27 inches. Today, 44 million sets are sold a year in North America, with an average cost of $460 and an average size of 38 inches.Consumers buy a new television set every seven years or so, and an average household owns 2.8 TVs, he said. While those numbers would suggest a bonanza for television manufacturers, Mr. Gagnon said the larger, more sophisticated sets were expensive to manufacture and cut into manufacturers’ profit margins.To help reduce costs, manufacturers invested heavily in sophisticated new factories or retrofitted old ones that were capable of cranking out more televisions at lower cost. The problem is that the factories became operational about the time the recession hit, creating a glut of televisions and forcing prices down.A strong yen, relative to the dollar, has further hurt Japanese manufacturers like Sony and Panasonic, while Korean manufacturers like Samsung have benefited from a weak won.Tablet devices like iPads that can be used like televisions are also cutting into sales.Ms. Patel, who makes her living from the TV industry, said she had a flat-panel TV and a couple of iPads in her household. “Guess what? The price of an iPad is the same as a 42-inch LCD TV. It is more personal, yet everyone can use it.”Despite the success of the iPad, Apple has not yet transformed the television in the same manner that it did music players and mobile phones, despite years of effort. Apple introduced a television accessory in 2007 that allowed users to stream iTunes content, but consumers were not enamored. Still, Steve Jobs vowed before his death to create a television with “the simplest user interface you can image.”Google, meanwhile, offered a second version of Google TV in October that includes apps so viewers can search cable and Web sites for movies and shows and even live concerts.At a conference in Paris this month, Google’s chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, boldly predicted that Google TV would be offered on the majority of new televisions by the summer.While it is too soon to know whether Apple or Google’s television ventures will succeed, Mr. Gagnon said traditional TV makers would be wise to focus on “a more intuitive user interface that just works right out of the box with other products.”“If Apple is going to enter the space, it certainly is going to raise the bar in terms of user experience,” he said. “Traditional TV makers will have some catching up to do.”1037 2011-12-27 ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani on Monday denied news reports that he was planning to dismiss the country’s army and intelligence commanders in the aftermath of tensions that have emerged over a controversial memo that claims the civilian government had sought American help in constraining the powerful Pakistani military.Last week, in an unusual outburst, Mr. Gilani had warned of conspiracies against the civilian government, accused the commanders of acting as “state within a state” and reminded them they were accountable to the parliament. The tone of his remarks suggested that dismissals were possible — the opposite of the message he sought to convey on Monday.Speculation about the government’s intentions dismiss the two commanders — Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, the head of the army, and Lt. Gen Ahmad Shuja Pasha, the head of Pakistan’s intelligence service, were fueled by news reports in the stridently anti-American press in Pakistan, where many people view the United States as an arrogant adversary instead of an ally.Any hints of clandestine collaboration between the civilian government and Washington represents potential political damage to Mr. Gilani and the president, Asif Ali Zardari, who is already unpopular.On Monday, The News, an English language daily known for aggressive reporting against the Mr. Gilani’s Pakistan Peoples Party, the majority party that runs the government, published a report titled “Is sacking of Generals Kayani and Pasha on the cards?”The speculative article, which carried no byline, claimed that United States officials had encouraged the civilian government to dismiss the two generals. The article said their removal would make it easier for the United States to impose its “desired strategy in the region”, a veiled reference to the Pakistani military’s differences with the United States over the conflict in neighboring Afghanistan.1038 2011-12-27 “Beyond the Raters” (editorial, Dec. 15) does not mention important points in the discussion of removing references to rating agencies from federal securities regulations, something we have long supported.First, any business model — issuer pays, investor pays or government pays — has the potential for conflicts of interest. What is important is how that potential is managed. Through regulation and voluntary actions, we have strengthened the safeguards we have in place to prevent such conflicts.Additionally, your editorial implies that ratings are assigned without transparent criteria. S.&P.’s criteria are publicly available and consistently applied. To further enhance the transparency of our ratings, we regularly request feedback on proposed criteria from market participants, including policy makers, issuers and investors.Before updating our criteria to rate banks, we recently reached out to more than 10,000 market participants and interacted with more than 2,500 of them around the world.S.&P. is committed to providing the market with a global benchmark of credit risk. We believe that the market — not government mandates — should decide the value of our work.1039 2011-12-27 A single blood pressure test, or even several readings over a short period of time, may not be enough to gauge the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.Many researchers predict a subject’s risk for cardiovascular risk with a single blood pressure reading, but a new study has tracked blood pressure over 14 years beginning at age 41 in more than 61,500 men and women, most not taking blood pressure medicine. The paper was published online last week in Circulation.Men who developed hypertension during middle age had a 70 percent lifetime risk of developing cardiovascular disease or stroke, compared with a risk of 35 percent among men who had lower blood pressure.Among women, those who had hypertension from age 41 through 55 had a lifetime risk of 49 percent, compared with 22 percent among middle-aged women with lower blood pressure.“This study has shown that changes in blood pressure early in middle age affect your lifetime risk,” said the lead author, Norrina Allen, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University. “We need to think about hypertension much earlier in life, around age 40.”About 30 percent of men and 40 percent of women had increasing blood pressure over the 14 years; about a fifth of men and a tenth of women had decreasing readings.1040 2011-12-27 A 49-year-old man built more like a wrestler than a runner, Galvan grew up in Williamsburg, and in the 1970s competed in the mile and two-mile events for Automotive High School. In the winter, the runners practiced indoors and often got sick from gas fumes, he said, so when spring rolled around, he and his teammates could not wait to hit the track. They would jog across Berry Street, through the park’s ball fields, across Driggs Avenue and onto the track, which, at the time, was 400 meters of dirt and cinders, much in the style of “Chariots of Fire.”“Over there,” Galvan said, gesturing at the 100-meter start line with his umbrella, “we ran sprints, 20, 30 at a time. Not easy for a distance runner who likes to cruise.” He laughed.It is no secret that athletes, particularly those who are no longer competitive, like to recount their most gut-wrenching moments. Stories about withstanding physical pain, fear and embarrassment initiate athletes into an order that age, ethnicity, gender or preferred sport cannot dismiss them from. The shared bravado is a necessary ingredient, of course, not just for surviving the rigors of training but also for tricking oneself into believing it is all worth it, or was.A high tolerance for irritation, it turns out, is also needed at the McCarren Park track sometimes.Built in 1910, the track served as one of its diverse neighborhood’s pulsing orbs of activity. When the pool opened across the street under the reign of Robert Moses in 1936 with a capacity for 6,800 people, the track served as a place to heat up before cooling down.Robin Perl, stretching in the ninth lane on a clear November afternoon, remembers the old days, when children in swimsuits would spill onto the track and the area was a hot spot for flirting and showing off.“Teenagers would walk from the track to the pool and launch themselves into the water wearing their construction boots — that was very cool — and the girls would swim with just their T-shirts, no bathing suits,” she said. “Anything might happen around here in those days.”An artist just out of college in the 1970s, Perl, for $600 a month, scored a 6,000-square-foot loft, where she still lives.“I ran often on the track,” she said, “but there’d be no more than five runners at a time — it was too dusty from the soccer players kicking up dirt.”The area, as the story goes in New York, has changed.“It used to pretty much be Spanish, Polish and Italian people here when I was growing up,” said a squatly built middle-aged racquetball player who did not wish to be named but was called Beyonce by his teammates.“We were in charge,” he said confidently, “but now with everything, well, changed, you see all races and ages.”In 2006, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation committed $1.7 million to resurfacing the track to rubber and transforming the field from a mess of muddy ruts and grassy clumps to a blanket of kryptonite green. In 2008, $1.1 million bought stadium lights and updated the cross-fit gym, the courts and the landscaping.No longer a two-season loop for die-hard athletes willing to twist an ankle, skin a knee or risk their mother’s annoyance by ruining their running shoes on the sloppy lanes, the track is now a place for those who need to move their bodies in any way, at any hour.Concentric circles of activity overlap from outside in, resonate, fuse, disconnect and then finally fade. Ringing the outer edge of the track are separate worlds unto themselves. Players toss silver balls on two pétanque courts. Nearby, break dancers spin in on themselves, galaxies of one, and the grass supports a single yoga practitioner, hugging himself tight in crow pose before shooting backward to plank.Shouting, grunting and slapping noises from the handball court grab the attention of Sean Keogh, an administrator and player for the Shamrock Soccer Club, which was formed in 1960. For a second he is distracted when he hears Beyonce cursing, goading his teammates to “hit the ball!” Athletic posturing and insults ensue. When Keogh shouts in his Irish accent to pipe down, the men yell back: “Hey! At least we bring our fights out into the open!”Keogh rolls his eyes, undisturbed by this tremor in the usual harmony of a Saturday at the track.Tommy Yagervich grips his racket and apologizes for his friend, who huffs his way back onto the court. “He’s Italian,” he said with a shrug.The track served as their backyard 40 years before, the daily ground for play, adventure, love, friendship and, now, most important, stress relief. Though they moved all over the region, from New Jersey to Queens, working mainly in the financial industry, they still meet at the track every weekend to play racquetball.In a few more decades, this old guard may be replaced by Szymon, Kevin and Patrick, 11-year-old friends from Greenpoint, who hang out at the track to work on their abs. Kevin talks as he crunches through situps. “My stomach never hurts when I do these,” he said without losing his breath. “Maybe ’cause I do 80 every day at home.”Kevin, they all agree, is the best at situps, but that does not mean they will not try to beat the record, which is 108. After 110, Patrick grimaces, exhales deeply, and lifts his T-shirt to examine his muscles. The others assure him that nothing much has changed. A cellphone rings, the boys roll their eyes in a universally adolescent “it’s-the-parents” expression, and Szymon answers in Polish, “Czesc!”Kiki Morris might toughen up those boys if he had the chance. A personal trainer, former boxer and athletic provocateur, Morris can flirt most ladies into joining his workout program. For 15 years by his count, and at least 25 by others, he has taken ownership of the cometlike tail of the track, near the start line to the 100-meter dash, guiding groups through his specialized “traditional tribal fitness” workouts. Twice a day, he tucks his long, black dreadlocks into a hooded sweatshirt and exhorts people to “get out of the gym and into great shape.”“Kiki is definitely the marathon mouth of the park,” said Robin Bowman, a photographer and park devotee. She had waved to Morris for years while walking her dog. One day, he called her over to the track with his wide smile. “Before I knew it, I had a jump rope in my hands,” she said, laughing. She has been training with him ever since.For $15 a class, he leads small groups through quick-changing, simple-seeming exercises that leave them doubled over and panting. Timed hand slaps, crouching sprints, sudden sets of push-ups and a ball-passing exercise that resembles confused planets in retrograde motion are all part of the secret recipe of a program he learned from his West African boxer grandfather.The groups include all ranges of fitness, age and ethnicity. Some do not speak English. Many are middle-aged, trying to stop, if not reverse, the aged softness of their bodies. Others are at-risk children he trains without charge from neighborhoods near and far.“Kiki teaches these kids lessons they will not learn anywhere else,” says Sean Banker, 37, an occasional assistant to Morris, a former boxer for the Marines and a commodities trader on Wall Street. “They work hard, they get tired, they carry the bags for him and learn respect — for themselves and others.”Baby Boot Camp, happening on the Cool Down tail of the track, just 100 meters from Morris, is a new addition to this track’s solar system. A stroller-based fitness camp, it invites mothers with newborns to gather and train their bodies back to prepregnancy strength. And to do it without needing a baby sitter. Using their babies as cooing medicine balls and the cutest barbells ever, these moms prep for road races like the Turkey Trot on Thanksgiving.Mike Camarra, 38, an owner of the franchise along with his wife, holds one of the fussy babies as a mother twists and bends. A new dad himself and a former day trader, he bounces the baby expertly and says, “I’ve never been happier going to work than I am now.”As the session ends, Camarra quotes the Warren Buffett line about how writing a check separates a commitment from a conversation.Kinga Marszal, 30, an employee at the Polish Consulate, nods her head and says: “It’s true. The motivation to get in shape is that I don’t waste my money.” After a pause, she adds, “Plus, I want my baby to see me as sporty.”Looking carefully to the left and then the right, the moms peel away from one another and join the momentum of the track. With the stroller sun shades guarding the babies, they keep to the outside lanes, watching for unexpected flying discs, soccer balls and water bottles.At 6:45 one morning, there are 31 people at the track, most of them runners, some of them walkers and one group of three in matching navy sweatsuits who stroll arm in arm. A father and his two children kick around a soccer ball before school. One man hits a tennis ball against a wall. A dog runs free near a crab apple tree.“Running here is like playing Paperboy,” Liam Harrison, 32, an animator, says. “You know, that 1980s video game? You better be prepared for all kinds of obstacles.”Harrison was a runner in high school but claims he took a break for 10 years to focus on his drinking. You would never know it, seeing him and others from the North Brooklyn Runners club ease gracefully out of the last lap of a 1,200-meter interval.“I once tripped over a little kid,” he said, holding out his hand to suggest the height of a toddler. “And I rolled hard, real hard. She seemed fine.”Ben Neilestuen, 29, an accountant training for a 50-mile race, adds: “How about the time right at dusk when I was doing a fast mile in Lane 1? At the last second, I realized a jump rope was spread across Lanes 1 to 5.”A few years back, members of the N.B.R. (who jokingly refer to themselves as the Nearby Ball Return because the soccer players often expect them to throw stray balls back onto the field) got together, petitioned Parks and Recreation to monitor the track more closely and wound up with painted lettering in Lanes 1 to 3 that read, “Runners Only.” The signs were printed in Polish, English and Spanish, the primary languages of the neighborhood.“It did absolutely nothing,” Liam said. “People were probably like: Oh, cool, Runners Only. Must be a new band.”Track users kept on doing what they were always doing in Lanes 1 to 3: catching up on phone calls, strolling in high heels, pushing an ice cream cart, kicking a soccer ball, testing a new skateboard, doing yoga.“Oh, yeah, I seen the lettering,” said Khairany, 56, who declined to give her last name, nodding vigorously and looking down at her usual garb of striped skirt, several sweaters and snow boots. “But I walk ’cause I need to walk.”Several runners squeeze between Khairany and the edge of the turf. She is unmoved, however, by their heavy breath and beads of sweat.“I walk until I can’t walk anymore,” she says. In June, after her boyfriend and her mother died and her own mental stability was in question, Khairany started going to the track for the first time, though she has lived in the neighborhood for decades.“I always knew it was here, but now I need it,” she said.“I don’t have to wonder where I’m going next,” she added, picking up one boot at a time as the lithe strides of marathon runners wing by. A small or giant step for this woman, no one can judge.Close to the center of the field, pigeons lift upward in unison, whirling in a centrifugal flock over a weekend crowd gathered to watch the Polonia Soccer Club play the Shamrocks. After a lap of their own, the pigeons settle down, drawn by the crumbs from spectators’ hot dog buns.“We come every Sunday after church,” said Pawel Galanty, 55, who plays in Polonia’s 40-and-up league.Antoni Trzaskowski, 70, a coach for the team, first played on the field in 1969 when he traveled from Poland with the national team. He was most valuable player that year and later got to face Pelé during a stint with the Rochester Lancers before eventually settling in Greenpoint. He shakes his head and remembers dragging his own goals to the muddy field, ignoring the shady corners and the drug deals, listening to the textile manufacturing warehouses on Bayard Street, and fighting with other teams over who owned the field.“Those were rough times,” he said. “We had no money or sponsors for the team back then, and so we’d go door to door in the neighborhood. We raised about two dollars and several jars of pickles.”The new field seemed like a miracle that fell from the sky, a meteorite changing the surface of the whole neighborhood. With permits now carefully issued by the parks department, the field runs in an organized fashion with soccer, football and Ultimate Frisbee teams sharing the space in relative peace.A few old friends from the Bushwick High School football team grumble that they can barely poach a corner to play because it is so busy, but mostly they are happy to have the spongy surface on which to dive and tackle.Not everyone feels as lighthearted about the renovation. Some turn a suspicious eye to the wealthy inhabitants of the nearby condominiums, completed just as the park renovation project was done.“The rich folks wouldn’t want to have to look at a bunch of immigrant kids sweating on a dirt field,” said Beyonce, one of the racquetball players.And one mother will not let her children near the field, claiming the turf is toxic. Children playing pickup football shake their pant legs, and handfuls of the black pebbles roll out. They slide and laugh, rolling into a pile of bodies. Nearby, two teenagers cuddle in each other’s arms while a friend does a somersault over them.With winter coming, some track inhabitants will move indoors. But others will not be able to resist the track, pulled by something as mysterious and ordinary as gravity.“I’ve been here a thousand times,” Galvan said from Lane 9, “but each time is like the first time. I guess I connect with that little kid who was me. He’s here, too, cheering me on.”1041 2011-12-27 JERUSALEM — The Israeli Parliament on Monday held its first public debate on whether to commemorate the Turkish genocide of Armenians nearly a century ago, an emotionally resonant and politically fraught topic for Israel, founded on the ashes of the Holocaust and trying to salvage frayed ties with Turkey.The session resulted from a rare confluence of political forces — an effort under way for decades by some on the left to get Israel to take a leading role in bringing attention to mass murder, combined with those on the right angry at how Turkey has criticized Israel over its policies toward the Palestinians.Previous efforts to declare one day a year a memorial for “the massacre of the Armenian people” have failed, and hearings on the topic were restricted to closed sessions of the Parliament’s defense and foreign affairs committee because of concerns over Turkey’s reaction, especially at a time when relations were friendlier.But with Turkey having recalled its ambassador from Tel Aviv, the hearing was moved this year to the education committee, where sessions are open. The debate was on live television.“As a people and as a country we stand and face the whole world with the highest moral demand that Holocaust denial is something human history cannot accept,” Reuven Rivlin, the speaker of the Parliament, who has favored official recognition of the genocide, said in his testimony. “Therefore we cannot deny the tragedy of others.”1042 2011-12-27 Tiny spiders have brains so large that they fill up their body cavities and extend into their legs, a new study reports.Researchers measured the central nervous systems of nine species of spiders in a range of sizes. While the smallest had smaller brains in absolute terms, relatively speaking their brains were enormous.“The basic trend was that the smaller the spider, the relatively larger its brain is,” said William Eberhard, a biologist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Costa Rica and an author of the study, which appears in the journal Arthropod Structure & Development.In the smallest spiders, Dr. Eberhard and his colleagues found, the central nervous systems filled nearly 80 percent of the cephalothorax, or body cavity, including 25 percent of the legs.“The brain tissue of the nervous tissue is metabolically expensive,” he said. “These little spiders are paying a very large price to keep these brains functioning.”At times, that price includes a deformed body cavity bulging with brain matter, which may in turn compromise the size of the digestive system, Dr. Eberhard said.1043 2011-12-27 This mission seems built into Mr. Safdie’s design, which consists of eight linked pavilions that border or span two large pools that are fed by the spring (and that unfortunately were empty and still being worked on when I visited this month). In a way that seems slightly confused, the arrangement evokes aspects of the Getty’s hilltop campus in Los Angeles, of Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater in western Pennsylvania and of a fancy theme park, minus the rides.But there is an undeniable brilliance to this physical dispersal; you are never far from the outdoors, never cocooned by a maze of galleries. Moving through the building becomes something of a tour of its remarkable setting.Meanwhile, the art on view defines the museum as foremost an exceptional if idiosyncratic picture gallery assembled by someone with a discerning and independent eye for paintings. The collection has an appealing aesthetic populism, which is to say that different paintings provide points of entry for different levels of sophistication, and their groupings offer the immediate means to sharpen that sophistication as you move from work to work.In the first two pavilions, which take art up to about 1900, there are sentimental genre paintings and splendid ones (Richard Caton Woodville’s 1848 “War News From Mexico”); facile Impressionist landscapes and earlier works whose robust paint handling almost seem to presage Impressionism (John La Farge’s “Hollyhocks” from around 1864-65). And there are plenty of things that will stop just about anyone in his tracks: John Singleton Copley’s shimmering portrait of Mrs. Theodore Atkinson Jr.; a fiery autumn landscape by Thomas Moran; Francis Guy’s panoramic “Winter Scene in Brooklyn”; George Inness’s great and stormy “Sunset on the River”; an impressively large and varied group of works by the Luminist Martin Johnson Heade; John Singer Sargent’s enigmatic portrait of the writer Robert Louis Stevenson and his wife; and a glowing depiction of an Indian encampment, set in a semitropical forest bathed in yellow light, by George Catlin.There is one huge blind spot in the collection up to 1900, and it is a very serious one in my book: the almost complete lack of paintings by largely self-taught or folk artists. This country’s folk art is as great and as original as any other art it has produced; its uncanny fusion of abstraction and representation, and of primitive and modern makes it the American equivalent of Sienese painting in the early Italian Renaissance. Leaving it out is like looking at the story of American art with only one eye.This absence results in a certain unopposed homogeneity dominated by a fairly academic quest for realism. I kept wishing for a quirky, flattened landscape or marine view by the great Thomas Chambers to disrupt the fussy verisimilitude and endless vistas of the Hudson River school paintings.In contrast, the galleries of early 20th-century art are enlivened by a healthy opposition of conflicting sensibilities and approaches, which is part of what makes them the museum’s most successful. Here the Ash Can School, American Scene painting and various degrees of Modernism, both abstract and representational, are constantly sparring. There are unfamiliar works, like George Bellows’ antiwar painting “The Return of the Useless” from 1918, a harrowing scene of German soldiers and Belgian forced laborers rendered in shades of red; and emblematic masterworks like Dove’s glimmering semi-abstraction “Moon and Sea II” from 1923; and Hartley’s tender painting of a blocky Acadian boxer from 1940.The galleries dominated by postwar American art are the most confused and arbitrary, but they also roil with different sensibilities. Major artists like Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Robert Rauschenberg and Jackson Pollock are mostly represented by works that are either small or perfunctory. The energy in this area comes largely from unexpectedly strong works by lesser artists, both realist and abstract, among them Grace Hartigan, Will Barnet, Wayne Thiebaud, Joan Mitchell, Gene Davis and Hale Woodruff and the eminently weird Janet Sobel, the self-taught artist who painted peasant-art motifs but also made dripped-paint abstractions before Pollock, who was aware of her work. Here she is represented by a large painting in which she does both at once.The works in this half of the museum can jump back and forth in time — in some cases almost to the beginning of the century. In a narrow side gallery devoted mostly to artists’ self-portraits and including striking works by Davis (1912), Oscar Bluemner (1933) and John Steuart Curry (1935), you’ll find a 1939 painting in which Ben Shahn portrays himself wearing spectator shoes and taking photographs near a group of black-clad churchgoers. Next to it hangs a small gray-on-gray study, from 2006, for one of the morose Photo Realist self-portraits that the Italian-born New York painter Rudolf Stingel has been making over the last decade. The juxtaposition doesn’t exactly make sense, but the very incongruity seems to announce, “Anything can happen here.”Crystal Bridges can boast of one piece of brand-new art that perfectly embodies its larger mission: James Turrell’s latest free-standing “Skyspace,” a circular stone structure with a domed roof open at the center for viewing the sky at dawn or sunset. Subtle shifts in the artificial lighting inside the dome conspire with the changing natural light to create a dazzling chromatic show. It may sound cheesy, but it works.Crystal Bridges is user friendly in ways big and small. Admission is free, and it has an ambitious education program that will, among other things, reach out to more than 80,000 elementary school students in the area. And in some of the interstices between its pavilions — where one might have been grimly prepared to see museum gift shops — it has areas outfitted with comfortable chairs and couches and stocked with stacks of art books for browsing.These elements, like the museum they are part of, convey the belief that art, like music and literature, is not a recreational luxury or the purview of the rich.

In what could serve as an early study of the effect of back-to-back games during the lockout-shortened season, they trailed, 28-11, after one quarter.“We’re learning on the fly,” Williams said. “We still don’t have a concept of the offense. We’re still making a lot of mistakes on defense, and our flaws are going to show up against teams that have been together and they have been together for years now.”Explaining the Nets’ ability to mount a comeback on Monday but not on Tuesday, Williams said, “That was the Wizards, this is the Hawks, that’s pretty much it.”The Hawks looked physically imposing and fresh in their season opener. Six players finished in double figures. Vladimir Radmanovic led the way with 17 points. Marvin Williams made a case that a 3-pointer early in the first quarter can be a backbreaker. Even though he only finished with 5 points, Josh Smith was loose and engaged, his athleticism a controlled weapon. An ageless Tracy McGrady attacked the rim. And Teague put the Hawks up by 52-30 at halftime by calmly hitting a long, stepback 3-pointer.“Defensively we were active,” Smith said. “Everyone was active. Even when the bench came in, they were active.”Humphries got a loud ovation from the crowd during player introductions, perhaps matched only by the ovation given to Deron Williams, and a “We love Humphries!” chant broke out after he scored his first points of the night.Humphries fielded questions before the game on the strange attention he has been receiving.Mostly joking, he suggested that the home fans might boo him too. “Maybe if that’s what they think motivates me, they’ll do it,” he said.Humphries’s treatment is the end product of the bizarre spectacles that took place at the Prudential Center last season, when Kardashian, then his girlfriend, often made her presence felt courtside.The Nets last season also capitalized on the reality TV boom by hosting the stars of “Jersey Shore.” On one bizarrely memorable evening last January, Nicole Polizzi, known as Snooki, the pint-size cultural touchstone of “Jersey Shore,” sat with Kardashian.But with the way the Hawks controlled the game, the Humphries appreciation party was never more than an appetizer.The former Yankee Bernie Williams played an acoustic rendition of the national anthem and a halftime concert with his band.1064 2011-12-28 CAIRO — An administrative court ruled Tuesday that the Egyptian military had wrongly violated the human rights of female demonstrators by subjecting them to “virginity tests” intended to humiliate them.The decision was the first to address a scandal arising from one of the military’s first crackdowns on protesters, on March 9, less than a month after it seized power with the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak. And the ruling was also the first time since the military takeover that a civilian court has attempted to exert judicial authority over the ruling generals, who have suspended the Constitution and set themselves up as the only source of law.Although members of the ruling military council have often denied imposing the “virginity tests,” the court said in its judgment that it relied in part on a June 27 report from Amnesty International in which a general on the council confirmed that women had been physically examined against their will. The general justified imposition of the tests to safeguard soldiers from being accused of raping women detainees.The court found that protecting against potential charges of rape was no justification for violating women’s bodies, according to a text of the ruling provided by the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, which helped argue the case.“These acts involve deliberate humiliation and intentional insult to women participating in protests,” the court said in its ruling, calling the military’s conduct of the tests “a criminal offense.”1065 2011-12-28 The battle has broadened and grown increasingly visible in recent weeks and months. Orthodox male soldiers walked out of a ceremony where female soldiers were singing, adhering to what they consider to be a religious prohibition against hearing a woman’s voice; women have been challenging the seating arrangements on strictly “kosher” buses serving ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods and some inter-city routes, where female passengers are expected to sit at the back.The virulent coercion in Beit Shemesh has been attributed mainly to a group of several hundred ultra-Orthodox extremists who came here from Jerusalem, known as the Sicarii, or daggermen, after a violent and stealthy faction of Jews who tried to expel the Romans in the decades before the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70.Religious extremism is hardly new to Israel, but the Sicarii and their bullying ilk push with a bold vigor that has yet to be fully explained. Certainly, Israel’s coalition politics have allowed the ultra-Orthodox parties to wield disproportionate power beyond the roughly 10 percent of the population they currently represent.The ultra-Orthodox community’s rapidly increasing numbers — thanks to extraordinarily high birthrates — may also have emboldened the hard core, as may have their insular neighborhoods. And their leadership appears to lack moderating brakes.In any case, the extremists have provoked an outpouring of opposition from all those who are more flexible, be they ultra-Orthodox, modern Orthodox, mainstream or secular. In fact, it was an ultra-Orthodox-led group that claimed at least part of the credit for making Naama’s story public.“We are working to save our city and to save our homes,” said Dov Lipman, 40, a local activist, rabbi and self-defined modern ultra-Orthodox, who moved to Beit Shemesh from Silver Spring, Md., seven years ago. Seizing on the public mood of rejecting ultra-Orthodox bullying, Mr. Lipman and a group of supporters have been lobbying the Israeli Parliament, organizing protests and recently hired a media consultant. He said that is how Naama’s story came out.Built near the ruins of an ancient city of that name mentioned in the Bible, Beit Shemesh was established in 1950, first drawing mostly poor immigrants from North Africa, then immigrants from Russia, Ethiopia and English-speaking countries. With the construction of the new neighborhoods of Ramat Beit Shemesh A and B in the 1990s, the ultra-Orthodox population boomed. Residents say 20,000 more planned housing units are earmarked for the ultra-Orthodox.In Ramat Beit Shemesh B, signs on the walls of buildings call for modesty, exhorting women and girls to dress in buttoned-up, long-sleeved blouses and long skirts. Outside a synagogue on Hazon Ish Street in the Kirya ha-Haredit quarter, a sign requested that females should cross to the opposite sidewalk and certainly not tarry outside the building.Naama’s school, Orot, opened in September in an area with a large community of English-speaking observant Jews that borders on the strictest ultra-orthodox neighborhoods. She quickly found she had to run a miserable gantlet to get to school, even dressed in long sleeves and long skirts.Riots broke out on Monday when the police accompanied media crews into Hazon Ish Street, the area where Naama’s tormentors are believed to have come from. Hundreds of black-garbed men and boys poured out of the synagogue and an adjacent seminary holding handwritten signs calling for the exclusion of women, illustrated with the male and female symbols used for public washrooms. One policeman was injured after being hit in the head with a rock and several arrests were made before the crowds dispersed at dusk.Many of the ultra-Orthodox agitators blamed the news media for the unrest, saying they had come into the ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods to sow hatred and to persecute the residents for their religious beliefs.Meanwhile, some residents insisted that Beit Shemesh was a tolerant city, but defended at least some gender separation and modesty on religious grounds.“I think women are very poorly treated in Western society,” said Cindy Feder, 57, a resident of Ramat Beit Shemesh A, who came to Israel from New York in 1970, and who defines herself as an “open haredi,” the Hebrew term for ultra-Orthodox. She said that the objectification of women on some billboards made her feel sick.In the more austere Ramat Beit Shemesh B, a 32-year-old mother of four defended the gender separation on public transportation, saying that it was necessary to preserve women’s honor on crowded buses that squeezed people like “tomato puree.”But the woman, who gave only her first name, Rivka, for fear of provoking the disapproval of her neighbors, also told a story that revealed the costs of separation: one night, the extremists came and removed all the public benches from the neighborhood, so that the women could no longer sit outside with their children in the street.1066 2011-12-28 “We’ve seen him in international competitions and in workouts,” Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said. “We have our opinions and are aware of what he can do, but other than that, I wouldn’t comment any more.”Certainly, all 30 clubs are well aware of Cespedes’s exploits: his speed in the 60-yard dash, his ability to track balls in center field and, most of all, his power to all fields as a right-handed slugger. Although Cespedes (pronounced CES-ped-es) has had only a few at-bats against major league pitching, in the World Baseball Classic, many talent evaluators think he could eventually separate himself from all previous position players who have defected over the past two decades from Fidel Castro’s Cuba.“He might be the best to come out of Cuba,” said Ismael Cruz, the Toronto Blue Jays’ special assistant to the general manager. “The question for everyone is how much you want to pay for that, and that is up to each team to decide.”Cespedes, whose mother, Estela Milanés, was a star pitcher on Cuba’s softball team at the 2000 Olympics, defected from Cuba on a speedboat after he broke the single-season home run record in the 2010-11 season. He and Jose Dariel Abreu, the Cuban league’s most valuable player, each hit 33 homers.Once he got to the Dominican Republic, Cespedes hired Adam Katz of the Wasserman Group to represent him. (If he had sought residency in the United States, he would be subject to baseball’s draft and therefore not be a free agent.) Cespedes’s management team in the Dominican Republic published an indulgent 20-minute video called “The Showcase,” which illuminated his undisputed athleticism and brute strength through his workout regimen, as well as highlights of him in a Cuban uniform crushing balls to all fields and flashing his magnetic smile.“I’m a lawyer representing baseball players and not a professional scout,” Katz said. “But the people in baseball that I’ve spoken to describe a toolsy player with exceptional ability. What I do know is that everything we’ve asked him to do so far he’s done with enthusiasm, passion and grace.”But as with Darvish, there is an element of mystery surrounding Cespedes because the recent records of Cuban defectors are mixed. Several, like Livan Hernandez, Orlando Hernandez and Kendry Morales, have become stars, while others, like Alay Soler, Leonys Martin and even Aroldis Chapman — currently a $30 million setup reliever — have not lived up to expectations.“Players from Cuba face a lot of challenges,” said Rene Gayo, the Pittsburgh Pirates’ director of Latin American scouting, who is the son of Cuban immigrants. “They can play, but they’ve been completely separated from the rest of the world, so they don’t know anything about Major League Baseball; the history, the culture. That’s an adjustment for them. But at the end of the day, it’s still hitting a round ball with a round bat.”Reports say Cespedes does that very well. Those who have seen him play for the Cuban national team, and in recent workouts in the Dominican Republic, issue universally favorable reports, although with nuances. All agree he can run, field, throw, hit for power and perhaps hit for average over time. Some assign higher grades in certain categories.One general manager referred to Cespedes’s five tools and said, “All of them are off the charts.” Others wonder if he can play center field in the majors, but one scout who has seen him play in competitions in four countries said he had uncanny defensive instincts and played with heart. The scout added that within “a few years, he will be one of the two or three best center fielders in baseball.” As for his speed, he has been rated as a 7 on a scale from 2 to 8.A few described an average to slightly above average arm, and said they wondered whether Cespedes would ever be a .300 hitter. A National League scout, who has seen Cespedes several times since 2008, projected him as a .270 hitter, with 25 home runs and 85 to 100 runs batted in. Not a superstar, but perhaps an All-Star.“He’s definitely a middle-of-the-order guy,” the scout said. “I’ve seen him for years now and I always used to say, ‘I hope he comes out.’ ”Perhaps the most logical destination for Cespedes would be Miami, where a large Cuban population might come out in volume to support him at the Marlins’ new downtown stadium. While some teams assess Cespedes’s value strictly in terms of his contributions on the field, he could also be a marketing boon for the Marlins.Meanwhile, Cespedes continues to work out in the Dominican Republic as he waits for his paperwork to come through and for the bidding to begin.1067 2011-12-28 A monthly survey released Tuesday shows consumers' confidence in the economy in December surged to the highest level since April and was near a post-recession peak.But a separate private report said home prices in most major cities in the United States fell for the second straight month in October.The New York-based Conference Board said that its Consumer Confidence Index rose almost 10 points to 64.5, up from a revised 55.2 in November. Analysts had expected 59.The surge builds on another big increase in November, when the index rose almost 15 points from the month before.Improving confidence is in line with retail reports of a decent holiday shopping season. Still, the December confidence reading is below the 90 level that indicates an economy on solid footing.1068 2011-12-28 Recipe for peppered duck breast with red wine sauce....1069 2011-12-28 DUBUQUE, Iowa -- Newt Gingrich has been aggressively outspent by rivals on television and radio ads that have done serious damage to his standing in polls, especially here in Iowa.

Some Oscar polls even include a red carpet category for forecasting actor-designer match-ups.In 2011, the Natalie Portman baby bump was the year’s hot topic. Starting with the Golden Globes (where she wore a blush Viktor & Rolf dress with a rose detail) and ending with the Oscars (where she collected the best-actress statuette clad in an off-the-shoulder maroon gown by Rodarte), Ms. Portman was a winner on all fronts.For other red-carpet regulars, minimalism was a dominant trend. Actresses like Gwyneth Paltrow, Claire Danes and Jennifer Lawrence chose bright but simplistic Calvin Klein gowns. For men — Robert Downey Jr., Christian Bale, Jeremy Renner — the look was navy and midnight-blue suits, tuxedos and ties, as well as monochromatic ensembles.Youth (not in the Botox sense) was also a hit this year. Hailee Steinfeld, Chloe Moretz and Elle Fanning all showed their flair for fashion, on the red carpet and off, donning sophisticated and often age-appropriate looks. At this rate they will undoubtedly be voted best dressed at their respective proms when they’re old enough to attend.For rule breakers like Helen Bonham Carter, Katie Perry and Nicki Minaj, getting “dressed up” has an alternative meaning.  Geoffrey Rush, like Samuel L. Jackson, never steps onto the crimson runway without a hat. They are all loyal to their aesthetics, and as a result, they don’t quite fit into a best or worst category. Their originality in a trend-obsessed world is refreshing if not entertaining.Here is a rundown of the best, the worst and the risk takers from 2011. Not every risk taken panned out, but all were discussion-worthy.1071 2011-12-29 Verizon Wireless will start charging a $2 fee to customers who use their credit cards to make one-time payments online or over the phone....1072 2011-12-29 Verizon Wireless will start charging a fee to customers who use their credit cards to make one-time payments online or over the phone....1073 2011-12-29 Verizon is preparing to charge a $2 ""convenience fee"" for customers who pay individual cellphone bills over the phone or on the Internet.

Moscow has previously reacted angrily when the State Department’s annual reports have accused Russia of human rights breaches. The department has expressed concern about attacks on rights activists and journalists, most of which go unpunished.1079 2011-12-29 Those sanctions have not focused on Iran’s oil exports. But in recent weeks, the European Union has talked openly of imposing a boycott on Iranian oil, and President Obama is preparing to sign legislation that, if fully enforced, could impose harsh penalties on all buyers of Iran’s oil, with the aim of severely impeding Iran’s ability to sell it.Rear Adm. Habibollah Sayyari, Iran’s naval commander, said in remarks carried by an official Iranian new site that “closing the Strait of Hormuz is very easy for Iranian naval forces.” Admiral Sayyari, whose forces were in the midst of ambitious war game exercises in waters near the Strait of Hormuz, was the second top Iranian official to make such a threat in 24 hours.A spokeswoman for the United States Navy’s Fifth Fleet, which is based in Bahrain and patrols the strait, responded: “Anyone who threatens to disrupt freedom of navigation in an international strait is clearly outside the community of nations; any disruption will not be tolerated.”The Strait of Hormuz, with two mile-wide channels for commercial shipping, connects the Gulf of Oman to the Persian Gulf, the principal loading point for oil shipped from Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest oil exporter.A Saudi official told The Associated Press that the other oil-producing gulf nations are prepared to fill any shortfall in Iranian oil supply. But just as unrest in Libya shook the oil market in 2011, concern over Iran could influence prices in 2012.Markets seemed to shrug off Iran’s threats. The price of the benchmark crude oil contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell for the first time in more than week, settling at $99.36 on Wednesday, down $1.98.But several investment banks predict that the price of the benchmark crude on the New York exchange will average about $110 next year while Brent crude oil, which analysts say affects what most of the world pays for oil, will average about $115 a barrel.“The possibility that there might be a disruption in oil supply at some time in 2012 as Iran retaliates has, I think, permanently embedded a $10 to $20 premium in the price of oil,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. “The danger is if oil starts to move toward $130 a barrel, or even higher, depending on whether that confrontation will escalate. Then you’re really talking about the prospect of the U.S. tipping over into recession in addition to Europe, and that the whole global economy will be facing an economic downturn.”Analysts say that members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, including Iran and Saudi Arabia, have an incentive to keep prices near $100 a barrel. Many governments in the Middle East and North Africa spent heavily on social assistance programs in response to the unrest of the Arab Spring and are depending on higher prices to help meet their budgets.“It would be nice if prices did come down quite substantially,” said Francisco Blanch, head of commodity strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who added that the chances were slim. “The idea that oil is going to stay high for a while is pretty well entrenched because this is a premium fuel in the world economy, there isn’t a lot of oil out there and whatever oil is available is pretty much off bounds.”Economists say they expect prices to remain high despite the relative weaknesses of the American and European economies because global demand for oil — especially diesel — is escalating and outstripping supply.“There’s a consensus view that high prices will persist through 2012 because of the premise that the rest of the world, the emerging economies, are using a lot more fuel,” said Tom Kloza, chief oil analyst at the Oil Price Information Service.At the same time, there is uncertainty in the forecasts, with some analysts predicting that prices could end up much lower as production increases in Libya and North America and could even drop sharply if the European economy falls apart. The United States Energy Information Administration, for instance, estimated this month that the price of the benchmark West Texas Intermediate, often called W.T.I., could fall as low as $49 a barrel or rise as high as $192 by the end of next year.Sustained triple-digit oil prices could threaten the United States recovery, costing jobs, raising the prices of food and other consumer goods and pushing a gallon of gasoline to $5 or more. By one estimate, a $10 increase in the price of a barrel of oil shaves 0.2 to 0.3 percentage points off the economy’s annual growth rate.Early this year, when W.T.I. crude oil finally reached $100 a barrel — the highest it had been in more than two years — the economy proved more resilient than in 2008, when crude crossed $100 a barrel and the country was mired in recession.This spring, oil prices peaked at about $114 a barrel and then fell, stabilizing well below many predictions — in part because the Arab Spring did not stop oil from flowing out of the Middle East to the extent that had been anticipated. Gas prices have been declining since May and gross domestic product, while still sluggish, grew throughout the year, according to the most recent Commerce Department estimates.Before 2008, gas prices had mainly stayed below $3 a gallon, and Americans were less focused on fuel economy, buying larger cars including S.U.V.’s. But after the price shock, when oil soared to $145 a barrel and average gas prices topped $4, many of those habits changed. Since then, gas prices have remained volatile, rising sharply toward the end of 2010 and the early part of this year before beginning to decline.New figures from the Federal Highway Administration show that Americans cut back on their driving again in October. They logged 2.3 percent less, or 254 billion miles, compared with October a year ago, the eighth consecutive month there has been a decline. A broader measure — the 12-month total of miles driven — shows that motorists fell back to the low of 2.963 trillion miles driven reached at the end of the recession in 2009.“It’s not just, I don’t have enough money, I don’t want to go out and buy gas,” said John Gamel, a macroeconomic analyst at MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse. “It’s, I have found ways not to have to buy gas and so I’m going to keep doing that.”He added that Americans had been doing less discretionary driving because they still perceived gas prices as being high. “Consumers have this belief that prices will either go up or they will remain at elevated levels.”1080 2011-12-29 Ms. Morgan said a city analysis found that the Education Department did not have proper documentation for all but 9,000 students during the 2007-8 and 2008-9 school years, a period covered retroactively by the new rules. The analysis shows, however, that even for those students, almost 20 percent of the $10 million in claims filed were rejected for not meeting the new criteria.In September, for the first time since 1988, when Congress allowed school districts to file for Medicaid reimbursements, the city put a manager in charge of handling the claims exclusively, one of several recent changes intended to improve collections.“We aggressively pursue reimbursements,” Ms. Morgan said, “and are working towards a long-term, streamlined solution that will allow us to receive money available to our students.”The new rules are part of a settlement in which New York City agreed to repay the federal government $100 million — and the state $332 million — after a 2005 audit unearthed myriad irregularities in its claims. They require school districts to file claims much as medical clinics do. For example, doctor’s orders must accompany individual claims, and districts must use specific codes for the types of services they provide. In addition, therapists are now required to hold higher levels of certification — levels which half of New York City’s speech teachers lack — and districts must provide annual training, and hire compliance officers.Other school districts are also struggling. Since counseling sessions led by guidance counselors and social workers are no longer eligible for reimbursement, Syracuse recently hired two licensed therapists, at a cost of $250,000. Even so, the district has been able to file only about one-quarter of the claims it once did, its chief financial officer, Suzanne Slack, said.“The new regulations nearly crippled us,” Ms. Slack said.But at a time of tight budgets and grim economic forecasts, many districts and states — each with its own set of filing rules — have invested heavily in compliance. Bruce Hunter, associate executive director for policy at the American Association of School Administrators, said the reimbursements, generally from 50 percent to 70 percent of the cost of a service, had become “an enormous help to school districts” across the country.In New Jersey, where the state treasury retains 65 percent of the reimbursements, filing the claims has been mandatory since 2008, and the state has set precise goals for its districts, including a 90 percent return rate on forms giving parental permission for schools to file on a child’s behalf. In Washington, Mayor asked the accounting firm Deloitte in February to suggest, among other things, ways to improve the system used by local schools to apply for reimbursements.Each of the 57 county-level school districts in , where 40 percent of the reimbursements are kept by the state, has had its own Medicaid coordinator for years. Their duties include hiring therapists and nurses whose certification meets federal requirements and, much like an attendant at a doctor’s office, keeping students’ up to date to ensure the claims are not disallowed, said Jane E. Reagan, a Medicaid specialist at the Michigan Education Department.“It’s a hassle, but once you’ve got the infrastructure and staff in place, the costs are almost always worth the benefit,” said Ms. Reagan, who is the president of the National Alliance for Medicaid in Education, a professional group.In , Buffalo hired a company to handle the claims; Syracuse sent social workers knocking on students’ doors to make sure their parents signed the required consent forms; and hired a consultant to train school bus monitors to note pickup and drop-off times for special-needs children, as mandated by the new rules, which district officials estimate will lead to $100,000 in additional claims each year.“We’ll be able to put more teachers in the classroom and more staff in our schools without costing the local taxpayer any additional money,” said Yvette Goorevitch, New Rochelle’s director of special and alternative education.But in New York City, according to a September letter from the State Health Department, officials were still submitting some claims using forms that are no longer accepted. A second state audit, released in April, showed that many of the city’s claims in 2009 were missing documentation or showed incorrect dates for services, forcing the Education Department to return $87,000 as a result.The borough president, , wrote to , the schools chancellor, in October, criticizing the city for failing “for years to apply in an organized fashion” for the reimbursements. “Funding for public schools have been cut to the bone, and it’s unconscionable that the D.O.E. will leave millions of dollars on the table,” Mr. Stringer, a mayoral hopeful, said in an interview.Ms. Morgan, the spokeswoman, said the city was working on the problems. In addition to putting a manager in charge of the claims, the department hired a Medicaid compliance officer last year. This fall, it added 15 doctors, who are paid about $60 an hour, plus some benefits, to work approximately four hours each week writing the service orders that must be attached to each claim. It also hired three medical consultants who are paid $110 an hour, without benefits, to do the same work.The department has also screened therapists to determine whether they have the appropriate certification, and whether the services they provide are eligible for reimbursement. It has offered compliance training to more than 16,000 therapists, supervisors, outside providers and finance staff.And it has spent $80 million to build a database — the Special Education Student Information System — that it hopes will make filing claims easier by making prescriptions, treatment plans and schedules of services readily available. Many teachers and principals, however, have complained about the time it takes to load the database and how often it crashes.1081 2011-12-29 “Verizon’s Worrisome Cable Deals” (editorial, Dec. 25) doesn’t mention several important points about Verizon’s agreement with cable companies.First, this spectrum sale is in line with both the Federal Communications Commission’s and the Obama administration’s goal to “unlock the value of otherwise underutilized spectrum” and quickly provide tens of millions of wireless users the network capacity they demand and require to use their wireless devices.Second, the Verizon cable agreements create new competition. American cable companies can offer wireless services bundled with landline, Internet and video services, the so-called quadruple play, and compete against others offering similar bundles. Verizon provides wireline services in only 12 states.Third, the editorial claims that the wireless market isn’t competitive. This is simply not true. In virtually every category, choices and use of wireless services have grown, while prices for those services have gone down. These agreements will further increase retail competition, arming cable companies with access to wireless services they can sell to their customers.1082 2011-12-29 It was with great pleasure that I read “Trumbo Gets His Due for ‘Roman Holiday’ ” (ArtsBeat, Dec. 21). Although it has been said that justice delayed is justice denied, in this case that maxim does not apply.Dalton Trumbo was my friend and one of the finest screenwriters of the 20th century. He told me that because he was blacklisted, he couldn’t sell “Roman Holiday” under his own name.In 1959, when I broke the blacklist and gave Dalton Trumbo screen credit for writing “Spartacus,” it was one of the proudest decisions of my life.I congratulate the Writers Guild of America, West; Tim Hunter, son of the screenwriter who received the credit for “Roman Holiday”; and the late Christopher Trumbo, Dalton’s son, for working tirelessly to see that justice was finally done.1083 2011-12-29 “The cake’s just spicy now,” said Fatima Abbas, as she and her two daughters plugged their noses with napkins and continued sharing a slice of blueberry cheesecake. “We’re used to the flavor.”Bahrain is the tiny island nation where the United States bases the Navy’s Fifth Fleet and where a royal family and its allies have brutally crushed a pro-democracy uprising. The island is governed by a Sunni family, the Khalifas, with ties not only to Washington, but also to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The country is majority Shiite, a religious sect that complains it has been systematically marginalized and discriminated against in jobs, education and governance in Bahrain. When the Arab Spring broke out, the Shiites, with some Sunni allies, took to the streets in huge numbers, demanding fair elections for Parliament and a true constitutional democracy.The repression has hardly let up ever since, even as the kingdom says it is instituting reforms. And with no place to legally organize, this coffee shop has become an unlikely gathering place for human rights activists and opposition leaders. Indeed, the manager says business has recently increased by 50 percent.“We disappeared because we had never seen tanks and bullets,” said Ala’a Shehabi, 31, an economics lecturer who avoided the cafe until recently. “But now we have removed the cape of fear and come into the public once again.”The assembled have grown accustomed to sipping lattes with gingerbread syrup, a drop of marshmallow and a less desirable side serving of tear gas. But even this patient lot has its limits, and when the riot police fired a second time, and the familiar burn of tear gas struck, tempers boiled over.“For how long are we going to be patient, patient, patient?” shouted Fatan, a young woman draped in a Bahraini flag who was afraid to give her last name.“We’re tired of tolerating, tolerating. They kill, and we tolerate. More deaths, and we tolerate. They hit, and we tolerate. Our heart is melting into ash.”The uprising here began in February when many thousands of Bahrainis camped at the iconic Pearl Square demanding democracy. That initial burst of enthusiasm came to a sudden halt when Bahrain unleashed its security forces, some firing live ammunition, targeting protesters with widespread arrests and torture, according to a government-commissioned report.For its part, the government has chided these protesters as anti-Bahraini, and blamed them for disturbing the peaceful majority who “are fed up and just want to go back to some normalcy,” said Abdul-Aziz bin Mubarak al-Khalifa, an official in the information affairs department, and like most top officials, also a member of the royal family.“Their message is ‘our way or the highway,’ ” he said.Terrified of repercussions, the opposition dispersed. But in the past few months, Costa Coffee has emerged as a relative safe haven of dissent. So now, instead of the mass protests once held in the street, the opposition has been partly reduced to a smattering of activists nestled in the corner of a shopping mall that plays Mariah Carey’s “All I Want for Christmas Is You.”“Don’t think I’m just sipping coffee,” said Mazin Madhloom, 27, offering a wink. “It’s like being undercover. If something happens, I’ll participate,” he said referring to the nearby villages.The clashes at Costa — which activists said is bugged and frequented by intelligence agents whom they call “moles”— also highlight how the kingdom feels threatened by even the most benign dissent. Costa’s customers include the elite, antigovernment posters on Twitter, who use Costa as a command center, and street protesters seeking a caffeinated refuge from their nightly clashes with the police in nearby villages.The same faces appear here almost nightly. Nearly everyone is Shiite, knows one another, and speaks fluent English. They table-hop inquiring about friends and relatives in prison. Many received grants to study in the United States.This surreal scene in which activists gather at a cafe with high-speed Internet to a backdrop of tear gas illustrates the contradictions of Bahrain — a cosmopolitan, successful banking center with a well-educated population that is facing crushing repression and sectarian tension.“We want to see the truth live,” said a middle-aged man who refused to give his name, citing fear of government retaliation. He comes to the cafe twice a week with his three children to post on Twitter from an anonymous account.“It’s kind of a challenge to be here,” he added.At night, the police are almost permanently stationed outside Costa, which offers a front-row seat of Budaiya Highway, the road that cuts through several Shiite villages. On this day, which happened to be National Police Day, one of the country’s more celebrated online activists, Zainab al-Khawaja, was peacefully protesting when the police dragged her into a vehicle and charged her with illegal assembly. Many of her friends recorded the event on video — from Costa’s leather sofas.Costa’s manager, Ahmed Mbarak, who is from Kenya, said it was the “the worst day yet.”Two days later, it became worse, still, when hundreds of police officers used batons to beat their way through Costa’s patio, clubbing customers along the way.But the violence, and the attacks, seem to simply draw more customers.Ahmad al-Hawaj, 20, said he brought his 15-year-old brother to Costa regularly. “My brother is the next generation,” he said over hot chocolate. “He must learn, and on TV they don’t show what really happens.”1084 2011-12-29 The Romney campaign has recruited volunteers in the business community, who they hope can spread Mr. Romney’s message to others.And in a sign that Mr. Romney believes his strategy is working and that he can finish strong in Iowa, his campaign introduced a new television advertisement here on Monday, promoting both his economic vision and his family values. Mr. Romney also plans to spend New Year’s Eve in the state.“I just want to do well here,” Mr. Romney said Wednesday at a campaign stop here. “I’m happy that I’m getting an enthusiastic response, but I’ve got no predictions for where we’ll end up in the tally.”He added, “But I feel like it’s going to be a strong showing.”Roger Underwood, 53, owns three medium-size agricultural businesses and is exactly the sort of community leader the Romney team wants to recruit.  In 2008, he supported Fred Thompson of Tennessee, and this year he served as a state co-chairman of the presidential campaign of Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor, until he dropped out of the race. Mr. Underwood joined the Romney team about a month ago, and estimates that he has already talked to as many as 60 people about Mr. Romney.“I’ll identify people who are leaders in agribusiness, and I’ll reach out to them and make sure they understand who Governor Romney is, and what Governor Romney is trying to communicate to people,” Mr. Underwood said. “It’s a trickle-down effect and a trickle-up effect and a trickle-across effect — and really trickle everywhere, I guess.”The “trickle everywhere” idea grew out of a business roundtable that Mr. Romney hosted in Pella, Iowa, in August. Mr. Romney and his aides were shocked to realize that he had met only half of the business leaders seated around the table. His Iowa staff members pored through directories for business organizations, identifying leaders and influential community members in four main areas: agribusiness, manufacturing, community banks and rural cooperatives.Now, more than 100 business and community leaders have joined Mr. Romney’s volunteer army — lobbying for him in both formal and informal ways, and speaking on his behalf on caucus night.“These are people who can articulate Governor Romney’s concerns,” said Kent Lucken, an international banker from Boston and a top foreign policy adviser and contributor to Mr. Romney.Once such supporters are in the Romney network, staff members can send them mailers and e-mail, provide them with lists of names to call and include them on tele-town halls. There have also been about half a dozen conference calls, including one that Mr. Romney joined.The approach in Iowa — winning over persuadable voters, rather than investing time and resources into wooing those who may never cast a Romney ballot — is also a reflection of the campaign’s national strategy, which merges Mr. Romney’s experience in the private sector with current problems facing the country (jobs and the economy). Four years ago, Mr. Romney tried a three-legged stool approach: aggressively wooing foreign policy conservatives, social conservatives and economic conservatives. Today, he has narrowed his focus to economic issues.That singular approach may also appeal to evangelicals or social issue voters, aides said.“A lot of business leaders are social conservatives, and the question is: How do you engage them?” Mr. Lucken said. “When you talk to them about jobs and the economy, over-taxation and burdensome regulation, they light up. They can still be concerned about social issues, or be evangelicals at heart, but with a candidate who understands the economy, this is a much better way to lead the conversation with voters.”For Ron Pierson, the former chief executive of Hy-Vee, an employee-owned supermarket chain headquartered in Iowa, helping Mr. Romney was an easy decision.“I’m very strong with his business background, and I think that’s way over-needed in the White House,” Mr. Pierson said. “I’ve been very vocal that I’m a Romney supporter.”Mr. Pierson said he had talked up Mr. Romney at the weekly breakfast meeting he attends with 75 other men, chats about him to members of the various boards and committees with which he is involved and even tried to persuade some neighbors at a recent Christmas party to support Mr. Romney.They were Newt Gingrich supporters, he explained, and he was not sure he had changed their minds. “But at least I made them think about it a little bit,” he said.1085 2011-12-29 Gus Modern will take 15 percent off furniture and accessories in January (the Atwood sectional, pictured, originally $3,199, will be about $2,719; the Carmichael Loft sofa, normally $1,999, about $1,699); gusmodern.com.Some desk accessories, books and home furnishings are up to 50 percent off at the MoMA Store (the memo canisters, regularly $40, are about $29; the salad server set, originally $35, is about $25); (800) 447-6662 or momastore.org.Some lamps by Michele De Lucchi, Vico Magistretti and others are up to 30 percent off at Artemide through Saturday (the Tolomeo Classic, usually $420, is $315 ; the Dalù, originally $110, is $85); 46 Greene Street (Broome Street); (212) 925-1588 or artemide.net.Many napkins, place mats and table linens are up to 40 percent off at Ann Gish through Jan. 7 (the Mariana place mat, originally $190 for four, is $130; the linen tie napkin, normally $135 for four, is $95); 4 West 20th Street; (212) 727-2122 or anngish.com.Good deals may be reported to deals@nytimes.com.1086 2011-12-29 Credit: Deidre Schoo for The New York Times1087 2011-12-29 Mr. Naryshkin moved to Parliament, where he will be speaker, representing the United Russia Party.In another change, Russia’s envoy to NATO, Dmitri O. Rogozin, who is known as irascible and an outspoken nationalist and who once hung a poster of Stalin in his office in Brussels, was appointed a deputy prime minister overseeing the military-industrial complex.Finally, the Kremlin’s deputy chief of staff, Vladislav Y. Surkov, who had overseen domestic politics, moved to a deputy prime minister’s position in the cabinet. He was replaced by Mr. Putin’s former chief of staff in the prime minister’s office, Vyacheslav Volodin, a loyalist who helped form a pro-Putin national political movement this year called the People’s Front.Interpreting the meaning of these changes is an admittedly imprecise science — akin to the now-dated practice in Kremlinology of analyzing the position of bureaucrats on Lenin’s Mausoleum during parades.All the same, critics of Mr. Putin say they contradict the promises of reform. The appointment of Mr. Ivanov in particular appears a retort to demonstrators.“Hopes of some Russians that this regime can change through education, proper instruction or with convincing arguments are unfounded,” Andrei N. Illarionov, a former economic adviser to Mr. Putin, wrote in a blog post this week. “All hopes in its ability to evolve in the direction of democracy and liberalization collapsed.”Dmitri B. Oreshkin, a member of a presidential advisory panel on human rights, said the appointees are “men who act directly, decisively and in the Soviet style: If you are against us, you will receive a blow to the forehead.”After the first of two protests in Moscow that were the largest street demonstrations since Mr. Putin came to power, Mr. Medvedev had offered in a speech that he would restore direct elections for governors, ease the rules on registering political parties and transform state television into public television. These changes were held up as concessions.Mr. Putin, for his part, on Wednesday told Russian journalists at a gathering for the New Year’s holiday that “there has to be dialogue” with the opposition and “I will think in what form it can take place.” But he made it clear that was not about to happen anytime soon.Mr. Ivanov and Mr. Putin have said they are acquainted from work in the Leningrad office of the K.G.B. in the 1980s. Mr. Ivanov, a former minister of defense, is so close to Mr. Putin that he had been considered a plausible successor to the presidency in 2008, before Mr. Putin endorsed Mr. Medvedev instead.Mr. Rogozin was promoted to deputy prime minister in charge of weapons manufacturing.He said after Mr. Medvedev announced his appointment at a meeting in the Gorky residence outside Moscow that he would use an “iron fist” to whip the sector into shape as Russia sets out on a major rearmament program.“That’s how it should be done,” Mr. Medvedev responded.1088 2011-12-29 LOOKING BACK Ms. Reinert blames the refinancing: “It’s what did us in. Back then, we didn’t anticipate things slowing down.” Today, the Reinerts run KR Construction, which does handyman jobs. Ms. Reinert also works at a local restaurant, and Mr. Reinert plays bass in a Beatles tribute band, Dr. Robert.Just Moulding, based in Gaithersburg, Md., sold and installed decorative molding. It opened in 2004 and closed last April.AT ITS PEAK Mark Rubin and Kevin Wales started with a single workshop that handled small jobs larger installers did not want. In 2007 things were going so well they decided to sell franchises in the business and raised $700,000 from 21 investors. After Mr. Wales left the company in 2010, Mr. Rubin’s father-in-law, Richard Hayman, took over as president. Soon after, sales increased by 20 percent and the company became profitable.WHAT WENT WRONG The recession. The company, Mr. Hayman said, sold a product that people wanted but did not need: “It was crown molding, not a furnace or a roof.” And while the business had the high legal and accounting costs associated with selling franchises, it had sold only three by the end of 2009. Potential franchisees had trouble raising the $100,000 to $250,000 needed to get started.LOOKING BACK “We did everything right,” said Mr. Hayman, who sank $470,000 into the company. “We hired the best people and had a great product. We could not overcome the bad economy.” He and Mr. Rubin declined to discuss what they are doing now.When 1% Is a Lot of MoneyP & H Capital, a commercial mortgage company in Brooklyn that specialized in finding loans for small businesses, opened in 2009 and closed last March.AT ITS PEAK Shawn Porat and Ismail Humet started P & H Capital with $4,000 while Mr. Humet was working as a Wall Street analyst and Mr. Porat was running Recovery of Judgment, which helps clients collect legal judgments. The friends saw the subprime crisis and tightening of credit as an opportunity, believing they could match small businesses with lenders offering alternative financing. In January 2010, Mr. Humet and Mr. Porat were piecing together a $500 million deal that they believed had a good chance of working. “Our commission was 1 percent,” Mr. Humet said, “and 1 percent of $500 million is a lot of money.”WHAT WENT WRONG For one thing, the big deal fell apart. Lenders were skittish because the money would be used to build a factory in Asia, Mr. Humet said, and they were wary of dealing with a foreign government. In addition, lenders wound up imposing stricter parameters for alternative loans. He also said that P & H clients often had unrealistic expectations about how much money they could get. “We had a restaurant owner that needed $300,000 to open another location, but we could only get him $150,000,” Mr. Humet said. “He didn’t go through with it.”LOOKING BACK Mr. Humet said he and Mr. Porat did not anticipate how difficult it would be to place even their best applicant’s loans. Since closing P & H, Mr. Humet has helped start MyFreebeez.com, which promotes small businesses online using free giveaways. Mr. Porat operates Recovery of Judgment and Judgment Marketplace, an online marketplace where monetary judgments can be bought, sold and traded.ScooterFood, a maker of all-natural dog food based in Brooklyn, opened in 2006 and closed last August.AT ITS PEAK Shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, Michelle Lewis found herself unemployed when the online art gallery where she worked — in the shadow of the World Trade Center — went out of business. An animal lover with time on her hands, she began cooking all-natural meals for her dog, Scooter Mae, who did not like canned food. Friends suggested she turn the meals into a business, and in 2006, she started ScooterFood. The company was promising enough to win a second prize award of $5,000 at the PowerUP! Business Plan Competition at the Brooklyn Public Library in 2006.WHAT WENT WRONG Ms. Lewis said her business plan was more hopeful than it should have been. Because her food was perishable, she sold it frozen — but did not realize that in 2006 few pet stores had freezer space. In part because frozen food was expensive to ship, ScooterFood was priced higher than other dog foods.LOOKING BACK Ms. Lewis said she should not have done her own bookkeeping: “I didn’t project my costs well and never really knew if my revenue was covering them.” Over five years she invested about $60,000. With a clearer picture, she said, she might have closed the business sooner. In September, Ms. Lewis started Spoonable, a line of caramel sauces. She has hired outside bookkeeping help.SmartyVA was an online training program for virtual assistants who specialize in social media management that was based in San Luis Obispo, Calif. It opened in 2009 and closed last February.AT ITS PEAK In 2009 Starr Hall, a public relations consultant who was overwhelmed with requests for social media help, saw an opportunity. She invested $10,000 to create SmartyVA training materials and a Web site with a search engine that aggregated job leads. The six-week training program cost $1,000 and was aimed at stay-at-home mothers and disenfranchised women, like victims of domestic violence. When graduates took jobs through leads on the site, SmartyVA received 10 percent of their earnings. The company generated $100,000 in revenue its first six months.WHAT WENT WRONG SmartyVA’s profitability depended on graduates following up on job leads they received through the system. “A hundred virtual assistants finished the program, but only 21 of them were working,” Ms. Hall said. “If all of them had been working, profits would have been huge.”LOOKING BACK “I didn’t anticipate how different the mindset of the women I was training was from my own,” she said. Ms. Hall has returned to consulting. Her new book is, “The Social Wave: Why Your Business Is Wiping Out with Social Media and How to Fix It.”1089 2011-12-29 “It was important for us to know that there would not be any animals harmed in the development or testing of our product,” said the co-founder of Dr.’s Remedy, Adam Cirlincione, a podiatrist in New York.Consumers seem to agree, said Nancy Beck, a former science and policy adviser for the physicians’ group, who conducted a report on the topic while working there. “Part of it is awareness about the issue in general,” said Dr. Beck, who has a doctorate in microbiology and immunology. “Science has evolved, and we have the technology now that maybe we didn’t have 30 or 40 years ago to do safety assessments without using animals. So having the methods in place, and companies bothering to take the time and making the investment into developing new methods, has a lot to do with it, too.”But while some companies have stopped testing on animals, getting them to do so hasn’t been easy. “It’s hard to get them to talk to you,” Dr, Beck said. “You start out by writing a letter: ‘We’d love to talk to you about your approach to testing and could we meet?’ Usually you don’t hear back.”On March 11, 2009, the European Union banned cosmetics and personal-products companies from testing their products on animals for things like skin irritancy, sensitivity to light and acute toxicity. The decision also banned the import of cosmetics containing ingredients that have been animal-tested in this way. By March 11, 2013, companies will be forbidden from further tests designed to establish longer-term toxicity.But no such laws exist in the United States. The closest is the Safe Cosmetics Act of 2011, which was introduced on June 24, 2011, (it has yet to be adopted) and encourages, among other things, the development of alternatives to animal testing.That isn’t sufficient for Vicki Katrinak, the administrator for the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics, a consortium of animal protection groups (including the Humane Society of the United States, the Doris Day Animal League and the American Anti-Vivisection Society) in Jenkintown, Pa. “We are worried that without a full ban being incorporated into the language of that bill, there will be more testing,” she said.What’s more, the “cruelty-free” label that some personal-care products and cosmetics companies have adopted doesn’t have a universally agreed-upon meaning. “The F.D.A. says on its Web site that companies can make any claim about their animal testing policies because there is no regulated definition of what is cruelty-free,” Ms. Katrinak said.Companies may say their products are “cruelty-free” or “not tested on animals,” she said, but their claims might refer only to the finished product, and not to specific ingredients (the bulk of animal testing happens on the ingredient level). Or they hire outside laboratories to do the testing for them.Even “all-natural” claims are confusing. Michelle Larner, a makeup artist in New York, thought she was using only products not tested on animals because she favors lines aimed at customers with sensitive skin. But then she went to the Web site of the advocacy organization People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which lists companies that do and don’t test on animals.“I saw a few brands that fall into the ‘natural’ range that I just assumed would be cruelty-free,” she said. She was dismayed to discover that “everything I use, from mascara, toothpaste, deodorant and feminine products were on the list. Even my laundry cleaning products are on this ‘yes’ list.”A majority of items made without animal testing are independent brands that are not readily available at chain drugstores, department stores or specialty stores, she added. It also would be easier “if the products had a disclaimer saying, ‘Yes, we test on animals,’ ” Ms. Larner said. “I would not buy it.""Some organizations have been trying to change that. PETA licenses its “cruelty-free bunny” logo.Leaping Bunny, a program run by the Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics, licenses a rabbit logo to companies the organization has certified as cruelty-free. It also provides consumers with a list of these companies.So far, about a third of the 400 certified companies use the logo, said Ms. Katrinak, including Burt’s Bees, Tom’s of Maine, the Body Shop and Urban Decay. Not everyone, though, thinks that eliminating animal research entirely is feasible. “Most ingredients in cosmetic products were tested long ago, so very little testing is done nowadays,” said Frankie Trull, president of the Foundation for Biomedical Research, which promotes humane and responsible animal research. But “in some cases, animal models are still a necessary part of ensuring ingredients will not cause harm to people.”Ms. Bauer, who favors Almay and bareFaced Mineral Cosmetics, is unmoved by this argument. She often checks PETA’s Web site to see which products do and don’t test on animals.“It takes five minutes to go through this list,” she said. “Sometimes the non-tested are more organic and natural. Sometimes they’re even cheaper.”1090 2011-12-29 Updated 4:36 p.m. |  Minutes before a single-engine plane crashed onto Interstate 287 in northern New Jersey last week, its pilot radioed air-traffic control to say that he was in ''icing conditions'' and requested clearance to climb higher, accor...1091 2011-12-30 Credit: Eric Michael Johnson for The New York Times1092 2011-12-30 Jonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, has been named a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for a long list of achievements in shaping the look of Apple products, incl...1093 2011-12-30 Jonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, has been named a Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for a long list of achievements in shaping the look of Apple products, incl...1094 2011-12-30 ""I look forward to getting this job, and I think I will,"" a confident Mitt Romney tells a receptive audience in New Hampshire....1095 2011-12-30 ""I look forward to getting this job, and I think I will,"" a confident Mitt Romney tells a receptive audience in New Hampshire....1096 2011-12-30 An example of how companies can treat stock options and yield a tax benefit....1097 2011-12-30 An example of how companies can treat stock options and yield a tax benefit....1098 2011-12-30 The second set of answers to readers' questions posed to our visiting expert, William Berloni, a theatrical animal trainer and the director of animal behavior for the Humane Society of New York....1099 2011-12-30 The second set of answers to readers' questions posed to our visiting expert, William Berloni, a theatrical animal trainer and the director of animal behavior for the Humane Society of New York....1100 2011-12-30 It was a down year for the American stock market, at least by one measure.

At today’s price of about $1.80 a share, the value of those options has risen to $165 million from the $35 million reported by the company as a compensation expense on its financial books when they were issued.If he exercises and sells at that price, Mr. Karmazin would of course owe taxes on the $165 million as ordinary income. The company, meanwhile, would be entitled to deduct the full $165 million as compensation on its tax return, as if it had paid that amount in cash. That could reduce its federal tax bill by an estimated $57 million, at the top corporate tax rate.SiriusXM did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Dozens of other major corporations doled out unusually large grants of stock options in late 2008 and 2009 — including Ford, , , and — and soon may be eligible for corresponding tax breaks.Executive compensation experts say that barring another market collapse, the payouts to executives — and tax benefits for the companies — will run well into the billions of dollars in the coming years. Indeed, of the billions of shares worth of options issued after the crisis, only about 11 million have thus far been exercised, according to data compiled by InsiderScore, a consulting firm that compiles regulatory filings on insider stock sales.“These options gave executives a highly leveraged bet that stock prices would rebound from their 2008 and 2009 lows, and are now rewarding them for rising tides rather than performance,” said Robert J. Jackson Jr., an associate professor of law at Columbia who worked as an adviser to the office that oversaw compensation of executives at companies receiving federal bailout money. “The tax code does nothing to ensure that these rewards go only to executives who have created sustainable long-term value.”For some companies, awarding stock options can seem like a tempting bargain, since there is no cash outlay and the tax benefits can exceed the original cost.Under standard accounting rules, companies calculate the fair market value of the options on the date they are granted and report that value as an expense, disclosed in regulatory filings. But the allows companies to claim a tax deduction for any increase in value when those options are exercised, usually years later at a much higher price. The tax savings are listed in regulatory filings as “excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.”For most companies, the primary advantage of using options is that options allow them to award large bonuses without actually depleting their cash, said Alan J. Straus, a New York tax lawyer and accountant. “But the tax treatment is a nice bonus,” he said. “It’s the only form of compensation where a company can get a deduction without having to come up with cash.”Some corporate watchdog groups, and a few members of Congress, call the corporate tax deduction an expensive loophole.Many tax lawyers and accountants counter that the tax deduction is justifiable because the options represent a real cost to the company. And because the executives who exercise their options are taxed at high individual rates, the companies say that a change would result in an unfair form of double taxation.Yet even those who support the existing tax policy say it was opportunistic for executives to avail themselves of big increases in stock options — which are supposed to be a performance-based reward — when a marketwide collapse meant that most companies’ stock price seemed destined to go up.The increases in the value of options granted during the financial crisis would not just cost the . Shareholder advocates and corporate governance experts say they come at the expense of other investors, too, whose stake in the company is diluted.Well before the market downturn, hundreds of American corporations reduced their tax bills by billions of dollars a year through their shrewd use of stock options. A decade ago, companies like and were widely criticized because their stock options created such big deductions that, in some years, they paid no federal taxes at all. When shareholders and regulators complained about the excessive use of stock options, Microsoft temporarily stopped issuing them in 2003.From 2005 to 2008, reported that the options exercised by its employees cut its federal income tax bill by more than $1.6 billion. Stock options reduced Goldman Sachs’s federal income tax bill by $1.8 billion during that period, and ’s by nearly $850 million, according to filings by the companies.Companies say the tax treatment is justified because they are deducting the cost of paying an employee, just as they would if they paid a salary in cash.Senator , a Democrat, has tried for nearly a decade to eliminate the tax break, which affects the most commonly granted stock options. He has introduced a bill that would limit a company’s tax deduction for options to the same amount declared on its financial books. His proposal would also count options toward the maximum of $1 million that companies can deduct for an executive’s pay each year (outside of performance-based bonuses).The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that if the senator’s proposal were enacted, it would add $25 billion to the Treasury over the next decade.Stock options became a popular reward for top executives in the 1990s after Congress imposed the $1 million cap. They lost a little of their appeal after accounting changes in 2005 forced companies to start counting the value of the options as an expense. Scandals over the backdating of options also made some companies wary. Restricted stock and other forms of equity sometimes replaced options. Once the stock market dropped in the fall of 2008, however, there was a spike in the number of options granted by companies. According to regulatory filings compiled by Equilar, an executive compensation consulting firm, the number of options issued by companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 jumped to 2.4 billion in 2009 from 2.1 billion in 2007, though they had been on the decline since 2003.Goldman Sachs granted 36 million stock options in December 2008, 10 times more than the previous year.General Electric, which granted 18 million options in 2007 and 25 million options in 2008, granted 159 million in 2009 and 105 million in 2010.Some companies say that their options awards in 2008 and 2009 were decided before it was clear the stock market would recover. Others say that because share prices had plunged, they had to issue more options to reach the target compensation for their top executives.General Electric acknowledged that it issued far more options after the market collapse because they offered a cheaper way to pay executives than restricted stock and other forms of compensation. A G.E. spokesman, Andrew Williams, said that tax considerations did not play a role in that decision.To be sure, some executives whose option values have skyrocketed can point to notable accomplishments. Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, was granted options valued at $12 million in November 2008 that are today worth more than $100 million. In the years since, Starbucks has laid off thousands of employees, closed hundreds of stores and retooled its business plan. The strategy reversed the company’s slide in earnings. Shares of Starbucks, which traded in the $30s during much of 2008 and fell below $8 after the near collapse, closed Thursday at $46.45.But other companies whose executives have already cashed in some options issued during the crisis have not performed particularly well compared with their peers. The oil drilling company is one.And some financial services companies that have seen the value of the options they issued after the market collapse rise significantly — including Goldman Sachs and — were able to weather the crisis, in some part, because of the billions in federal bailout money they received.“The reason the C.E.O.’s and corporate boards gave all those options during the crisis is because they expected the market to recover — and because the economy is cyclical, everyone knew it would recover,” said Finkelstein, a professor of management at Dartmouth’s Tuck School of Business. “And the whole game is played with other people’s money — the market’s money and the taxpayers’ money.”1121 2011-12-30 Work on an underground museum at the World Trade Center has ground to a halt because of a financial dispute, and it will not open on time next year, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said on Thursday.The museum, commemorating victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, was scheduled to open in 2012 on the 11th anniversary of the attacks. But in recent months, the foundation responsible for running the museum, the National September 11 Memorial and Museum foundation, has been fighting with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey over which is responsible for paying millions of dollars in infrastructure costs related to the project.The Port Authority, which is responsible for the construction of the museum, claims that the foundation owes it $300 million. The foundation claims that the authority actually owes it $140 million because of delays in the project.The dispute has been simmering for some time, and the work slowdown was reported in November. Thursday, however, was the first time Mr. Bloomberg and other officials acknowledged that the discord would cause the museum not to open as planned.“There is no chance of it being open on time,” the mayor said. “Work has basically stopped.”Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said recently on a radio program that the Port Authority was “on the verge” of suing the foundation, but the mayor and the Port Authority said on Thursday that negotiations were continuing.“I’m sure we are going to work something out with the Port Authority,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “They’ve got a difficult budget situation. I’m sympathetic to that.”1122 2011-12-30 It is unclear if Mr. Monti will have any better chance of winning approval for such fundamental changes next year, but he has one thing working in his favor: None of the country’s main political parties want to topple his government of technocrats yet because none feel they could do well enough in elections.For now, Mr. Monti’s package was more a wish list than a specific plan he could present to Parliament, but he said that some of the measures would be drafted in time to present to euro zone finance ministers who will meet in Brussels on Jan. 23.The broad outlines of change won plaudits on Thursday from two of the main political parties — the two that are the most important to Mr. Monti’s effort to win passage — though their enthusiasm may wane as the specifics become clearer.Pier Luigi Bersani, the leader of the center-left Democratic Party, said Mr. Monti’s analysis of the Italian situation was a “dose of reality after years of fables.” And lawmakers with the party of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was ousted over the country’s economic troubles, said Mr. Monti had touched the right chords for growth. The lawmakers, however, also said they would need to see the content of the proposals before giving the plan their full support.In a hopeful sign, Italy sold another bundle of government debt on Thursday at levels well below the last bond auction, suggesting more confidence in Italy’s economic future, at least in the short term. But the continuing high yields on the benchmark 10-year bonds — just shy of the 7 percent rate at which other euro zone governments were forced to seek bailouts — pointed to continuing challenges ahead.Italy, the euro zone’s third-largest economy, must refinance almost 200 billion euros in government debt (about $260 billion) by April, and if borrowing rates remain high, the country could face a solvency crisis that could threaten the stability of the euro.At the Thursday sale, the 10-year bond was priced to yield 6.98 percent, down from a euro-era record high for Italy of 7.56 at the previous sale in late November. The Italian Treasury also sold bonds due in 2014 to yield 5.62 percent, down from 7.89 percent.Despite the encouraging news, Italy was unable to sell all the bonds it wanted to on Thursday, selling 7 billion euros’ worth (about $9 billion), rather than the target of 8.5 billion euros (about $11 billion).In an auction of 9 billion euros (about $11.6 billion) in short-term Treasury bills on Wednesday, rates fell by half from previous levels. But the sale on Thursday was seen as a more significant signal of market sentiment about the longer-term outlook of Italy’s struggling economy.Analysts had said that much of the buying on Wednesday came from European banks that had just loaded up on cheap, three-year loans from the European Central Bank, and were looking for easy profit.Bloomberg News and Reuters reported that the European Central Bank had bought small quantities of Italian bonds on Thursday on the open market after the closely watched auction showed 10-year yields still close to 7 percent.Mr. Monti said Thursday that he was encouraged by the bond auctions, but he warned that rough times were ahead. “We absolutely don’t consider the market turbulence to be over,” he said. “There is much more to do,” he added, but said a long-term solution required that “work must be done in Europe” within a more integrated framework.President Giorgio Napolitano was more blunt, chiding European leaders on Thursday for not being up to the challenges of economic globalization. In a letter published in the Rome daily newspaper La Repubblica, Mr. Napolitano said European leaders seemed to be having trouble finding a “new balance between economic and social policies,” and called on them to overcome “dogmas and national limits” and act with more courage to bolster troubled economies.Some analysts remain skeptical that Mr. Monti’s new proposals can do enough to spur growth while Italy is under so much pressure by Germany and other European countries to cut spending.If Italy is forced to pursue policies that bind it to reducing its debt and balancing its budget by 2013, then “welcome to a future of stagnation and recession,” said Gustavo Piga, an economist at the University of Rome, Tor Vergata. Italy need look no further than Greece to see the effects of too much cost-cutting, he said, and he noted that debt over gross domestic product was still rising in Greece because gross domestic product was collapsing.Mr. Piga said that the proposals Mr. Monti presented Thursday were too vague to comment on, but that reforms generally take a long time to generate growth, particularly in a recession. “Do you think that if you liberalize Roman taxi drivers you’ll generate growth tomorrow?” he asked. “It’s important to start reforms, but you also need to stimulate demand, which will raise G.D.P.”1123 2011-12-30 “These fees are going to cover the costs of those last-minute payments,” said David Samberg, a Verizon spokesman. “We don’t want anyone to have to pay this.”So how can customers avoid it? In addition to using a check, automated bank transfer and credit or debit card, Verizon customers can also pay at a Verizon store, by money order, or by using a bank or other company’s online bill payment service. They may also use a Verizon gift or rebate card, or make a last-minute, one-time phone or Web payment by handing over their bank account number and their bank’s routing number.Verizon Wireless followed other Internet service providers, including Comcast, that have decided to charge fees to customers for certain phone payments. AT&T, Verizon’s biggest rival, has not announced plans to impose charges for electronic payments and a company spokesman declined to speculate on whether it might do so.Gerry Purdy, a principal analyst with MobileTrax, a market research firm, said it made sense that Verizon was charging for over-the-phone payments, because carriers typically must pay a third-party service to handle those transactions. But Internet payments do not require a third party, he said.“That’s the one that surprises me, because most people won’t charge you for paying on the Internet,” Mr. Purdy said. “When you book a plane ticket online, you don’t get charged a fee.”Verizon may be imposing a $2 fee on one-time online payments to pressure customers to enroll in an automatic payment option, Mr. Purdy said, because it creates a higher probability that the payments will come in on time.Mr. Samberg would not say how many people would have paid the fee this month if it existed now. A study conducted by Javelin Strategy & Research, a firm that focuses on financial services and payments, found that 23 percent of adults make a last-minute payment to a biller once a month.Those who would pay it today are people like Grace Lusich, an administrative assistant in San Jose, Calif. She no longer has a bank account after bad experiences with what she believed were unfair overdraft charges. Now, she uses a prepaid debit card from Walmart called the MoneyCard.“A lot of people in America who are having a hard time paying their bills need a little leeway to wait for the money to come in,” she said. She said she called Verizon each month once she knew her paycheck had been direct-deposited onto her card. Then she makes the payment without ever talking to a human being.“If you go into their store and an associate helps you, they’re not charging you for that,” she said. “But with the phone, no one is helping me. It’s all automated. And they’re going to accept personal checks, which will cost them more in the long run?”Mr. Samberg, the Verizon spokesman, said he did not have a breakout of Verizon’s costs for processing various payments.Those one-time payments cost Verizon money since it must pay merchant fees to card companies and others. The amount it costs Verizon to accept cards in stores could be less because of quirks in how the card companies set fees. It may also be willing to swallow the costs of accepting cards in its stores in exchange for the opportunity to sell upgrades to people who come in to pay their bills.“They are punishing people who need to wait until the last second,” said David O’Neill, who recently lost his job at a Borders bookstore that closed. He is a former Verizon Wireless customer but took to Twitter anyway on Thursday to argue that the company’s move helps the 1 percent get richer, since it rewards Verizon shareholders.“We hope it’s not the case that people are forced into paying this,” said Mr. Samberg. “You look at all of the options and choose the one that is best and easiest for you.”1124 2011-12-30 The brand’s new advertising agency, TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the Omnicom Group, decided to “bring personality to the brand, and, in one of those rare cases, have the actual product be the actual spokesperson,” said Brett Craig, the group’s creative director for Tostitos.Working with Legacy Effects, a Los Angeles special effects company, the agency developed the hand-manipulated puppet with movable parts and special effects to convey energy, said Mr. Craig.The custom puppet appears in two 30-second commercials, the first of which is called “Life of the Football Party,” where its boasting grabs the attention of friends at a football-watching party. The second, “Inspired to Dip,” comically tracks the chip’s compatibility with dips.Tostitos will present one spot during the Rose Bowl on Monday, then five commercials will be shown before and during the 41st Tostitos Fiesta Bowl, where Oklahoma State is playing Stanford at the University of Phoenix Stadium. Last year, Tostitos presented only three spots during the college football matchup.Its ads also will be shown on cable channels, including Bravo, Lifetime and Food Network, for 10 months, and on local stations and ESPN during the football season. Last year, Tostitos spent $34.5 million on advertising, Kantar Media research found. The brand spent $26.8 million for the first nine months of this year compared to $29.6 million for the same period in 2010, according to Kantar Media.Tostitos plans to ramp up its spending in 2012, Ms. Anderson said. She did not provide specifics except to say that the brand would nearly double its digital buy.The energetic chip character will be on the Tostitos Facebook page as well as in banner ads, she said, but noted that “television is still the foundation of our campaign.”“This is a competitive market, with chips alone being about $2 billion,” she said. Shipments of tortilla chips and similar corn products like curls reached $5.3 billion in 2007, according to United States Census Bureau figures. Dips are a separate category.Marketers first focused Tostitos, introduced in 1981, around the idea of escape. “It was a trendy new Mexican food that, over the years, became mainstream,” Ms. Anderson said.Since then, Tostitos has expanded to about a dozen varieties, like Fire-Roasted Chipotle and Hint of Lime, and varied its marketing approach. After the social connections theme in the ’90s, the brand introduced its Scoops chips in 2000, and shifted its focus to everyday social occasions and then to highlighting the ingredients in its chips.In particular, the brand emphasized that its ingredients — corn, oil and salt — were natural, as consumers became more focused on the content and calories of packaged snacks.While Tostitos sales have slipped in recent years, the Tostitos Natural variety had the highest sales gains last year of PepsiCo’s brands, according to Mintel Group’s March 2011 salty snacks report. When final sales figures are tallied for this year, sales of tortilla chips over all are expected to pick up and continue to grow to a $6 billion market in 2015, according to Mintel.Tostitos, which switched advertising agencies last summer, has moved away from its earlier theme that technology brings people together. During the Fiesta Bowl’s halftime last January, the brand sponsored surprise reunions between returning soldiers and their families.This month, Tostitos introduced its latest campaign with an event, “Tostitos Fiesta in the Square,” which converted an area in New York’s Times Square to a regulation-size football end zone and invited fans to a field goal kicking contest.The singer and television personality Nick Lachey and football notables like Jim Kelly, the former Buffalo Bills quarterback who is in the Hall of Fame, were in the event, which set a world record with 181 field goals kicked in six hours.As a result, Tostitos pledged a $200,000 donation to the charity Big Brothers Big Sisters and started an online drive for fans to donate to the charity on facebook.com/Tostitos or bbbs.org/Tostitos until Jan. 31.Highlights from the event will be shown at halftime at the Fiesta Bowl, and Tostitos plans to give the charity a check for $200,000 along with a matching sum, up to $25,000, for any online donations.Tostitos has been associated with gatherings to watch televised sports, with sales surging around football and summer seasons, and wants to expand its consumer base to make its chips a must-have at small and large gatherings, said Ms. Anderson.“The majority of our customers purchase Tostitos between five and 10 times a year,” she noted, with a spike in the first two months of the year, then around Memorial Day to Labor Day.The adoption of a party-theme campaign, she said, “is a return to our heritage.”1125 2011-12-30 When the financial crisis depressed stock prices, many companies saw an opportunity to grant a large number of options to their executives — so that if the share prices recovered, the executives would reap windfalls.1126 2011-12-30 State officials on Thursday reopened the last stretch of state highway still closed after flooding from Hurricane Irene in August. About seven miles of Route 107, a busy east-west road connecting Bethel and Stockbridge, was opened. State officials say all 500 miles of state roadways damaged during the storm have now been repaired.1127 2011-12-30 In “Why Is the N.Y.P.D. After Me?” (Sunday Review, Dec. 18), Nicholas K. Peart illustrates how the lives of young black men are violated regularly by the police, usually without any merit.Our analysis of 2009 stop-and-frisk data for the New York police shows that 94 percent of stops in 2009 did not lead to an arrest. The analysis also showed that there were 132,000 stops of black men 16 to 24. This is particularly striking since according to Census Bureau data that we examined, only 120,000 black men of that age lived in New York City in 2009. So on average, every young black man can be expected to be stopped and frisked by the police each year.We cannot accept that so many young people experience their lives this way, particularly at such a formative stage. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s recent Young Men’s Initiative made little attempt to address stop-and-frisk policy. We must stop treating young black men like criminals and start thinking of them as potential assets to our recovering and growing economy and society. Until we do, our efforts to improve their education and employment prospects will be hollow.1128 2011-12-30 An independent Palestinian rights group said Thursday that the Hamas authorities in Gaza were searching the homes and questioning members of the rival Fatah party. A report from the Palestinian Center for Human Rights said one Fatah activist was held for 15 days, during which Hamas officers placed a plastic bag over his head during interrogation and subjected him to loud noises. On Monday and Tuesday alone, the report said, Hamas summoned about 50 former members of Fatah security forces, questioning them at length.1129 2011-12-30 Through the years that Mr. Lampert dominated Sears as chairman and principal shareholder, he made it clear that he thought retailers worried too much about sales growth and not enough about profitability. He thought they spent too much money on fixing up their stores. He hired retail executives, then shoved them aside when they did not accept his wisdom. The current chief executive, Lou D’Ambrosio, had a long career at I.B.M. and ran Avaya, a technology company that went private during his tenure. Mr. D’Ambrosio never had any experience in retail before he was hired to run Sears.Mr. Lampert declined to be interviewed this week. His last public comment on Sears seems to have come nearly a year ago, when he told shareholders the company’s “financial results remain at unacceptable levels.” They are much worse now.When things were better, he wrote to investors more frequently. At the end of 2005, he explained why the rest of the industry was foolish:“One subject where the conventional wisdom has been much on display recently is the issue of capital expenditures. As I made clear in my very first letter to shareholders, we do not subscribe to the view (seemingly widely held) that more is better, or that there is a certain amount that must be spent on cap ex every year. The question we ask at Sears (and I believe every business should ask) is: ‘What is the most productive way to allocate the capital that we have on hand and the cash flow the company generates?’ In some cases, spending money on the construction of new stores or the updating of existing stores produces real bottom-line benefits. In those cases, increasing capital expenditures is an attractive option. But if the analysis shows that allocating capital in some other way — for example, on acquisitions or stock repurchases — will generate superior returns, then it would be a mistake to plow money into capital expenditures merely because that is the ‘accepted practice’ or ‘expected.’ (That approach — of uncritically following accepted or prevailing practice — is what led many telecom companies astray as they tried to ‘keep up’ with WorldCom’s expenditure levels.)”That comparison to WorldCom was telling. If he was going to seek out an example of the folly of following conventional wisdom, he might have tried to find one that did not involve fraud.The problem that other companies faced was that WorldCom’s numbers were made up. It claimed to be making lots of capital investments in order to hide operating costs. Trying to match phony numbers was a recipe for frustration. But there is no reason to think that other retailers did not spend money on fixing up their stores to make them more attractive. They did, and customers noticed.In letters to investors, Mr. Lampert told them to pay attention to earnings before depreciation charges, not to net earnings under normal accounting rules. That was a good idea, he said, because the depreciation expense reflected the excessive capital spending of the past, which would not be repeated.By his preferred measure, the company now estimates that it will have a loss of a few hundred million dollars for the fiscal year ending in January. The net loss — the one using those pesky accounting rules — seems likely to be in the billions as the company takes lots of write-downs.In the first few years of Mr. Lampert’s reign, the company did pay down debt. But more recently, it has been increasing its borrowing. To get by, it is going to have to borrow more.On Thursday, Fitch cut Sears’s bond rating to CCC, the nether regions of junk. It warned that “there is a heightened risk of restructuring over the next 24 months.”In Mr. Lampert’s 2005 letter, he pointed to two types of investment that might be superior to capital spending. One was acquisitions. The other was share repurchases. There is no doubt that he found the latter attractive.From February 2005 through October of this year, Sears Holdings spent $6.1 billion on share repurchases, nearly double the $3.2 billion it spent on capital expenditures. Over the same period, depreciation expenses — a reflection of the old capital spending that Mr. Lampert deemed excessive — came to $6.6 billion.I don’t know what would have been accomplished by spending more on capital expenditures, but it could not have been that much worse an investment than were the share repurchases. The company spent an average of $103.58 a share over the period, three times the current value of the shares, as it bought nearly 59 million shares.Now Sears has 107 million shares outstanding, with a total market value of $3.6 billion.It will be sad if Sears goes out of business, but there is precedent. Its predecessor as the No. 1 retailer in America, Montgomery Ward, lost that distinction because of a somewhat similar decision not to invest in its business. That came after World War II, when its chief executive, Sewell Avery, was sure a depression was coming and that he would be able to pick up the pieces when Sears went broke from building all those stores in the newly growing suburbs. It took decades for Montgomery Ward to vanish, but it eventually did.This time, Mr. Lampert was sure that he knew better than all those retailers who believed that continued investment in facilities was necessary to avoid alienating customers and losing out to competitors.To be fair, Mr. Lampert was no hypocrite. He does not seem to have sold stock when the company was buying, and it appears that the shares, which closed Thursday at $32.90, are still worth more than he paid. But his wealth — and that of investors in his hedge fund — has plunged. The winners were the former Sears shareholders who decided to take the company’s money and invest in some other company, perhaps one run by a boss who was less certain of his own brilliance.1130 2011-12-30 The small, hardy community in the Rocky Mountains that gives “Angels Crest” its name is a rough-hewn working-class town of grain elevators and meat-and-potatoes eateries where everyone knows everyone else’s business. Ethan Denton (Thomas Dekker), the film’s main character, is a 21-year-old father who works in an auto parts shop and is raising his 3-year-old son, Nate, singlehandedly. The child’s mother, Cindy (Lynn Collins), a bitter and promiscuous alcoholic much older than Ethan, keeps her distance.Tragedy strikes early, when Ethan packs Nate into his pickup truck and drives into the woods to hunt. After parking on the side of the road, he buckles his son into his child seat, turns up the heat and leaves Nate alone while he stalks deer. When Ethan returns, Nate has disappeared, and he panics. A frantic search ensues, with teams of men combing the woods. Even after the search is abandoned, Ethan continues looking for the boy, whom he eventually discovers frozen to death.“Angels Crest,” directed by Gaby Dellal, is a sustained howl of grief in which Ethan’s unassailable sorrow and guilt send an arrow into your heart. In these scenes the screenplay, adapted by Catherine Trieschmann from a novel by Leslie Schwartz, captures the same excruciating pain beyond words that Atom Egoyan distilled in his adaptation of “The Sweet Hereafter” by Russell Banks. That film, about a small town’s trauma after many of its children die in a school bus accident, had more concentrated grief than any film I can recall.But the other parts of “Angels Crest” mostly don’t fit. Although the movie captures the solidarity and the beauty and peril of a rustic mountain town whose residents are necessarily interdependent, its individual subplots don’t connect. Despite several solid performances, the characters are too hazily sketched and too loosely linked to form a meaningful chain.Ms. Collins as the absentee mother, who in a rage tries to run down Ethan in her car, is a self-pitying, one-dimensional nightmare. A story line involving Cindy’s relationship with her devout mother (Barbara Williams) tries and fails to humanize her. When Cindy snaps at her mother, “You have your god; I have mine,” a reference to booze, all you feel is disgust.1131 2011-12-30 Better news on home sales and improved prospects for job growth sent stocks higher on Wall Street on Thursday.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 136 points, nearly making up its 140-point loss from the day before. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index edged back into the black for 2011, with just one day of trading left in the year.The four-week average of unemployment claims fell to a three-and-a-half-year low, an indication that hiring could pick up. Also, the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes in November rose more than 7 percent to the highest level in a year and a half, according to the National Association of Realtors.Quincy Krosby, Prudential Financial’s market strategist, said the reports were encouraging signals for the economy going in to 2012.“The correlation between jobs and housing has been crystal-clear this year,” Ms. Krosby said. “Parts of the country where jobs are more plentiful are the ones where the housing market has held up.”1132 2011-12-30 MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa -- Representative Michele Bachmann, trying to keep her campaign alive in the waning days of the race in Iowa, highlighted a theme she has been using lately, comparing herself to Margaret Thatcher, the conservative British prime ...1133 2011-12-30 The topper was the bouquet of flowers.

They are plowing up areas previously used for grazing cattle or set aside for conservation because they had been deemed too wet, too sandy or too hilly for farming.And they are returning crops to places that had been reserved for ostensibly more lucrative purposes like strip malls, housing developments or, in several cases, struggling small-town golf courses.“One day it’s grassland, and the next day it’s black dirt,” said Jim Ringelman, the North Dakota-based director of conservation programs for Ducks Unlimited, a hunting and conservation group worried about the trend. “It’s that quick.”There are no encompassing statistics about how much land is being cleared, but farmers and environmentalists around the region agree that the available figures and anecdotal evidence suggest a significant increase in the amount of dormant land going back into production. There is debate over whether this should be a source of concern.Craig Cox, the head of the Midwest office of the Environmental Working Group, which has released a report warning about farmland erosion, stressed that the more aggressive farming tactics, like removing trees that act as windbreaks or buffer areas that surround streams, put both land and water at risk.“It’s really disturbing,” Mr. Cox said. “Farmers are pushing as hard as possible to get every last bushel out of every last acre.”In Iowa, the nation’s biggest producer of corn and soybeans, farmers insist that they are simply getting more value from their land. Darrell Coddington, a farmer who runs an excavation business, has spent much of the past year clearing additional land in the hilly and wooded southern part of the state, including places that used to be left alone and derided as a “cocklebur farm,” referring to the thorny weed.While working one overgrown parcel for a neighbor, Mr. Coddington discovered a rusting horse-drawn plow buried beneath a foot of earth, a find that suggested the land had not been farmed in a century. And while expanding his own cropland he decided to tear down the empty family homestead, an action that he described as sad but economically justified.“Hey,” he said, “it was farm ground before they built it.”The force pushing more land into production is the rise in crop prices: in the past five years corn prices tripled and those for soybeans doubled because of swelling worldwide demand, including demand for ethanol production. At the same time yields have spiked because of genetically engineered crops and improvements in farming technology, which are also allowing farmers to grow in previously inhospitable areas.In turn farmers, flush from the most profitable years in decades and looking for better places to store money than low-interest savings accounts or a turbulent stock market, are putting their money in land.In Iowa, the state with the highest gains in the Midwest, the average price of farmland grew a record 32 percent last year to $6,700 an acre, according to a study released last week by Iowa State University. This month a land auction in the northwest corner of the state shattered records when one farm sold for $20,000 an acre, prompting another round of warnings of a real estate bubble.Many of those not buying new land are instead putting money into their operations by buying new equipment or undertaking long-planned projects for their property like tearing down trees, buildings or fence rows to make more room for crops.Others are pulling land out of the federal Conservation Reserve Program, which pays a per acre fee to farmers who agree to leave their land idle for a decade or more. Enrollment in the program, praised by environmentalists and hunters for improving water quality and wildlife habitat, peaked at 36.8 million acres in 2007 and dropped to 29.6 million acres last month, in part because farmers believed they could make more by farming than the $53 per acre average paid for conservation.In Iowa, just 9 percent of farmers with expiring contracts in the program renewed them in 2009. With a spike in expiring contracts next year and Congress considering scaling back the program, which has paid out more than $1.7 billion so far this year, significantly more marginal land could return to production.It is not just land in the country that is being returned to production. In the Des Moines area, farms that were bought for development — even parcels that were cleared and graded — are being tilled and planted again, some rented as a stopgap measure and some permanently sold off. “It may be worth almost as much now as farm ground as it was for development,” said Bill Northey, the state agriculture secretary.Todd Volz, a farmer who pays to grow hay on these vacant properties in urban areas, said more developers are using this income until the housing market recovers. “I can’t handle all the work,” Mr. Volz said.Another casualty has been small-town golf courses, many of which were already struggling. In Rockford, about a two-hour drive east of here, Jim Dow, the owner and manager of a 78-acre course, has been turning over the land, removing 750 trees in the process. Though he has never farmed, he believes he could turn a profit with the current prices. Better yet he might be able to sell a property that had been languishing without bidders.“Maybe once people see it’s plowed,” he said, “someone will make an offer.”1140 2011-12-31 Credit: Luke Sharrett for The New York Times1141 2011-12-31 The consumer outcry may also reflect the national mood — and some companies’ misreading of it, according to some analysts.“I just think people are sick of being nickeled and dimed by big companies,” said Edgar Dworsky, founder of ConsumerWorld.org. “And it’s just baffling to me why a company like Verizon Wireless or Bank of America doesn’t do market testing on something like this first. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that there is going to be a backlash.”What was surprising about the Verizon Wireless rollback was how quickly it occurred. It took consumers about a month to persuade Bank of America to rescind its plan to charge a $5 monthly fee to people who used their debit card for purchases.But with Verizon Wireless, the corporate change of heart took only a day, even though it is the week after Christmas when companies often drop bad news in the hope that fewer people are paying attention.“The multiplication effect with things like Twitter is incredible,” said Ron Shevlin, senior analyst at the Aite Group in Boston. “And because of the national mood, it hits the boiling point really quickly.”Verizon Wireless may also been have moved to change its mind when the Federal Communications Commission put out word earlier Friday that it thought the company’s actions merited closer scrutiny.If the company had taken a different tack, it might have succeeded in convincing consumers that some kind of fee increase was necessary, Mr. Shevlin said.“The easy thing would have been to be more explicit about what the costs were that were causing it to add this fee,” he said.The company, for instance, might have explained how few people were going to pay the fee, which was supposed to be for one-time credit or debit card payments by phone or on the company’s Web site. It also could have explained how much higher the costs were, on a percentage basis, to accept payments in that way, versus regular, monthly credit card billing, which would have remained free.Verizon Wireless declined a request for much of this information on Thursday and did not respond to follow-up requests on Friday.Mr. Shevlin also said that Verizon Wireless, like Bank of America before it, said it was responding to customer feedback. But both companies seemed to have missed the opportunity to get accurate feedback before putting the fees in place.“Why not post it on your Facebook page?” he said. “Maybe the feedback would have been just as bad, but then you’re seen as heroes for listening to feedback ahead of time. These firms are not reading the mood or living in the real world.”Mr. Dworsky is on Verizon’s consumer advisory panel (and did not know about the fee ahead of time). But he said he chose to speak out about the move anyway, saying that he had a bigger concern about what the Wireless unit’s failed move portends.“Who is going to try to tack on a fee next for using a credit card?” he said. “Is it the local grocery store? A department store? That is the bigger worry.”Mr. Dworsky, a former assistant attorney general for consumer protection in Massachusetts, spent Friday morning reading credit card merchant agreements and various federal regulations in the hope that the proposed surcharge was actually against the rules.“I’m glad this got killed in its infancy,” he said. “But I don’t think we’ve seen the end of it. Hopefully, the collective consumer voice will be able to change the next company’s planned fee.”1142 2011-12-31 “If our government lets these companies touch even a drop of our water,” he said, “we’re ruined.”South Africa is among the growing number of countries that want to unlock previously inaccessible natural gas reserves trapped in shale deep underground. The drilling technology — hydraulic fracturing, or “fracking,” for short — holds the promise of generating new revenue through on the gas, creating thousands of jobs for one of the country’s poorest regions, and fueling power plants to provide electricity to roughly 10 million South Africans who live without it.But many of the sites here and on other continents that are being considered for drilling by and gas companies and by governments short of cash are in fragile areas where local officials have limited resources, political leverage or experience to ensure that the drilling is done safely.The interest from big energy companies in South Africa and elsewhere means that shale gas may redraw the global energy map, according to many energy experts.Klare, a professor of world security studies at Hampshire College, said that the new sources of natural gas from shale may lessen the geopolitical importance of countries that historically have been the biggest producers of natural gas, including , and . The new drilling, which draws strong support from the government, represents a boon for American companies like , and that have greater experience with shale gas, and therefore are likely to win many lucrative contracts abroad.More than 30 countries, including , and , are now considering fracking for natural gas or oil, and the surge in gas production has spurred interest in building pipelines and terminals that liquefy the fuel so it can be shipped to far-flung markets. In the United States, shale gas has increased supply, driving prices down and benefiting industrial plants that use the gas for manufacturing and consumers who depend on it for electricity, heating or cooking.But the enthusiasm abroad, especially in less-developed regions, does carry risks, according to many energy experts.“The big problem is that all the excitement around shale gas, most of it fostered by the U.S., has also led some countries, especially in the developing world, to take a drill-first, figure-out-regulations-later attitude,” said Professor Klare, who has written extensively about the way that energy policies affect global security. “There is simply too much being taken on faith when it comes to company reassurances about the safety and costs of this drilling.”The Indonesian government, for example, is considering allowing drilling for shale gas in a part of Java where, in 2006, drilling led to the eruption of a mud volcano that killed at least 13 people, and displaced more than 30,000 residents from 12 villages, according to a team of international scientists. is a major exporter of liquefied natural gas, but it struggles to meet domestic demand, and supporters of the shale drilling project say it will help solve that problem.Shale gas in may represent more than a third of the natural gas resources in , according to energy experts, and could help the country reduce its dependence on Russia, which now supplies about 60 percent of Poland’s gas.But an April 2010 report by Bernstein Research, a market research group, raised concerns about the costs and risks of shale gas drilling because Poland is so densely populated, dependent on agriculture and farmers will have to compete with drillers for water.“Europe and some of the countries with shale potential have significantly less renewable water resources than the U.S.,” the report warned.In the United States, where the water-intensive drilling technique of fracking was invented, the government is taking a lead role in supporting the dissemination of the technology abroad, as well as promoting other energy projects, including building infrastructure to extract and transport liquid natural gas.Over the past three years, has promoted shale gas during visits to China, India and Poland.“We believe that there is the capacity technologically to extract that gas in a way that is entirely safe,” Mr. Obama said in a speech in May in , where the American Embassy co-hosted an international shale gas conference.The Export-Import Bank of the United States has financed some of its biggest gas projects over the last several years, including the largest transaction in the bank’s history — $3 billion approved in 2009 for hundreds of miles of gas pipeline and a liquid natural gas plant and terminal project led by Exxon Mobil in .The United States Geological Survey has offered training and technology to geologists exploring shale gas in Europe.In 2009, the United States and China signed an agreement to promote accelerated development of shale gas in China, which has major shale gas deposits in Inner Mongolia in the north and in the country’s restive western frontier, Xinjiang, which is characterized by severe droughts and a separatist movement.The State Department’s Global Shale Gas Initiative, begun in 2010, has been advising many foreign countries on fracking. It has organized a half-dozen trips this year for foreign officials to meet with American energy experts and to visit drilling sites in the United States.The Web site for the initiative says that its primary goals are “to achieve greater energy security, meet environmental objectives and further U.S. economic and commercial interests.”Some economists and environmentalists say that while the governments of poorer countries may benefit from the new tax revenues and jobs, they may not be paying enough attention to the environmental risks of drilling. They also note that local residents — who bear the brunt of the air pollution, potential water contamination from spills or underground seepage, and truck traffic that come with drilling — may see few benefits.“These projects have already started causing steep inflation in costs of local housing and services, and except for the lucky few who get temporary construction jobs, the economic conditions for local communities can actually get worse,” said Doug Norlen, policy director of Pacific Environment, an advocacy and research organization that tracks federal and corporate financing of energy projects abroad.The direct benefits of new drilling to American landowners — they receive bonuses and royalties when they lease their land to drillers — will generally not be shared by landowners abroad. In South Africa and many other countries looking to embrace the drilling, the minerals under a property are more often owned by governments, not individuals.Mr. Norlen added that the influx of foreign construction workers in these projects could lead to conflicts with local and tribal communities. In one example, he noted, the United States government-financed project in Papua New Guinea to extract and transport liquid natural gas recently led to violent clashes between residents and foreign contractors.But Jan Willem Eggink, general manager for Shell in South Africa, said that the Karoo project could eventually produce millions of dollars in direct and thousands of jobs for South Africans, which would help lower the nation’s unemployment rate of about 25 percent.“There is a huge energy problem looming for South Africa,” he added, explaining that energy demand is growing rapidly and that shale gas coupled with renewables could help meet that new demand while also lowering the nation’s dependence on for gas.Fracking involves injecting large amounts of water mixed with chemicals and sand at very high pressure deep underground to crack rock and release gas. After fracking, much of the water at each well returns to the surface mixed with toxic chemicals.Shell’s plan is to drill at least six exploratory wells over the next three years, and if the gas reserves appear profitable, it will start production with at least 1,500 wells several years later. Martin Bell, the water manager for Shell’s Karoo project, said the company planned to recycle as much wastewater as possible, storing it temporarily in closed containers. Trucks will not be the primary method for moving waste or water, he said. Drilling waste, which could be especially toxic because the area is high in uranium deposits, will be shipped to disposal plants by pipes or by rail, Mr. Bell said.Water needed for fracking may be brought in by rail from the coast, which is hundreds of miles away in some parts, or drawn from aquifers far below the ones that supply water for farmers. The company will tap into the aquifers that farmers use only if it can prove no adverse impact, Mr. Bell said.In interviews, South African drilling regulators emphasized that producing and using more natural gas would help the country’s air pollution problems and avoid increasing its already heavy dependence on for electricity, since coal is dirtier than natural gas when burned.But in this sun-flooded hinterland, where sheep outnumber humans and rusty windmills pumping water dot the horizon, many residents say they would prefer to see the government bring in wind or solar farms, not new drilling.“It just takes one big spill, leaky pipe or crack underground that their studies didn’t catch, and a farm my family has run for four generations is done,” said Trenly Spence, 44, as he dug up a clogged irrigation pipe that carries water across his 3,300 acres to where his 3,000 sheep and goats graze.Mr. Spence added that farmers had been frustrated by the lack of information from Shell officials about the chemicals they would inject into the ground during fracking.Shell officials said that they would disclose what they could about fracking formulas if they started drilling, but that they might be limited by trade secrets of their subcontractors.In the United States, some drilling companies have been reluctant to reveal the chemicals they use in fracking, saying the information is proprietary.Officials from the State Department’s shale gas initiative have said that developing countries interested in fracking will need to create stronger protections for intellectual property rights so energy companies will think that they can safely maintain certain patents over their drilling techniques. Some environmentalists say that strengthening these intellectual property protections will only help energy companies argue that they do not have to disclose the chemicals they use in fracking abroad.A spokesman for the State Department declined to answer questions about fracking and intellectual property rights. But he emphasized that the initiative’s goal is to help countries make informed decisions about their resources, rather than promoting shale gas abroad.“The regulatory and financial climate is obviously important to companies considering an investment in unconventional gas,” the spokesman said in an e-mail. “But sound environmental regulations and policies are also critical, as is working with local communities and other stakeholders to understand the impact of shale gas on their lives.”Some legal experts say that the United States needs to be more concerned about environmental and other impacts as it promotes energy technology abroad. David Hunter, director of the Program on International and Comparative Environmental Law at American University, said, “Especially with energy projects, the U.S. and its funding institutions have a habit of promoting policies that foster a stable climate for foreign investors but that are not in the best interests of local populations.”In , for example, the United States Export-Import bank provided more than $400 million in guarantees in 2008 for a liquefied natural gas terminal to export gas from the Camisea gas fields, which are in the Amazon . The project for drilling and pipelines in the Camisea, which received separate financing from the Inter-American Development Bank, has been dogged by spills, accusations that company officials bribed lawmakers and criticisms about exporting the gas rather than using more of it to lower prices for domestic consumers.Energy companies are using fracking technology in parts of , bringing jobs and wealth to gas-rich provinces like and . But residents near drilling sites have complained that natural gas has seeped into their water wells making their tap water flammable. Drillers have denied responsibility.In South Africa, pressure is mounting to proceed cautiously.After public concerns were raised this year about drilling in the Karoo region, South African drilling officials set a moratorium on new licenses for exploration until February so the government could conduct more research.In July, the Advertising Standards Authority of South Africa, an independent agency that sets guidelines for media companies, ruled that several of Shell’s advertised claims — including one that said fracking had never led to groundwater contamination — were misleading or unsubstantiated and should be withdrawn. Shell said the advertisements were an accurate reflection of its opinion.“The government is under a great deal of pressure to hurry up,” said Hein Rust, director of disaster management for the central Karoo region. “But I don’t think these decisions should be made on faith or until all the costs are known.”1143 2011-12-31 Bach is central to the mission of Bachanalia, the string ensemble founded in 1988 by the violinist Nina Beilina. His music is included on every program, no matter how varied.So it was disconcerting to hear Bachanalia open its 24th season on Wednesday night at Merkin Concert Hall with such an ineffective performance of two chorale preludes by Bach. Part of the problem lay in the arrangements for solo violin and strings by the composer Jakov Jakoulov, which turned the music gloppy with thick-textured scoring and beefed-up harmonies.Ms. Beilina’s account of the solo violin part was marred by intonation problems. She arrived in America in the mid-1970s after studies with David Oistrakh at the Moscow Conservatory and several prizes from competitions. She played tentatively in the Bach and was similarly unsteady after intermission in an arrangement of Ravel’s “Pavane for a Dead Princess” for violin and strings.The main enticement of this program, provocatively titled “Renaissance and Decadence,” was a pastiche of music by the Renaissance madrigal composer Gesualdo, who had a penchant for unorthodox harmonies, and the fin de siècle French composer Erik Satie, whose soft-spoken, epigrammatic pieces inspired a cultish following from the group of renegade composers in early 1920s Paris called Les Six.Before the performance Mr. Jakoulov, who arranged the Gesualdo and Satie works, spoke about this project. I strongly encourage musicians to speak directly to audiences. But Mr. Jakoulov’s thick Russian accent and rambling discourse made it hard to follow his points.Both Gesualdo and Satie, as he said, were experimenters. But as creative people, they could not have been more different. Gesualdo was an imperious aristocrat who murdered his wife and her newborn child when he discovered her with a lover. Satie was a modest bohemian who played piano in cabarets as a young man and led a strangely secretive life.1144 2011-12-31 There is little indication that Mr. Obama plans to endorse same-sex marriage before the presidential election in November, despite recent statements that tiptoe right up to that position. Speaking to a gay rights group in October, he said, “Every single American — gay, straight, lesbian, bisexual, transgender — every single American deserves to be treated equally before the law.”But in the absence of that symbolic step, the White House wants gay people to know that it stands with them. It is publicizing initiatives like the State Department’s campaign against persecution overseas and a government conference on the problems faced by older gay people.“It works for the White House on several levels, particularly in an election year,” said Richard Socarides, a Democratic political strategist who advised former President on gay-rights issues. “Gay voters will be more enthusiastic for him than we would have been a year ago.” Some gay rights advocates believe that Mr. Obama will declare his support for same-sex marriage before the election — both because polling data shows a sharp increase in voter support for it among crucial groups, and because two pending court rulings on marriage rights will make it harder to justify the president’s position that his views are still evolving.“My core argument is that you’ve got a lot to win and not a lot to lose,” said Evan Wolfson, the founder of Freedom to Marry, a group that campaigns for marriage rights. “It would remove a constant irritating false note, and it would allow him to tap into an unmitigated good stream of energy.”Interviews with administration officials, however, suggest that the president believes he can stand pat and still win a large majority of gay votes, based on his track record, which includes his decision not to defend a 1996 law that defines marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman.The president may have history on his side: a nationwide exit poll conducted by the firm Edison/Mitofsky in the 2008 elections found that 4 percent of voters indicated they were gay. Of that group, 70 percent said they voted for Mr. Obama and 27 percent for the Republican nominee, Senator .This time, Mr. Obama is being helped by Republican candidates who are competing to proclaim their opposition to same-sex marriage as they court social conservatives in . Former Gov. of , former Speaker and Gov. of have all been confronted in recent days over their positions on gay rights.Mr. Gingrich told a voter in Iowa that he should “be for Obama” if same-sex marriage was the sole issue he cared about. Mr. Perry was heckled for a television commercial in which he declared, “There’s something wrong in this country if gays can serve openly in the military but our kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas.” Mr. Romney sat down with a military veteran in a restaurant and ended up sparring with him over the state’s gay-marriage law, which Mr. Romney opposes.David B. Mixner, a longtime gay rights advocate who has raised money for candidates, said he planned to work hard for Mr. Obama’s re-election. “We can keep pushing for marriage without stopping our work for him,” he said, “because we can just look at the cast of characters waiting in the wings.”Mr. Obama’s appeal to supporters of gay rights rests on more than a fear of Republicans. Administration officials say he has compiled an impressive record, same-sex marriage aside. In particular, the repeal of the “ ” policy that prohibited gay men, lesbians and bisexuals from serving openly in the military fulfilled a campaign promise that many supporters did not believe Mr. Obama would be able to keep.“One issue after another he’s taken them on and he’s knocked them down in a very methodical way, but consistent with his views about justice and fairness in the ,” said , Mr. Obama’s chief domestic policy adviser.In October, two weeks after the military’s ban on openly gay soldiers ended, the president received a standing ovation at a dinner held by the Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates gay rights. He felt comfortable enough with the crowd to joke about having held “productive bilateral talks with your leader, .”In recent weeks, though, it is the president’s cabinet members who have set the pace on gay rights issues.Mrs. Clinton’s passionate speech on gay rights in Geneva has been likened to the famous one she gave on women’s rights in in 1995, when her husband was president. And the significance went beyond her words, administration officials said. She said that the United States would protect gay victims of persecution and that it would channel foreign assistance in ways that promote equal rights for gay people.Daniel B. Baer, a deputy assistant secretary of state who helped develop the policy, said that by staking out such a strong position on gay rights abroad, the United States would face pressure to keep moving on the issue at home.“If we are articulating one thing internationally and another thing domestically,” he said, “that tension gets pointed out.”Mr. Baer, one of the highest-ranking gay members of the administration, said Mrs. Clinton’s speech was not written for domestic consumption. Still, he added, “Her leadership on this does accrue to the benefit of the president.”1145 2011-12-31 On Tuesday, Mr. Maliki offered a kind of rebuttal. At his regular cabinet meeting, the prime minister asked that Mr. Essawi be declared “ill and absent” and said his job of preparing the budget should be handed over to Ali Shakri, the minister of planning and a politician allied with the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr.Ali al-Mousavi, a top adviser to the prime minister, said that Mr. Maliki was simply trying to find a temporary solution to draw up Iraq’s budget in the vacuum left by Mr. Essawi. He said that Mr. Essawi would retain his job as finance minister. In any event, the cabinet and Mr. Shakri refused to go along. Mr. Essawi saw the move as an escalation in Mr. Maliki’s battle with Iraqiya and disclosed that he had received an apologetic phone call from Mr. Shakri, perhaps a small sign that some sectarian differences may yet be overcome in the new Iraq.Some of the criticism against Mr. Essawi has darker overtones. A few Iraqi officials have revived old accusations that Mr. Essawi has supported Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. One of them, Abdul Hussein Hamid, a Maliki adviser, told the Kurdistan News Agency that “there is a case that accuses the finance minister of supporting assassinations of political figures in Falluja.”Hassan al-Saneed, a close ally of the prime minister’s, said that the government was not investigating Mr. Essawi. But the timing of the leaks may be telling. Similar innuendo floated through Iraq’s partisan press in the days before the government announced an arrest warrant for the Sunni vice president Tariq al-Hashimi, on charges that he ran a death squad. Mr. Hashimi is now camped out in Iraq’s Kurdish north to avoid arrest, saying he cannot get a fair trial in Baghdad.Mr. Essawi said the charges against him were perennial falsehoods that surfaced whenever his opponents wanted to attack him. Last year, when Mr. Essawi was serving as Mr. Maliki’s deputy, the prime minister told the American military he was worried about Mr. Essawi’s possible links to terrorists.In August 2010, Gen. Ray Odierno, then the commander of United States forces in Iraq, took the extraordinary step of sending Mr. Maliki a letter in Arabic assuring him that American intelligence analysts had conducted a comprehensive review into the charges and determined they were groundless.“No evidence was found of a relationship between Dr. Rafe al-Essawi and Al Qaeda,” General Odierno wrote, according to an Arabic copy of the letter that was obtained by The New York Times.“He is the cleanest politician in Iraq,” said a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid upsetting the Iraqi government. “We never found anything on him. If there was a weakness, you might question whether Essawi is tough enough to survive the dirty politics of Iraq.”THE charges reflect Mr. Essawi’s background as a Sunni Arab from Falluja, which became a nest for Qaeda militants and insurgents after the 2003 invasion. Mr. Essawi, trained in Baghdad and Basra as an orthopedic surgeon, ran a hospital in Falluja where he saw the war’s civilian toll.“He had some really brave stands with people in the battle of Falluja,” said Abdul Sattar Khadum, a doctor who was friends with Mr. Essawi in college.When other educated Iraqis fled during Saddam Hussein’s rule or the sectarian cleansing, Mr. Essawi primarily stayed inside the country, though his children today are elsewhere, at schools in Jordan and in Iraqi Kurdistan.A scion of a powerful tribe in Anbar Province, he was able to steer through the complex currents of Iraqi tribal and regional politics and became a leading figure in the Iraqiya coalition, a quilt of Iraqi political parties supported by many Sunnis. He helped rebuild the Iraqi Health Ministry, which had been used by followers of Mr. Sadr, the Shiite cleric, to carry out sectarian killings. And he mediated disputes between Arabs and Kurds along internal fault lines in northern Iraq.He is a religious man who regularly reads about faith, whose friends admired the way he spoke about the Koran, or how he sometimes stood up at weddings to sing songs of faith. But his vision of Iraq was that of a nonsectarian country. It was a view that meshed with some Western hopes for Iraq, but one that may now be falling out of fashion.The sparring factions have not even been able to sit down together, worried that accepting an invitation proffered by an opposing side could be read as a sign of weakness. Meetings among the factions are being planned for next week by Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, with the strong support of the United States. But with armored personnel carriers, Army Humvees and tanks now sitting not far from his offices in Baghdad’s Green Zone, Mr. Essawi said he worried that the country’s crisis was entering a more perilous phase.“Democracy is threatened in Iraq,” he said. “I am afraid the street will lose confidence in their leaders and they may take their own decisions. And this is a very bad step.”1146 2011-12-31 Abortion     The candidates all profess opposition to abortion rights, but there are distinctions.
