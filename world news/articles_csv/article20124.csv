"'12-04-01,'0','“I want to give to Tim Cook for this,” said Dara O’Rourke, associate professor of environmental and labor policy at the . “He’s admitting they’ve got problems.”Apple’s supply chain is a subject much closer to Mr. Cook than it was to his predecessor. Not long after Mr. Jobs returned to lead Apple in 1997, he hired Mr. Cook to clean up the manufacturing operations, which were in disarray, with bloated inventory that hurt its profits. Over more than a decade, Mr. Cook helped transform Apple’s operations into the envy of the electronics industry, with an array of partners, mostly in , able to efficiently pump out its latest products.In contrast to Mr. Cook, Mr. Jobs never visited the factories in where Apple’s products were made, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified to avoid antagonizing Apple.During the years when he was chief executive, Mr. Jobs was never as directly engaged with Apple’s effort to audit its suppliers as Mr. Cook was, according to a former Apple executive who declined to be identified. Still, when Mr. Jobs learned of the more serious violations of its supplier code of conduct — instances where was used, for example — he was outraged, this person said.Mr. Cook has spoken publicly of how his blue-collar roots growing up in gave him an early appreciation for factory work. “I spent a lot of time in factories personally, and not just as an executive,” Mr. Cook told investors at a conference in in February. “I worked in a paper mill in Alabama and an aluminum plant in .”Some labor rights advocates, though, said they were not yet convinced that last week’s report about conditions in Foxconn factories would lead to meaningful improvements for workers, saying that earlier promises of progress by Apple and its partners had not been fulfilled.“It looks like a pattern I’ve observed before,” said Jeff Ballinger, a global labor activist and researcher. “It’s a report to get you over and hopefully things will die down. It’s not very convincing.”Since 2007, Apple has published annual reports with the results of audits of factories where its products are produced. But in the last several months under Mr. Cook’s watch, the company has taken a bolder set of steps to prod its suppliers into making workplace improvements.In January, when Apple published its 2012 annual report on conditions within its suppliers’ factories, the company also released the names of 156 companies that supplied it with parts and other services involved in the manufacturing of Apple products, something it had previously declined to do.To help end excessive overtime work, it began publishing monthly reports on compliance with Apple’s policy of a 60-hour workweek at its supplier factories. For the month of February, Apple said that compliance figure rose to 89 percent from 84 percent in January.This year, Apple also became the first technology company to join the Fair Labor Association, and it invited the nonprofit global monitoring group to conduct inspections of its suppliers’ factories in China and elsewhere.Last week, the group published the results of its first inspections of Apple’s supply chain, citing numerous violations of Chinese labor laws and regulations at Foxconn factories, including instances where workers exceeded the 60-hour workweek that is the association’s standard.Foxconn, which is based in , promised that by July 2013 its employees would no longer exceed the 49-hour workweek limit set by Chinese law. Workers will not see a pay decline because of corresponding wage increases, Foxconn pledged.In a statement, Apple said, “Our team has been working for years to educate workers, improve conditions and make Apple’s supply chain a model for the industry, which is why we asked the F.L.A. to conduct these audits.”Apple has said it had made many improvements to factory conditions over the years. In 2008, for example, company inspectors discovered a situation in which a supplier had forced foreign workers to give up their passports to factory managers, effectively limiting their ability to leave their jobs. Apple demanded that the supplier, unnamed in Apple’s annual report mentioning the incident, return the passports to the workers.Other problems have been harder for Apple to eradicate. Even Mr. Cook conceded in his speech at the investor conference in February that Apple had consistently found that suppliers had violated the company’s overtime policies.Daniel Diermeier, a professor at who studies reputation management, says he believes the more aggressive stance by Apple toward factory conditions is the result of greater scrutiny of the company by media and advocacy groups, at a time when there is also intense interest in Apple’s soaring share price and cash reserves. But he also believes Mr. Cook’s leadership has played a role in the changes.“I think he probably has a deeper understanding, and this is more personal for him than it might be for other executives,” Mr. Diermeier said.Some worker advocates say they are hopeful the changes that have occurred under Mr. Cook will lead to lasting improvements in the manufacturing of electronics products.“They have an opportunity to become the new face of sustainable production in the electronics sector,” said Meg Roggensack, senior adviser, business and human rights at Human Rights First, a nongovernmental organization. “They’re smart enough. They’re well capitalized enough.”'"

"'12-04-01,'0','Despite street signs that point out the Nourse Auditorium, few walking past the hulking building at Hayes and Franklin Streets know about the opulent 1,800-seat theater inside. Built in 1927 for the High School of Commerce, it has served as a stage for poets, rock stars, lawyers and, for the last 30 years, as storage space for the San Francisco Unified School District.Joseph Nourse worked for the San Francisco school district for 42 years as a teacher, principal and superintendent. In 1919, Mr. Nourse started the city’s R.O.T.C. program. In 1940, “against his better judgment,” he allowed students to play bridge during school. The school had some noteworthy graduates, including Pedro Flores, a former Filipino bellboy credited with marketing the yo-yo.After the High School of Commerce closed in 1952, the hall was rented out for events. In 1965, Alcoholics Anonymous held a 30th anniversary event there. On the day of Robert F. Kennedy’s funeral in 1968, Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Allen Ginsberg read poetry. A year later, Jim Morrison appeared with the Living Theatre, an experimental theater company with nude performers (some on LSD) who proclaimed, “To be free is to be free is to be free.”Damon Tevis, a facilities administrator for the school district, knows the decorative Spanish Revival-style building inside and out. Climbing on the catwalks in the space above the ceiling, he pointed to hand-cranks for the elaborate chandeliers and to the plaster and horsehair insulation. “There are doors that go nowhere,” he said.In 1985, the orchestra pit was covered with plywood and used as a courtroom for a State Civil Court case on asbestos exposure, which involved 35 insurance companies and almost 100 lawyers. It was one of the first instances of a “wired” courtroom: lawyers were provided computers linked to a mainframe in Texas to share documents. After the two-year trial, a judge ruled against the insurance companies.After the court case, the theater was closed to the public and the school district used it for storage. City Arts & Lectures is trying to raise $1 million for cosmetic renovations: seats, carpets and paint. The theater is due to reopen in 2013, and the school board has agreed to rent it for $2,500 per month.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','Dr. Margo said if he halted his practice without a replacement, ranchers would have nowhere to go. “My clinic is right in front of my home,” he said. “They’d be banging on my door, saying: ‘What do you mean you’re retired? Get over here.’ ”Tommy Guerra, whose ranch sits on the Zapata-Starr Counties line, used to see Dr. Margo when a cow needed medical attention. Now, with the closest veterinarian 100 miles away in McAllen, he tries to solve problems on his own. “I don’t make the drive unless I’ve got a really sick horse,” he said.The dearth of rural veterinarians is a nationwide problem. The United States Department of Agriculture is trying to address the scarcity with a relatively new program, through which the agency repays the student loans of veterinary school graduates if they work in designated locations with veterinarian shortages. The program repays up to $75,000 in loans for each participant. The U.S.D.A. selects the participants, and the Texas Animal Health Commission nominates the state locations to be designated as having shortages.In 2011, Texas had eight shortage areas — which can span up to five counties — and the department gave awards to five veterinarians.Holly Poremski, director of laboratories and a staff veterinarian at the health commission, gathers information to determine areas with shortages. She said she believes that because several regions remain underserved for years at a time, the incentive remains insufficient to overcome the perceived disadvantages of rural practice.Fewer veterinarians head to rural areas after graduating because many believe it is more difficult to make a living in a rural area than in an urban one. “Vets are retiring and say nobody wants to take the risk to come out here, hang up their shingle and try to run a business out here because it’s tough to make a living,” Dr. Poremski said.Another factor is the demographics of incoming classes. The Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine, the state’s only veterinary school, has an outsize influence on who becomes a veterinarian. (Texas A&M University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune.)These days, many veterinary students have grown up in urban or suburban neighborhoods. Their relationship to animals is rooted in the afternoons they volunteered in animal shelters rather than working with cattle, and most plan to practice in cities. Plus, the attraction in metropolitan areas of a predictable schedule, the opportunity to make more money and the appeal of big-city life are draws for those without ties to rural areas.Dr. Dan Posey, director of special programs at Texas A&M’s veterinary school, said its admissions policy seeks out students with varied backgrounds and values applicants who convey the importance of their background to their career goals. He warns against looking for speedy solutions to the rural veterinarian shortage.“I wish you could get to the root of it; that would be helpful,” he said, “but there’s so much personal reason why people choose what they do.”One noticeable change at previously male-dominated veterinary schools has been the increase in the number of female students, which started in the 1980s. But is that a factor in the rural vet shortage? Dr. Posey said no. “There’s an inference that when you’re female you go into small animal practice, and when you’re male you do large, and I don’t see that,” he said.Kaki Nicotre, a veterinary student at A&M, was raised around cattle in the Panhandle town of Sunray. She wants to return there to work with large animals.She also disagrees that the increasing numbers of female veterinarians is tied to the rural veterinarian shortage. “Just because the rooster crows every day at dawn doesn’t mean the rooster causes the sun to rise,” she said.In Rio Grande City, Dr. Margo has found a replacement. Noe Ramirez, 28, plans to work in Dr. Margo’s practice after he graduates from Mississippi State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine in April. He grew up outside Rio Grande City and worked with cattle on a feedlot alongside his father during summers when he was in high school and college.In veterinary school, Mr. Ramirez became interested in food animals. “That’s what excites me about working with cattle,” he said. “You’re literally handling somebody’s steak, hamburger. They don’t even know it. You’ve got your hands in the food chain,” he said, adding, “I feel like I’m keeping the food chain safe.”Mr. Ramirez wants to return to Rio Grande City. His family is there, and he sees an opportunity others may not. “I feel like that’s my home,” he said, “and I feel like I can make a living there.”'"
"'12-04-01,'0','Tony Winnicker, an adviser to Mr. Lee who served as his campaign spokesman, said the mayor made support for local technology investments a key part of his 2011 campaign message, and that aiding local startups is a matter of following through on a promise to voters. As of late 2011, a document obtained by The Bay Citizen revealed, Mr. Conway’s SV Angel firm has or had investments in 69 San Francisco-based companies. Mr. Winnicker said it would be impossible to pursue a local tech-industry policy without somehow benefiting Mr. Conway’s investments. Other investors in his SV Angel funds include former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.“We make no apologies,” Mr. Winnicker said. “Lee is following through on what he promised he would do as mayor.”Critics, however, contend that this is an example of how Mr. Lee’s actions demonstrate his lack of independence from his political backers. Mr. Conway is a Republican. Mr. Lee is a Democrat.“There’s a distinct difference between pursuing policies that raise the tide for everybody and pay-to-play politics to reward one particular supporter’s investment,” said Aaron Peskin, a former Board of Supervisors president who is now head of the local Democratic Party. “This is about rewarding a major campaign contributor. It’s pay-to-play politics pure and simple.”Mr. Winnicker said he “vehemently” disagreed that Mr. Lee’s actions amounted to “pay for play.”Corey Cook, an assistant professor of politics at the University of San Francisco, said it was not unusual for politicians to find backers in industries they support. But, Mr. Cook said, the mayor’s close ties to Mr. Conway could harm him politically.“It’s not that Lee risks violating ethics standards,” Mr. Cook said. “It’s that he feeds into the perception that he’s not an independent politician.”On March 12, San Francisco’s treasurer and tax collector posted on the agency Web site a rule specifying that online brokers who help people rent their rooms to vacation travelers must pay the city’s 14 percent hotel occupancy tax. The obscure-seeming rule was of keen interest to Airbnb, the leader in this nascent business, which employs 125 people at its San Francisco headquarters.Later in the month, an employee of Mr. Conway’s SV Angel investment firm sent an e-mail to local technology firms urging them to send employees to a hearing about the rule.Last Tuesday, Mr. Lee announced the formation of a “Sharing Economy Working Group,” which the mayor said in an interview had as a goal creating legislation to give a tax break to companies like Airbnb.The next day, the fourth-floor hearing room of San Francisco’s City Hall was packed to overflowing with 120 young people, many wearing buttons with the Airbnb logo.At the hearing, Jay Nath, Mr. Lee’s chief technology officer, urged the city’s tax administrator to postpone enforcing the tax until a newly appointed “collaborative consumption work group” could come up with a compromise.“The important thing is to have a policy discussion first, so we can see how to support companies built around the model of collaborative consumption,” Mr. Lee said in an interview.Mr. Lee’s stance seemed to represent an about-face from the position of San Francisco’s previous mayor, Gavin Newsom. In March 2010, Mr. Newsom wrote to Nancy Pelosi, then the speaker of the United States House of Representatives, urging her to derail efforts by online travel agencies, a category that includes companies like Expedia and Travelocity, to obtain relief from local hotel taxes.Jennifer Matz, Mr. Lee’s director of economic and workforce development, defended the apparent turnabout, saying that room rentals by individuals should be viewed in a different light than the hotel business.She said several mayoral staff members have been in discussions for the past month to help support a new type of business they call “collaborative consumption,” a category that includes vacation room rentals, car sharing, parking space sharing and other such activities. Fostering the growth of these kinds of emerging companies will help San Francisco develop a reputation as a cutting-edge tech hub, and that reputation might lure larger employers, Ms. Matz said.The meetings by Mr. Lee’s staff members followed the publication of an article Mr. Conway wrote for The Economist, in which he said collaborative consumption was “perhaps the most thought-provoking sector I see developing in 2012” for venture capital investments. He cited as examples two of his portfolio companies, Airbnb and Rentcycle, which is also based in San Francisco.Airbnb is one of two local Conway-backed San Francisco companies that have run into recent regulatory difficulties. On Nov. 28, officials with the city’s Municipal Transportation Agency recommended that the agency’s board members consider possible problems with Square, the smartphone credit-card reader, before permitting taxi drivers to use it to collect payments from passengers. Unlike taxi-specific charging devices, the Square system is not connected to the meter, meaning that charges are not reported to regulators, according to a Municipal Transportation Agency staff report.The agency’s board did not follow through on the staff recommendation, however. “We’ve been in discussion with people in the Municipal Transportation Agency’s taxi division to get off of initial positions that were held out of fear, and embrace what could be a technology that benefits everybody,” Mr. Lee said.'"

"'12-04-01,'0','Last year, Michel Barnier, the European commissioner responsible for financial services, proposed that companies be forced to change every three years the company that they pay to rate their credit, or every six years if they hired more than one ratings agency.He also said that financial institutions should be allowed to rely less on the agencies and be obliged to make their own assessments.Those rules still need to be approved by governments and the European Parliament, and Mr. Barnier’s proposals on the frequency of rotation could be modified. A longer phasing-in period for the rules could also be added.Even so, the political support shown by the ministers on Saturday for rotation could mean that Europe will reach an agreement on a new law regulating ratings agencies in the summer.The discussions on ratings agencies followed the finance ministers’ decision on Friday to increase the size of a bailout fund for the euro zone to about $1 trillion.That decision was overshadowed by a disagreement between the Austrian finance minister, Maria Fekter, and Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers, over who got to announce the deal first.Mr. Juncker canceled a scheduled news conference after Ms. Fekter upstaged him with an impromptu announcement.Ministers avoided acrimony on Saturday in a discussion about creating a so-called financial transaction tax, a proposal that has drawn fierce criticism from Sweden and Britain.Proponents say such a mechanism could help recoup vast sums of money that governments have spent to save banks by levying a tax on most share, derivative and bond trades. But opponents warn that such a tax would push banks and other financial institutions to abandon European financial centers like the City of London and could ultimately leave European governments with less revenue.In a sign that the governments could be preparing the path to a compromise, Anders Borg, the Swedish finance minister, said he could support a more modest levy known as a stamp duty that mainly taxes shares.“Something in line with the French stamp duty or the British stamp duty” would be less costly for the economy and could be acceptable to Sweden and Britain, Mr. Borg said in comments on the margins of the meeting.“There are some positive signs on this,” he said, adding that he had agreed to join a working group on the issue at the invitation of the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','In the 17 months since Mr. Pelette was buried in the trash-strewn graveyard here, cholera has killed more than 7,050 Haitians and sickened more than 531,000, or 5 percent of the population. Lightning fast and virulent, it spread from here through every Haitian state, erupting into the world’s largest cholera epidemic despite a huge international mobilization still dealing with the effects of the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake.The world rallied to confront cholera, too, but the mission was muddled by the United Nations’ apparent role in igniting the epidemic and its unwillingness to acknowledge it. Epidemiologic and microbiologic evidence strongly suggests that United Nations peacekeeping troops from imported cholera to Haiti, contaminated the river tributary next to their base through a faulty sanitation system and caused a second disaster.“It was like throwing a lighted match into a gasoline-filled room,” said Dr. Paul S. Keim, a microbial geneticist whose laboratory determined that the Haitian and Nepalese cholera strains were virtually identical.And, as the deaths and continuing caseload indicate, the world’s response to this preventable, treatable scourge has proved inadequate. Cholera, never before recorded in Haiti, stayed one step ahead of the authorities as they shifted gears from the earthquake recovery. While eventually effective in reducing the fatality rate, the response was slow to get fully under way, conservative and insufficiently sustained.“In the future, historians will look back and say, ‘Wow, that’s unfortunate,’ ” said Dr. , co-founder of Partners in Health, a nongovernmental organization that provides health care for the poor. “This unfolded right under the noses of all those NGOs. And they will ask, ‘Why didn’t they try harder? Why didn’t they throw the kitchen sink at cholera in Haiti?’ ”While the world has dedicated $230 million so far to combating the unexpected epidemic, the United Nations is now pleading for an additional $53.9 million just to get the vulnerable displaced population through the rainy months ahead.At the same time, Haitian cholera victims are seeking compensation from the United Nations, pressing it to accept responsibility. Early on, protests against the United Nations hindered the construction of treatment centers and the delivery of lifesaving supplies. Now distrust of some cholera programs lingers, and the issue has strained the peacekeepers’ relationship with the Haitians they are protecting in an eight-year-old mission to stabilize the politically volatile nation. So, too, have unrelated allegations that they engaged in criminally abusive behavior.“In telling the truth, the U.N. could have gained the trust of the population and facilitated the fight against cholera,” said Dr. Renaud Piarroux, who led an early investigation into the outbreak. “But that was bungled.”The United Nations maintains that an independent panel of experts determined the evidence implicating its troops to be inconclusive.Questioned for this article, though, those same experts said that Dr. Keim’s work, conducted after their own, provides “irrefutable molecular evidence” that Haiti’s cholera came from Nepal, in the words of G. Balakrish Nair, an Indian microbiologist.“When you take the circumstantial evidence in our report and all that has come out since, the story now I think is stronger: the most likely scenario is that the cholera began with someone at the Minustah base,” said another expert, Daniele Lantagne, an American engineer, using the French acronym for the United Nations mission.Even so, Anthony Banbury, a United Nations assistant secretary general, said last week, “We don’t think the cholera outbreak is attributable to any single factor.”Many health officials consider the cholera response “pretty remarkable,” as John Vertefeuille, the ’s director in Haiti, said.A sky-high initial fatality rate of over 9 percent has declined to 1.3 percent (less than 1 percent is considered a well-managed epidemic). And the most recent statistics show new cases dropping to 120 daily.Others, though, believe the bar for success was set too low and more lives could have been saved. Some critics bemoan weak disease surveillance and case-tracking, others inadequate water distribution and latrine building, and still others what they see as a penny-pinching reluctance to use and cholera vaccine.Also, some think cholera could have been stymied, even eradicated, last winter during the dry season after the first wave. Instead, it flared with the rains even as aid groups shuttered or reduced operations. And now, after another winter without an aggressive prevention and eradication effort, the health authorities fear a reprise.“I think it’s going to be another bad year for cholera,” said Dr. John Carroll, an doctor who works in Haiti.Here in the epicenter of the epidemic, all signage relates to life in the time of cholera. Surrounding the town square are heart-adorned posters that say, “Living with cholera: Always wash your hands with clean water and soap.” Banners slung across the streets, in contrast, bear skulls and crossbones: “Justice and reparations for all victims of the Minustah cholera.”Inside , the deputy mayor, crisply dressed in a chambray shirt and slacks, described how he personally buried 27 bodies for fear that workers would not take precautions, how he nearly lost two of his own children to cholera and how he seethed every time Nepalese troops entered his offices.“They were in my face every day, and the feeling inside me got stronger and stronger,” said Ocxama Moise, the deputy mayor. “A few months ago, I even considered killing a soldier or two to see what would happen. I shared the idea with some friends, and they said, ‘Don’t. You’re an official.’ But it’s only a matter of time before the population finds a way to get justice.”After the earthquake, when Haitians were living amid cadaver-filled ruins in the sprawling Port-au-Prince area, international health officials were concerned that would rip through the tent camps.Well before the earthquake, Haiti was fertile ground for a disease that spreads primarily through fecal contamination of water: in 2008, only 12 percent of the population had access to piped, treated water, and only 17 percent to “improved sanitation,” which includes the simplest pit latrines. Haitians’ latrine access actually declined, from 24 percent in 1990.“For decades we as partners have failed to ensure safe water and sanitation is provided to every resident of Haiti,” said Dr. Jon Kim Andrus, deputy director of the Pan American Health Organization.But Haiti had escaped the cholera that raged through Latin America in the 1990s, and even the cholera that struck the in the 19th century. It appeared “extremely unlikely” that cholera would present itself, a C.D.C. post-earthquake brief said.“The risk of cholera introduction to Haiti is low,” it said, noting relief workers were “likely to have access to adequate hygiene and sanitation facilities within Haiti, such that any cholera organisms they import would be safely contained.”Seven months later, that assumption would be challenged.On Oct. 8, 2010, hundreds of Nepalese troops began arriving in Haiti after a cholera outbreak in their homeland, where cholera is endemic; the country weathers outbreaks well, with that one causing nine deaths.Cholera also affects individuals differently; many infected develop no symptoms or only mild or moderate .Falling violently ill in October 2010, Mr. Pelette was not one of the lucky ones. Severe cholera causes profuse watery diarrhea, often accompanied by . Treatment is straightforward: replacing lost fluids and electrolytes, orally or intravenously. But those like Mr. Pelette who get no treatment can become so dehydrated that they go into shock and swiftly die.Nobody knows for sure, but people here believe that Mr. Pelette was the first Haitian to die of cholera, and, though he was not named, he was presented as the “first case” in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in January.Some details in that widely cited article, like Mr. Pelette’s age and date of death, did not match those on his death certificate, obtained by . Also, Mr. Pelette does not offer an example of untreated mental illness, as the article contended; he had received care at a hospital for chronic mental diseases, his brother said.“When he took his pills, he was calm,” Malherbe Pelette said, speaking on the porch of his sundry store. “He would come here every day, stand at the door waiting for a soda or , and give a fist bump to everybody who came in. Sometimes, he showed up completely naked. He had a terrible speech impediment, and when he was agitated, it was really hard to understand him.“Still, my friend, I cried when he died — a lot, a lot.”A couple of hours after Mr. Pelette died from what the family priest proclaimed to be a poison of some sort, Rosemond Laurimé, 21, a “small businessman” in his family’s description, got sick in nearby Meille.In Haiti, small businesses are minuscule, selling mangos or charcoal today to survive tomorrow. Mr. Laurimé peddled soap at a stand outside the Nepalese base, which sits on the banks of a fly-specked stream that flows into the Latem and then into Haiti’s longest river, the Artibonite.Around 6 p.m. on Oct. 16, when he returned to his shack near the base, he was clutching his stomach. Soon, doubled over from violent diarrhea and vomiting, he begged for help.His grandmother, 70-year-old Marie-Jean Ulysse, did her best, finally summoning a moto-taxi at daybreak to take Mr. Laurimé to the hospital in Mirebalais, run by a Cuban medical brigade.By the time he got there, it was too late: “His body had lost all its water,” Ms. Ulysse said.On Oct. 17, Mr. Laurimé became the first to die of cholera at a hospital in Haiti. The next day the Cuban doctors, who had seen five dozen cases of acute diarrhea in preceding days, notified the Haitian Health Ministry that something was terribly wrong.Mr. Laurimé’s grandmother also fell ill and, hovering near death, witnessed the frightening explosion of the epidemic as she lay absorbing fluids intravenously on a hospital cot. She saw a chain of sick prisoners stripped of clothing and handcuffed one to the next. She watched an endless parade of patients carried in, bodies carried out.“I said to my children, ‘Please do your best to take me home because I don’t want to end up in the big hole where they’re dumping all those bodies,’ ” she said.While she is fine now, Mr. Laurimé’s mother is not. Yverose Fleury wears a cloth binding her midsection in an effort to contain her sorrow. She said neighbors had ripped up her son’s photograph because she keened over it incessantly.“Nothing is the same with us after the cholera,” she said. “My husband is weak and cannot work, my remaining son has a mass on his neck, my little daughter can’t hold down food, and I am sick in the head.”From Meille, the epidemic coursed through the Artibonite River valley, landing with a thump 46 miles northwest, and downstream, in the coastal St. Marc area. On Oct. 19, three children died in rapid succession in a classroom in the rice fields. On Oct. 20, the St. Nicholas Hospital was overrun.Patients sprawled on every surface, doubled and tripled up on beds, in the halls, in the courtyard and even on the sidewalk outside. By nightfall, there were 404. Forty-four died.“At that moment, I felt like I didn’t want to live any longer myself,” said Dr. Yfto Mayette, the hospital director. “It was so sudden and so brutal.”On Oct. 21, as a brass band accompanied Mr. Pelette’s white coffin to the cemetery, the national laboratory completed its analysis of the bacteria.At 11 that night, Dr. W. Tappero of the C.D.C. got a call in from the laboratory’s director: “Jordan,” he said, “It’s positive.”Louise C. Ivers, Haiti mission chief for Partners in Health, had just arrived in for a meeting. “My first thought was, ‘You can’t be serious.’ Everyone was exhausted.”In Port-au-Prince, Jocelyne Pierre-Louis, a senior Haitian health official, had steeled herself. “We were in a way waiting for the other shoe to drop,” she said. “We had barely picked ourselves up after the earthquake when the cholera fell on us.”Dr. Pierre-Louis reported to the large tent that replaced her collapsed office after the earthquake. Dr. Ivers took the next plane back, and Dr. Tappero flew in, too, with the first of 119 C.D.C. employees who would deploy to Haiti.“It was a herculean effort at the time, people working 18, 20 hours a day, trying their best to make a difference,” Dr. Tappero said.There was much to do, from treating patients to treating water, from importing personnel to training Haitians, from distributing supplies to distributing basic disease and hygiene information.But there were also fundamental decisions to be made, and nobody was firmly in charge. International health officials deferred to the Haitians — “our partners” — but in reality held the purse strings and know-how. This led to an often awkward collaboration, colored by Haitians’ resentment that cholera had been imported in the first place.It did not help that the initial projection used by international officials for planning purposes — 200,000 cases in six months — was an underestimate. There would be that many cases in three months’ time, with a daily death toll of more than 100 by mid-December.As the epidemic took off, the players who operated outside the “health cluster,” a consortium of humanitarian groups, were able to react most nimbly.At first, Doctors Without Borders and the Cuban medical brigades, both self-financed, handled the overwhelming majority of cases. “We felt quite lonely at the beginning,” said Yann Libessart, spokesman for Doctors Without Borders. “It made no sense. Everybody was in Haiti. It was the biggest density of humanitarian actors in the world, and we two organizations were dealing with 80 percent of the cholera.”Gaëtan Drossart, mission chief for Doctors Without Borders- , said the health cluster had good intentions, “but there’s a lot of meetings and a lot of blah blah blah.” He said other groups were limited by agreements with donors to working in the earthquake zone and could not redeploy quickly.Also, everybody initially worried most about the epidemic’s arrival in Port-au-Prince. But Haiti’s meager health care resources have always been concentrated in the capital, and after the earthquake humanitarian personnel and supplies were, too. That would eventually increase the cholera survival odds in Port-au-Prince, which would have a 0.7 percent fatality rate compared with 4.5 percent in the southeast.But it took several deadly weeks for the disease to forcefully strike the capital, where rehydration solutions were warehoused; water, latrines and medical professionals were more plentiful; and organizations had had time to set up proper treatment centers.Proper treatment centers maintain rigorous infection control to keep from becoming cholera contamination centers: chlorine sprayers to disinfect shoes, hand-washing stations, cots with holes and buckets underneath, disposal systems for waste and bodies.None of this was in place at the start. Doctors Without Borders sent a team to the St. Marc hospital. “It was really, really awful,” Mr. Drossart said. “There were an enormous number of cases, it was totally disorganized, the cholera patients were not isolated, and they were not being treated correctly.”Even four months later, that hospital did not have cholera cots; patients defecated in bed or risked a potentially fatal drop in by getting up, United Nations investigators found.“Hospital staff reported walking on feces in cholera units,” they added.Understaffed hospitals sometimes discharged patients too soon, sending them home to their deaths. They deputized relatives as caretakers although many patients arrived so dehydrated that they needed intravenous lines and nurses to watch over them. Pregnant women were a particular challenge.“Our greatest heartbreak is that while the women survived, we only saved one ,” said Ian Rawson, managing director of Albert Schweitzer Hospital in central Haiti.Within a week of the outbreak, officials in Mirebalais were pointing fingers at the United Nations base, and United Nations officials were trying to stifle what they portrayed as rumors. The struggle began between those who thought that determining the epidemic’s origin was important and those who lamented “the blame game.”At first, the United Nations said the base’s handling of its waste met international standards — that it used sealed septic tanks, which were regularly emptied by a Haitian contractor, with the waste buried in a proper landfill.But on Oct. 27, filmed peacekeepers with shovels “working furiously to contain what looks like a sewage spill.” Latrines appeared to be emptying black liquid directly into the river, a reporter said, and the air smelled foul with excrement.That same day, The Associated Press observed an overflowing septic tank at the base and discovered the landfill to be open pits in a residential area uphill from the community’s bathing stream.Even four months later, the United Nations’ own experts, examining the base’s supposedly improved sanitation, discovered haphazard piping with “significant potential for cross-contamination” between toilets and showers.They also noted the “potential for feces to enter and flow from the drainage canal running through the camp directly” into the tributary. Contaminants would have been distributed throughout the river delta in two or three days — a timeline consistent with epidemiological evidence tracing the cholera trail, the experts said.Before long, hundreds of Haitians were marching on the base, with demonstrations spreading to Port-au-Prince and riots developing in Cap Haitien.Edmond Mulet, then head of the United Nations stabilization mission, complained that it was “really unfair to accuse the U.N. for bringing cholera into Haiti.” United Nations officials believed that agitators were taking advantage of the issue to sow unrest before November elections. But many Haitians were genuinely incensed — and fearful. Some wanted an explanation, others a scapegoat. Voodoo priests were being lynched for their supposed role in bringing the curse of cholera on Haiti, the government said.In early November, the C.D.C. said that Haitian cholera samples matched strains commonly found in South .Dr. Piarroux, an infectious diseases specialist and parasitologist from Marseilles, arrived to lead a three-week French-Haitian investigation. He and his colleagues built a database of cases, identified geographic clusters and mapped the epidemic’s movement.His conclusion: the only explanation for an outbreak of South Asian-style cholera in a rural area of Haiti home to a Nepalese Army base with a faulty sanitation system had to be infected soldiers on the base itself.In early December, Dr. Piarroux’s mission report was posted on the Web site of the newspaper . Eventually his findings would be peer-reviewed and published in the C.D.C.’s Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.But at that point, he said, he was considered “a renegade and a mythomaniac.” A leading medical journal, , rejected his study after publishing an editorial that said, “Although interest in how the outbreak originated may be a matter of scientific curiosity for the future, apportioning blame for the outbreak now is neither fair to people working to improve a dire situation, nor helpful in combating the disease.”Nonetheless, , the United Nations secretary general, announced an independent panel “to get to the bottom of this and find answers the people of Haiti deserve.”From the start, financial concerns colored the response to the epidemic, which had killed more than 3,600 Haitians by the first anniversary of the earthquake. It was partly a question of getting money flowing. Some donors hesitated, given the plodding pace of the earthquake reconstruction; others had to wait for a new budgetary year. Some institutions had time-consuming grant or contracting processes.It was also a question of philosophy.Some health officials wanted to use the least expensive prevention and treatment strategies and to marshal resources for the long battle ahead.Others wanted to employ every available weapon at once, from free drinking water and antibiotics to aggressive case-tracking, mass vaccination, and water and sewer system building.If that meant spending more upfront, so be it, they said. A year after the earthquake, many organizations were sitting on donations that remained unspent. The , for one, still had nearly half of the $479 million it had raised; it would ultimately dedicate $18 million directly to cholera prevention and treatment. Doctors Without Borders would spend $45 million.Dr. Farmer of Partners in Health, who calls himself “a maximalist,” said he wanted “health equity” — for the developed world to respond to cholera in Haiti as it would at home.His organization initially requested potable water be trucked into the Haitian heartland so that a traumatized population would not have to filter and treat its water. Purification tablets were delivered instead because it was considered cheaper and simpler, he said.“There was a fetishization of the simple,” Dr. Farmer said. “But there’s nothing simple about the introduction of a new pathogen or stopping its spread in a water-insecure place. There’s nothing cheap about it, either.”Dr. Farmer said he kept thinking about the many water stations at the : “That’s for a sport, for heaven’s sake. You’re telling me the giant humanitarian aid machine can’t do that in an epidemic?”Mark Henderson, a official, said water trucking was done inside the town of St. Marc. “I don’t know if it would have been logistically possible to send a water truck to every village in the Artibonite,” he said. “And I’m not sure it would have yielded better results than getting water, which is available locally, and applying chlorine.”There was also a reluctance to use antibiotics, which can reduce diarrhea, spare suffering and potentially limit the disease’s spread.The Cubans alone, who claimed in a report that without their help “another 1,000 Haitians would have died at Haitian Health Ministry institutions,” dispensed antibiotics to all cholera patients and preventively to their relatives.World health authorities, concerned with cost and drug resistance, initially said antibiotics should be reserved for severe cases. Nearly three months later, the C.D.C. recommended antibiotics for moderate cases, too.The fiercest disagreement was over vaccination. Again, citing cost as well as limited supplies and logistical challenges, world health officials initially did not endorse it. Some worried aloud that Haitians could get a false sense of security and become lax about hygiene.Also, one of the two oral vaccines available — Shanchol, the cheaper one — was still under review by the .But proponents argued that vaccines could save lives and buy time until long-range solutions like water and waste systems were put in place. They called for fast-tracking approval for Shanchol and increasing vaccine production by offering manufacturers purchase commitments. In mid-December, after a C.D.C. analysis indicated that using the available vaccine doses could reduce the caseload by 22,000, the Pan American Health Organization agreed a pilot vaccination project would be useful.Influenced by arguments against vaccination, though, the Haitian government said no. Choosing a small group to be immunized would inflame tensions, it said; at least 500,000 needed to be vaccinated, said Jean Ronald Cadet, Haiti’s vaccination chief. “They brought us cholera, they have to take responsibility for taking care of it,” he said.In February 2011, nearly four months after the outbreak, the United Nations’ independent experts arrived in Haiti.The secretary general’s office wanted them to move quickly but not too quickly; it did not want the findings released until the Nepalese contingent had concluded its six-month rotation, Ms. Lantagne said.When the experts revealed their findings in May, the secretary general’s staff members were surprised, Ms. Lantagne said. Early theories had proposed environmental and climatological explanations for the outbreak. “I believe they fully expected our results to be that there was no possibility cholera was imported into Haiti,” she said.Instead, the panel said not only that the cholera had come from South Asia but that it originated in the tributary behind the Nepalese base.Yet the United Nations experts noted that “the introduction of this cholera strain as a result of environmental contamination with feces could not have been the source of such an outbreak without simultaneous water and sanitation and health care system deficiencies.”And they diplomatically concluded that the epidemic was “not the fault of, or deliberate action of, a group or individual.”The panel had examined the Nepalese base’s infirmary logs and found no reports of severe diarrhea in September or October of 2010. Many took that to mean that the soldiers were probably unwitting, asymptomatic carriers of cholera. But Dr. Piarroux did not think that asymptomatic carriers would have shed enough bacteria to have caused such a sudden, marked contamination of the river. He believed that many soldiers must have had diarrhea — even if it was only mild or moderate diarrhea that, being military men, they did not report to the infirmary.Testing the soldiers would have been the only way to learn the truth, Dr. Piarroux said. But Haitian health officials were not permitted onto the base to examine the soldiers.After the United Nations panel dispersed, Danish and American scientists collaborated to scrutinize the Haiti-Nepal connection using the most comprehensive type of bacterial genetic analysis — whole-genome sequence typing.Dr. Rene S. Hendriksen of persuaded the Nepalese to provide samples from their outbreak. Dr. Keim’s Translational Genomics Research Institute in sequenced the DNA, comparing it with Haitian samples already sequenced by the C.D.C.The Haitian and Nepalese strains were virtually identical — a conclusion the Nepalese were reluctant to accept. “They were trying to fish around for whether our analysis was properly conducted,” Dr. Hendriksen said. “But finally they gave up simply because our data was valid. We agreed we would balance the paper and not get into the blame game.”Citing this study and other evidence, a legal claim was submitted to the United Nations in November on behalf of Haiti’s cholera victims.Anticipating compensation, thousands flooded treatment centers seeking medical certificates attesting to their cholera. Doctors Without Borders set up a special unit to process the requests, and has asked the United Nations to clarify whether a legal proceeding is even moving forward.The victims’ lawyers have asked the United Nations to establish a commission to hear the claim. Mr. Banbury of the United Nations said the claim is “under serious review by the legal affairs department.”“The U.N.’s choice is simple,” the lawyers wrote in a legal article. “It can rise to the occasion and demonstrate that the rule of law protects the rights of poor Haitians against one of the world’s most powerful institutions, or it can shrink from the challenge and demonstrate that once again in Haiti, ‘might makes right.’ ”It is tempting now, when reported cholera cases are at a low, for Haitians to relax their guard and for health officials to take a breather.“We are no longer 24/7 cholera,” Dr. Pierre-Louis said. The same thing happened last year. Then the rains hit, and Port-au-Prince, like other places, experienced more cases — 24,000 — during a 42-day period than at the epidemic’s start. It was a scramble to deal with the surge; many grants had expired, emergency workers had gone home, and treatment centers were closed.“We had supplies and structures prepositioned, but it wasn’t simple,” said Mr. Drossart of Doctors Without Borders. “We couldn’t keep mobilizing staff for Haiti. There are other things going on in the world.”Dr. Vertefeuille of the C.D.C. said a key focus now was making the response sustainable without a large international presence. But the government health system, weak and underfinanced, will be hard-pressed to assume greater responsibility.Dr. Vertefeuille also said cholera was likely to persist in Haiti absent the development of water and sanitation systems, the cost of which has been estimated at $800 million to $1.1 billion.A singular achievement was the opening of Haiti’s first wastewater treatment site last fall. But humanitarian groups fret that short-term water and sanitation solutions are not being pursued aggressively, and that tent camps have lost the free water and, in some cases, the latrine services that gave them a buffer against cholera.Many also express keen frustration that the dry season is not being used for aggressive case tracking — chasing the disease into pockets where it flares, investigating and chlorinating the water source, and mobilizing the community.“You can’t wait with your arms crossed until the rain falls again,” Dr. Piarroux said. “You have to go after these areas like firemen trying to extinguish every last burning ember of a forest fire.”Those who now find the official response sluggish — “daily” epidemic surveillance is posted after a delay of weeks — point to what happened recently in Pestel in southwest Haiti.On Dec. 10, a severely dehydrated man showed up at the cholera treatment unit. The man was too far gone to be resuscitated, said Dr. Seneque Philippe, the physician in charge.Dr. Philippe’s cholera unit had been inactive because the government had not paid the staff’s salaries. He was not ready for another outbreak.Within two weeks, however, Dr. Philippe believed that he was in the midst of one. People were dying during the long journey down from the rugged mountains to his coastal hospital.He said that he alerted Health Ministry officials on Dec. 24, and that they were unresponsive. So he contacted an American missionary who had been working in Pestel for decades. She, in turn, tapped into an Internet network of health professionals involved in Haiti and gathered volunteers, supplies and money to pay Dr. Philippe’s nurses.They arrived Jan. 10 to find the cholera treatment unit overflowing. Most patients were coming from the mountains, so the volunteers, bolstered by other recruits, set up remote treatment tents. They also conducted a door-to-door census in the villages. Including treatment records, too, they calculated 278 suspected cholera cases and 62 deaths in December and January, with most deaths occurring before the ad-hoc group of foreigners arrived.In Port-au-Prince, Dr. Pierre-Louis of the Health Ministry maintained that the reported outbreak in Pestel had been a “false alarm,” with only 65 cases and three deaths. She said that “the local doctor” had rebutted the larger numbers.But Dr. Philippe, the local doctor, while saying he is “personally aware of only about 15 deaths,” said he knew of 300 cases — a significant outbreak.“I felt abandoned to handle the problem myself,” he said.Farther north, one effort to use the dry season to establish a bulwark against the disease was running into other problems.Late last fall, the new government of President had authorized a vaccination campaign. It was to start small, immunizing 50,000 residents of a Port-au-Prince slum and 50,000 rural residents in the St. Marc area.The organizers, wishing they could have begun a year earlier and more broadly, were nonetheless relieved to have secured the new administration’s cooperation; it helped that Shanchol, the cheaper vaccine at $1.85 a dose, had been approved.The organizers — Partners in Health and the Haitian group Gheskio — were also pleased to be starting well before the rains; the vaccine, considered nearly 70 percent effective, is administered in two doses two weeks apart and takes another week to take effect.In February, Djencia Augustin, 25, a petite, vivacious law student, was racing from mud hut to mud hut in the rice fields of Bocozel to register residents. She wore a T-shirt with a wordy slogan — “We are fighting cholera with Shanchol vaccine without forgetting the other principals of hygiene” — and, in the shade of breadfruit trees, gathered barefoot villagers in threadbare clothing around her as she recorded their information on a computer tablet.“Some people think cholera is not in our country anymore,” Ms. Augustin told them. “That’s not true. Cholera will come to visit when the rains arrive, so you need to be prepared.”Bocozel seemed eager. Chavan Dorcelus, 58, said: “It’s a real bonus for us. Plus it’s free, and it can’t hurt.”Told that pregnant women were ineligible, Fada Joseph, 24, patted her belly. “That’s not really fair. I’m very scared of cholera,” she said. “And if I got an , would that help?”But in mid-March, radio reports characterized the project as an experiment on Haitian guinea pigs. With $370,000 of vaccine sitting in coolers, a government bioethics committee took up the issue. The campaign appeared in peril. Dr. Farmer said last Thursday, however, that the Haitian health minister had just promised him that she would resolve the issue in the coming week.In Meille, the walled gate at the United Nations base is freshly painted now with the insignia of Uruguayan peacekeepers. The Nepalese are gone.The mission itself is reducing its forces nationwide. Nepal’s troop strength is being cut by two-thirds, more than any other country’s. United Nations officials said that this was unrelated to tensions over cholera.But people here think otherwise: “If they hadn’t left, we would have burned it down,” Deputy Mayor Moise said of the base.In February, an Uruguayan advance guard was there, removing latrines and generally “sanitizing the operation so previous problems do not repeat themselves,” as one soldier said.Across the street, the open pits where the base’s waste used to be deposited were fenced. “They stopped dumping the foreigners’ poo there after the cholera,” said Ludner Jean-Louis, a farmer, his two cows tied to trees.Mr. Jean-Louis, who had survived the disease himself, added, “I don’t guess you can be mad at Minustah for the cholera. Only for the poo.”Behind the base, the stream where the epidemic began bustles with life now as it did before the outbreak; many who live and work beside it have no other access to free water.Recently, just behind the base’s barbed-wire periphery, Dieula Sénéchal squatted with her skirt up, scrubbing exuberantly colored clothes while a naked 6-year-old girl, Magalie Louis, defecated by the bank, gnawed on a stalk of sugarcane and then splashed into the water to brush her teeth.Approaching with a machete on his way to hack some cane, her gap-toothed father, Légénord Louis, said Magalie had contracted cholera late last year but after four days of “special IVs” was restored to health. He knew the river water was probably not safe, he said, but, while they brushed their teeth in it, they did not swallow.For drinking water, Mr. Louis said, his family relies on a local well. But he lives from hand to mouth and cannot afford water purification tablets; the free supply he got in 2010 ran out long ago. So he gambles.“If you make it to the hospital,” he said, “you survive the cholera.”'"
"'12-04-01,'0','Saturday was his last chance for a tuneup before a potential opening day start, and the sense of occasion was reflected in the presence of Manager Terry Collins, who stayed at the complex for a couple of extra hours while his players made the trip to Jupiter, Fla., to play the Miami Marlins.Santana simulated three innings as Dan Warthen, the pitching coach, stood inside the batter’s box and invented situations using the names of National League hitters.“Prado, trying to hit a home run on the first pitch,” said Warthen, his hands gripping an invisible bat, referring to the Atlanta Braves’ Martín Prado. “After that, he’s going the other way.”Santana got into the moment, too. With one imaginary matchup having run to a full count, Santana spun a slider over the outside corner of the plate. After Warthen, now playing umpire, punched out the invisible batter, Santana clapped his hands and held out his glove for the ball before he broke into a wide smile.As the half-hour session came to a close, the last three names Warthen called out gave a clear indication of the Mets’ current hopes: Freddie Freeman, Jason Heyward and Andrelton Simmons, all players for the division rival Atlanta Braves.“That’s what I’m hoping for, but, again, we’ll see in the next couple of days how it is,” Santana said when asked if he would start on opening day. “If everything goes right, I’ll be there.”Collins and Warthen said that the session had gone smoothly.For all the uncertainty that accompanied Santana’s every move, his time in camp has been devoid of plot twists. His early bullpen sessions took place with a large audience of coaches, team officials and reporters. Then he graduated to Grapefruit League games, slowly increasing his workload. Under this scrutiny, Santana appeared to pass every test.The only thing resembling a setback came during his last exhibition outing, on Monday, when his fastball lacked its normal zip. The timing seemed to inject a modicum of doubt into the Mets’ early plans. Santana conceded Saturday that he had struggled in that start, but he played down the significance.“It was a tough day,” he said. “I didn’t know what to expect. It was the first time I went over 80 pitches.”The sight of Santana on the Citi Field mound Thursday would represent a triumphant end to his ordeal. Santana has not pitched for the Mets since 2010, when he had surgery to repair a torn capsule in his shoulder.But Santana suggested the climax of his story arc was, in fact, still far in the future.“We’re not done yet,” he said. “We’re just in the beginning of everything. The season hasn’t started.”Jim Crane, the owner of the Houston Astros, toured the Mets’ complex Saturday morning. The Astros’ lease in Kissimmee, Fla., will expire in 2016, and Digital Domain Park has the capacity for a second team.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','Were they a major-market team when Elio Chacon and Charlie Neal were the keystone combo? Back then, the new breed of fans was grateful to have any team at all.The current sour mood is understandable, what with the creepy smirk of Bernie Madoff leering over the franchise, the departure of Jose Reyes and the huge deficit as fans and their dollars stay away.The owners might as well put it in the fine print on the tickets:Please be advised that this team will make you cry, and make you laugh, but no money will be refunded if some latter-day Marvelous Marv misses a base or two while legging out a triple.Mets fans of all ages — even those who have no idea who Marv Throneberry was (ask your grandfathers) — need to brush up on the zany devotion of original Mets fans, the innate understanding that life was not easy, and was never going to be.From the first horrid season, Mets fans were proud of not being like the grim followers of other teams one could mention, whose fans expected championships every season. What kind of love is that?To renew these connubial vows, it is necessary to relive the conditions under which the Mets were formed. A large chunk of fans in the New York area were sleepwalking after the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants went west after the 1957 season.These abandoned fans did not know whether to root for their departed team in California or, what the heck, jump in the river and end it all. (The Yankees won three pennants in that time; how nice for them.)In 1962, the Mets were wrenched into existence from an expansion draft that was rigged to give the Mets the culls and rejects of other organizations. Casey Stengel went to spring training and started babbling that the new team might be a contender, but as Robert Lipsyte recalled recently in The New York Times, reports from Florida suggested Casey might have been exaggerating.Warned by a hip cadre of reporters on site in Florida, fans back north were conditioned not to take Casey too seriously. The Mets lost their first exhibition — an 8-0 defeat by the Cardinals — and opened the season in St. Louis, where the hotel elevator became stuck before they ever played (and lost) a game.It wasn’t long before Stengel called his team a fraud and noted that “the attendance got trimmed,” meaning the fans were shortchanged. So nothing that is happening in 2012 is new to anybody who was young and foolish in 1962.How sweet and exciting it was at the rickety old Polo Grounds, where fans carried their hearts and souls and surplus bed sheets on which they had scribbled hopeful prayers that the Mets might win a game once a week or so.It was a joyous spring of rediscovery. Willie Mays came back. Duke Snider came back. Stan Musial came back. Henry Aaron came back. Frank Robinson came back. This miracle, this rebirth, was surely a sign there was a deity of baseball.That first year was a love affair, but New York fans were not stupid. In one side of the bleachers was a loud old man named Looie Kleppel. In the other side was a loud old woman who called herself Mother of the Mets. Needless to say, they did not speak to each other. Separately, they roasted inept players and stodgy management.Owners have rarely been saluted for their brilliance. The original Mets were owned by a jolly rich woman, Joan Whitney Payson, who entrusted the new team to the crusty executives M. Donald Grant and George M. Weiss. These sour guardians did not think quips on bed sheets were appropriate and tried to have them removed from the premises. They tried to repress the very essence of Mets fans.Still, who in that amazing spring of 1962 would not have sold their souls for brief moments of ecstasy from Gil Hodges in 1969 and Yogi Berra in 1973 and Davey Johnson in 1986 and Bobby Valentine in 2000? Four World Series in 50 years for one measly soul? Done.Yes, the Mets are in trouble. With all that cable television money available in the New York area, the legal troubles of the Wilpons have turned the Mets into a small-market disaster. Fans talk of turning the Mets into a municipally owned treasure, like the Green Bay Packers, or finding a new owner-savior, but neither is likely to happen.Two years ago, I quoted Dante in warning Met fans to expect nothing. (“Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.”) That still works in 2012. But Mets fans need to take stock of the hope and humor that course underground, like a long-forgotten creek under a municipal dump.The team lost 120 games that first season. Who’s to say it couldn’t happen again?In this anniversary year, it’s time for fans to stop whining, time to honor their roots. The Mets are different. Always were.Just for sanity’s sake, it is time to revive the wonder of that spring, 50 years ago, when the chant first soared toward the heavens: Let’s go, Mets. What else is there?'"
"'12-04-01,'0','To compensate, the government often relies on the private sector to serve as an intermediary abroad. India’s two leading business groups — C.I.I. (the Confederation of Indian Industry) and Ficci (the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry) — now have offices around the world and sponsor informal diplomatic dialogues between India and countries like Japan, China, Singapore and the United States.As India’s growing economy demands more natural resources, its business leaders have led the country on an aggressive push into Africa and South America. Last year, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh toured Africa, pledging aid and good will in a high-level trip encouraged by an Indian private sector competing with China for resources on the African continent.“These are places that are incredibly important to India, but the Indian state doesn’t have the resources to maintain a major presence,” said Ashley J. Tellis, a former American diplomat who served in India. “Business has really become the de facto substitute for Indian diplomatic engagement. And that works out nicely for India.”India, a nation of 1.2 billion people, has about 800 diplomats serving in 162 missions and posts around the world. The United States, by comparison, has a diplomatic corps of more than 11,000. Even tiny Singapore surpasses India, with 847 foreign service officers.In a background interview last year, a senior Indian official agreed that the country’s diplomatic corps was far too small to adequately represent India’s global interests. An expansion and hiring program is under way, but the process remains tediously slow; as a result, India’s Ministry of External Affairs is often forced to borrow bureaucrats from other ministries. Or, the senior official said, the ministry sometimes leans on the private sector.“The presence of Indian corporations, both public and private, does help to expand our presence,” the official said. “Our footprint will also expand through the private sector.”Mr. Kumar last visited Lahore in November 2008, at a moment of cautious optimism. Trained as an economist, Mr. Kumar, who was then leading an Indian research group, met with members of a Pakistani research group to discuss their nations’ relationship amid speculation that Mr. Singh, the Indian prime minister, would soon make a historic visit to Pakistan.Less than two weeks later, militants trained in Pakistan assaulted Mumbai in an audacious and vicious terrorist attack, killing at least 163 people and enraging the Indian public. Any chance of a diplomatic breakthrough was shattered as diplomats worked to avert a military confrontation.By 2010, Mr. Kumar had joined Ficci, the Indian business group, with an agenda of expanding the group’s influence in India’s neighborhood and creating a fluid and interconnected South Asian market. He began traveling to Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, where the prime minister and other top leaders received him.“More and more, economics and commerce are seen as the primary drivers of international relations, which they were not in South Asia until very recently,” said Mr. Kumar, who is now Ficci’s secretary general.To a large degree, Mr. Kumar has been playing catch-up. For more than a decade, the other major Indian business group, C.I.I., has operated as one of the most influential interlocutors of Indian foreign policy, helping to facilitate closer Indian ties with Japan, Singapore and, most important, the United States.In 2001, C.I.I. partnered with the United States-based Aspen Institute to sponsor a meeting between Indian and American “thought” leaders in the Indian city of Udaipur. The United States and India, after decades of frosty relations, had suddenly warmed up to each other, especially after a visit to India by Bill Clinton. But neither side knew how to move forward.The Udaipur meeting brought together Henry A. Kissinger, the former national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, the Harvard scholar Joseph S. Nye Jr. and others on the American side to meet with an Indian delegation that included the industrialist Ratan N. Tata and the influential diplomat Naresh Chandra.“We started talking about defense, about energy,” recalled Tarun Das, the former head of the C.I.I. “We started talking about H.I.V./AIDS. The dialogue went into: ‘What else can we do? How can we build trust between the two countries?’ There was only mistrust after 50 years.”Since then, the C.I.I. has sponsored 14 more exchanges in a United States-India relationship that, if still fractious at times, is fundamentally changed. The two countries are now strategic partners, with growing cooperation on defense issues where one had not existed before. Today, India buys American military hardware and participates in joint exercises with the United States.The most dramatic concept borne of that initial meeting between the two countries involved cooperation on nuclear energy, in what eventually became the landmark United States-India Civil Nuclear Agreement. The deal was criticized in both countries, but it was eventually approved, if still not fully carried out.In 2008, when the United States Congress threatened to vote down the measure, India’s government got lobbying support from its most potent ally: the Indian private sector, which included Indian-Americans who had prospered in business, science and technology in the United States and had developed one of the most influential lobbies in Washington.Ashok Malik, a journalist who was one of the writers of an academic analysis of India’s private sector diplomacy, said the influence of Indian business is evident beyond the changed relationship with the United States. In 2005, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela was greeted with a big reception in New Delhi at a time when Indian leftists were part of the coalition government. Two years later, with the leftists no longer in the coalition, India’s president skipped Venezuela on a tour of South America, instead stopping in Chile and Argentina, where Indian corporations had business interests.Mr. Malik said Indian diplomats were now trained to consider business development as a primary part of their job. “Before, commerce was beneath public policy,” he said. “Now they are talking individual deals.”Business has also become a primary conduit for increasing India’s footprint in East Asia, China’s backyard. Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Australia have each increased business ties, partly as a strategy to draw closer diplomatically to India and possibly nurture a counterbalance to China. At the same time, the C.I.I. is quietly sponsoring yet another dialogue, this time with China itself.“We are slowly trying to see if there can be some building of trust with China,” Mr. Das said in an interview last year. “It is much more difficult than with the Americans.”At the convention center in Lahore in February, Pakistani soldiers were posted everywhere, assault rifles in full view as they awaited the arrival of Indian delegation. Mr. Kumar had come two days early, to open the trade booths, but now the Indian commerce minister, Anand Sharma, was arriving with his Pakistani counterpart, as well as the Indian trade delegation. Security was a concern.A careful reconciliation between India and Pakistan has been under way since July 2011, eight months after the Mumbai attacks, with efforts being made on both sides of the border. Mr. Sharma’s visit was a significant gesture: he was the first Indian commerce minister ever to make an official visit to Pakistan, though few people expected any breakthroughs.“I see it as a symbolic act, a vaccination against the right-wing groups who will oppose India,” Mr. Kumar said of the trade show and Mr. Sharma’s visit. “If this is successful, the next one can be bigger.”Pakistan is easily India’s toughest foreign policy challenge, with hard-liners on both sides showing little desire to compromise, yet Mr. Kumar believes progress is possible because the middle class in both countries wants to ease hostilities and focus on economic growth.Mr. Malik noted that the rise of India’s middle class, as well as the growing domestic influence of the private sector, has created a quiet constituency for easing hostilities with Pakistan. “The growth phenomenon has made the Indian middle class less tolerant of adventurism, lawlessness and war,” he said. “It is still worried about terrorism. But it doesn’t want to fight wars. It has other things to do.”India’s political establishment is still grappling with redefining the country’s foreign policy, and its cold war legacy of nonalignment still holds a lingering and potent appeal. As the private sector (and Mr. Singh) have pushed India toward closer ties with historical rivals like the United States, and now Pakistan, a strong reaction has occurred in some quarters. Many leftists say the government is pushing India too close to the United States and kowtowing to corporate interests. Right-wing Hindu groups are suspicious of any interaction with Pakistan.And others note that the corporate sector is protective of its own vested interests. Mr. Tellis, the former American diplomat, said India’s uncertain response to the Arab Spring was partly because the nation’s private sector — which has major business dealings in the Persian Gulf — was hesitant to embrace political change.“They are simply afraid that if they end up supporting revolutionary movements, many of their economic interests that have been put in place, private sector interests, would be at risk,” Mr. Tellis said. “These interests feel very uncomfortable with change in the status quo in the gulf.”In Pakistan, the slow progress being made on trade could be derailed by a new terrorist attack, a risk Mr. Kumar regards as unavoidable. Meanwhile, movement on issues like Kashmir and terrorism is almost nonexistent. Still, two weeks after the Indian trade trip, Pakistan announced a change in rules that could greatly expand the number of products imported from India — a business and diplomatic victory.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','They contend that new instruments should be approved by a “financial products agency” that would test them for social utility. Ideally, products deemed too costly to society over all — those that serve only to increase speculation, for example — would be rejected, the two professors say.“It is not the main purpose of our proposal to protect consumers and other unsophisticated investors from shady practices or their own ignorance,” they wrote. “Our goal is rather to deter financial speculation because it is welfare-reducing and contributes to systemic risk.”It is a refreshing rejoinder to the mantra on Wall Street — and in some circles in Washington — that financial innovation is always good and regulation is always bad. Bankers often argue that complex financial products are among America’s great inventions.But given that exotic instruments played a central role in the credit crisis, it is worth questioning the costs and benefits of such financial innovations. The paper by Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl provides a basis for what could be a productive dialogue.“We tried an experiment with a very radical form of deregulation that has very little basis in sound economic science,” Mr. Weyl said in an interview last week. “What we’re advocating is to do the best we can to put the genie back in the bottle.”FIRST, their paper says, we should distinguish between financial markets — where institutions lend money, trade securities and make investments — and the real economy, where people trade goods and services.“It is tempting to think that if the real economy should be largely unregulated (as it is), then the financial markets should be as well,” the professors wrote. But that view, they went on, is wrong.Instead, they advocate testing new financial products for social benefits. For example, financial instruments could be judged by whether they help people hedge risks — which is generally beneficial — or whether they simply allow gambling, which can be costly.The instruments could also be measured for how they affect capital allocation, and whether they might add useful information to the marketplace.The professors note certain instruments that they say have added little to society. Among them are credit default swaps, which were devised in the 1990s and became enormously popular.The paper concludes that credit default swaps have considerable drawbacks. Those who use swaps to hedge their debt holdings, for example, assume the risks of dealing with counterparties. Swaps also contribute little to the appropriate allocation of capital, the professors say, because investors use them to take positions on debt that is already outstanding. And the paper dismisses the notion that such swaps provide significant information to the market about the safety of underlying debt.Imagining a credit default swap being brought before a financial protection agency, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl wrote: “We would expect the F.P.A. to treat it skeptically.”Alternatively, the professors point to a type of derivative that lets homeowners hedge exposures to real estate. These derivatives are potentially good for society because they can offset losses if housing prices fall, Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl say, reckoning that the instruments have had a positive effect for those who have used them. But unlike credit default swaps, they have gained little traction in the market.The professors also question the central tenet of the nation’s financial regulatory framework — that full disclosure provides enough protection for investors.“My major concern about Dodd-Frank is that the basic philosophy behind it is to improve disclosure, the traditional way of addressing market failures in a way that is thought to be helpful but not too intrusive,” Mr. Posner said last week.But disclosure alone isn’t enough in the pharmaceutical industry, he said, and the same view should be applied to finance.“In pharmaceuticals, we could allow a company to sell whatever it wants as long as it tells people the product might work but also might cause your head to fall off,” Mr. Posner said. “We don’t do that because people will ignore the information, so we draw the line and say, ‘You can’t buy that product.’ ”Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl say they know full well that their proposal will upset the wizards of Wall Street and their fans, which include many in the regulatory arena. The professors also recognize that their proposal, if enacted, would encourage financial activity to move overseas in order to evade oversight.But this challenge faces any type of financial regulation, and the professors suggest that it could be solved by coordination with other countries having large financial centers.THE proposal by Mr. Posner and Mr. Weyl is unlikely to get off the ground anytime soon. But if their ideas open a discussion about measuring the social costs of our financial products, that alone would be a step forward.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','A German organization that was also targeted in Egypt, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, recently closed its office in the U.A.E. at the demand of the country’s foreign ministry.The closing of democracy-building organizations cast a shadow on the meeting here Saturday, which was intended to inaugurate a strategic multilateral alliance with the nations in the Gulf Cooperation Council. In addition to the U.A.E., the group includes Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar and Oman.Mrs. Clinton said the alliance would create “opportunities to pursue multilateral cooperation on shared challenges, including terrorism, nuclear proliferation and piracy.” As with Egypt, though, she found herself defending American nongovernmental organizations, or N.G.O.’s, in countries that are important to the United States on security matters.When pressed during a news conference about the closing, Mrs. Clinton said “we very much regret it” and said she had brought it up with the country’s foreign minister at the conference.“Both N.D.I. and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation offices play a key role in supporting N.G.O.’s and civil society across the region, and I expect our discussion on this issue to continue,” she said.She added, however, that the administration’s “overarching” interest was to cooperate with countries in the region, particularly in the areas of security and antiterrorism.The idea for Saturday’s meeting took shape last fall as the Obama administration moved ahead with its withdrawal of the last American troops from Iraq, reducing the American military presence in the region at a time of increasing tensions with Iran.The United States has close bilateral military relations with all six gulf nations, but the administration hopes to develop a more united military strategy that would include an integrated missile defense system, intended to combat any attack in the region from Iran.The United States has recently stepped up arms sales to gulf nations, including a $30 billion sale of 154 F-15 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia and a nearly $2 billion one to provide the United Arab Emirates with one of the most sophisticated antimissile systems.The gulf council, dominated by Saudi Arabia, has become more active beyond its borders. Qatar and the U.A.E. sent combat aircraft to the Mediterranean last year as part of the intervention against Libya, while Bahrain and the U.A.E. have forces in Afghanistan.That has made the United States eager to work even more closely with the nations as a group. At the same time, however, the gulf nations are some of the least democratic in the world. Last year, the gulf council dispatched a military force to Bahrain to support that government’s suppression of popular protests, brushing aside American criticism. (Critics of the Obama administration’s policy in Bahrain argue that the United States, which bases its Fifth Fleet there, did not itself press the country hard enough to end a brutal crackdown.)Mr. Campbell of the National Democratic Institute said the group had been working in Dubai for almost four years. On Wednesday, he said, authorities visited the office and said the license had been canceled, but did not say why.He said the office helped support programs in countries including Qatar and Kuwait and that many of its programs worked with women to bolster their leadership skills. He said the organization had two expatriates and two local staff members in Dubai.“I don’t know if this is part of a pattern after Egypt, but we’re disappointed and disturbed at this turn of events,” he said.Sam Gejdenson, a former House Democrat from Connecticut who serves on the NDI board, said that certain players in the Middle East may have felt threatened by the activities of the regional office.“Sometimes there are factions in a country that try to convince themselves if they can hold things together, everything will pass and be okay,” he said, adding that he was not speaking on behalf of NDI. “So they lash out at organization like NDI that try to help bring about fair and honest elections. But you pay a heavy price in the long haul for such a move.”Mrs. Clinton also confirmed Saturday that Iran and six world powers, including the United States, had agreed to meet in Istanbul on April 13 for the latest round of talks about Iran’s nuclear program.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','In some circles, the stock market commands almost as much attention as sports, and in these precincts the month was also notable. On March 15, the Standard & Poor’s 500, which tracks the movements of big-company stocks, closed above 1,400. That’s a gain of 107 percent from its 2009 low. The index has been flirting with 1,400 since, closing on Friday above 1,408. It has gained 12 percent this year.That achievement may not warrant a brass band, but it is something of a milestone. Before March, the market hadn’t closed above 1,400 in nearly three years — 951 trading days, actually. (Morgan Stanley has been counting.) Many brokerage statements will now make for more pleasant reading. But based on past history, Morgan Stanley suggested in a research report, investors would be wise to respond with relief rather than rapture.AFTER all, the market has been here before, several times, always with dismal results. The S.& P. surmounted 1,400 in 1999, before the market tumble that started in 2000. The index broke through it again on Nov. 17, 2006, and climbed above 1,500 the next year, only to fall off a cliff. After many years of wrenching ups and downs, in other words, the S.& P. has gone nowhere.What’s worse, Morgan Stanley finds parallels to late 2006 and concludes that the market today is in some ways more precarious.While the economy has been growing lately, the report said, “macro conditions are vastly different and largely worse” than in 2006. Real gross domestic product in March grew at a lower annual rate — 1.6 percent, versus. 2.2 percent in November 2006. Inflation was much higher — 2.9 percent versus 1.4 percent. And the disparity in unemployment rates is shockingly steep, at 8.3 percent versus only 4.4 percent.Most corporate balance sheets are in better shape than they were in 2006, but the Federal Reserve’s is conspicuously bloated, the report noted. The Fed has been doing its best to prop up the economy and to make riskier assets, like stocks, more appealing, but its efforts may pose significant dangers.“During this same period, the Federal Reserve has tripled its balance sheet to nearly $3 trillion through purchases of mortgage securities and Treasuries,” Morgan Stanley noted. “While this stimulative monetary policy has arguably aided risky assets, it has increased uncertainty as well, since ultimately it needs to be unwound.”The Fed stands ready to do more. With the housing market weak and unemployment high, it is “too early to declare victory” for the economy, Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said last week. And if oil and gas prices climb high enough, they could easily derail the American economy. So could the recession in Europe or a flare-up of the financial crisis simmering in the euro zone. Or slowing growth in China. Or fiscal austerity in the United States.David Rosenberg, chief economist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto, and formerly of Merrill Lynch, wrote in a report that huge central-bank intervention is the “critical reason” the market has “doubled over the past three years — punctuated by steep givebacks once the taps are turned off (only to then be turned on again.)” This pattern is likely to continue, he says, so investors should keep their wits about them.IN a similar vein, Morgan Stanley says expectations of rising corporate profits have persuaded many investors to pay richer prices for stocks. But the trajectory of the profit growth is flattening, it says. The company emphatically warns its clients: “Don’t pay a higher multiple for today’s corporate earnings.”In short, the stock market is back and may well move higher still. But it’s worth remembering that it is a blood sport — more “Hunger Games” than light entertainment.Golf, on the other hand, is a gentler pastime. Yet it, too, has provided some stern tests, with one this week at the Masters tournament at Augusta National. Like the market, Tiger Woods is back, yes. How securely, we may soon see.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','It’s true that by the end of the Bush presidency, prices had fallen back to $1.69, as oil prices plummeted with the rest of the global economy. But I think we can all agree that a global financial crisis is too high a price to pay for cheap gasoline.Still, Republican presidential candidates are blaming the policies of President Obama for the current high level of gasoline prices. Mitt Romney has said that the president should fire three of his cabinet members for failing to get oil prices down.Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, has promised us $2.50-a-gallon gasoline. But if we can suspend the law of supply and demand, why stop with gasoline? Why not $2.50 for one-carat diamonds, steak dinners and 18-year-old Scotch whiskey?Although the United States cannot unilaterally lower the price of oil, it can reduce its consumption, by using oil more efficiently and by developing alternative sources of fuel. For example, the Obama administration has raised the corporate average fuel economy standards imposed on automakers. If consumers buy more fuel-efficient cars and trucks, demand for gasoline falls, as does the burden imposed by high gas prices. But while such rules help, they are not the best way of achieving societal goals.A better approach would be to gradually raise the gasoline tax to levels similar to those in Western Europe, where fuel-efficient cars are the norm. N. Gregory Mankiw — the Harvard economist who advises Mr. Romney and is a fellow contributor to the Economic View column — has long advocated such a policy. I agree with him, as do most other economists.For evidence, note that the economists in that same University of Chicago poll were asked whether they agreed with this statement: “A tax on the carbon content of fuels would be a less expensive way to reduce carbon-dioxide emissions than would a collection of policies such as ‘corporate average fuel economy’ requirements for automobiles.”On this question, there was just a single negative vote. Yet in our current political climate, making the sensible suggestion that we gradually raise the tax on gasoline — or impose a broader system of carbon taxes — is ridiculed, and no one running for president can safely make such a proposal. At least two of the candidates have shown that they understand the underlying economics. In the past, both President Obama and Mr. Romney have acknowledged that higher gas prices have an upside: they give car owners the right incentives, and if the high prices stem in part from higher fuel taxes, the deficit can be trimmed. But such obviously true statements are now considered almost unpatriotic, equivalent to cheering against the U.S.A. in the Olympics.THE confused public debate on this topic is representative of a more general problem. The voting public is not very good at attributing credit and blame to presidents. They get too much credit when things go well and too much blame when things go badly. The same applies to coaches, C.E.O.’s, parents and anyone else in charge. Leaders are important but not omnipotent.So, to evaluate a leader, we must determine the factors over which that leader has a modicum of control. If you hate the Obama health care program and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, by all means give the president a big share of the blame. And if you love them, give him some credit. What makes no sense is to blame the president for rising gas prices, where he has virtually no control, but not to give him some credit for rising stock prices and an improved labor market, domains where his policies — along with those of the Federal Reserve and Congress — are more likely to have had an effect.When we make our choice on Election Day, we should consider that the winner will have an important impact on policies in many areas: health care, distribution of the tax burden, Supreme Court nominations, and abortion rights. The candidates’ differences on those issues should be driving our decision, not the wishful thinking that a president can simply lower the price of gasoline. Or Scotch, alas.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','THE artwork that organizations choose for their buildings, or for their grounds, is as important as the art that people select for their homes.Corporate buyers are looking to complete their space in an interesting way. They also select paintings, photography and sculptures for their employees’ enjoyment and to project a certain image. Some view their art as an extension of their corporate work life. I enjoy the challenge of coming up with a plan that reflects what a client wants to say about itself.I’ve been an art adviser to corporations, law firms, developers, trade associations and other organizations for 36 years. Much of my work comes from referrals. I’m often contacted by a managing partner of a law firm or a C.E.O. or firm administrator. If, after interviewing me, a group goes ahead with the project, it forms an art committee to work with me.Every project is different, depending on the client’s goals. One company wanted to emphasize that it’s a global organization. I suggested a series of antique textiles — tapestries, paisley shawls, 18th-century English bed coverings, Indian embroideries, batiks, costumes and ethnographic artwork — from locations around the globe where the company has offices. We were surprised to learn that one of the shawls was a rare textile that experts believed had been lost. The client became so involved in the company’s collection that he was asked to join the board of the Textile Museum in Washington.I’ve found that much exciting work today involves merging art and technology. Artists are using computer-generated images, LED lighting, video and other technology, and it’s attracting interest from companies.Some organizations aren’t sure what they want when we start together. At a law firm I worked with, I learned that many partners had engineering backgrounds. I suggested devoting a portion of the collection to works of art in glass, either blown or cast in molds. I thought the glass-making process would interest people with that type of background.'"
"'12-04-01,'0','Last year, you started a liberal antidote to the that is now called Rebuild the Dream. You said, “Hold onto your hats” for an “October offensive.” Then I didn’t hear much else. . . . We were pointing at the possibility of a very explosive populist movement from the left. It happened at the grass-roots level, and it was called Occupy. Rebuild hasn’t got the same press attention, but we have 600,000 members and a presence in every Congressional district.Occupy lacked a rational spokesman versed in the issues. Why didn’t you join them? You can’t really work for Occupy, because it’s not an organization. It’s a swarm. We did everything we could to support it. I’m not proprietary at the end of the day.

I don’t mind bearing the cross for controversial ideas I had when I was younger, but I can’t stand bearing the cross for wacky ideas I never had. I’m a black guy who used to sue police departments for brutality. You don’t have to make up stuff to scare people.Why didn’t the administration simply deny that you’d signed it? There was a lot of pressure on me from the right and the media. My brain was turning into putty. I said, “I’ve never seen this language before.” But it was like five years earlier, and maybe somebody had tricked me. I resigned on a Saturday night. The next week, we began piecing together what happened. By then, of course, nobody cared.What did the president say to you afterward? Did the president of the personally call me? No. No, he didn’t.Really? He calls after a football team wins. Fox News had raked you over the coals for weeks. My decision to resign was horrible, it was painful.

"'12-04-01,'0','Rivers, too, can cause trouble. New Jersey’s inland riverfront communities have been hit harder than coastal areas by nearly annual storms in recent years, including Hurricane Irene at the end of August and Tropical Storm Lee in the first week of September; both caused severe flooding.Responses have run the gamut — everything from dismantling houses most directly in harm’s way to fortifying their peripheries with retaining walls and systems to redirect water.Manville, at the confluence of the Millstone and Raritan Rivers in Somerset County, has been flooded repeatedly in recent years. “We’ve had our fill of it,” said Gary P. Garwacke, the borough’s administrator and engineer, who has joined with his counterparts in neighboring towns to form the Raritan-Millstone Flood Control Commission, in search of long-range plans beyond buying out or elevating homes deemed to be under threat.After Hurricane Floyd in 1999, the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the state joined forces to buy out and raze 44 badly flooded homes in Manville. Since Irene, Manville has received $3.9 million in federal and state funds to buy and dismantle 15 houses, Mr. Garwacke said. In Wayne, close to 50 houses are in line to be bought and torn down.Manville’s neighbor Bound Brook has also been victimized by flooding. But damage was less severe last year as a result of an Army Corps of Engineers effort begun in the 1970s, the Green Brook Flood Control Project, a complex system of levees, flood walls and bridge alterations that cost $120 million. With 85 percent of the project complete by the time Hurricane Irene struck (and the rest scheduled for completion later this year), downtown Bound Brook got three feet of water last August, versus the 12 feet produced by Floyd, said Dale Leubner, a project engineer, who added, “It lessened both the area affected and amount of water significantly.”Somerset County was particularly hard hit last year, and many towns are still recovering, to judge by the results of a door-to-door survey of 1,400 county homeowners just completed by the Somerset Area Disaster Recovery Committee. Lynn Weckworth, a volunteer on the committee, said some people had yet to move back into their houses, and others had yet to clean out their basements.“Some people were so overwhelmed, they just couldn’t deal with it at all,” Ms. Weckworth said, explaining that the survey offered a way “to see the scope of needs and prioritize where we should be addressing first.”Development has only worsened flooding, with paved surfaces and culverts giving heavy rains fewer places to soak into the ground. In response, some new building projects are including plans to reopen waterways. One such project was recently completed at the former Magic Marker site in Trenton, which is being redeveloped for affordable housing and green space. The engineering firm Princeton Hydro was hired to open up a piped-in water system, re-exposing 1,200 feet of natural stream known as Petty’s Run. Geoffrey Goll, a founder of Princeton Hydro, said that only minutes after the waterway was reopened, “kids came down and started picking frogs out of the stream.”Houses carrying mortgages are required to carry flood insurance if they are in flood plains. But once a mortgage is paid off, homeowners often drop their flood insurance, said Jeff Wyrsch, a vice president of Van Dyk Insurance in Beach Haven Terrace. He added that those living outside of flood zones rarely bought flood insurance.“For all the flooding we’ve seen in New Jersey,” Mr. Wyrsch said, “most of it has not been at the shore. It’s along the rivers where people don’t think about getting flood insurance. The only time we have people coming in asking for it is after they’ve been affected. It’s always in hindsight.”'"
"'12-04-01,'0','AS a nature writer and former wilderness ranger, Ceiridwen Terrill has spent a lot of time roaming the wilderness, often with her dogs. Her treks with Inyo, a wolf and husky mix she adopted as a traveling companion, are the subject of her new book “Part Wild.” And her shepherd mix, Argos, has been trained to carry his own backpack. “Even at 12 years old, he can put in the miles,” she said on the phone from Portland, Ore., where she lives and teaches at Concordia University.Hiking with dogs helps Ms. Terrill feel safer on the trail and is a great bonding experience, she said. But there are guidelines that hikers should adhere to for the safety of both wild and domestic animals. Here are excerpts from a conversation about trekking the great outdoors with a canine companion.Q. How do you prepare for a long trek with your dog?A. Almost any breed can hike — you just need to get them in shape and used to uneven or rocky terrain. Practice the “come” command, because as much as they are able to inhibit a lot of their natural drives, if they smell a wild animal, they will go deaf. If you don’t have 100 percent confidence in your dog, hike with it on a 25-foot cable. What I like to do is take a Flexi lead carabiner, usually used for rock climbing, and attach it to my pack. That way, the dog is always connected to me but I’m hands-free.Q. What supplies do dogs need?A. Choose a pack for your dog and then start them wearing it around the neighborhood on walks to get them comfortable with it. You want one that’s sturdy, well made and secured with straps under the belly and around the chest. I always like to sew on reflective strips. You need to be able to see your dog in low light or by headlamp. Get dog boots for traction if you’re going to be in snow or on rough terrain. Your exercise routine will toughen up their feet, but sometimes you need boots too, especially if you’re in cactus country.Q. What are some ways to keep your dog safe?A. Dogs chasing wildlife is bad news; they are predators. Also, people have lost their dogs as a result. People can also lose their dogs to stream or river crossings. Make sure to remove your dog’s pack and test the speed of the current. Use a harness because the dog can slip the collar. And get your dog used to water before going.Q. What other precautions should people take?A. Bring a first-aid kit and a snakebite kit. Heat is not to be taken lightly. There are just some places that are too hot for dogs. Be aware of poison oak. They can get it on their fur and transfer it right to you. Check the water conditions with local rangers. Carrying enough water for you and your dog adds a bunch of weight. So at least make sure to camp near water at night.'"

"'12-04-02,'1','Kim, a three-time tour winner, had donated her entire paycheck from her last victory, the Lorena Ochoa Invitational, to charity. She tried to look at her runner-up finish as a blessing, but the tears in her eyes made it hard to see anything clearly.“It’s just hard to kind of focus on what’s going on right now because I was still a little bit bummed about what happened, honestly,” she said.Yoo described her victory as huge and said she felt more nervous speaking about the victory than sealing it.“I think I did better than I was expecting, so I’m very happy,” she said. “I was thinking one shot at a time and keeping it simple.”It was hard to say which was more shocking: Kim’s miss or Tseng’s closing 73.Tseng won here in 2010. She collected 12 titles worldwide last year and posted victories in three of her first five starts in 2012. She became the second-youngest player, after Nancy Lopez, to reach 15 L.P.G.A. victories, and started the day tied for the lead, at nine under, with Sjodin.Last year, Tseng entered the final round at Mission Hills with a two-stroke lead, shot a 74 and was overtaken by Lewis. This time, Tseng opened with a bogey that turned into a three-stroke swing when Sjodin eagled the second hole. After two more bogeys on the front side, Tseng settled down.“I was totally shocked that I couldn’t make that last putt,” Tseng said. “But I tried my best again.”She added: “I don’t feel I played really bad today. I think I just needed a little more luck to drop some putts. A little disappointed, but not really. You know, it’s not the end of the world.”Motivated by last year’s near-miss here, Tseng had cut such a large swath through the tour that nobody blinked earlier in the week when she said she had been jumping in her backyard pool to practice for the winner’s leap into the pond running alongside the 18th green.If there has been a negative to Tseng’s dominance, it is that people believe it is easy to be her. Lewis said the expectations that Tseng carries like an extra 10 pounds must be hard to bear.“I think Yani’s got a ton of pressure on her,” Lewis said, adding, “I couldn’t imagine having that pressure.”Kim can imagine it now, after having a taste of what it’s like to think you have a major locked up and lose it.“I don’t know,” she said. “Sometimes, things happen, and it’s kind of tough because it’s Nabisco, but hopefully I’ll have better or more chances.”MAHAN WINS HOUSTON OPEN Hunter Mahan shot a one-under 71 to win the Houston Open in Humble, Tex., edging Carl Pettersson by a stroke and becoming the first two-time champion on the PGA Tour in 2012.Mahan finished 16 under for the tournament and moved to No. 4 in the world ranking, the first time he has been the highest-ranked American.Ernie Els finished 10 under and fell short in his bid to earn an automatic invitation to this week’s Masters. Els needed a victory Sunday to avoid missing the tournament for the first time since 1993.The Masters could offer Els a special invitation, like the one tournament officials gave Greg Norman in 2002, but he said he would not accept it.“To go through all of this and then get an invite, I wouldn’t take it,” he said. “They can keep it.” (AP)'"

"'12-04-02,'1','Visa removed Global Payments, an Atlanta company that helps the payment giant process transactions for merchants, from its list of “compliant service providers.”A security breach at Global Payments reported on Friday was thought to have compromised up to three million credit card accounts. It is among a group of companies that act as the plumbing in the electronic transaction chain, authorizing millions of transactions a day. That makes the companies prime targets for data thieves looking to steal richly detailed financial information.The details of the data breach are still unknown, but bank officials said Friday that they were told by Visa and MasterCard that the breach happened between late January and late February. The hackers gained access to what is known as Track 1 and Track 2 data, which includes names, card numbers and validation codes.Ahead of a scheduled conference call, Global Payments announced on Sunday that hackers had compromised only 1.5 million card numbers. In a statement, the company also reassured investors and customers that the data theft was limited to Track 2 data and did no include Social Security numbers, addresses or cardholder names. “Based on the forensic analysis to date, network monitoring and additional security measures, the company believes that this incident is contained,” the company said in the statement. That’s not enough to earn Global Payments a spot on Visa’s approved provider list. In a statement Sunday, Visa confirmed its decision to remove Global Payments from its list of approved providers. The decision was first reported by The Wall Street Journal.“Based on Global Payments’ reported unauthorized access, Visa removed the company” from its list of providers, Visa said in a statement.Amy Corn, a spokeswoman for Global Payments, said the company expected to be reinstated, but she did not indicate how long that would take. “We continue to process transactions for our merchants and customers with the same efficiency and care that they have come to expect,” she said.'"
"'12-04-02,'1','“I want to give to Tim Cook for this,” said Dara O’Rourke, associate professor of environmental and labor policy at the . “He’s admitting they’ve got problems.”Apple’s supply chain is a subject much closer to Mr. Cook than it was to his predecessor. Not long after Mr. Jobs returned to lead Apple in 1997, he hired Mr. Cook to clean up the manufacturing operations, which were in disarray, with bloated inventory that hurt its profits. Over more than a decade, Mr. Cook helped transform Apple’s operations into the envy of the electronics industry, with an array of partners, mostly in , able to efficiently pump out its latest products.In contrast to Mr. Cook, Mr. Jobs never visited the factories in where Apple’s products were made, according to two people with knowledge of the matter who declined to be identified to avoid antagonizing Apple.During the years when he was chief executive, Mr. Jobs was never as directly engaged with Apple’s effort to audit its suppliers as Mr. Cook was, according to a former Apple executive who declined to be identified. Still, when Mr. Jobs learned of the more serious violations of its supplier code of conduct — instances where was used, for example — he was outraged, this person said.Mr. Cook has spoken publicly of how his blue-collar roots growing up in gave him an early appreciation for factory work. “I spent a lot of time in factories personally, and not just as an executive,” Mr. Cook told investors at a conference in in February. “I worked in a paper mill in Alabama and an aluminum plant in .”Some labor rights advocates, though, said they were not yet convinced that last week’s report about conditions in Foxconn factories would lead to meaningful improvements for workers, saying that earlier promises of progress by Apple and its partners had not been fulfilled.“It looks like a pattern I’ve observed before,” said Jeff Ballinger, a global labor activist and researcher. “It’s a report to get you over and hopefully things will die down. It’s not very convincing.”Since 2007, Apple has published annual reports with the results of audits of factories where its products are produced. But in the last several months under Mr. Cook’s watch, the company has taken a bolder set of steps to prod its suppliers into making workplace improvements.In January, when Apple published its 2012 annual report on conditions within its suppliers’ factories, the company also released the names of 156 companies that supplied it with parts and other services involved in the manufacturing of Apple products, something it had previously declined to do.To help end excessive overtime work, it began publishing monthly reports on compliance with Apple’s policy of a 60-hour workweek at its supplier factories. For the month of February, Apple said that compliance figure rose to 89 percent from 84 percent in January.This year, Apple also became the first technology company to join the Fair Labor Association, and it invited the nonprofit global monitoring group to conduct inspections of its suppliers’ factories in China and elsewhere.Last week, the group published the results of its first inspections of Apple’s supply chain, citing numerous violations of Chinese labor laws and regulations at Foxconn factories, including instances where workers exceeded the 60-hour workweek that is the association’s standard.Foxconn, which is based in , promised that by July 2013 its employees would no longer exceed the 49-hour workweek limit set by Chinese law. Workers will not see a pay decline because of corresponding wage increases, Foxconn pledged.In a statement, Apple said, “Our team has been working for years to educate workers, improve conditions and make Apple’s supply chain a model for the industry, which is why we asked the F.L.A. to conduct these audits.”Apple has said it had made many improvements to factory conditions over the years. In 2008, for example, company inspectors discovered a situation in which a supplier had forced foreign workers to give up their passports to factory managers, effectively limiting their ability to leave their jobs. Apple demanded that the supplier, unnamed in Apple’s annual report mentioning the incident, return the passports to the workers.Other problems have been harder for Apple to eradicate. Even Mr. Cook conceded in his speech at the investor conference in February that Apple had consistently found that suppliers had violated the company’s overtime policies.Daniel Diermeier, a professor at who studies reputation management, says he believes the more aggressive stance by Apple toward factory conditions is the result of greater scrutiny of the company by media and advocacy groups, at a time when there is also intense interest in Apple’s soaring share price and cash reserves. But he also believes Mr. Cook’s leadership has played a role in the changes.“I think he probably has a deeper understanding, and this is more personal for him than it might be for other executives,” Mr. Diermeier said.Some worker advocates say they are hopeful the changes that have occurred under Mr. Cook will lead to lasting improvements in the manufacturing of electronics products.“They have an opportunity to become the new face of sustainable production in the electronics sector,” said Meg Roggensack, senior adviser, business and human rights at Human Rights First, a nongovernmental organization. “They’re smart enough. They’re well capitalized enough.”'"
"'12-04-02,'1','Erica Molina was standing where she usually stands at lunchtime, in the middle of her 116 square feet — an irregularly shaped booth in the Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side. She was talking about the $5,000 loan that had allowed her to buy the counter she was leaning on and the used refrigerator behind her when a delivery arrived.That, too. “For quesadillas,” she explained.Ms. Molina and her business partner, Jesse Kramer, turned to an unconventional source for the money to keep their Brooklyn Taco Company food stand afloat last year: Accion East, an arm of a nonprofit microlender that specializes in small loans to entrepreneurs who, like Ms. Molina and Mr. Kramer, have not been in business long.Microlending, pioneered by the Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh, has surged in the United States in recent years. As credit markets seized up and the recession deepened — and as credit card companies tightened their rules, because many startups add substantial balances on the owners’ credit cards — microlenders provided cash infusions to keep small businesses from going under. Gina Harman, the chief executive of Accion, the US Network, which is the parent of Accion East, said the typical loan totaled $7,000.Ms. Harman said that Accion had arranged nearly 13,000 loans totaling more than $94.5 million in the New York region in the 21 years it has been in business. Roughly 80 percent of the money went to immigrants or minorities, Ms. Harman said.“These loans, on average, create two and a half jobs, which is consistent with the fact that the small business sector has been the only sector to contribute net increases in the last 10 years,” she said. “So when a small business is supported, the business generates revenue, it becomes part of the tax base and it adds to the stability in communities and employment, which makes a $7,000 loan a pretty efficient tool for driving the economy.”'"
"'12-04-02,'1','With the case in litigation, Mr. Powers declined to discuss the numbers. But university records show that about two-thirds of the white freshmen were admitted automatically, compared with 80 percent of the black students and 85 percent of the Hispanic students. Because students are admitted to specific colleges, like the College of Education or the business school, it is impossible to determine which group benefits most from holistic review without knowing how many students of which race applied to, and were admitted to, each school — numbers the university does not release.College counselors say that holistic admissions decisions are hard to predict.“We try to teach all our parents and students that U.T. uses holistic review to fill specific programs, but it’s sometimes hard to accept that someone with lower grades and scores might get in if they’re an all-state cheerleader,” said Jeff Pilchiek, director of guidance at the highly regarded Westlake High School. “The buzz a few years ago was, ‘Apply to education, and then you can transfer to business.’ Then it was natural science, but that got very competitive.”In interviews on the stately campus overlooking the State Capitol, students’ views on holistic admission seemed to depend on their own race and ethnicity.This year’s freshman class of 7,000 students is 46 percent white, 23 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian and 6 percent black — and, as on most campuses, many students socialize mostly with others like themselves.“I imagined, coming to college, that it would be unified, but when I got here, I fell back into my comfort zone,” said Aimee Vasquez, a Hispanic freshman. The university’s motto is “What Starts Here Changes the World,” she added, but “it’s comfortable to be with your own kind, so we’re not changing the world.”Like other black and Hispanic students interviewed, Ms. Vasquez said she believed that holistic admissions mostly helped affluent white students from top schools. “I think the holistic approach, where they look at everything, does more for kids who went to the most awesome schools, mostly the white kids,” she said. “A lot of them have great test scores, great grades and lots of activities.”Catherine Rodarte, a Hispanic junior, agreed. Only one friend was not admitted under the state’s top students program, she said, “and when I asked how she got in, she said she was really involved in a lot of activities in high school.” She added: “In my anthro class, we were discussing it, and some people said they thought Latino students got in easier, and get more aid. I didn’t say anything, because sometimes it’s still hard for me to speak up in class when it’s almost all white students around me.”“I’m pretty outgoing, but I’m the only black person in my Spanish class, and when it’s time to choose a partner, there’s that moment of, ‘Who’s going to want to be my partner?’ ” said Charley Collins, a senior.Ms. Collins and Nicole Akpunku, a sophomore friend, said the black students they knew had been admitted automatically. “All of my friends who got in were in the Top 10,” Ms. Akpunku said.But, Ms. Collins said, “a lot of white students didn’t come through Top 10.”Yet many white and Asian students think that holistic admissions bring in more black and Hispanic students.“If I had to guess, I think the 25 percent helps minorities more,” said Christina Jackson, a white senior from Oklahoma. “There’s been a shift. I think they’re thinking more about minorities now.”Few students spoke with much passion on the issue. “I haven’t heard big debates or anything, maybe because the current students were already admitted,” said Natalie Butler, the student body president.Some faculty members did not seem to be getting worked up either. “There’s a little bit of fatigue,” said Arthur Markman, a psychology professor.'"
"'12-04-02,'1','The corporate veil also distorts lines of legal responsibility. Human rights law is largely designed on the presumption that it is states and not private companies that exercise sovereign powers like detention or border control. Legally holding governments accountable for human rights violations by contractors requires an additional step showing that it is the state and not just the corporation or individual employee that is responsible for the misconduct.Mr. Mubenga’s case is not unique. Numerous reports have been filed about misconduct, violence and abuse perpetrated by contractors carrying out migration functions. The three security guards responsible for deporting Mr. Mubenga worked for the Anglo-Danish security company G4S. Before Mr. Mubenga’s death, G4S held the exclusive contract with the U.K. Border Agency to provide escorts for immigration detainees deported from the country. The firm subsequently lost this contract, but this didn’t end its involvement in managing migration.As the world’s largest security company with more than 650,000 employees, G4S is involved in a plethora of migration functions all over the world, from operating immigration detention centers in Britain to carrying out passenger screening at airports in Europe, Canada and the Middle East. In America, G4S operates a fleet of custom-built fortified buses that serve as deportation transports for illegal migrants caught along the United States-Mexico border. Just last month, the U.K. Border Agency signed a new contract with G4S worth up to $337 million to house asylum seekers.G4S’s success in this market shows that deportation, detention and border control have become big business. Boeing’s current contract to set up and operate a high-tech border surveillance system along the United States-Mexico border is worth $1.3 billion and involves nearly 100 subcontractors. The Florida-based Geo Group — one of G4S’s main competitors — manages 7,000 detention beds in the United States and, until recently, at the Guantánamo Bay detention center, where migrants intercepted in the Caribbean are transferred. N.G.O.s and international organizations profit, too. In 2010, the International Organization for Migration was paid $265 million to assist governments in returning migrants to their home countries, among other activities.The migration control industry covers not only detention and deportations but also border control. Many airlines today employ former immigration officers or themselves contract security companies to perform the document, forgery and profiling checks required by destination states. In Israel, the West Bank checkpoints are gradually being transferred to private security companies.Placing responsibility at lower levels may serve to insulate governments from lawsuits. In the Mubenga case, the three private security guards involved in the deportation were initially arrested. Following accusations from G4S employees that senior management had repeatedly ignored internal warnings about poor training and unsafe restraint techniques, charges against the company are now being considered. Yet none of these lawsuits are likely to address whether the U.K. Border Agency should face criminal liability for Mr. Mubenga’s death because of its decision to outsource deportations in the first place.Even if governments want to re-establish state control over migration, it isn’t so easy. Political promises to renationalize immigration detention centers in Britain have so far remained unfulfilled despite repeated reports of abuse and mistreatment. And privatization, once pursued, is difficult to reverse.The United States discovered this when, in the aftermath of 9/11, it was faced with the challenge of hiring 45,000 employees for the newly established Transportation Security Administration to recoup sovereign control over previously private airport security. And private contractors work to shape policy as well. When Arizona’s notorious SB 1070 immigration bill was passed, 30 out of 36 co-sponsors had received donations from private prison companies or their lobbyists.Today, government outsourcing has given rise to an industry that encompasses nearly every aspect of migration management in countries across the globe. This shift comes at a price: It eliminates government accountability and runs roughshod over the rights of those subjected to private corporations’ control. And unless governments reassert control over what used to be a core sovereign function of the state, many more Jimmy Mubengas are likely to die.'"
"'12-04-02,'1','The two funds represent the extremes, with Pennsylvania in a group of pension systems with some of the highest percentages of investments in alternatives and Georgia in a group of 10 with some of the lowest, according to groupings of funds identified by the -based research firm Preqin.An analysis of the sampling presents an unflattering portrait of the alternative bets: the funds with a third to more than half of their money in private equity, hedge funds and real estate had returns that were more than a percentage point lower than returns of the funds that largely avoided the riskier assets. They also paid nearly four times as much in fees.While managers for the retirement systems say that a five-year period is not long enough to judge their success, those fees nevertheless add up to hundreds of millions of dollars each year for some of the country’s largest pension funds. The $51.4 billion Pennsylvania public schools pension system, for instance, which has 46 percent of its assets in alternatives, pays more than $500 million a year in fees. It has earned 3.9 percent annually since 2007.Whether the higher fees charged by the alterative-investment firms are worth it has been hotly debated within the investment community for years. Do these investment entities, over an extended period of time, either offset the wild swings in assets during rough patches of the market or provide significantly higher gains than could be found in less-expensive bond and stock investments?“We can’t put it in and bonds; that’s just not making any money,” said Sam Jordan, the chief executive of the Police Retirement System in .James Wilbanks, executive director of the Teachers Retirement System, which has largely stayed with stocks and bonds, said that pension funds were obligated to take a cautious approach. “We all heard the stories about institutional funds that had more than half of their assets in private equity in 2008” and then had to sell, he said.While both sides of the debate can point to various studies, the topic is taking on a sharper focus as more funds embrace the riskier strategy. By September 2011, retirement systems with more than $1 billion in assets had increased their stakes in real estate, private equity and hedge funds to 19 percent, from 10.7 percent in 2007, according to the Wilshire Trust Universe Comparison Service.Public retirement systems are struggling to earn sufficient returns with interest rates near record lows and more and more workers qualifying for retirement. The costs of their pensions are growing fast, but state and local government returns are not keeping up.A new study by the raised questions about how some alternatives performed for public and private pension funds during the financial crisis. Meanwhile, some public retirement systems that increased their stakes in alternatives are now trying to curb those costs.Fees for the $242 billion in ’s giant state pension system, known as Calpers, nearly doubled, to more than $1 billion a year, after it increased its holdings in private assets and hedge funds to 26 percent of its total in 2010, from 16 percent in 2006.Calpers, which has earned 3.4 percent annually over the last five years, is pushing the managers of the funds for lower fees as well as reducing the number of outside managers it uses to try to bring costs down.“I think it’s part of our job as public fund managers to do our best to drive a better bargain,” said Joseph A. Dear, the chief investment officer for Calpers.Mr. Dear cautioned that there were big differences in how various alternative investments performed during the financial crisis.He said that Calpers’s investments in real estate had been “a disaster” and that its hedge fund investments had not met their benchmarks and were under review. But he said that its private equity holdings had easily beaten public stock returns over the last decade.“Over the longer term, that kind of outperformance represents real skill, not luck, and it’s worth paying for,” he said.Heads of pension funds across the country feel trapped. Lower-risk instruments, like 10-year Treasury notes with a yield of around 2 percent, simply will not fill the gaps many systems face between what they have and what they owe retirees.The Austin Police Retirement System, for example, moved 46 percent of the $505 million it oversees into alternatives after the 2000 collapse of technology stocks produced steep losses for the fund.However, the fund’s choice of investments — real estate in places like and — did not provide much refuge when that bubble burst.“Vegas was in a boom time,” Mr. Jordan, the fund’s chief executive, said. “Snowbirds were moving there from the Midwest. People were saying at one time it was going to get bigger than New York. Then the bust happened, and we owned some single-family developments, subdivisions, and there’s no one living in those.”The fund has returned 2.5 percent annualized over the last five years. Mr. Jordan still believes that over many years those investments will pay off, he said.It has been tough to find robust returns in any markets over the last five years. While the median return for private equity investments held by public pension funds was an annualized 7.2 percent, hedge funds returned only 2.74 percent, according to Wilshire TUCS. Likewise, global bonds earned 6.99 percent while global equities rose 3.68 percent.Despite their tepid returns, retirement systems that have bet big on alternatives are paying a hefty tab. While funds with little stakes in hedge funds and private equity pay an average of 17 cents on every $100 invested, funds with large stakes pay 77 cents.The Pennsylvania state retirement system, which has about 46 percent of its money in alternatives, paid those managers 77 percent of the system’s total $195 million in fees last year. Last fall, the system replaced the two consulting firms that had emphasized those investments. Over the last five years, its annualized returns of 3.6 percent lagged behind its peers’.In a series of e-mails, Pamela Hile, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania fund, said that the fund had made many new investments in alternatives from 2004 to 2007. Some of these entities, like venture-capital funds, often have negative returns in the early years as that money is invested, she said.Noting that pension funds have time horizons that stretch into decades, Ms. Hile added that the retirement system had outperformed its 8 percent target over the last 25 years, with an 8.8 percent annualized return.Still, the allure of alternatives remains strong, even among public pension funds that without them have still performed better than other funds.The Oklahoma Teachers Retirement System, which has posted returns of 5.5 percent over the last five years through a mix of stocks and bonds, is putting 10 percent of its fund into private equity and real estate funds.When asked about the higher fees, Mr. Wilbanks, the fund’s executive director, said, “We believe the outperformance from moving into these categories can justify the additional fees.”'"
"'12-04-02,'1','The winners of the Machlin Women’s Swiss Teams in Memphis last month were Barbara Sonsini of Woodside, Calif.; Judi Radin of New York City; Lynn Deas of Schenectady, N.Y.; Beth Palmer of Chevy Chase, Md.; Irina Levitina of Hackensack, N.J.; and Kerri Sanborn of Stony Point, N.Y.When asked for a deal they submitted two with an identical theme. The diagramed deal was the first.In the given auction Sanborn (North) opened two clubs and rebid two no-trump as the least of evils. Levitina (South) transferred to spades with three hearts. When West doubled, North passed to deny three or more spades. South’s redouble asked partner to complete the transfer. Then four diamonds was a natural slam-try. Four hearts was six-ace Roman Key Card Blackwood, asking about both of responder’s suits.South’s reply showed two key cards and denied the diamond queen. Five hearts announced that all of the key cards were held and asked if partner had anything more. With the extra length in her suits and the club void, South immediately jumped to seven diamonds.Looking at the North-South hands alone, the grand slam is excellent. But then you see that the spades are breaking 5-1 and the diamonds 4-0. The trump break would not have been fatal if spades had been 4-2, but the contract was unmakable with the actual distribution.To make matters worse the opposing North-South pair had stopped in five diamonds. Bidding and making six diamonds would have gained 11 international match points. If seven diamonds had made, the gain would have been only 14 imps.In the second deal the excellent slam was six spades, which also failed because of unfavorable distribution and which had been missed by two world champions at the other table.'"

"'12-04-03,'0','A disease that has killed millions of bats across 16 states and Canada has been found in Missouri, marking its advent west of the Mississippi River and spelling possible trouble for agriculture in the region, officials said Monday. The disease, white nose syndrome has, been confirmed in three bats in two caves in Lincoln County, north of St. Louis, the Missouri Department of Conservation said. The name describes a white fungus found on the faces and wings of infected bats and has not been found to infect humans or other animals. It had been found only as far west as Kentucky until the Missouri discovery. Ann Froschauer of the federal Fish and Wildlife Service said the spread of the disease could affect crops because bats subsist at least in part on crop pests. She said a recent study estimated that bats provide about $22 billion a year in “ecological services” in part because of all the pests they consume. The Missouri Department of Conservation estimated Missouri’s gray bats alone eat about 540 tons of insects each year.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','Blue and scarlet blowing with the wind / one valiant cry /we have a name everyone knows: /MEANING Intended to be a symbol of Catalan identity and pride. It is sung in an organized way at the beginning of the match, and sometimes chanted spontaneously by fans during the match.HISTORY Written by Jaume Picas and Josep Maria Espinàs and composed by Manuel Valls in honor of the club’s 75th anniversary. It was first sung at Camp Nou on Nov. 27, 1974, by a 3,600-person chorus led by the director Oriol Martorell. At the time, Catalan nationalism was forbidden under the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco, so El Cant del Barça was often sung in place of the anthem of Catalonia, “Els Segadors.” For many modern day fans, the song does not have political connotations.A FAN SAYS “If you hear the song, you may think it is just about football. But if you look deep into it with a magnifying glass, you see the political meaning. To the people who first sang it, it was a song for a country to be apart from the Spain under Franco.”— Josep Maria Palà, 65, one of the original singers of El Cant del BarçaAnnouncer: In the ___ minute of play, GOOOOAAAALLLL for FC Bayern Munich /from our player with the number ___, [first name of player]! / Crowd: [last name] /Announcer: [first name] Crowd: [last name] / Announcer: [first name] / Crowd: [last name] /Announcer: [name of opposing team] / Crowd: NULLLL / Stadium announcer: Thank you!MEANING A way to celebrate a goal and ignore the visiting team. No matter the number of goals the opposition has scored, the answer is always “null,” or none.HISTORY Born as an idea by the Bayern Munich stadium announcer Stephan Lehmann, who succeeded the former announcer Andreas Wenzel in 1995. Lehmann, a lifelong Bayern Munich fan, was formerly a D.J. on the radio station Antenne Bayern. The call-and-response shout stems from Lehmann’s earlier ritual of announcing the starting lineup, whereby he called out player numbers and first names and fans echoed the last names. The routine ended with Lehmann thanking the crowd for helping him call out the lineup. By the late 90s, the ritual had evolved to announce home-team goals and the current score. It has since spread to other German soccer clubs.A FAN SAYS “When a goal is scored, everyone is expecting the shout, and the way it unites all the home fans together is simply amazing. Since it happens exactly upon a goal, it is always a special moment in the match. The one I remember most is when Roy Makaay scored a record-breaking goal after just 10 seconds against Real Madrid” in the 2006-7 Champions League “and the stadium announcer shouted, ‘In der zehnte Spielsekunde...’ ” (in the 10th second of the match). “It was hard to fight off the tears of joy.”'"
"'12-04-03,'0','A federal appeals court panel on Monday upheld California’s ban on using race, ethnicity and gender in admitting students to public colleges and universities. The ruling was the second time the Ninth United States Circuit Court of Appeals turned back a challenge to the state’s landmark voter initiative, Proposition 209, which was passed in 1996. Affirmative action proponents, who had requested that the court reconsider its 1997 decision after the United States Supreme Court ruled in 2003 that affirmative action could be used in college admissions, said they would ask the full appellate court to review the case since this decision was issued by a three-judge panel. At least six states have adopted bans on affirmative action in state college admissions. Besides California, they include Michigan, Arizona, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Washington. In its ruling, the court rejected the plaintiffs’ arguments that a new ruling is needed and said the previous decision still applies. In February, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case against the University of Texas alleging that affirmative action is discriminatory. If the court decides against the university, the ruling could definitively end consideration of race in public university admissions.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','Prices for Manhattan real estate were relatively flat in the first three months of the year, but brokers anticipate a much stronger spring sales season, saying that many properties had recently prompted bidding wars, indicating a new level of buyer confidence.The median sale price for the first quarter was $775,000, unchanged from the same period in 2011, according to a report from Streeteasy.com that will be released on Tuesday. Reports from New York City’s largest brokerages also indicate relatively steady pricing, with one showing the median dropping by 1 percent and others an increase of 4 percent to 6 percent.The average price rose, with Brown Harris Stevens and Halstead Property showing a 9 percent increase over last year to $1.48 million. That number, however, was skewed by strong sales in the luxury market, including an $88 million penthouse at 15 Central Park West.Hall F. Willkie, the president of Brown Harris Stevens, which represented the buyer and the seller in the $88 million deal, said the sale “had an immediate effect on comparable properties, but it also had an impact on the overall market in terms of confidence.”“It provided an emotional lift across the board,” he continued.The reports reflect deals that went into contract late last year and that closed through the end of March, but brokers said many of the sales that had gone into contract in recent weeks involved multiple bids above the asking price.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','“I don’t feel any different,” Calipari said. “I’m not going to feel any different in the morning. I’m going to go to Mass in the morning and be the same guy.”And on this night, clearly having more talent than Bill Self’s Kansas team (32-7), Calipari’s squad was barely tested. The Wildcats finished a dominant season at 38-2, and Calipari exacted revenge on Self, who had beaten him in the 2008 final while Calipari was at .For a few fleeting moments, it appeared that the ghosts of Calipari’s tournament pasts could return. Kansas cut the lead to 5 points with 1 minute 37 seconds remaining, and it appeared destined to cut that to 4 points after a Davis free throw when Tyshawn Taylor found himself wide open on a backdoor cut off an inbounds play.But the Kentucky freshman Michael Kidd-Gilchrist closed with astonishing speed and gave the game the closest thing it will get to a hallmark play. Taylor tried a reverse layup and Kidd-Gilchrist’s sublime effort led him to a clean block and a clinched ballgame.“He made an unbelievable play,” Taylor said of Kidd-Gilchrist. “I definitely thought that I had a layup.”The Kentucky sophomore Doron Lamb led all scorers with 22 points. Marquis Teague added 14 points, and Kidd-Gilchrist had 11.With six all-Americans and as many as six candidates to be drafted in this year’s N.B.A. draft, Kentucky showcased the dominance that had been its hallmark all season. The Wildcats played stingy defense, fought relentlessly for loose balls and looked like a disciplined and unselfish team.So Davis certainly did not care that his first field goal did not come until the 5:14 mark of the second half when he hit a 17-foot baseline jumper. It was his only basket in 10 attempts, but his fingerprints were all over nearly every other aspect of the game.“He is an unbelievable factor on both ends, certainly on defense,” Self said. “His first jump is unbelievable. He’s a very smart defender as well.”Kentucky, with freshmen and sophomores leading the Wildcats to the No. 1 ranking for most of the season, was a decisive favorite Monday. That gave Calipari an excellent chance to stare down his N.C.A.A. tournament demons.A demoralizing N.C.A.A. tournament loss came two years ago against West Virginia in the Round of 8, when his team was led by future standouts like John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins. Calipari’s Wildcats never properly adjusted to a 1-3-1 zone, shooting 4 of 32 from 3-point range.In 2008, Calipari’s Memphis team squandered a 9-point lead in the final 2 minutes 12 seconds because of poor free-throw shooting and an inability to foul late that allowed Mario Chalmers to hit a rainbow 3-pointer in the final seconds to force overtime.Calipari’s tournament troubles go beyond the court. Two of his Final Fours — one at in 1996 and the other at Memphis in 2008 — were vacated for rules violations under his watch. (Calipari has not been directly implicated in either case.)While Calipari’s reputation may be questioned because of the violations, his ability to recruit is beyond dispute. But he seemed more exhausted than reflective Monday.“It’s not about me,” Calipari said. “It’s about these 13 players.”On Monday night, it started with Davis, who dominated the first half even though he missed all four of his shots and did not score. Kentucky led by as many as 18 before entering halftime in front, 41-27. In the Wildcats’ student section, there was a sign that read, “Couches Burning Soon” — in a dual salute to the game’s broadcaster, , and to the celebrations in Kentucky after the Wildcats beat on Saturday in the semifinals.In the first half, Davis grabbed nine rebounds and blocked three shots. More important, the specter of his condorlike wingspan on defense was engrained in Kansas’ psyche. The three blocks did not do justice to the amount that Davis altered, as it seemed every Kansas offensive movement was made with him in mind. Davis guarded the offensively challenged center Jeff Withey most of the night, leaving him free to help on Robinson.The driving Jayhawks guards short-armed shots to try to sneak the ball over him. Post players like Robinson, whom Davis dominated from the help side, shot the ball too hard and too quick to try to get it to the rim before he arrived, and made only 3 of 11 attempts in the first half.“They did it with defense,” Calipari said. “Unbelievable defensive effort.”And while he insisted he did not care, Calipari finally fought off his coaching demons and claimed a national title.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','“Higher energy prices would encourage energy efficiency across the full array of American businesses and citizens,” Mr. Romney wrote. “It would provide industries of all kinds with a predictable outlook for energy costs, allowing them to confidently invest in growth.”In the book, Mr. Romney called for greater domestic exploration and drilling. And he expressed concern about the collateral damage from higher energy prices on people who drive great distances, businesses that consume a lot of energy and people on fixed incomes.But he acknowledged that allowing the price for gas and oil to rise could be the centerpiece of “game-changing incentives” that would alter consumer behavior when it came to buying cars and using electricity. That, he wrote, could help the country wean itself off an overreliance on foreign oil.“To become energy secure, we may need to turn to those game-changing incentives that will lead individuals and businesses of all kinds to invest in efficiency and to reduce their use of oil and energy,” he wrote.Campaign aides say Mr. Romney’s position on energy remains consistent. They say the energy chapter in his book carefully lays out the beliefs he now espouses as he seeks to become the Republican nominee. Asked to square Mr. Romney’s statements in his book with his recent criticism of Mr. Obama, the Romney campaign replied by reiterating its assertion that the president is harming the economy by pushing for higher energy costs.“President Obama is succeeding in his efforts to drive energy prices higher, producing the hardship for American families and businesses that Governor Romney predicted,” Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, said. “This is exactly why the governor has always rejected proposals that would increase prices, and why he instead supports a strategy of developing the extraordinary energy resources that we have in this country.”On the campaign trail and in the book, Mr. Romney has condemned what he calls the “radical, feel-good policies” like the cap-and-trade plan to confront that Mr. Obama pushed early in his presidency.“Such policies would have little effect on the climate but could cripple economic growth with devastating results for people across the planet,” he wrote.And Mr. Romney continues to emphasize the need to increase domestic oil drilling, exploration and the use of nuclear power. He wrote that the “right step” is to “get started by authorizing exploration and infrastructure construction.”But as he has moved closer to the Republican nomination, Mr. Romney has adopted a much more aggressive approach to confronting Mr. Obama over energy prices.That has intensified even more as the price of gas has jumped. In March of 2010, when the book was released, the average cost of a gallon of gas was $2.79. The current average price is more than $1 per gallon higher.Mr. Romney has joined his Republican rivals and his party’s leadership in Congress in blaming Mr. Obama and his administration for the rise in gas prices. His favorite targets are the secretary of energy, the secretary of the interior and the administrator of the .He calls them the gas trio, reserving particular scorn for , the energy secretary. Dr. Chu told The in 2008 that, “somehow, we have to figure out how to boost the price of gasoline to the levels in .”“This gas hike trio has been doing the job over the last three and a half years, and gas prices are up,” Mr. Romney charged this month. “The right course is they ought to be fired.”In the book, Mr. Romney proudly recalls his father, George Romney, who ran an auto company, deriding his competitors’ cars as “gas-guzzling dinosaurs.” The younger Romney discusses the need to motivate people to buy high-mileage cars.Noting the pain that accompanied the “oil shocks of 1973 and 2008,” Mr. Romney writes that the answer is higher gas prices with “predictability and gradual change, not a roller-coaster ride.”That approach is embraced by many liberals and conservatives alike. One of Mr. Romney’s top economic advisers, , an economist at and a former Bush administration official, has advocated as recently as January for raising the tax on gasoline by more than $2 a gallon.“If the tax on gasoline were higher, people would alter their behavior to drive less. They would be more likely to take public , use car pools or live closer to work,” Mr. Mankiw, a contributor to the Economic View column, wrote in The New York Times.Charles Ebinger, the director of the energy security initiative at the , said Mr. Romney’s openness to the benefits of higher energy prices was similar to the approach that Mr. Obama’s advisers had espoused for years.“I think that’s absolutely accurate in terms of what the administration has over time argued,” Mr. Ebinger said. “They always argued that it was a gradual increase that was needed. I think it is the same argument.”Mr. Romney’s aides deny that, saying that Mr. Romney is clear in the book that the economic costs of policies like higher gas taxes are — on balance — greater than the benefits. Despite praising a “tax swap” that would increase gas taxes and lower payroll taxes, for example, he concludes in the book that “a great deal of work remains to be done if it is to become a viable option.”Even so, Mr. Romney’s book suggests an openness rarely heard on the campaign trail.“We may hear of entirely new alternatives,” Mr. Romney writes of ideas to reduce energy consumption. “As said, ‘I’m all ears.’ ”'"
"'12-04-03,'0','DUBLIN — Anti-austerity protesters are claiming victory after the government acknowledged that around 50 percent of Ireland’s estimated 1.6 million homeowners failed to pay a new, flat-rate $133 property tax by the March 31 deadline.“It is quite clear a mass boycott has really sent this government a significant message it didn’t want to hear,” Luke Flanagan, one of the parliamentary deputies leading the opposition to the new household charge, said in an interview on Monday. “When we started this campaign, even 25 percent support translating to several hundred thousand would have been phenomenal, but we estimate over a million people eligible to pay this tax have refused.”Introduced on Jan. 1, the household charge was intended as a forerunner to a comprehensive property tax next year. It has become a lightning rod for widespread disenchantment on an assortment of issues like cuts to services, findings of political corruption, taxpayer liability for debts to private banks and even European legislation intended to enhance wastewater treatment from septic tanks.Ireland has had five austerity budgets in four years and faces at least four more through 2016 as it tries to cut its deficit to an agreed 3 percent of gross domestic product from its current 10 percent. The European Union, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund have lent Ireland $90 billion but in turn have demanded spending cuts and tax increases.The Irish government argues that it has no choice but to introduce the interim tax at the behest of its lenders and has vowed to identify and prosecute those who have refused to pay.'"

"'12-04-03,'0','BERLIN — A long-simmering dispute between Germany and Switzerland over a CD containing stolen data about possible tax evaders has escalated after Swiss authorities issued arrest warrants for three German tax inspectors who paid $3.3 million for the information.The neighboring countries had hoped that a tentative deal calling for Switzerland to tax and fine the German accounts, without revealing the names of the accountholders to the German government, would help ease the tensions, but it still requires parliamentary approval and the gap remains wide.After news emerged over the weekend that the Swiss have demanded the extradition of the inspectors, a leading German politician said on Monday that the inspectors should instead be decorated with medals.Tax evasion has long been a source of contention between the countries, with some wealthy Germans using Switzerland’s banking secrecy laws to avoid the high tax rates Germany levies on the rich and on top wage earners. German officials view the Swiss laws as enabling the theft of Germany’s tax revenues. Switzerland, on the other hand, looks on the German tax inspectors who bought the CD with stolen account information as having violated its banking secrecy and data privacy laws.The CD was purchased from an informant in February 2010 and used by authorities in North Rhine-Westphalia and other states to begin more than 1,000 investigations of possible tax dodging by Germans. At the time, the Swiss denounced the investigation as an intrusion into their historical banking privacy.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','The Bloomberg administration and its police commissioner, Raymond Kelly, have been disturbingly dismissive of complaints about the city’s program of stops, frisks and arrests that is ensnaring hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers each year.Civil rights lawsuits may now force the administration to examine this policy, which has largely focused on minority neighborhoods and has created anger and distrust among black and Hispanic New Yorkers who feel that the police view them as suspects, not citizens.The latest suit, filed last week by the New York Civil Liberties Union in federal court on behalf of 13 plaintiffs, focuses on private rental buildings whose owners have given the police permission to patrol the halls. According to the complaint, thousands of residents in buildings enrolled in the Clean Halls program are subject to being stopped and illegally ticketed or arrested for trespassing in their own buildings if they fail to produce identification when they take out the garbage, check the mail, duck out to the store for a quart of milk. Young people growing up in these buildings, lawyers say, are routinely searched without legal cause and detained. The lawsuit, which charges the city with violating the Fourth Amendment and the Federal Fair Housing Act, is similar to one filed two years ago against the New York Police Department and the city’s public housing agency, which is alleged to have employed a similar patrol system.The city claims that the Clean Halls program fights crime and that building owners and managers heartily approve of it. But that does not justify the kinds of abuses that the plaintiffs claim to be receiving at the hands of the police. At the very least, the city needs to make sure that its officers are following the law and treating these residents with respect.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','The life of a singer perpetually involves vast, sudden shifts of scale. The ability to negotiate them — as well as to choose halls and repertory carefully and match them wisely — is as much a quality of a successful career as singing in key. Two budding stars of the Metropolitan Opera (3,800 seats) were put to this test when they sang on Sunday afternoon in Gilder Lehrman Hall at the Morgan Library & Museum (250 seats).The baritone Brian Mulligan has a voice that is rich, secure and really, really big. He did not let the audience forget any of these three qualities — especially the last — on Sunday, filling the small space many times over. There was barely a moment of relief from the sheer loudness, which distorted his opening set of three Liszt songs.There is a place for stentorian insistence in these songs, but also for other emotions that were crowded out. The melancholy of “Tomb of the Forefathers,” the lovesickness of “It Must Be a Wonderful Thing” and the dreamy sadness of “The Lorelei” were barely glimpsed amid the aggression.Mr. Mulligan is capable of sensitivity and musicality in perfectly executed moments like the wistful little triplet on “ihr gold’nes Haar” (“her golden hair”) in “The Lorelei.” On the line “Und ruhig fliesst der Rhein” (“And the Rhine flows quietly”) in the same song his voice took on a smooth flow of its own. But the overall impression was a clang.It was a strange choice for such a youthful, vigorous singer to perform one of Verdi’s arias for Macbeth, “Pieta, rispetto, amore,” in which the character bemoans the effect his evil deeds will have on his old age. Macbeth sings, “Within my veins I feel my life drying up,” but you didn’t get the sense that Mr. Mulligan, singing with tireless, even exhausting power, agreed.He finally mellowed in the second half of the program, with four songs from Dominick Argento’s cycle “The Andrée Expedition,” about an ill-fated 19th-century attempt to reach the North Pole by balloon. Mr. Mulligan sang these with passion but also tenderness and nuance.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','Pinnacle Airlines, a regional carrier that flies under contract for Delta, United Continental and US Airways, has filed for bankruptcy protection to deal with its mounting debt.The airline, which is based in Memphis, said late Sunday that its current business model is not sustainable. It had tried for months to cut costs at its operating subsidiaries and recover from lost business with major airlines because of flying cutbacks.In its Chapter 11 filing on Sunday in United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, Pinnacle listed $1.42 billion in debt and $1.54 billion in assets. It ended the third quarter, the most recent quarter for which financial results are available, with $81.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.Pinnacle, which mostly flies between major airports in the East, has been hurt by rising costs and integration problems. It plans to wind down the United Express flights it operates for United Continental Holdings. It expects to continue Delta Connection flights for Delta Air Lines. It was already in the process of winding down its service with US Airways.Pinnacle’s Colgan Air subsidiary operated a plane that crashed into a home near Buffalo in 2009, killing 50 people. It was operating under the banner of Continental Connection. With the termination of contracts with US Airways and United, Pinnacle will no longer operate Colgan Air.The airline lost $8.8 million in the first nine months of 2011 in contrast to a profit of $17 million in the period a year earlier. Revenue improved in that time, but costs accelerated at a faster pace. Traffic in the first two months of the year was virtually flat while the carrier sharply scaled back its number of available seats. After a review, the company’s board decided that reorganization under Chapter 11 was its best option.'"
"'12-04-03,'0','Snorting and stopping breathing during sleep are associated with depression, even in people whose symptoms do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, a new study has found.Researchers studied 9,714 men and women participating in an ongoing national health survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They used interviews about sleep symptoms and a well-validated questionnaire that screens adults for depression. The report appears in the April issue of the journal Sleep.Among those with a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, depression was more than twice as common among men and more than five times as common among women, compared with those who did not have the condition.But the researchers also found that those whose partners reported that they snorted or stopped breathing were also significantly more likely to have depression, with the likelihood increasing with frequency of symptoms.Men who were affected five or more nights a week were almost four times as likely to suffer depression as those who never had the symptoms. Women with these sleep troubles were more than twice as likely to be depressed.Anne G. Wheaton, a C.D.C. epidemiologist who led the study, said that the symptoms may lead to lighter sleep and a reduction of oxygen to the brain.'"

That was up from 52.4 in February. Readings above 50 indicate the sector is expanding.A measure of manufacturing employment rose to a nine-month high, a sign that factories were hiring more workers.

"'12-04-04,'0','In a case in Poughkeepsie, I.B.M. protested the 2008 and 2009 annual assessments of its 3.8 million-square-foot plant along South Road. The property had been valued at $160 million in those years, said David D. Hagstrom, who acted as special counsel for the Town of Poughkeepsie.The resulting negotiated deal kept the $160 million assessments in 2008 and 2009, but the property’s value was reduced to $110 million and frozen there for 15 years. Local governments are satisfied because they did not have to hand back any money.And not only does I.B.M. get a predictable and lower tax bill for many years, it is also immune from any tax increases approved by the town and schools over that period. There are exceptions for major development at the plant and another major downturn of local property values.“Tax certs certainly have had more impact on local governments through the downturn, particularly commercial, industrial and retail” claims, said Karla M. Corpus, a real estate tax expert and a partner in the Syracuse office of the law firm Hiscock & Barclay.While towns and counties feel the pain of refunds, said Ralph Napolitano, the superintendent of Yorktown Central School District in Westchester County, schools are hardest hit because the largest share of most tax bills is earmarked to finance them. As a result, up to 60 percent of a refund can come from schools.Mr. Napolitano said Yorktown schools refunded $45,000 in the 2008-9 school year, $52,000 in 2009-10 and $934,000 in 2010-11. Already this year, the district has committed to $877,000 in refunds, he said.Daniel McCann, the superintendent of the nearby Hendrick Hudson School District, in Montrose, said: “We had $300,000 in tax certs last year, and this year, we’ll have $400,000. We don’t have a reserve for it anymore. We have to borrow.”Successful tax cert appeals often set a new valuation that stands until the parcel is reassessed. In other words, it is likely that the property owner today will pay the lower taxes well into the future, hobbling districts when the economy rebounds.It is not uncommon to find properties around the state that have not been revalued since the 1950s or even earlier. Of the 983 taxing authorities in the state, only 468 hold periodic reassessments, according to the state’s taxation and finance department. That is in no small part because potential voters assume wrongly that revaluations always raise their tax bills, said Matthew P. Metz, a real estate lawyer and former member of the town board in Yorktown.By comparison, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts mandates statewide reassessments every three years, and Connecticut requires them every five years. Calls for an assessment mandate are increasing in Pennsylvania, which, like New York, leaves the process to municipalities.New York City is among those municipalities that perform regular revaluations, reassessing its one million parcels every year.In the city, the major complaint among commercial property owners is not that assessments are necessarily outdated, said Peter E. Blond, a partner at the law firm Brandt, Steinberg & Lewis, which has represented businesses in tax-appeal cases since 1932.Instead, Mr. Blond said, city assessors are overstretched and lack critical industry tools for making accurate assessments.In response, Glenn Newman, the president of the New York City Tax Commission, said suggestions of insufficient training were “questionable.” Finance Department and Tax Commission assessors are required to obtain certification from the State Board of Real Property Tax Services, Mr. Newman said. And, beginning with the 2011-12 tax year, the commission is imposing a fee on higher-value property to restore some positions cut in previous years and to move some commission functions online for easier access.The fee, $175, is applied to property with an actual assessed value of at least $2 million.For the foreseeable future, however, few expect any changes in how properties in the state are assessed. A bill, A9038-2011, has been introduced by Sandy Galef, assemblywoman of District 90, that would require all taxing authorities to reassess all their properties every four years. The legislation has been sent to the ways and means committee, but Ms. Galef concedes it will be “really tough” to get it passed.In New Rochelle, the finance commissioner, Howard Rattner, said he recently presented the City Council with a plan for regular revaluations, the first since the 1950s.“The council told me, ‘Sit on that one for a while,’ ” he said. This despite the city having had to negotiate $33 million in refunds for itself, local schools and Westchester County from 2002 to 2010. He expects to have processed an additional $8.5 million in 2011.The combination of political unpopularity and cost might doom any effort to revamp the system. Several officials around the state say it is less expensive to pay tax cert refunds than to enact regular reassessments.Ms. Corpus, of Hiscock & Barclay, said “a big chunk of the problem” with tax certs would be solved if Albany forced periodic reassessments. “But the state would have to pay for it,” she said, “and local governments would need to control the process, or it wouldn’t stand a chance.”'"
"'12-04-04,'0','Cano signed a four-year, $30 million deal, with two club options, before the 2008 season. Cashman noted that Cano finished second in the American League in runs batted in last season and would have commanded a free-agent fortune.“I’m certainly glad we did it,” Cashman said.The Yankees will have to pay up, before long. They hold a $15 million option for 2013, and then Cano’s agent, Scott Boras, can shop him on the open market. The Dodgers, who now use Mark Ellis at second base, just may give Boras a call.Cano is 29, and he should still be performing at an elite level when he reaches free agency. The same was true for Votto, who is 28. He was already signed through 2013, and now will be a Red for many more years.According to USA Today, the new deal adds 10 years and $225 million, tying Votto to Cincinnati through 2023, when he will turn 40. Votto becomes the latest first baseman to sign a multiyear contract for more than $20 million a season, joining Prince Fielder, Adrian Gonzalez, Ryan Howard, Albert Pujols and Teixeira.It is a staggering commitment from the Reds, whose cable deal runs through 2016 but seem to believe that securing Votto will help them get a better one. The promise of a TV windfall helped drive the Dodgers’ sale price, just as TV riches helped the Los Angeles Angels sign Pujols and the Texas Rangers land Yu Darvish last winter.The Reds operate in a small market, so their cable revenue theoretically will be limited. Forbes magazine recently ranked the Reds 24th out of 30 teams in franchise value, ahead of Toronto, Cleveland, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Tampa Bay and Oakland. The Votto deal could be a triumph of revenue sharing. The Reds have been a recipient for years, and now they are using the money to keep their best player, who has already led them to a division title. This is how the system should work.Then again, the deal could cripple the Reds if Votto’s production deteriorates. Remember the joy in Minnesota in March 2010, when the Twins locked up Joe Mauer for eight years and $184 million? Mauer’s batting average, on-base percentage and slugging percentage have slipped ever since. Last year, the Twins lost 99 games, and with so much payroll tied up in Mauer and Justin Morneau, their boldest off-season acquisition was Josh Willingham.The Dodgers’ departing owner, the reviled Frank McCourt, gave Magic Johnson’s ownership group one long-term asset: center fielder Matt Kemp, who signed an eight-year, $160 million deal last winter. The Dodgers’ best pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, has three years before free agency; by then, he may be coupled with Cole Hamels or Zack Greinke, the headline pitchers in this winter’s market.Cain would have ranked in their class, and the Giants surely shuddered at the idea that their oldest rival could poach him. They cared so much about keeping Cain that they gave him the richest deal ever for a right-handed pitcher, focusing more on his career earned run average (3.35) than his record (69-73).This feels a little like the St. Louis Cardinals’ $120 million deal for Matt Holliday in 2009; they signed their second-best hitter before their centerpiece, Pujols, who ultimately left as a free agent. The Giants, likewise, have kept their No. 2 but might someday lose their ace, Tim Lincecum, who is scheduled to reach free agency in November 2013, when he will be 29.Lincecum, then, could hit the market at the same time as Cano. Even without bidding for Cain and Votto, the Dodgers should have plenty of chances to spend their money.'"
"'12-04-04,'0','Ms. Catlett became an educator, too. After graduating cum laude from Howard University in 1935, she taught high school in Durham, N.C.Howard hadn’t been her first choice. She had won a scholarship to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, in Pittsburgh, but the college refused to allow her to matriculate when it learned she was black. So she entered historically black Howard, with one semester’s worth of tuition saved by her mother. She earned scholarships to cover the rest.An interest in the painter Grant Wood led her to pursue an M.F.A. at the University of Iowa, where Wood was teaching. There she focused on stone carvings rooted in her own experience — sensitive portraits of African-American women and children.After graduating she moved to New Orleans to teach at Dillard University, another historically black institution. There she organized a trip to the Delgado Museum of Art so that her students could see a Picasso exhibition. But this was no ordinary school trip; the museum was officially off-limits to blacks, so Ms. Catlett arranged to visit on a day when it was closed to the public.While on a summer break from Dillard, she met the artist Charles White in Chicago. They married in 1941 and divorced five years later.She left New Orleans to study with the Russian-born sculptor Ossip Zadkine in New York. Mr. Zadkine, who spent his formative years in Montparnasse alongside Modigliani and Brancusi, nudged her work in a more abstract direction. During this time, the early 1940s, Ms. Catlett also worked in adult education at the George Washington Carver School in Harlem, a program that nurtured the photographer Roy DeCarava, among others.In 1946 Ms. Catlett traveled to Mexico on a fellowship. There she married the artist Francisco Mora and accepted an invitation to work at Taller de Gráfica Popular (TGP), a workshop in Mexico City for murals and graphic arts. The TGP inspired her to reach out to the broadest possible audience, which often meant balancing abstraction with figuration.“I learned how you use your art for the service of people, struggling people, to whom only realism is meaningful,” she later said of this period.Like other artists and activists, Ms. Catlett felt the political tensions of the McCarthy years. The TGP was thought to have ties to the Communist Party; Ms. Catlett never joined the party, but Mr. White, her first husband, had been a member, and she was closely watched by the United States Embassy.In 1949 she was arrested, along with other expatriates, during a railroad workers’ strike in Mexico City. Eventually she gave up her American citizenship and was declared an undesirable alien by the State Department. In 1971 she had to obtain a special visa to attend the opening of her one-woman show at the Studio Museum in Harlem.Ms. Catlett continued to teach even after becoming a successful artist. In 1958 she became the first female professor of sculpture and head of the sculpture department at the National Autonomous University of Mexico’s School of Fine Arts in Mexico City. She retired to Cuernavaca, about 35 miles southwest of Mexico City, in 1975.Ms. Catlett’s art is in museums around the world, including the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York; the High Museum in Atlanta; the Museum of Modern Art in Mexico City; and the National Museum of Prague. In 2003, the International Sculpture Center gave her a lifetime achievement award.Mr. Mora, her husband, died in 2002. She is survived by three sons, Francisco, Juan and David Mora Catlett, 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.In 1998, the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College in Westchester County exhibited a 50-year retrospective of Ms. Catlett’s sculpture. The critic Michael Brenson wrote in the show’s catalog, “Ms. Catlett’s sculptures communicate a deeply human image of African-Americans while appealing to values and virtues that encourage a sense of common humanity.” He also singled out the “fluid, sensual surfaces” of her sculptures, which he said “seem to welcome not just the embrace of light but also the caress of the viewer’s hand.”In his review of that show for The New York Times, Ken Johnson wrote that Ms. Catlett “gives wood and stone a melting, almost erotic luminosity.” But he also found her iconography “generic and clichéd.”Last year, the Bronx Museum mounted “Stargazers: Elizabeth Catlett in Conversation With 21 Contemporary Artists,” an exhibition that placed her sculptures, prints and drawings in the company of works by Ellen Gallagher, Kalup Linzy, Wangechi Mutu and others at the forefront of the contemporary art scene.In her own words, Ms. Catlett was more concerned with the social dimension of her art than its novelty or originality. As she told a former student, the artist and art historian Samella S. Lewis, “I have always wanted my art to service my people — to reflect us, to relate to us, to stimulate us, to make us aware of our potential.”'"
"'12-04-04,'0','The report does not deal with the role of politicians in the process. By law, the auditor general’s department may review only the work of public servants.Initially, the Conservative government led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper vigorously defended the purchase of F-35s, at times suggesting that its critics did not have the safety and well-being of members of the military in mind.But over the last several weeks, Mr. Harper and the cabinet minister responsible for military procurement have been distancing the government from the program.“At some point we will have to make a final decision,” Mr. Harper said last month. “But obviously we have not signed a contract so that we can retain our flexibility in terms of ensuring the best deal for taxpayers.”Shortly after the release of the auditor general’s report, and before members of opposition parties began their attacks, the government announced that it had frozen its budget for the direct purchase of the aircraft at 9 billion Canadian dollars. It also said that the purchase would be overseen by a wider variety of government departments.The auditor general said that it was still unclear how much the aircraft would cost. But his auditors concluded that the government appeared to have both understated the likely purchase price — the 9 billion Canadian dollar estimate — and not included several substantial costs directly related to the program.The country probably cannot stay within its budget by reducing the size of its order. The F-35s will replace a fleet of CF-18s, a variation of the F-18, which went into service during the 1980s and which will remain airworthy without further upgrades until the end of the decade. Sixty five, it is widely agreed, is the minimum number of replacements required.Lockheed Martin did not respond to requests for comment. Two weeks ago in an e-mail, Keelan Green, a spokesman for Lockheed Martin Canada, wrote that “the government of Canada has not indicated to Lockheed Martin that it is changing its commitment to the F-35 program.”'"

"'12-04-04,'0','The Westchester County executive, Rob Astorino, has called for HUD to release $7 million it has withheld from the county because of what it calls a lack of compliance.Mr. Astorino took aim at the department after a court decision in March. A magistrate judge ruled that Mr. Astorino did not violate the agreement when he vetoed a bill that required landlords to accept government vouchers as rental payments.“This is a major win not just for the county but for the nation,” Mr. Astorino, a Republican, said at a news conference. “We took a very principled stand against an unwarranted invasion by HUD and the federal government, and the county won.”His critics, including some in the Democratic-controlled county legislature and at the Anti-Discrimination Center, the nonprofit group whose lawsuit led to the agreement, said Mr. Astorino was mischaracterizing a mixed ruling and continuing to flout the terms of the deal.For decades, the federal government has steered clear of concerted efforts to integrate communities by race and income. And the fight in Westchester, along with similar efforts in places like and Marin County, Calif., is being watched as a test of how far the government will go in encouraging residential integration.The case began with a 2006 lawsuit. The Anti-Discrimination Center alleged that Westchester had lied when, while applying for federal housing money, it claimed to have complied with fair housing mandates.After a federal judge ruled that the county had “utterly failed” to meet its obligations, it agreed to the settlement. The deal required the county to spend $51.6 million to build 750 units of affordable housing in 31 overwhelmingly white communities within seven years, and to market those units to nonwhites aggressively. The Westchester settlement includes working families solidly in the middle class, with most rental units available to a family of four earning up to 65 percent of the area’s median income, or $70,135.The settlement also required the county to “use all available means as appropriate” to promote nondiscriminatory housing, including pushing towns and villages to alter zoning rules that discouraged the construction of apartments. Pound Ridge, for example, covers 23.5 square miles, but no land is zoned for multifamily use.Mr. Astorino, who defeated , the Democratic executive who agreed to the settlement, said that 206 units had been approved and that 196 of those had financing in place, almost double what was expected by this time.“If the federal government looks at it some way else, you’ll have to ask them,” Mr. Astorino said in an interview. “But as far as I’m concerned, this is a pretty clear-cut, seven-year contract we have to fulfill in building 750 units in 31 eligible communities. I don’t think anyone can deny we’re having a lot of success.”Mr. Astorino said that rather than being a bastion of privilege, Westchester was the fourth most diverse county in the state, and that market forces determined who could afford to live in affluent places like Bronxville, Rye and Scarsdale.But his critics say the overall diversity masks a deeply segregated landscape in which minorities are clustered in a few cities — like Mount Vernon, , Peekskill and Yonkers — while, according to the 2010 census, more than half the towns and villages are less than 5 percent black, and nearly half are less than 10 percent Hispanic. (As a whole, the county’s population is 15 percent black and 22 percent Hispanic.)James E. Johnson, who was chosen by the government to monitor Westchester’s performance, offered praise and criticism. He noted progress on the number of units being built and a mixed record on overall compliance, but said Mr. Astorino’s public comments were “not evidence of a program of support for the settlement, or fair housing, or integration.”The monitor and HUD had argued that Mr. Astorino violated the settlement when he vetoed the bill, which would have prohibited landlords from discriminating against tenants who receive housing subsidies. But the magistrate ruled that while the deal required the county executive to promote such legislation, which Mr. Spano had done, it did not say the executive had to sign it.Kenneth W. Jenkins, the chairman of the Board of Legislators, said Mr. Astorino’s focus on the number of units built distorted the essence of the settlement.“This is not about 750 units,” he said, emphasizing that the more important goal was to establish a long-term framework for integrated, affordable housing. “There’s no race to build 750 units.”Craig Gurian, executive director of the group that sued the county, said much of the housing that had been approved or proposed was adjacent to low-income communities in neighboring towns or otherwise isolated from the rest of the wealthier community.The proposal for Chappaqua, home of the Clintons, calls for what would be the tallest building in the town, dropped into a no-man’s land between railroad tracks, a highway and a bridge. New housing completed in Rye hugs the border of largely minority Port Chester, across two busy highways from the rest of Rye. Forty-six units scheduled for Larchmont sit in a virtually unpopulated block behind a strip mall, squeezed in against railroad tracks and Interstate 95.Mr. Gurian faulted not only Mr. Astorino, but also HUD and the monitor.“Unfortunately,” he said, “they’re failing entirely in the face of two and a half years of clear, pervasive, across-the-board resistance, and it’s really a tragic loss of the promise of the consent decree to make change.”Still, some local officials and residents say many factors complicate compliance, like high land costs, the lack of available land in densely populated southern Westchester, the lack of sewers and the restrictions on building in the watershed in northern Westchester.Mr. Astorino’s supporters also say that the county already has some of the nation’s highest real , and that it is essential to comply with the ruling in a way that is both fair and affordable.Mayor Douglas French of Rye said his community had no choice but to build where land was affordable. In Scarsdale, Mayor Miriam Levitt Flisser said her village was taking steps to comply. It is one of six municipalities cited by the monitor as having adopted new land-use rules. But she said Westchester was no more discriminatory than, say, , with its swaths of wealth and poverty.“In a country as large as ours, I think it’s very difficult for the federal government to micromanage growth in an exceedingly small municipality with 17,000 residents and 5,000 families,” she said.Michael Allen, a lawyer in who worked on the original suit, said HUD was showing a vigor not seen in decades on fair housing issues. He said Westchester was viewed as a test case for the government’s resolve.“This is not big brother imposing its will arbitrarily on innocent Westchester County,” he said. “It’s just law enforcement. And if going down this road conveys to municipalities that there are obligations that come along with getting federal funds, so much the better.”'"
"'12-04-04,'0','Motorola Mobility said in a statement it was “confident that a thorough investigation” would show it had honored its “obligations and complied with antitrust laws.” It said it would “continue to work closely with the European Commission to resolve this matter as soon as practicable.”The cases could also have consequences for Google, which is seeking final regulatory approvals for its purchase of Motorola Mobility to compete directly with its archrival, Apple. Google’s deal, worth about $12.5 billion, cleared its biggest hurdles by winning regulatory approval in the United States and Europe in February.In a warning in February, Joaquín Almunia, the E.U. competition commissioner, said his decision to clear Google’s deal for Motorola Mobility would not exonerate any wrongdoing concerning patents “by Motorola in the past or all future action by Google.”News of the investigations came a day after Microsoft said it was moving its software distribution operations to the Netherlands from Germany because of concerns that an adverse decision in a patent dispute with Motorola Mobility could hamper crossborder shipments.Motorola filed a lawsuit against Microsoft in July last year asking for a royalty of 2.25 percent on the price of each product using video software on which Motorola holds some patents.Microsoft refused to pay, saying the demand by Motorola could lead other patent holders to make similar demands and make the costs of licensing technology unaffordable.Motorola then sued to stop sales and shipments in Germany of any product that uses Microsoft software with the video software.A ruling against Microsoft on April 17 by the Mannheim regional court could block the software giant from distributing Windows software and the Xbox gaming system in Germany.On Tuesday, Microsoft said there had been no previously existing royalty agreements concerning the video software before the dispute.Microsoft had a “great relationship” with its current distributor but “Motorola’s refusal to live up to its patent promises has left us no choice,” said Thomas Baumgärtner, a spokesman for Microsoft in Germany. “Unfortunately the risk of disruption from Motorola’s patent litigation is simply too high.”The commission can fine companies as much as 10 percent of their worldwide annual income if it finds them guilty of antitrust violations. But the way any such fines would be calculated would depend on which company owned Motorola Mobility at the time of the offenses. Determining which company would pay any such fines can often depend on the fine print of merger agreements. Motorola Mobility was split off from Motorola in January 2011.The commission also has the power to require companies to change the way they do business. That, too, could have consequences for Google and its deal for Motorola Mobility.“We haven’t finalized our acquisition of Motorola Mobility, but will work with the European Commission to answer any questions they might have,” said Al Verney, a spokesman for Google in Brussels. “We have longstanding concerns about patent abuses, including lawsuits and royalty demands targeting the Android ecosystem,” Mr. Verney added, referring to Google’s operating system for mobile devices.But a prominent commentator on the issue, Florian Mueller, who also advises companies including Microsoft on patent issues, said in a blog entry that the decision Tuesday by Mr. Almunia to start a formal investigation into Motorola Mobility was a bad sign for Google.“If and when Google closes the deal, it will effectively buy itself into two more E.U. antitrust investigations,” Mr. Mueller wrote.“It’s time for some people in Mountain View to realize that a multi-front war against competition authorities, on three continents in parallel, is a war that they won’t be able to win,” he added, referring to Google’s headquarters in California.The commission is already investigating Samsung for the way it used standard, essential patents and for the way it sought injunctions against its competitors in national courts.Samsung, a South Korean company that relies on Android for many of its products, has been pursuing legal battles worldwide over the levels and fairness of fees it imposes on others for using patented technologies.TripAdvisor filed an antitrust complaint against Google with E.U. regulators Tuesday, adding a second case against the search-engine operator by online travel companies, Bloomberg News reported from Brussels.TripAdvisor said the complaint addressed “anti-competitive and unfair practices by Google that harm the marketplace and consumer welfare.”Expedia last week added its complaint to an E.U. investigation of claims that Google discriminated against other services in its search results and stopped some Web sites from accepting rival ads. Joaquín Almunia, the E.U.’s competition commissioner, has said he could decide this month whether to proceed with a case against Google.'"
"'12-04-04,'0','SEVERAL years ago, my family banished brisket from our Seder.It was hard to do. Serving brisket for Passover was as ingrained as ladling out the matzo ball soup. The brisket lovers couldn’t imagine a Seder without it.But the naysayers in the family prevailed, and after much cajoling, my mother tried substituting boneless short ribs in her lemon pot roast recipe. The bright, meaty flavors were the same, but the texture was plusher and much less stringy.We’ve never gone back the brisket way. Every year, we try out a new preparation centering on short ribs, experimenting with everything from the cut of the meat to the flavors in the pot.When it comes to short ribs, you have choices.Boneless short ribs are easier to serve to a crowd and can be substituted pound for pound in your grandmother’s time-honored brisket recipe.Bone-in short ribs require a very large pot and are somewhat more awkward to plate. The upside is that they have even more flavor because the marrow that seeps out of the bones seasons the sauce.You can buy them either cut across the bone, called flanken, or along the bones, often called English style — the way it is done in fancy restaurants. You’ll need about three-quarters of a pound of bone-in short ribs per person, or even less at Passover with the likes of gefilte fish and haroseth on the table, too. Something to note is that short ribs won’t slice as nicely as brisket (they tend to fall apart). And they are fattier, too, which is in part why they taste better. But if you cook the beef the day before and chill it overnight, you’ll be able to lift off much of the fat that hardens on top of the sauce.'"

"'12-04-05,'0','Ye gods, to borrow one of his pet phrases, the gregarious Bisher saw more new coats slipped on than a tailor.In florid prose, he painted images as striking as the verdant visuals at the hallowed grounds.“The love, the worship, of golf seems to be everywhere as you stand there absorbed in it yourself,” he wrote of the scene. “It seems to ooze inside your skin; yet you can’t touch it.”He was an unabashed admirer of the tournament — “its place in the realm of world classics is secure” — and the system that has allowed men to run it czar-like. In the mid-’70s, Bisher defended the autocratic approach of chairman Clifford Roberts, suggesting that, “If you get to heaven and find it’s run by committee, ask for a transfer.”A decade ago, Bisher, believing that a private club should call its own shots, happily dismissed the efforts of the women’s rights activist Martha Burk, who shepherded a small protest on-site intended to pressure Augusta National to admit a female member.“Hurricane Martha has wafted through, little more than a zephyr, making no more sound than a cat’s meow,” he razzed in print.Bisher occasionally snapped his pincers at unruly spectators or players who he felt dishonored the gentleman’s game. Generally, he viewed the performers and their audience through a prism of respect.Among the Masters story angles that often intrigued him were foreigners (he was not one, having hailed from North Carolina), lefthanders (this, he was) and golf’s roots in amateurism and gentility (he was an avid amateur player, more genteel on the course than off of it).For many golfers, Bisher was nearly as much a part of the Masters experience as the azaleas and Amen Corner.“There have been certain staples and traditions that have always reminded me that I am at the Masters,” Jack Nicklaus said. “One of those has been Furman Bisher.”Some players would invite his questions after rounds.Once, Nicklaus seemed almost hurt when Bisher excused himself from the news conference. After he asked why, Bisher, well up in years, explained to him, “When you’re my age and your kidneys talk, you have to listen to them.”Arnold Palmer had become a largely ceremonial Masters participant when he spotted Bisher walking the course — as was his custom, regardless of his age. Palmer greeted him with a backslap, saying, “I’m just glad to see somebody out here as old as I am.”Aside from his rookie stint at Augusta, when he represented The Charlotte News, Bisher filed dispatches for the Atlanta newspapers: first The Constitution, then The Journal, then their combined version. After he retired in 2009, he still corresponded for The Journal Constitution from the tournament, two hours east of his metro Atlanta residence.He continued to file for smaller papers’ Web sites, and his own, on a variety of subjects. His last column in early March, fittingly, was Masters-related, and it closed with, “As some say, you’re never too old.”Bisher covered a spectrum of sports — including football, baseball, horse racing, auto racing and boxing — that reflected the tastes of his Southern readership.The Atlanta Braves owe their existence partly to him, Bisher having spearheaded the franchise’s move from Milwaukee. He championed Atlanta’s successful pursuit of the 1996 Summer Games soon after the notion was a gleam in the eye of the eventual Atlanta Olympics chief Billy Payne.“Furman Bisher, there will never be another one,” Payne, current chairman of Augusta National, said Wednesday.Bisher was booked for this year’s Masters after deciding against back surgery that would have confined him to home.On March 18, he was looking forward to the final round of the PGA Tour’s Transitions Championship on television when he felt ill and checked into a hospital. Later that day, the heart attack ended his life.Marked by a gold nameplate, Bisher’s permanent third-row seat in the press center is vacant this week, except for a replica of his trademark floppy yellow hat, placed there by an Augusta National official.Bisher’s own hat was last seen resting atop his coffin at the funeral as it was being wheeled away for burial.'"
"'12-04-05,'0','The Marlins’ performance rarely matched the fans’ enthusiasm during a 4-1 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals, the defending World Series champions.Kyle Lohse, the Cardinals’ starter, did not allow a hit in the first six innings. The former Met Jose Reyes broke up the no-hit bid leading off the seventh with a single to right field that provided fans a rare moment to celebrate. The Marlins ended with just four hits — two from Reyes - and didn’t score until eighth inning.“We didn’t give them too much to cheer about,” said Johnson, who allowed 10 hits and three runs.But Wednesday night wasn’t about the game as much as it was about the spectacle of a one-of-a-kind stadium with a South Florida feel. Marlins Park, with its lime-green outfield walls and a 73-foot home run sculpture, features palm trees, pink flamingos, sea gulls and smiling marlins activated when a Marlin hits a home run.Reyes, a four-time All-Star with the Mets, was sold. He left for Miami in the off-season for a $106 million contract and a change of scenery with the Marlins, beginning with a ballpark like nothing Reyes and baseball has ever seen.“At the beginning when I came here, the first words out of my mouth were, ‘Wow,’ ” he said. “After I saw it, they had a good chance to get me here in the new stadium.“I saw the future of the team. That’s why I made to decision to come to the team.”But Reyes knows better than anyone that new does not necessarily mean better. Reyes helped christen Citi Field in 2009, when it replaced Shea Stadium. The injury-plagued Mets limped to a 70-92 finish.Whatever the future holds for Reyes and the Marlins, one thing is clear: it will be different than anything baseball fans here have ever seen.The Marlins won two World Series, in 1997 and 2003, but otherwise were overshadowed by the Miami Dolphins, the Miami Heat and Miami Hurricanes football.That changed on Wednesday — at least for a night — in a new stadium built on the site of the old Orange Bowl. A couple of miles east, in downtown Miami, LeBron James and the Heat were playing, and beating, the Oklahoma City Thunder in a potential preview of the N.B.A. finals. But the Marlins, for once, were the hottest ticket in town.Continued enthusiasm will probably depend on the team’s performance on the field. It won’t be determined by the same challenges of the past — South Florida’s hot, wet summer weather, and Loria’s traditionally low payroll.“It’s impossible to play baseball in Miami in the summer,” Loria said. “The weather uncertainty killed us for years.Loria also put an end to his frugal ways, hiring Manager Ozzie Guillen, signing Reyes and pitcher Mark Buehrle, and making a run at Albert Pujols.It has paid off with more than 15,000 season tickets — a club record — sold for 2012 after the Marlins ranked last in National League attendance each of the last six years.Getting to this point was a much tougher sell for Loria, a 71-year-old art dealer who is the Marlins’ third owner. Like the previous owners, Wayne Huizenga and John Henry, he pushed for a new ballpark in South Florida.A Miami billionaire, Norman Braman, tried to stop Loria’s attempt with lawsuits, public demonstrations and behind-the-scenes politicking.Local citizens were opposed to spending tax money on a sports facility, and many politicians who supported the park lost their seats.But on Wednesday, everything seemed to be fine. As the retractable roof parted 30 minutes before the first pitch, third basemen Hanley Ramirez could see that better days were ahead — and above. For six seasons, Ramirez, a three-time All-Star, endured small crowds, losing teams, oppressive heat and late-day showers.“I think that’s going to help us a lot,” he said. “We lost a lot of energy through the games.”The energy slowly drained from the crowd during a lackluster performance against the Cardinals. Soon, the buzz of the Marlins’ most anticipated opening day since the first one, in 1993, will fade, too.Ultimately, the key to whether Miami’s big bet on baseball pays off will be the ability of the Marlins to win games, after the team posted a 72-90 record in 2011. But no one is panicking after one loss, even if it felt a little bigger.“In my eighth opening day, you realize — with as much hype and energy with the new stadium — it is one game; you have 161 left,” catcher John Buck said. “It is a marathon — although it does hurt. You want to win that opening game, especially in the new stadium. But it is one game.”'"
"'12-04-05,'0','Of course, some faculty support the project, and some are deeply involved in it: Charles Bailyn, an astronomy professor, will be the dean of Yale-N.U.S. when the first 150 students arrive next year, and other professors helped develop the plan and are working on hiring.At last month’s faculty meeting, about 150 professors, an unusually high turnout, debated Professor Benhabib’s resolution calling for a formal commitment to broad freedoms. A vote was postponed until the next meeting, this Thursday evening, when an even larger turnout is expected, along with an attempt to amend the resolution to include a statement of support for the project.With the globalization of higher education, such delicate cross-cultural partnerships are increasingly common. In fact, the National University of Singapore already has, among other collaborations, a medical school venture with Duke, a partnership with Johns Hopkins’ conservatory and a Law School master’s program.New York University has a liberal arts campus in and is starting another in , each offering the same degree granted in New York. Yale has been unwilling to grant its own degree abroad, either in Singapore or at an arts institute in Abu Dhabi under discussion five years ago.The Yale administration says the faculty has had ample opportunities to weigh in since the September 2010 prospectus outlining the Singapore project, including two poorly attended town-hall-style meetings.But many professors said they had paid little attention early on, assuming the project would come to a vote.“I was stunned by the announcement that we’d hooked up with this university,” said Mimi Yiengpruksawan, an history professor. “My first question was, ‘Who’s “we” — and why are “we” involved in developing a campus paid for by a national government that is not the ?’ ”Even apart from Singapore, there had been mounting faculty discontent about university decisions on the budget, the graduate school and shared services. The complaints coalesced this winter at a gathering at the home of an English professor, where 20 senior faculty members discussed their frustrations.Now the Singapore debate is heated, with a stream of commentary from students, faculty and alumni — including, this week, a glowing vote of confidence in a sophisticated model of education blending East and West by Fareed Zakaria, a Yale trustee, and a blistering attack calling Yale’s plan “poorly informed, reckless and sultanistic” by Michael Montesano, an alumnus in Singapore.The resolution creating all the buzz is rather mild, expressing “concern regarding the recent history of lack of respect for civil and political rights in the state of Singapore,” and urging Yale-N.U.S. “to respect, protect and further principles of nondiscrimination for all, including sexual minorities and migrant workers; to uphold civil liberty and political freedom on campus and in the broader society,” ideals “at the heart of liberal arts education.”Professor Bailyn, who radiates enthusiasm about the chance to design a new college, is uncomfortable with the resolution, worrying about the implied “us versus them” attitude of faculty members “at a safe distance of 9,000 miles, telling Singaporeans how to live.”Furthermore, he said, the timing could hardly be more awkward: “It could have been a huge conversation a year ago, before we actually signed the agreement. Now we’re right in the middle of making faculty offers.”Timing aside, faculty supporters say, the resolution is important both symbolically, to support civil liberties, and practically, to bolster the faculty voice.“Thursday will be the first vote ever taken on anything related to Singapore,” said Christopher L. Miller, a professor of French who is gay. “It would be a very positive step, saying that the Yale College faculty is taking back some ownership of the issue, but it’s only the first step.”Plenty of questions remain, faculty members said, about what the agreement between Singapore and Yale contains, how it would work and what made Yale choose Singapore.Some Yale trustees have long ties to Singapore. In recent years, three have held important positions at the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation, which handles Singapore’s more than $100 billion in assets, or at Temasek Holdings, which the Finance Ministry owns. As those ties have become known, some on the faculty have expressed frustration that Yale has not been forthcoming about them.In an interview Sunday, Mr. Levin said there was no impropriety. “Two of the three individuals with connections to Singapore were not serving as Yale trustees at the time the agreement was under discussion, and the third recused himself from voting,” he said.Specifically, he said, Charles Ellis, the husband of the Yale vice president Linda Lorimer, retired from the Yale Corporation in 2008, before the discussions began, and retired as an adviser to the Singapore corporation in June 2009, when the talks were under way. Charles W. Goodyear, who was Temasek’s chief executive-designate from March until August 2009, did not become a Yale trustee until after the Yale-Singapore agreement was signed. And G. Leonard Baker, a Yale trustee and leading fund-raiser since 2000, who served on the board of a subsidiary of the Singapore corporation from 2001 to 2011 and held other Singapore advisory positions, reported them on his annual disclosure forms. Mr. Levin said Mr. Baker had recused himself from voting on the agreement.Mr. Levin said it had not occurred to him to disclose Mr. Baker’s recusal. In a statement Sunday night, Mr. Levin said a review of Yale’s online information had revealed that Mr. Goodyear’s and Mr. Baker’s Singapore involvements were not in their biographical summaries, an omission that has been corrected.Mr. Levin first considered the project, which he called one of the most exciting of his long presidency, at the 2009 in Davos, . There, he had tea with the president of N.U.S., who had previously sought a liberal arts collaboration with ’s University of Warwick and ’s Claremont Colleges.If the collaboration hits some bumps, Mr. Levin said, they may be smoothed by a governance committee, with equal representation from both universities, that will advise the Yale-N.U.S. president on conflicts of values or principles.The prospectus includes negotiated language promising that faculty and students at the new college “will be free to conduct scholarship and research and publish the results, and to teach in the classroom and express themselves on campus, bearing in mind the need to act in accordance with accepted scholarly and professional standards and the regulations of the college.” It also says the new college’s nondiscrimination policy will be “fully consistent” with Yale’s.Still, Michael J. Fischer, a computer science professor, has urged Yale to pull back. “I ask that the Yale name be removed from the new college, that the Yale administration make clear to all that Yale’s role in Yale-N.U.S. is only as consultants and that the Yale collegium has no control, responsibility or affiliation with Yale N.U.S.,” he wrote in The Yale Daily News.In Singapore, an article in an independent student newspaper criticized Yale professors as trading in stereotypes — and suggested that if Americans obsess about the illegality of homosexuality, Singaporeans might obsess about and “dubious ‘antiterrorism’ laws.”The Yale Daily News offered a measured view: “The truth remains that Yale will henceforth be closely linked with an authoritarian regime, and the university will have to find a way to balance partnership and pushback.”'"

"'12-04-05,'0','The Census Bureau offered the first detailed picture of population shift in the United States since the end of the recession, releasing data that showed that population growth in outer suburbs — the fastest growing areas in the last decade — all but ground to a halt in 2010 and 2011, as the painful effects of the housing crisis lingered.The country’s outer suburbs, often referred to as the exurbs by demographers, were at the forefront of the country’s population growth for most of the last decade. New houses mushroomed in those areas as young families bought homes on credit that was easy to get, following the tradition of moving to the suburbs to begin adult lives.But when the housing market collapsed, growth in those areas slowed drastically. The economic recovery has not revived population growth in those areas and, according to an analysis by William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution, has only served to flatten it further. Population in the country’s outer suburbs grew at just 0.4 percent in the year ended last July, down from 1 percent in the previous year and a peak in 2006 of more than 2 percent.“The exurbs were the cutting edge of growth in the United States in the boom period,” Mr. Frey said. “That growth has really come to a standstill, and is maybe being given up for dead at this point.”It was the Census Bureau’s first major release since the recession was officially pronounced over, and demographers had been waiting for the data to begin to answer the question of what has happened to population. But there was scant evidence of any post-recession growth, Mr. Frey said, indicating that the aftereffects of the recession were still freezing Americans in place across large areas of the country.'"

The move has raised questions about whether the plan would create two tiers of students.'"
"'12-04-05,'0','As the author of the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, approved last year, I applaud Apple’s decision to allow the Fair Labor Association to investigate working conditions at Foxconn, its iPhone and iPad supplier in China, and to produce a detailed and credible report.However, Apple contributes directly to problems at supplier factories — as Steven P. Jobs did in 2007, for example, when he decided suddenly to revamp the screen on a new iPhone model a little over a month before it was due in stores. This required an assembly line overhaul and production schedule in the supplier factory that simply could not be met without violating already weak workplace standards.Imposing stricter conditions on suppliers alone isn’t going to solve this problem. The brands also have to acknowledge their role and change their own practices accordingly. All major brands that source their products overseas, including Apple, have supplier codes of conduct. The time has come for them also to consider codes of responsible ordering practices.The writer is a professor at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard. He was the United Nations’ special representative for business and human rights from 2005 to 2011.Am I missing something? Why can’t we just bring Apple factories back to the United States? Here we have equitable daily wages and reasonable work hours, and child labor is a historical relic. Plus we have a slew of people desperately needing jobs.And all that carbon impact — considerable in the shipping of Apple goods thousands of miles from China — would be gone. A huge win-win. And yet that option never seems to be on the table.'"
"'12-04-05,'0','The new research — reported in three papers posted online on Wednesday in the journal Nature — provides some measure of both, some experts said. There are probably hundreds, perhaps more than a thousand, gene variations that could disrupt brain development enough to result in social delays.An intensified search for rare mutations could turn up enough of these to account for 15 percent to 20 percent of all autism cases, some experts say, and allow researchers a chance to see patterns and some possible mechanisms to explain what goes awry.“These studies aren’t so much a breakthrough, because we knew this was coming,” said Jonathan Sebat, a professor of and cellular and molecular medicine at the , who was not a part of the research teams. “But I’d say it’s a turning point. We now have a reliable way forward, and I think it’s fair to expect that we will find 20, 30, maybe more such mutations in the next year or two.”Other researchers were more cautious, saying that the genetics of rare mutations was not yet well enough understood to make conclusive statements about their effect on the behavior of specific genes.“This is a great beginning, and I’m impressed with the work, but we don’t know the cause of these rare mutations, or even their levels in the general population,” said Aravinda Chakravarti of the Institute of Genetic Medicine at the Medical School, who was not involved in the studies. “I’m not saying it’s not worth it to follow up these findings, but I am saying it’s going to be a hard slog.”The three research teams took a similar approach, analyzing genetic material taken from blood samples of families in which parents who have no signs of autism give birth to a child who develops the disorder. This approach gives scientists the opportunity to spot the initial mutations that accompany the condition, rather than trying to work though possible genetic contributions from maternal and paternal lines. In all three studies, the researchers focused on rare genetic glitches called de novo mutations.De novo mutations are not inherited but occur spontaneously near or during conception. Most people have at least one, and the majority of them are harmless.In one of the new studies, Dr. Matthew W. State, a professor of genetics and child psychiatry at Yale, led a team that looked for de novo mutations in 200 people who had been given an autism diagnosis, as well as in parents and siblings who showed no signs of the disorder. The team found that two unrelated children with autism in the study had de novo mutations in the same gene — and nothing similar in those without a diagnosis.“That is like throwing a dart at a dart board with 21,000 spots and hitting the same one twice,” Dr. State said. “The chances that this gene is related to autism risk is something like 99.9999 percent.”The team found that a third child had a de novo mutation in another gene suspected of a possible link to autism risk — but one such mutation is not enough to make the case.But a team led by Evan E. Eichler, a professor of genome sciences at the in , independently found the same thing in a study of 209 families: one child with autism — and a glitch in the very same gene.The researchers added still another gene, finding two unrelated children with autism in their own sample who had de novo mutations in the same location. No such coincidences occurred among people in the studies who did not have an autism diagnosis.Finally — in the third paper — a team led by Mark J. Daly of ran its own analysis of these three genes, among others, and found yet more cases.Everyone typically has at least one de novo mutation, Dr. Daly said, but his study suggested that “kids with autism have a slightly higher rate, on average, and the effects are more severe.”All three studies also found evidence that the risk of de novo mutations increases with parental age. In an analysis of 51 de novo mutations, Dr. Eichler’s group found that glitches were four times more likely to originate in DNA from the male than from the female. The risk is higher in fathers at 35 than at 25 and seems to creep up with age. This offers one possible explanation for earlier research linking older fathers with autism’s rise: older male sperm is more subject to small, perhaps random glitches that in rare cases affect brain development.The emerging picture suggests that the search for therapies will probably be a very long one, and that what is known generally as autism may represent a broad category of related but biologically distinct conditions. But both Dr. Eichler’s and Dr. Daly’s groups found some evidence that high-risk genes interact in shared biological processes.“This is really the tip of the tip of the iceberg,” Dr. Eichler said, “but I think the important thing is all of us agree on where to start.”Dr. State added, “From my standpoint, this is a big deal, because I’ve been at this a long time, and for years and years you couldn’t get anyone to believe you’d even found one gene” that significantly increased risk.'"
"'12-04-05,'0','NO GUARANTEED EMPLOYMENT Cornell Iron Works, which is based in Mountaintop, Pa., and employs 600 workers, has been reinventing itself since it began as a blacksmithing business in 1828. Today, it makes specialty metal overhead doors for industrial, institutional and retail customers. Its chief executive, Andrew Cornell, joined the business in 1992. Since then, sales have increased about tenfold, to $130 million in 2011.Mr. Cornell attributes the company’s success, in part, to its approach to hiring and promoting family members. For 45 years, the company has followed a strict written policy: no job awaits anyone by virtue of family membership. Mr. Cornell, the only family member working in the business, said even one unqualified family member can wreak havoc. “A family business can’t be a home for wayward family members,” he said. “We’re building a business for the good of employees and shareholders.”Maintaining rigorous standards for family involvement is also important at W.S. Darley & Company. Based in Itasca, Ill., and founded in 1908, Darley began as a maker of municipal firefighting equipment, including fire trucks. The company has about 215 employees, including 10 third- and fourth-generation family members.Operations are overseen by an executive committee made up of Paul Darley, chief executive; his brother, Peter, and their cousin, Jeff Darley, both executive vice presidents and co-chief operating officers; and another cousin, James Long, an executive vice president.The company’s family-participation plan provides that, while family members are encouraged to consider working in the business, the position must be mutually beneficial. It states that the business owes no obligation to any family member and no family member is obligated to work in the business.Those who do are paid the market rate for their jobs and are subject to the same hiring, performance and termination rules that apply to other employees. Ideally, family members are supervised by nonfamily members. And, as at Flottman and Cornell, family members are encouraged to work outside the company first.All of this, Paul Darley said, has helped the company thrive. As fires have become less common, the company has evolved into a provider of equipment for first responders, including paramedics and the military. Despite a tough market, annual sales, which were $52 million in 2005, have increased to $112 million in 2011.SUCCESSION PLANNING When family is involved, crucial decisions regarding succession can become especially charged. Some family businesses strive to alleviate the potential for hard feelings by placing the responsibility for choosing new leadership in the hands of qualified members of the next generation. The fathers of both Tom Flottman and Paul Darley took this approach as they prepared to step down.Mr. Flottman’s father, Rod, left the business in stages in 1992. At the time, Tom Flottman and two of his five siblings were interested in running the company. Their father told them to determine their compensation and titles among themselves. When Tom realized they all wanted to be president, he suggested a rotating presidency of 10-year terms, which the siblings agreed to and put in place.Tom, now 60 and the oldest of the three, served as president from 1992 to 2002. He said the transitions had been smooth. “We all own a third of the business, and the three of us comprise the board of directors,” he said. “This is where the ultimate authority rests, irrespective of who has what title.”Paul Darley’s father, Bill, began planning for his company’s transition more than 10 years before he stepped down as president in 1997 (there was no chief executive title at the time). After observing the company’s younger leaders — family and nonfamily alike — he narrowed his choice to three: his sons Paul and Peter, and their cousin, Jeff.In 1989, Bill asked each of them to submit business plans that detailed what they would do following his death or retirement if they were in charge. He carefully reviewed the plans, but in 1995, he decided to leave the choice to them. They picked Paul after agreeing that he possessed the necessary communication and organizational skills.OUTSIDE ADVICE Family businesses tend to make emotional decisions. Because of that, Paul Darley said, he believes it is particularly important to have outside advisers. When his company hit $35 million in annual revenue, he established a formal board. He said the value of the board became apparent when it moved to close the doors of an operation in Oregon that had been unprofitable, on and off, for 10 years.Mike Petersen, president of Petersen Aluminum, agreed that it was important to seek input and guidance from outsiders. Based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., the company manufactures architectural metal products. Mr. Petersen’s father founded the company in 1965 as a provider of architectural aluminum, mostly for industrial clients. After Mr. Petersen joined the business in 1977, he persuaded his father to expand into steel as well.Sales have grown from $20 million in 1987, when Mr. Petersen became president, to $102 million last year. And the company now has about 220 employees. Mr. Petersen, two of his brothers-in-law, both vice presidents, and a recently hired nephew who works in sales are the only family members who work for the company.When Mr. Petersen’s father ran the company, he sought business guidance from a group of service providers: his lawyer, his accountant, his insurance adviser and his banker. They functioned as a “quasi-board of directors,” said Mr. Petersen, who opted for input from more independent sources when he became involved with the Chicago Family Business Council. He is part of a group of 10 family-business owners who meet monthly to share ideas.Despite the particular challenges of running a family business, the successful ones recognize that their longevity depends on keeping customers, employees and shareholders happy. “We don’t like the idea of family business,” Andrew Cornell said. “We like the idea of business family.”'"

The Lumia 900 feels gigantic if you’re accustomed to an iPhone, but the big screen is handy when you’re reading maps, e-books and Web pages.Then again, the Lumia shows you a larger area in less detail. Its resolution is 800 by 480. The iPhone’s 3.5-incher has a far sharper 960 by 640 pixels.The rest of the Lumia specifications are what you’d expect of a top-grade app phone: 8-megapixel camera, with flash, on the back, 1-megapixel camera on the front; GPS, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth; overseas roaming; 14 gigabytes of available storage. Some of the iPhone-like downsides are here, too: nonremovable battery, no memory card, an inability to play Flash videos online.But the iPhone doesn’t yet use 4G LTE, and the Lumia 900 does. That means brisk Internet connections in 4G cities (of which AT&T has many), and incredibly fast speeds in LTE cities (of which AT&T has only 31 so far). Apps download fast, Web sites load fast, videos don’t pause to load. As usual, the price you pay is battery life: this phone might not make it through the day if you’re online a lot in a 4G city.The right side has all four physical buttons: volume (up and down), sleep/wake, camera. The earbud cord is the antenna for the built-in FM radio. Call audio quality is excellent.The software (Windows Phone 7.5, the latest and most polished version) is spectacular. It’s a crisply scrolling virtual canvas of information. It’s sharp-looking, responsive and loaded with thoughtful touches. For example, even if the phone is off, you can hold down the dedicated camera button to wake the phone directly into camera mode, ready to shoot.The Bing Maps app gives you spoken driving directions. Android phones have more map features, like walking directions and street-view photos. But Bing Maps covers the basics extremely well. When you scroll the map quickly, city names zoom up in size as you pass by — a great feature.The Home screen is the software’s most noteworthy feature. It offers two colorful columns of tiles. Each represents something you use frequently: an app, a speed-dial entry, a Web page, a music playlist or an e-mail folder. These aren’t just buttons; they’re little status screens. The music tile shows album art, the calendar tile lists your next appointment, a person’s tile shows his latest Twitter or Facebook blurb. It works.There’s speech recognition, but you can’t speak-to-type (except in the text-messaging app). You can speak some commands, like “Call Dad,” “open calendar” and “find local sushi.” Unfortunately, this isn’t Siri, the iPhone 4S’s star feature. You don’t get follow-up questions, smart substitutions or free-form syntax. (Or jokes. This is Microsoft, after all.)So there you go: the Lumia 900 is fast, beautiful and powerful, inside and out.Unfortunately, a happy ending to this underdog story still isn’t guaranteed. Windows Phone 7 faces the mother of all chicken-and-egg problems: nobody’s going to write apps until WP7 becomes popular — but WP7 won’t become popular until there are apps.Microsoft says that 70,000 apps are available, an impressive start for an 18-month-old operating system. But Android has four times as many, and the iPhone has over eight times as many.Still, if WP7 offers the most important apps, the total doesn’t matter. So to gauge the completeness of Microsoft’s app store, I checked its list against the apps I use most often on my iPhone.Many of the essentials are there: movie apps like Netflix, IMDB and Flixster; restaurant apps like Yelp and OpenTable; check-in apps from Delta and American Airlines; popular apps like Groupon, Foursquare, Kindle, Spotify, Twitter and Facebook. A few of my other favorites also made it: RunPee (tells you when during a movie it’s safe to leave the theater without missing anything important), Speedtest (measures Internet speed) and FlightTrack (tells you everything about your flight).And, of course, Angry Birds.Unfortunately, there’s an even longer list of important apps that aren’t yet available for WP7 phones: Yahoo Messenger, Dropbox, Pandora, Mint, Bump, Draw Something, StumbleUpon, Pinterest, Urbanspoon, Hipstamatic, Instagram, Barnes & Noble Reader, Cut the Rope, Scrabble, Words With Friends, Google Voice, AOL Radio. Bank of America has an app, but Citibank, Chase, HSBC, Capital One, American Express and other big banks don’t.Plenty of my less famous favorites are also unavailable: Line2, Hipmunk, Nest, Word Lens, iStopMotion, Glee, Ocarina, Songify This.Even Microsoft’s own amazing iPhone app, Photosynth, isn’t available for the Lumia 900. Skype (which Microsoft owns) is still in beta testing.Embracing the underdog also means turning your back on the universe of cool, useful accessories that work with an iPhone — all those thousands of speaker docks, alarm clocks, car adapters, external batteries, carrying cases, camera lenses, medical sensors, TV output cables and so on.These days, an incredible number of hotels have iPhone charging docks in the rooms. Your odds of finding a dock for the Lumia 900 in a hotel room? Zero.This Nokia phone and its Microsoft operating system are truly lovely — more beautiful than the iPhone or Android software, and, for most functions, just as powerful.But is that enough to make you sacrifice apps like Scrabble, Pandora and Dropbox? Is “just as good” enough to justify losing out on the universe of accessories and compatibility?I’m rooting for these long shots. They’ve done great work. But I have a sinking feeling that this breed of underdog will turn out to look more like a Pekingese than a Doberman.'"
"'12-04-05,'0','It has been more than 35 years since George M. Sullivan, the former mayor of Anchorage, vetoed a bill passed by the city assembly that would have extended basic civil rights protections to gays. It has been three years since his son, Dan, the current mayor, vetoed a similar bill.On Tuesday, supporters of gay rights in the city, Alaska’s largest, took the issue out of the mayor’s hands — but the end result was the same. In a citywide ballot measure, voters overwhelmingly rejected language, known as Proposition 5, that would have added protections for people regardless of “sexual orientation or transgender identity” to the city’s civil rights laws.A surprisingly strong turnout caused many polling sites to run out of ballots late Tuesday, and as many as 8,000 votes, possibly more, had not been counted on Wednesday, said Barbara Gruenstein, the clerk for the Municipality of Anchorage. But Proposition 5 trailed by nearly 9,000 votes, defying polls that had suggested it would succeed.“Amazing what happens when the curtain closes behind you in a voting booth,” Jim Minnery, the chairman of Protect Your Rights Campaign — Vote No on Prop. 5, said Wednesday morning in an e-mail.The vote followed an unusually loud and expensive campaign for a city ballot measure in Anchorage. The organizers of Proposition 5, a group called One Anchorage, included prominent politicians from both sides of the aisle (Alaska’s United States senators, Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, and Mark Begich, a Democrat, both said they supported it), and the group outspent the opposition more than 4 to 1.'"

"'12-04-06,'0','* BlueGold tells investors it is aiming for “orderly closure”* Fund plans to return 98 of investor money by year endApril 5 (Reuters) - BlueGold Capital, an oil-focused fund that made headlines in 2008 by calling the peak of the market, is liquidating after four years of trading -- the last of which put it at the bottom of commodity hedge fund rankings.BlueGold is conducting an “orderly closure” of its business and expects to return about 98 percent of investor capital before the end of the year, the London-based fund said in a letter to investors on Thursday, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters.It did not give a reason for its closure. A person who answered the phone at BlueGold’s London office declined comment.BlueGold was one of the worst performers among commodity hedge funds last year, industry data gathered by Reuters shows. It lost 35 percent through 2011 and its asset base shrunk to about $1.2 billion from $2 billion a year a before.The fund was co-founded by former Vitol oil trader Pierre Andurand, who made his mark with a more than 200 percent gain in 2008 as other rival funds suffered.However, it appeared to veer from its energy roots last year, irritating some investors by placing half its bets on equities and other assets, Reuters reported in December.An investor who redeemed money from BlueGold in January said he still regarded the fund as “a pretty talented group” that may have given investors concern about the risk it was taking, its apparent change in tack and the rapid growth in assets until last year.“Performance is always a symptom that something is going wrong, even when things may otherwise seem fine. For instance, if you’re constantly hitting the sweet spot, you might be extremely skilled, but you could also either be taking too much risk or getting lucky,” the investor said.“In BlueGold’s case, they also took in a lot of money, which when fully invested, meant more risk being deployed. And as far as process and trading methodology is concerned, investors also don’t like it when you say you’re changing your stripes midway.”Andurand, a 35-year-old Frenchman, has made a name for himself in pursuits as divergent as sports, oil trading and movie-making.Andurand is an avid kickboxer and former member of the French junior national swimming team. He’s also a director at Shangri La, a Chinese movie production company that has three films to its credit, with the latest, “Sin-Jin,” due to be released in December this year.In the oil market, he took bold bets that once paid handsomely for him and his investors.His meteoric rise in trading came after he moved to Singapore in 2000 after earning finance and engineering degrees from top French universities. He started as an oil trader at Goldman Sachs, then climbed the ranks at Bank of America and Swiss oil trading giant Vitol before launching BlueGold with Vitol colleague Dennis Crema in early 2008.Several oil traders said Andurand had earned a $20 million bonus in one year at Vitol, after helping the company book a trading profit of $200 million. The bonus figure could not be confirmed, but in 2008 Andurand and Crema both made the ranks of the world’s top 20 hedge fund earners, with payouts of $90 million apiece, according to research firm Hedgeable.Andurand’s near-perfect run in 2008 became the stuff of oil market lore. He accurately anticipated crude’s rise to a record $147 a barrel in July of that year, then shifted positions to cash, ending BlueGold’s exposure as prices fell to as little as $33 in December, people who tracked the fund said. The fund was up 209 percent that year.Its winning streak ended last year as oil prices were locked in a range through most of the year, thanks to intermittent spikes in the dollar and a mixed global economic outlook, before breaking out in a late rally.Even before BlueGold’s fortunes turned, Andurand faced major losses. In 2003, he was a principal oil trader in the Bank of America team that suffered a loss of up to $89 million in the jet fuel market when the SARS virus led to a collapse in air travel worldwide.In February 2010, BlueGold was briefly thrust into the spotlight when a sudden crash in oil markets brought the fund down as much as 14 percent. It, however, recovered to finish up nearly 13 percent that year.'"
"'12-04-06,'0','As the A’s take the field for their home opener Friday against the Seattle Mariners, the team’s overachieving glory days depicted in last year’s “Moneyball” starring Brad Pitt as General Manager Billy Beane are a warm, if distant glimmer.While Opening Day traditionally represents a time of hope, this year it presents Oakland with the twin quandaries of a team that seems overmatched on the field and eager to leave the O.co Coliseum — the latest name for the former Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum, its longtime home.The owners, Lew Wolff and John Fisher, have been striving to get approval for a new ballpark in San Jose, a city eager for big league ball. But they have been thwarted thus far by the San Francisco Giants, who own the territorial rights to San Jose.With the exception of 2010, when the A’s finished 81-81, they have not had a winning season in five years. In this most recent off-season, the A’s once again traded or failed to re-sign several of their best players, including pitchers Trevor Cahill, Gio Gonzalez and Andrew Bailey.“They don’t want to win,” said Garth Kimball, a founder of Baseball Oakland, a group trying to keep the A’s in town. “They want to be able to get out of town without anybody caring.”'"
"'12-04-06,'0','The execution is a bit clumsy, but the documentary “MIS: Human Secret Weapon” shines a light on an interesting bit of World War II history: the Japanese-American soldiers who did vital work with the Army’s Military Intelligence Service even as their countrymen were being thrown into internment camps.As war with Japan began to seem likely, American military officials realized that they were going to need a substantial number of soldiers who could speak and read Japanese. They recruited Nisei, second-generation Japanese-Americans, who filled a wide range of roles, including translating captured documents and going ashore in places like Okinawa to try to persuade captured Japanese not to kill themselves. As the historian James C. McNaughton notes in the film, learning how many planes and tanks an enemy has is only half of the military-intelligence job.“The other half is finding out the enemy’s intentions,” he says. “That you can’t tell by flying an airplane over their camps.”It’s touching to hear several men who worked in the intelligence service, now in their 80s and 90s, talk about the odd position they found themselves in: loyal to the United States, but viewed as outsiders and working to defeat a country where many still had family members. Even captured Japanese prisoners held them in contempt.“The ones I interrogated, anyways, had the attitude that we were like traitors,” one veteran says.'"

"'12-04-06,'0','His one-on-one exchanges with African and Caribbean heads of state, including Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, Michael Manley of Jamaica and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, were part of another mission: to report on events affecting people of African descent throughout the world.“You learned a lot watching Gil,” former Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said in an interview for this obituary. “You didn’t have to agree with everything he said, but for many of us, he was required watching.”The deep support Mr. Noble enjoyed among his viewers helped him survive two controversies stemming from interviews with figures considered anti-Semitic, biased against Israel or both. In 1982, the Anti-Defamation League accused Mr. Noble of showing an anti-Israel bias when he broadcast a panel discussion about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon without presenting the Israeli perspective.Just the rumor of disciplinary action prompted protests outside WABC headquarters, led by the Rev. Calvin O. Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, and the Rev. Al Sharpton. No disciplinary action was taken, but Mr. Noble was required to present a program with pro-Israeli guests.Similar tensions arose in the summer of 1991, when Mr. Noble made plans to broadcast a speech in which a friend, Leonard Jeffries, a City College professor of black studies, was said to have made bigoted remarks. News reports had led to Mr. Jeffries’s removal as chairman of the black studies department.Mr. Noble argued that only by hearing the speech in full could college officials (and everyone else) decide whether the remarks were cause for discipline or had been taken out of context. (In one remark, Mr. Jeffries said Hollywood movies demeaning to blacks were made by “people called Greenberg and Weisberg and Trigliani.” In another, he said, “Everyone knows rich Jews financed the slave trade.”)WABC-TV executives shelved the segment, saying it could aggravate racial unrest in the city. As it happened, long-simmering tensions between blacks and Jews in the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn exploded into violence the next week.Protesters again appeared outside the station’s offices. This time, they included a state senator, later to be governor of New York, David A. Paterson.“It was a spontaneous protest as I recall,” Mr. Paterson said in an interview. “People just showed up. Because ‘Like It Is’ — it was something special in the African-American community, to be protected.” A segment on the Jeffries affair was eventually shown later.“Some white Americans are repelled by ‘Like It Is,’ but that’s the nature of the program,” Mr. Noble told The Village Voice later that year. “We are witnessing a quarrel between the races in America, and certain opinions in the black community must be heard even if they are revolting.”After Mr. Noble’s stroke, WABC-TV began broadcasting “Here and Now,” a public affairs show it described as “continuing the legacy of Gil Noble.”Gilbert Edward Noble was born in Harlem on Feb. 22, 1932, the son of Rachel Noble, a teacher, and Gilbert R. Noble, who owned an auto repair shop. Both parents were born in Jamaica. He attended City College and was drafted into the Army during the Korean War.Mr. Noble was hired as a reporter for the radio station WLIB in 1962. In 1967, after nationwide race riots that prompted television stations around the country to recruit some of their first black reporters, he was hired by WABC. He worked as reporter, weekend anchor and sometime correspondent for “Like It Is,” a show begun in 1968, before taking over as its host in 1975. He received seven Emmy Awards.Mr. Noble’s survivors include his wife, Norma Jean; their four daughters, Lynn, Lisa, Leslie and Jennifer; a son, Chris; and eight grandchildren.Milton Allimadi, publisher of the Harlem-based newspaper Black Star News and an occasional guest on Mr. Noble’s show, described the special regard in which Mr. Noble was held in the community he served.After Mr. Allimadi appeared as a guest on the show, strangers stopped him on the street to shake his hand, he wrote in an online appreciation last August. “When I enter an M.T.A. bus, drivers refuse to accept my fare,” he wrote, “saying they are happy to drive someone who has been on ‘Like It Is.’ ”'"

"'12-04-06,'0','WASHINGTON — The United Arab Emirates detained two employees of an American-financed pro-democracy organization and barred one of them from leaving the country on Thursday, worsening a diplomatic confrontation with the United States that has embarrassed and puzzled administration officials.The United Arab Emirates, one of the closest American allies in the Persian Gulf, last week ordered the closing of the organization, the National Democratic Institute, and then detained its two employees as they prepared to leave the country late Wednesday, administration officials and others briefed on the detentions said.The institute’s local director, Patricia Davis, an American, was ultimately allowed to leave. Her deputy, Slobodan Milic, a Serb, was released on Thursday after being detained overnight and questioned, but was not allowed to leave the country, they said. The detentions appeared to be part of a broader crackdown on nongovernmental organizations in the country, which also shut down a German advocacy group, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, which has close ties to the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel.In a statement to the state-run news agency on Thursday, the assistant foreign minister for legal affairs of the Emirates, Abdul Rahim al-Awadhi, said that the authorities ordered the closings because the organizations violated regulations governing their work in the country. He did not elaborate or identify the organizations involved. “Some foreign institutions that were operating in the U.A.E. have violated the terms of the license,” Mr. Awadhi said. “Some have been operating without a license.”It was the first public explanation of the closings, which occurred on the eve of a highly trumpeted security summit meeting between Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and leaders of the six Arab nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes the Emirates.'"
"'12-04-06,'0','TAMPA, Fla. — The prohibitive favorite Boston College’s march to a national championship rolled on Thursday night with a dominating 6-1 victory over Minnesota in the marquee matchup of the N.C.A.A. men’s hockey national semifinals at the Tampa Bay Times Forum. The overall top-seeded Eagles will meet upstart Ferris State, a 3-1 winner over Union College, for the title Saturday night.“We were very opportunistic, particularly in the second period,” Boston College Coach Jerry York said. “When you look at the game, timely saves from our goaltender, opportunistic scoring and then a bounce-back goal were the keys to bring us to Saturday night’s game. We’re very excited for the possibility of winning a national championship. It’s right there in front of us.”Boston College (32-10-1), which has not lost since Jan. 21 and carries an 18-game winning streak into the final, once again rode the stellar goaltending of the junior Parker Milner. Milner, who had his postseason scoreless streak snapped at 161 minutes 26 seconds, was brilliant in recording 30 saves, including spectacular goal-mouth stops on Taylor Matson late in the first period and Jake Hansen near the end of the second period.“I kind of rushed it, I had way more time than I thought,” said Hansen, who scored Minnesota’s lone goal early in the third. “That was a Grade-A scoring chance, right in front. If I score there, it’s 2-1 and we’re right back in the game. I think they scored on the next shift; it just kills you.”The Eagles, shooting for their third N.C.A.A. title since 2008, got goals from Steven Whitney, Kevin Hayes, Chris Kreider and Paul Carey to take a 4-0 lead after two periods. In all, 11 Eagles were involved in the offensive onslaught.'"

Tyler Clippard worked a scoreless eighth to win in relief, and Brad Lidge earned the save.In Cincinnati, Jay Bruce homered and drove in two runs. Miami managed three hits off Cueto and a bullpen depleted by the loss of closer Ryan Madson and the setup man Nick Masset. Aroldis Chapman pitched a perfect eighth, and Sean Marshall retired the side in order in the ninth.DODGERS 5, PADRES 3 With Magic Johnson and Frank McCourt sitting together next to the dugout, Los Angeles won at San Diego even though Clayton Kershaw, the reigning National League Cy Young Award winner, left after three innings with an illness.Johnson, part of a group buying the Dodgers for $2.15 billion from McCourt, had a big smile after Matt Kemp hit a two-run homer in the eighth. Kemp had three runs batted in.BLUE JAYS 7, INDIANS 4 J. P. Arencibia hit a three-run homer in the top of the 16th as Toronto won at Cleveland in the longest opening day game in history. Toronto was trailing, 4-1, in the top of the ninth, but tied the score when Edwin Encarnacion’s two-run double capped a three-run inning. The previous record for the longest opener was 15 innings, in 1926 and 1960.AVERAGE SALARY RISES The average major league salary rose 4.1 percent to $3.44 million, the steepest increase since 2008.Million-dollar salaries fell slightly, to 448 from 453. Still, that is nearly 53 percent of the 852 players on opening day rosters and disabled lists. The number of $10 million players increased to 89 from 82, and $20 million players rose to 14 from 10. Sixty-eight players make the $480,000 minimum.FOREIGN PLAYERS INCREASE The percentage of major leaguers born outside the United States rose to its third-highest level, 28.4 percent. That is up from 27.7 percent last year and trails only 2005 (29.2) and 2007 (29.0). The Dominican Republic led with 95 players, followed by Venezuela (66), Canada (15) and Japan (13).Of 7,278 players with minor league contracts, 3,382, or 46.5 percent, were born outside the 50 states.RAYS’ CLOSER SIDELINED The Tampa Bay Rays placed closer Kyle Farnsworth on the 15-day disabled list because of a strained right elbow. Farnsworth, who had 25 saves last season, said it was the same problem that bothered him last September.'"
"'12-04-06,'0','“We have very limited resources, and we have to put them toward the platforms with the biggest bang for our buck,” he said. “But we are a social network and it is incredibly important for us to be available on every platform.”Foursquare has in-house engineers working on iPhone, Android and BlackBerry versions of its service. But had Microsoft not offered to pay an outside company to do the work, Mr. Luedorf said Foursquare would “probably not” have developed an app for Windows Phone.Ben Huh, chief executive of the Cheezburger Network, a collection of humor and entertainment sites, said Microsoft’s market share was too small to warrant in-house development of a Windows Phone app. But when Microsoft approached his company about making an application featuring funny photos of cats, he agreed. “They made it very easy for us,” he said. “They took care of everything.”Casey McGee, senior marketing manager for Windows Phone at Microsoft, confirmed that the company offered an array of incentives for developers, but he declined to name the apps Microsoft had financed.Mr. McGee conceded that there were still holes in Microsoft’s lineup. “We are by no means satisfied with our catalog,” he said. “That’s something we can get better at, and do better at, every day.”Microsoft now has more than 70,000 apps in its app store, including big names like , , the Weather Channel, Kindle and the game Fruit Ninja. Apple, by comparison, has more than 600,000 apps, and Android has nearly 400,000. Analysts say that Microsoft does not need a million apps to appeal to phone buyers — just the ones that are so popular and mainstream that they feel like features of the phone itself.“Once you get to 100,000, the number stops being important,” said Jan Dawson, an analyst at Ovum, a research firm in . “I’m not saying they can take their foot off the gas pedal. They still need the apps that are dealbreakers for buyers.”Despite Microsoft’s best efforts, a number of popular applications are noticeably missing from its store, including Pandora, the streaming service; Instagram, the photo-sharing application; and games by . , the sole carrier of the Lumia 900 in the United States, has said that it will train its sales force to talk up the apps that are available and give demos of alternatives to curious shoppers.The Windows Phone store has a version of the app phenomenon Angry , but not the sequel from its maker Rovio, Angry Birds Space, which has also been a big hit. Rovio’s marketing chief, Peter Vesterbacka, said last month that it would not be worth the effort to bring the game to Windows Phone. But later that same day, Mikael Hed, its chief executive, said the company was “working toward” building a Windows Phone version. Rovio has not said when that might happen, and both companies declined to discuss what caused the about-face.Often Microsoft’s problem is not outright refusal by a developer, but more that its platform is simply not a priority. Sonos, which makes apps for Apple and Android devices that allow customers to control its networked home audio equipment, does not yet know when it will release a comparable Windows Phone app.“We’re definitely watching it carefully,” said John MacFarlane, chief executive of Sonos. “We believe it’s going to be a player.”Microsoft has also approached news organizations, including , about having a presence in its app store. Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for , said that its Windows Phone app was built by outside developers, and that “Microsoft provides assistance to help ensure that the app is best in class.” Ms. Murphy declined to say whether Microsoft had paid for the app’s development.Even did not build its own Windows Phone app, the creation of which was underwritten by Microsoft. Derick Mains, a spokesman for Facebook, said that for platforms other than Apple’s and Google’s, Facebook encourages companies to make their own apps, certifying them before they are released.Microsoft’s weak position in mobile apps is in stark contrast to the clout it had with developers in the heyday of the PC era. Its success with Windows was partly built on an all-out effort it made in the 1980s and ’90s to get independent software companies to make Windows the primary operating system for which they wrote applications.That influence began to weaken somewhat when the Web era took off and more companies began to design services and products that ran through browsers. But it has accelerated further as much of the creative talent in the developer world has shifted toward smartphone and applications.Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at , said Microsoft’s relative weakness was a function of not having a big enough audience of users. “Developers go where the money is, and the money is where people are,” she said.Ms. Epps noted that Microsoft and Nokia currently appeared to be going after customers who are not already using iPhones and Android devices, and so may not be as familiar with the mobile apps they cannot get on Windows Phones. To someone moving from a BlackBerry or an old-fashioned feature phone, the selection of Windows Phone apps is likely to be satisfying, she said.Ben Lamm, who runs Chaotic Moon, an app development studio that developed Windows Phone apps for TripIt and Pizza Hut, among others, said larger companies were warming up to Windows Phone.“We’re starting to get requests from firms that want a Windows Phone app,” he said. “It’s still only 5 to 10 percent of our total requests, but very different than a year ago, when only Microsoft was calling us to do work.”'"

"'12-04-06,'0','PARIS — Switzerland agreed Thursday to a revised tax deal with Germany under which it would pay billions of dollars on funds hidden in its banks by German tax dodgers, the latest step in an international charm offensive that is meant to salvage at least some of the country’s famous banking secrecy.The accord, which was made tougher after a September deal was criticized by the German opposition and officials in Brussels, provides for the assessment of a one-time charge of 21 percent to 41 percent of the value of secret German accounts, higher than the original agreement of 19 percent to 34 percent. Swiss banks that are home to such accounts would make payments to the German government.Anyone inheriting such an account will have to either pay a 50 percent tax or disclose its existence to the German authorities. And henceforth, taxes on investment income will be withheld at the standard German rate.Crucially, from the point of view of maintaining Swiss banking secrecy, account holders’ names will not be revealed to Berlin, and the Swiss authorities will be responsible for ensuring that taxes are paid on behalf of the account holder, who can remain anonymous if desired.The German Finance Ministry estimated that a one-time payment of back taxes could bring it a windfall of up to €10 billion, or $13 billion, with annual payments of €750 million a year thereafter.Still, ratification of the deal by the German Parliament is not assured. Members of the Social Democrats and the Greens, opposition parties that together have sufficient votes in the upper house to block it, have argued that the measures are too lenient on tax cheats.'"
"'12-04-06,'0','Still, the disclosures of e-mail hacking come at an awkward time for BSkyB, which is 39.1 percent owned by News Corporation and which has suffered from its association with the Murdochs as the hacking scandal has unfolded.“This is nothing like the hacking at The News of the World,” said Roy Greenslade, a journalism professor at City University London. “But there’s an embarrassment in that it’s another News Corporation business, so people will be saying, ‘That’s just typical of Murdoch.’ ”Last summer, stung by sustained criticism in Parliament and across Britain, News Corporation withdrew one of Mr. Murdoch’s cherished goals: its $12 billion bid to take over the portion of BSkyB that he did not own already. On Tuesday, in announcing James Murdoch’s resignation from BSkyB, the company said the continuing phone hacking investigation was making him a lightning rod for dissatisfaction and proving distracting to the company.A report from a House of select committee investigating phone hacking is scheduled to be released within the next few weeks, and is expected to criticize the younger Mr. Murdoch for what some members believe was incomplete and misleading testimony during hearings last summer.“I believe that my resignation will help to ensure that there is no false conflation with events at a separate organization,” Mr. Murdoch, 39, wrote in a letter to the BSkyB board, referring to News International, the British newspaper arm of his father’s media empire. He resigned as chief executive of News International five weeks ago.Mr. Ryley of Sky said Thursday that one of the e-mail hacking cases occurred in 2008 and concerned John Darwin, a Briton who staged his death in a fake accident in 2002 but actually moved to and, in collusion with his wife, collected £500,000 in .Known in the tabloids as the “canoe man,” Mr. Darwin returned to Britain and lived in a secret apartment in his old house until 2007, when he turned himself in to a police station, claiming at first to have no idea what he had been doing for the last five years.The next year, a Sky News reporter pursuing the story sought permission to hack into e-mails he suspected had been used by the Darwins to communicate after Mr. Darwin’s fake death, Mr. Ryley said in an online posting.“After careful consideration, Sky News granted permission because we believed the story was justified in the public interest,” Mr. Ryley said. “None of the material obtained was broadcast prior to the conviction and our coverage made clear that we had discovered and supplied e-mails to the police. There has been no attempt by Sky News to conceal these facts, which have been available on our Web site ever since.”In a statement, the police department in Cleveland, which handled the Darwin case, said that it had “conducted an initial review into these matters and can confirm that inquiries are ongoing into how these e-mails were obtained.”A second case involved e-mails relating to a suspected pedophile, a spokeswoman for Sky News said. On both occasions, she said, the managing editor of Sky News, Simon Cole, authorized the hacking.The company likened the e-mail hacking to other instances in which journalists broke the law for the sake of journalism. In 2004, Sky News journalists bought an Uzi machine gun to highlight how easy it was to buy illegal weapons in Britain. The year before, a reporter penetrated to show how porous it was.BSkyB has suffered various upheavals in the last year. As a result of the allegations surrounding the Murdochs’ newspaper business in Britain, the broadcaster is being investigated by Ofcom, the British broadcast regulator, over whether it is “fit and proper” to hold a television license.Critics seized on Sky’s disclosures as evidence of impropriety at the company.“The chair of BSkyB has to say something on this and reassure viewers that this has not been going on more widely,” Tom Watson, a Party member of Parliament and a persistent Murdoch critic, told the . “There are cases where the public is best served with journalists breaking the law, but it has to be done in extremis, and I am not sure whether it was in these two cases.”But Clare Enders, the head of Enders Analysis, a media research firm in London, said she thought that the biggest potential obstacle to BSkyB’s retaining its broadcast license had been James Murdoch, and that his resignation had removed much of the problem.“We all spend our days shell-shocked because it’s been one thing after another,” Ms. Enders said in an interview, referring to the seemingly endless stream of disclosures about wrongdoing at News International. Still, compared with past revelations by other British media outlets, she said she did not consider Sky’s practices “that big a deal.”Rupert Murdoch, who is 81, has complained on recently that critics have been unfairly targeting News Corporation with false allegations.He was particularly incensed, it seems, by reports in the BBC, and The Australian Financial Review charging that a section of his television operation hacked the encryption codes of its pay-television rivals in Britain and , encouraging piracy to undermine their businesses in the late 1990s.“Seems every competitor and enemy piling on with lies and libels,” he wrote on Twitter last week. “So bad, easy to hit back hard, which preparing.”'"

"'12-04-06,'0','Greek government officials said on Thursday that 97 percent of the investors holding its private sector bonds had agreed to the terms of a debt swap in which they would take a 75 percent loss in return for a new package of debt securities.The revised participation rate is up from the 96 percent rate announced last month, when the country struck a restructuring agreement to reduce its debt by about 100 billion euros ($130 billion).It represents another positive development for Greece and its financial backers in Europe, and it leaves just a small pool of holdout investors that could pursue Greece in court.The government announced that investors holding 20.2 billion euros of bonds governed by foreign law had agreed to the terms of the exchange. The earlier restructuring agreement covered 177 billion euros in bonds governed by Greek law.Greek officials also said that the deadline to participate in the swap had been extended to April 20 for the investors who continued to hold out.Many of these investors, including well-known funds that invest in distressed debt, like Aurelius Capital and Elliott Associates, are betting that in the coming months Greece will decide that it is better to make good on these bonds and not default. Greek officials have said repeatedly that they will not consider such a step.In fact, bankers and lawyers involved in the negotiations say that it was this unflinching hard line advanced by Greece that persuaded many investors to change plans and not challenge the deal. The investors figured that even with the deep loss, the basket of new bonds would be worth more than the uncertain prospect of holding out for a better offer or suing the country.'"

"'12-04-07,'0','The more aggressive posture is a break from the past, when Democrats on the national stage battled against the perception that the party was not as committed as Republicans were to a strong defense and an aggressive response to terrorism. Mr. Obama himself, during the 2008 campaign, drew criticism from both Republicans and his primary opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, for what they called his naïveté, particularly over his willingness to talk, without preconditions, to American foes like Iran.But Mr. Obama’s victory that year over Senator John McCain, a Vietnam War hero, was in part a result of an electorate weary from years of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq. Now, with a record that includes winding down the Iraq war and killing Bin Laden, coupled with the success of the military strikes in Libya and the removal of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, political and national security experts have embraced the Obama campaign’s belief that this could be the year when national security issues actually help a Democrat.“Barack Obama’s position in foreign policy is substantively stronger than that of any other Democratic candidate in recent memory,” said David Rothkopf, the chief executive and editor at large of the Foreign Policy Group. “The general Romney refrain of ‘I can do better’ is easily defused with one word: ‘How?’ ”Of course, Mr. Obama will have to fend off criticism on Afghanistan, where he has announced a withdrawal date for American troops even as the political situation remains tenuous, with reconciliation talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government in disarray. But even on this issue, Mr. Romney’s criticism — that Mr. Obama should listen more to his generals — has not had much resonance with a public that polls show to be increasingly disillusioned with the American presence there.Mr. Rothkopf’s description of the Obama counteroffense played out late last month, when Mr. Romney’s national security advisers sent an open letter to Mr. Obama via the conservative magazine National Review. The letter took the president to task over a host of issues, from Israel — which the Romney team said Mr. Obama had not done enough to support — to Iran, Afghanistan and Venezuela, where President Hugo Chávez, Mr. Romney’s advisers said, is growing in influence under Mr. Obama’s lax watch.Within 24 hours, the Obama campaign struck back, this time choosing Foreign Policy magazine for its counterpunch. Beyond taking on each of the Romney letter’s accusations point by point, the Obama letter, signed by 18 mostly Democratic-leaning national security experts, demanded that Mr. Romney say what he would do instead.“What specifically would you do to address the Iranian threat that is different from what President Obama is already doing?” the letter said. “Why did you call Russia ‘without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe,’ especially when strategic cooperation with Russia is essential for countering the Iranian nuclear threat?”And finally: “What did you mean when you said, ‘It’s not worth moving heaven and earth spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person,’ referring to Osama bin Laden?” the letter said.“We are so eager for this debate to happen,” said Michèle Flournoy, the former under secretary of defense who is now one of the Obama campaign’s national security surrogates. “If Romney is the Republican challenger, and he is going to make national security an issue, the president’s record is very strong and speaks for itself.”A host of other Obama national security surrogates went after Mr. Romney last week, after he jumped on Mr. Obama’s open-microphone slip a few days before, during which the president was overheard telling Russia’s president, Dimitri A. Medvedev, that he would have more flexibility to deal with Russian concerns over the American missile defense system after the election in November.  Russia, Mr. Romney told CNN later, is “without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.”The Obama campaign released a flurry of statements from pro-Obama foreign policy notables taking Mr. Romney to task. “His national security priorities seem to shift opportunistically each week, from threatening war with Iran to calling Russia our biggest geopolitical foe,” said Richard J. Danzig, the Navy secretary under President Bill Clinton.Mr. Romney, of course, has his own national security surrogates. Richard S. Williamson, who was Mr. Bush’s special envoy to Sudan, said Mr. Obama’s national security record left plenty of room for Mr. Romney to attack.“The world is better off because Osama bin Laden is dead. The world is better off because Muammar Qaddafi is dead,” Mr. Williamson said in an interview. “But two deaths do not a foreign policy make.”'"
"'12-04-07,'0','With the Republicans hammering away at higher gas prices, President Obama has gone out of his way in recent weeks to show that he is friendly to the idea of oil and gas exploration on federal lands. This is a sound part of any broad energy strategy as long as it balances energy needs with environmental protection. The administration has done a better job on this score than the Bush administration, which took a “drill now, drill everywhere” approach.But on one new project, the Interior Department is making the wrong move. It has tentatively approved a huge, overly aggressive natural gas drilling project in northeastern Utah. Gasco, a Denver-based company, plans to sink 1,298 wells in the next 15 years on 206,000 acres. About 200 of these wells would threaten Desolation Canyon, a wild, spectacular and fragile landscape.Gasco has rejected requests from the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance to eliminate these 200 wells and use lateral drilling father away to access reserves that might lie under Desolation Canyon.The Interior Department should take the present plan off the table and broker a compromise along those lines. It has done so before. In 2010, it helped forge an environmentally friendly deal in central Utah with another driller, the Bill Barrett Corporation, and just this week, it approved an expansion of an existing Anadarko oil and gas field in eastern Utah that won the blessing of conservationists.It should forge a similarly sensible compromise with Gasco. With natural gas supplies abundant and prices low, there is no reason to settle for anything less than a win-win deal.'"
"'12-04-07,'0','One of the largest and oldest drug rehabilitation agencies in New York State announced on Friday that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.The agency, Daytop Village, said the move was “a result of extreme financial pressure from its lending institutions.”According to court papers, it owes more than $33 million, secured by nearly $50 million in real estate holdings, to Signature Bank and Hudson Valley Bank.Daytop lost $28.2 million over five years, starting in 2006, the court papers said. It attributed the losses, in part, to a decline in inpatient residents, to about 700, from 1,100 in 2006.Declaring bankruptcy will allow Daytop “to continue its mission of treating and rehabilitating substance abusers while it continues to reorganize, improve its financial position and ensure long-term viability,” the agency said.Daytop was founded in 1964, and with 375 full-time workers, it serves about 2,000 people at 14 residential facilities and outreach clinics across the state.

"'12-04-07,'0','The other day Romney reacted spontaneously to a comment by , an Obama adviser, that Mitt was the “godfather” of the individual mandate in .“If I’m the godfather of this thing, then it gives me the right to kill it,” Romney said.Think about that for a minute. What do you think he was going for there? A Mafia metaphor? Romney also tossed in a mention of Rumpelstiltskin, so maybe either a Mafia metaphor or some sort of weird fairy-tale image? (“I am your evil fairy godfather, and I am putting you into a from which you will never awake.

"'12-04-07,'0','It’s not hard to understand the logic behind “Flamenco Sketches,” the new Blue Note release by the Andalusian pianist Chano Domínguez. As the title suggests, however indirectly, it’s a cultural reimagining of “Kind of Blue,” the landmark 1959 Miles Davis album, which featured a weightless ballad called “Flamenco Sketches” as its fifth and final track. On some level, perhaps, it’s an act of reciprocity, a circling back of flamenco’s modal improvising tradition after its borrowed time in Davis’s hands. That would be the generous interpretation.Another, more obvious way to put it: “Kind of Blue,” still the most potent crossover catnip for the casual jazz listener, holds a clear utility for Mr. Domínguez in attracting an audience beyond his native constituency. He recorded “Flamenco Sketches” at the Jazz Standard in 2009, as part of an exchange organized by the Voll-Damm Barcelona Jazz Festival; it was his debut in a New York club, after having been featured on a couple of flamenco-centered Jazz at Lincoln Center concerts in 2003.Mr. Domínguez is back at the Jazz Standard this week, promoting the album and taking part in the club’s 10th-anniversary celebration. He began his early set on Thursday night with “Flamenco Sketches,” bringing in the theme with a cloudlike drift of chords, in the appropriate Bill Evans style.As on the album, this soon led to a quickened pulse, girded by clave and punctuated by the plangent, melismatic rasp of Blas Córdoba. Soloing over a vamp, Mr. Domínguez shed the Evanesque touch, going for something more metallic, more insistent and more blithely self-assured.Aside from Mr. Córdoba, his band has been reconfigured, with direct musical consequences. On the album Mr. Domínguez leads a cohort of his countrymen, including a dedicated palmero, or hand clapper, and a percussionist focused on the cajón, or box drum. This week he has more of a jazz rhythm section, featuring two adopted New Yorkers, each with his own multicultural perspective: the bassist Omer Avital, from Israel, and the drummer Dafnis Prieto, from Cuba.This made for a more dynamic and spontaneous group interplay, especially on “Freddie Freeloader,” rearranged to capitalize on the polyrhythmic 12-beat cadence of flamenco. During his solo, Mr. Domínguez shifted from a tumbling triplet feel to a stiffer, more syncopated eighth-note articulation, and the band snapped into gear with a 4/4 Cuban son. Mr. Prieto was in commanding form, here and throughout, and Mr. Avital proved a strong anchor, though his solos, nimble as they were, came packaged with too many cute quotations.'"

"'12-04-08,'0','TAMPA, Fla. — The expected coronation of Boston College as king of men’s college hockey did not come without a struggle. The top-seeded Eagles were pushed to the limit but outlasted the underdog Ferris State, 4-1, in the Frozen Four title game Saturday night at Tampa Bay Times Forum.It was the third national championship in the past five years for the Eagles (33-10-1), and their fifth over all. The victory over Ferris State (26-12-5), which plays in N.C.A.A. Division II in every sport but hockey, capped a team-record 19-game winning streak for Boston College.A spirited, well-played game throughout, the Eagles prevailed in front of a raucous crowd of 18,818, the largest for a first-time Frozen Four host in the 64-year history of the event. In the end, it was the superlative performance of Boston College’s junior goalie Parker Milner, who made 27 saves, including a half-dozen outstanding stops. Milner allowed only two goals on 112 shots in four N.C.A.A. tournament games and was named the most outstanding player of the Frozen Four.“Our team stayed patient through the first two periods,” Boston College Coach Jerry York said. “We got an incredible goal from Johnny Gaudreau to break open the game. During the course of the game, Parker Milner was once again extremely strong in the net. We knew Ferris State was going to be outstanding. They may not have the name recognition, but they are an excellent club.”Nursing a 2-1 lead from midway through the first period, the Eagles finally put the Bulldogs away late in the third period on a scintillating move from the dynamic freshman Gaudreau. Corralling the puck at midice, Gaudreau weaved his way around Bulldogs defenseman Brett Wysopal and lifted a pretty backhand over the blocker of goalie Taylor Nelson with 3 minutes 2 seconds left for his 21st goal of the season. Boston College wing Steven Whitney added his second goal of the game, into an empty net, to complete the scoring.'"
"'12-04-08,'0','Maria Thomas, 29, with four daughters, helps friends sell piles of brand-name clothes, taking pains not to ask if they are stolen. “I don’t know where they come from,” she said. “I’m just helping get rid of them.”To keep her lights on, Rosa Pena, 24, sold the groceries she bought with food stamps and then kept her children fed with school lunches and help from neighbors. Her post-welfare credo is widely shared: “I’ll do what I have to do.”Critics of the stringent system say stories like these vindicate warnings they made in 1996 when President fulfilled his pledge to “end welfare as we know it”: the revamped law encourages states to withhold aid, especially when the economy turns bad.The old program, Aid to Families with Dependent Children, dates from the New Deal; it gave states unlimited matching funds and offered poor families extensive rights, with few requirements and no time limits. The new program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, created time limits and work rules, capped federal spending and allowed states to turn poor families away.“My take on it was the states would push people off and not let them back on, and that’s just what they did,” said , a law professor at who resigned from the Clinton administration to protest the law. “It’s been even worse than I thought it would be.”But supporters of the current system often say lower caseloads are evidence of decreased dependency. Many leading Republicans are pushing for similar changes to much larger programs, like and food stamps.Representative of , the top House Republican on budget issues, calls the current welfare program “an unprecedented success.” , who leads the race for the Republican presidential nomination, has said he would place similar restrictions on “all these federal programs.” One of his rivals, , calls the welfare law a source of spiritual rejuvenation.“It didn’t just cut the rolls, but it saved lives,” Mr. Santorum said, giving the poor “something dependency doesn’t give: hope.”spoke favorably of the program in his 2008 campaign — promoting his role as a state legislator in cutting the welfare rolls. But he has said little about it as president.Even in the 1996 program’s early days, when jobs were plentiful, a subset of families appeared disconnected — left with neither welfare nor work. Their numbers were growing before the recession and seem to have surged since then.While data on the very poor is limited and subject to challenge, recent studies have found that as many as one in every four low-income single mothers is jobless and without cash aid — roughly four million women and children. Many of the mothers have problems like addiction or depression, which can make assisting them politically unpopular, and they have received little attention in a downturn that has produced an outpouring of concern for the middle class.Poor families can turn to other programs, like food stamps or Medicaid, or rely on family and charity. But the absence of a steady source of cash, however modest, can bring new instability to troubled lives.One prominent supporter of the tough welfare law is worried that it may have increased destitution among the most disadvantaged families. “This is the biggest problem with welfare reform, and we ought to be paying attention to it,” said Ron Haskins of the , who helped draft the 1996 law as an aide to House Republicans and argues that it has worked well for most recipients.“The issue here is, can you create a strong work program, as we did, without creating a big problem at the bottom?” Mr. Haskins said. “And we have what appears to be a big problem at the bottom.”He added, “This is what really bothers me: the people who supported welfare reform, they’re ignoring the problem.”The welfare program was born amid apocalyptic warnings and was instantly proclaimed a success, at times with a measure of “I told you so” glee from its supporters. Liberal critics had warned that its mix of time limits and work rules would create mass destitution — “children sleeping on the grates,” in the words of Senator , a New York Democrat who died in 2003.But the economy boomed, employment soared, poverty fell and caseloads plunged. Thirty-two states reduced their caseloads by two-thirds or more, as officials issued press releases and jostled for bragging rights. The tough law played a large role, but so did expansions of child care and credits that raised take-home pay.In a twist on poverty politics, poor single mothers, previously chided as “welfare queens,” were celebrated as working-class heroes, with their stories of leaving the welfare rolls cast as uplifting tales of pluck. Flush with federal money, states experimented with programs that offered counseling, clothes and used cars.But if the rise in employment was larger than predicted, it was also less transformative than it may have seemed. Researchers found that most families that escaped poverty remained “near poor.”And despite widespread hopes that working mothers might serve as role models, studies found few social or educational benefits for their children. (They measured things like children’s aspirations, self-esteem, grades, drug use and arrests.) Nonmarital births continued to rise.But the image of success formed early and stayed frozen in time.“The debate is over,” President Clinton said a year after signing the law, which he often cites in casting himself as a centrist. “Welfare reform works.”The recession that began in 2007 posed a new test to that claim. Even with $5 billion in new federal funds, caseloads rose just 15 percent from the lowest level in two generations. Compared with the 1990s peak, the national welfare rolls are still down by 68 percent. Just one in five poor children now receives cash aid, the lowest level in nearly 50 years.As the downturn wreaked havoc on budgets, some states took new steps to keep the needy away. They shortened time limits, tightened eligibility rules and reduced benefits (to an average of about $350 a month for a family of three).Since 2007, 11 states have cut the rolls by 10 percent or more. They include centers of unemployment like , and , as well as , where the welfare director justified cuts by telling legislators, “We have a fair number of people gaming the system.” Arizona cut benefits by 20 percent and shortened time limits twice — to two years, from five.Many people already found the underlying system more hassle than help, a gantlet of job-search classes where absences can be punished by a complete loss of aid. Some states explicitly pursue a policy of deterrence to make sure people use the program only as a last resort.Since the states get fixed federal grants, any caseload growth comes at their own expense. By contrast, the federal government pays the entire food stamp bill no matter how many people enroll; states encourage applications, and the rolls have reached record highs.Among the Arizonans who lost their checks was Tamika Shelby, who first sought cash aid at 29 after fast-food jobs and a stint as a waitress in a Phoenix strip club. The state gave her $176 a month and sent her to work part time at a food bank. Though she was effectively working for $2 an hour, she scarcely missed a day in more than a year.Her supervisor, Michael Cox, said Ms. Shelby “was just wonderful” and “would even come up here on her days off.”Then the reduced time limit left Ms. Shelby with neither welfare nor work. She still gets about $250 a month in food stamps for herself and her 3-year-old son, Dejon. She counts herself fortunate, she said, because a male friend lets her stay in a spare room, with no expectations of sex. Still, after feeding her roommate and her child, she said, “there are plenty of days I don’t eat.”“I know there are some people who abuse the system,” Ms. Shelby said. “But I was willing to do anything they asked me to. If I could, I’d still be working for those two dollars an hour.”Clarence H. Carter, Arizona’s director of economic security, says finances forced officials to cut the rolls. But the state gets the same base funding from the federal government, $200 million, that it received in the mid-1990s when caseloads were five times as high. (The law also requires it to spend $86 million in state funds.)Arizona spends most of the federal money on other human services programs, especially and adoption services, while using just one-third for cash benefits and work programs — the core purposes of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. If it did not use the federal welfare money, the state would have to finance more of those programs itself.“Yes, we divert — divert’s a bad word,” said State Representative John Kavanagh, a Republican and chairman of the Arizona House Appropriations Committee. “It helps the state.”While federal law allows such flexibility, critics say states neglect poor families to patch their own finances. Nationally, only 30 percent of the welfare money is spent on cash benefits.“It’s not that the other stuff isn’t important, but it’s not what T.A.N.F.” — the Temporary Assistance program — “was intended for,” said LaDonna Pavetti of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research and advocacy group. “The states use the money to fill budget holes.”Even in an economy as bad as Arizona’s, some recipients find work. Estefana Armas, a 30-year-old mother of three, spent nine years on the rolls, fighting depression so severe that it left her hospitalized. Once exempt from time limits because of her , Ms. Armas joined support groups, earned a high school equivalency degree and enrolled in .Just as her time expired last summer, Ms. Armas found work as a teacher’s aide at a church preschool.“It kind of pushed me to get a job,” she said.Supporters of Temporary Assistance cite stories like that to argue that it promotes a work ethic. Despite high unemployment, low-skilled single mothers work as much now, on average, as they did under the old welfare law — and by some measures, a bit more. As a group, their poverty rates are still lower. And those without cash aid, they say, can turn to other programs.“We have reduced our caseload, and we don’t have people dying in the street,” Mr. Kavanagh said. “There were an awful lot of people who didn’t need it.”But the number of very poor families appears to be growing. Pamela Loprest and Austin Nichols, researchers at the Urban Institute, found that one in four low-income single mothers nationwide — about 1.5 million — are jobless and without cash aid. That is twice the rate the researchers found under the old welfare law. More than 40 percent remain that way for more than a year, and many have mental or physical disabilities, sick children or problems with domestic violence.Using a different definition of distress, Luke Shaefer of the and Kathryn Edin of examined the share of households with children in a given month living on less than $2 per person per day. It has nearly doubled since 1996, to almost 4 percent. Even when counting food stamps as cash, they found one of every 50 children live in such a household.The uses a third measure, “deep poverty,” which it defines as living on less than half of the amount needed to escape poverty (for a family of three, that means living on less than $9,000 a year). About 10 percent of households headed by women report incomes that low, a bit less than the peak under the old law but still the highest level in 18 years.Some researchers say the studies exaggerate poverty by inadequately accounting for undisclosed income, like help from boyfriends or under-the-table jobs. They note that asking poor people about their consumption, rather than their income, suggests that even the poorest single mothers have improved their standard of living since 1996.Mr. Haskins, the Temporary Assistance program’s architect, agrees that poverty at the bottom “is not as bad as it seems,” but adds, “It’s still pretty darn bad.”Trying to Make DoAsked how they survived without cash aid, virtually all of the women interviewed here said they had sold food stamps, getting 50 cents for every dollar of groceries they let others buy with their benefit cards. Many turned to and churches. Nationally, roughly a quarter have subsidized housing, with rents as low as $50 a month.Several women said the loss of aid had left them more dependent on troubled boyfriends. One woman said she sold her child’s number so a relative could collect a tax worth $3,000.“I tried to sell blood, but they told me I was anemic,” she said.Several women acknowledged that they had resorted to shoplifting, including one who took orders for brand-name clothes and sold them for half-price. Asked how she got cash, one woman said flatly, “We rob wetbacks” — illegal immigrants, who tend to carry cash and avoid the police. At least nine times, she said, she has flirted with men and led them toward her home, where accomplices robbed them.“I felt bad afterwards,” she said. But she added, “There were times when we didn’t have nothing to eat.”One family ruled out crime and rummaged through trash cans instead. The mother, an illegal immigrant from , could not get aid for herself but received $164 a month for her four American-born children until their time limit expired. Distraught at losing her only steady source of cash, she asked the children if they would be ashamed to help her collect discarded cans.“I told her I would be embarrassed to steal from someone — not to pick up cans,” her teenage daughter said.Weekly park patrols ensued, and recycling money replaced about half of the welfare check.Despite having a father in prison and a mother who could be deported, the children exude earnest cheer. A daughter in the fifth grade won a contest at school for reading the most books. A son in the eighth grade is a student leader praised by his principal for tutoring younger students, using supplies he pays for himself.“That’s just the kind of character he has,” the principal said.After losing cash aid, the mother found a cleaning job but lost it when her boss discovered that she was in the illegally. The family still gets subsidized housing and $650 a month in food stamps.The boy worries about homelessness, but his younger sisters, 9 and 10, see an upside in scavenging.“It’s kind of fun because you get to look through the trash,” one of the girls said.“And you get to play in the park a little while before you go home,” her sister agreed.'"

"'12-04-08,'0','The group that organized last year’s protest, the Coalition for Free and Fair Elections, announced last week that it would hold another rally on April 28 because a parliamentary committee’s recommendations for electoral reform had failed to satisfy its demands.In January, the High Court in Kuala Lumpur rejected an application by six Malaysians living in Britain for a review of the election laws. But the authorities have begun taking steps toward extending the vote to more Malaysians overseas. In a report released Tuesday, a parliamentary committee noted a proposal by the Election Commission that overseas citizens who have registered to vote and have returned home at least once in the five years before an election be allowed to cast absentee ballots.The report suggests that the Election Commission discuss with the relevant authorities, within the next three months, the logistics of allowing more overseas Malaysians to vote.Whereas the United States allows all overseas citizens to vote, other countries, like Malaysia, restrict voting to certain overseas citizens, often only diplomats and military personnel.Other nations impose limits on the length of time citizens can live abroad before losing their voting rights. Canadian citizens, for instance, lose their right to vote if they have lived overseas for more than five years, while the time limit for British citizens is 15 years.Some analysts believe that the governing coalition — which in 2008 suffered one of its biggest electoral setbacks, with the opposition taking more than a third of the seats in Parliament — is unlikely to extend the franchise to more overseas Malaysians in time for the next election.Expatriates, these analysts say, may be more likely to support the opposition, since many are ethnic Chinese and Indians who left, at least in part, because of the government’s longstanding policies favoring Malays.“The strong suspicion is that the vast majority of overseas Malaysians, who are ethnic Indians and ethnic Chinese, are somewhat frustrated with the affirmative action policies and have left Malaysia to seek better opportunities,” said John Lee, adjunct associate professor at the Center for International Security Studies at the University of Sydney in Australia. “This includes better opportunities for their children’s education, and also due to the fact that the best jobs in the public service and other selective sectors of the economy have affirmative action quotas in place.”Wan Saiful Wan Jan, chief executive of the Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs in Kuala Lumpur, said that Malaysians living overseas were, based on his observations, “overwhelmingly critical of the governing coalition.”“The government has a lot to lose,” he said. “Overseas voters can make a big difference if they have that opportunity to vote.”Wan Ahmad Wan Omar, deputy chairman of the Election Commission, said it would not be fair to extend the vote to citizens who return less frequently than five years and do not follow developments in their constituencies.Some expatriates are riled by the suggestion that if they stay away for long periods, they do not care about their country’s affairs. They say they want the chance to vote for leaders who will address the issues that prompted them to leave in the first place.“Just because you are overseas doesn’t mean you don’t care and don’t know,” said Ong Suan Ee, who works as a senior research analyst at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.See-See Leong, a software designer who has lived in London for 17 years and was one of the six Malaysians involved in the case the High Court ruled on in January, said there was “no logic” to why only certain overseas Malaysians are allowed to vote.“The Constitution gives you the right to vote, and therefore, so long as you are a Malaysian citizen, you should have the right to vote,” said Ms. Leong, 44, who is on the board of trustees of MyOverseasVote, an advocacy group set up in London in 2010.Among other changes, MyOverseasVote wants votes to be counted at Malaysian embassies, rather than mailed back to the country from overseas, a process that the Election Commission has recommended stay in place. The group said in a statement last month that voting by mail in Malaysia had “become synonymous with fraud and unfair balloting.”Mr. Wan Ahmad of the Election Commission said he was aware that such allegations had been reported in the news media but said the commission had received no formal complaints and urged anyone with evidence of misconduct to come forward.Some expatriates, including Hwa Shi-Hsia, 28, a biologist who lives in Singapore, are determined to vote even if the rules are not changed before the next election.Ms. Hwa, 28, plans to book a flight home as soon as the election is scheduled. But she says this is a cost she should not be required to bear.“The Philippines managed to arrange overseas voting for its citizens in Singapore,” she said. “I don’t see why we can’t.”'"
"'12-04-08,'0','Re “How to Avert a Financial Overdose” (Fair Game, April 1), in which Gretchen Morgenson described two professors’ proposal for the equivalent of a Food and Drug Administration to approve new financial products:The idea is intriguing. The standard argument made by Wall Street and many of my academic colleagues is that these instruments are useful for risk management and hedging. What is troubling, however, is whether some of these innovations manufacture risks where none existed before, amplify them and then create the need to hedge those risks. Credit default swaps are a prime example.The purported need for these swaps is to insure against default by a borrower. Unlike insurance on an asset, like a home, where only one policy can be written, there could be hundreds of these swaps on a single loan. The perverse incentives here are obvious — it can pay, figuratively, to burn the house down.This is the opposite of what the economist Joseph Schumpeter called “creative destruction.” It is destruction of a valuable asset, creatively.A Financial Products Agency as proposed by the two professors — Eric A. Posner and E.

"'12-04-08,'0','In Islamabad, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani expressed his shock over the disaster and said he was in “constant contact” with the military. But, he added, “The incident in no way would undermine the high morale of soldiers and officers.”The disaster did, however, underline the inherent dangers of fighting on the world’s highest battlefield.Gayari is on one side of the 49-mile-long Siachen Glacier, which has been violently disputed by Pakistan and India since 1984.Little fighting has broken out there for almost a decade, but thousands of troops are stationed on either side, facing greater peril from extreme weather conditions and dangerous terrain than from enemy fire.The temperature often drops to minus 40 degrees, and the soldiers, camping in igloos at elevations of up to 22,000 feet, must contend with altitude sickness, high winds and frostbite. Spring is especially hazardous, when ice begins to melt.The battalion headquarters at Gayari was established 20 years ago and is the main gateway through which Pakistani troops and supplies reach smaller bases overlooking the Siachen Glacier. The military said that both the location and timing of Saturday’s avalanche caught it by surprise.Since the establishment of the base “no incident of this nature has happened,” the military said.General Abbas noted that avalanches usually occurred at night, after the sun had warmed the snow and ice, but that this one took place at 6 a.m. “It is very unusual,” he said.Troops from both countries have been stationed at Siachen since April 1984, when the Indian Army occupied the heights around the glacier. Pakistan responded within weeks by sending in its troops, and both sides exchanged artillery barrages.Despite occasional skirmishes, the area has been relatively quiet since a cease-fire in 2003, with Indian forces dominating many of the higher positions. Critics in both countries say their militaries are wasting millions of dollars a year on a futile standoff that has more to do with national ego than military value.The Siachen dispute is part of the broader conflict over Kashmir, which is at the core of the strains between India and Pakistan that have led to three major wars since 1947.The fate of the glacier was discussed by Indian and Pakistani officials during secretive preliminary peace talks under Pakistan’s last military ruler, Gen. Pervez Musharraf.Officials from both countries say that, should their governments ever find agreement on the wider Kashmir dispute, the Siachen problem would be relatively easy to resolve.'"
"'12-04-08,'0','Williams hit a forehand winner to end the match moments later, and eliminated Stosur from a tournament for the second straight week. Williams beat Stosur, 7-5, 6-3, last week at the Sony Ericsson Open, serving 20 aces in the hardcourt win.Williams only had seven aces in this one, but she was in command of nearly every shot she hit.“I have to say this is probably the best match I’ve played in my career, either in a long time or it’s up there in the top five,” Williams said.Stosur is a skilled 28-year-old player ranked fifth and rising. She combines a powerful serve with the fitness to chase down about any shot. Stosur rallied on Friday to defeat Venus Williams and was looking to become just the eighth player to beat both Williams sisters in the same tournament.Serena quickly made sure that did not happen. She cracked serves over 100 miles per hour, landed returns in both corners and frustrated Stosur at every turn.Stosur moved up on Williams’s serve, varied her own serves — anything to slow down Williams’s relentless march. Stosur hoped to regroup in the second set, yet Williams’s powerful serves and ground strokes kept coming.“She was way too good today,” Stosur said. “I think she was pretty happy with the way she played.”The hole in Williams’s Hall of Fame resume is clearly on clay. She has won 13 Grand Slam titles, but just one coming at the French Open. Williams has had only one day’s practice on clay since the Sony Ericsson event ended. Still, she says she is sliding better than she has in recent years and is excited about her prospects on clay this year. The Family Circle Cup is a good start to her season on clay, she said. But that is all it is, a start.“I’m trying to play like this at the end of the clay-court season,” she said. “So we’ll see.”BRYANS PUT U.S. AHEAD Bob and Mike Bryan defeated Julien Benneteau and Michael Llodra, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (4), to give the United States a 2-1 lead over France in their Davis Cup quarterfinal.The Bryans, the top-ranked doubles team, have not lost a Davis Cup match since 2008. They were rarely troubled against a French pair that struggled to find any rhythm on the clay at Monte Carlo Country Club in Roquebrune, France.“We were ready for a dogfight,” Bob Bryan said. “I thought we did a great job of not letting the crowd get too loud.”On Sunday, No. 11 John Isner faces sixth-ranked Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France in singles. The teenager Ryan Harrison, ranked 66th, will play No. 13 Gilles Simon.On Saturday, Benneteau and Llodra lost their service games at the start of the first and second sets. Although they showed more fight in the third set, the Bryans did not face a single break point.The United States trailed by 2-1 in the tiebreaker but quickly rallied for a 5-2 lead. Llodra’s long forehand offered match point, which the Americans converted when Benneteau’s backhand down the line sailed out.CZECHS TAKE LEAD Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek won their 10th Davis Cup doubles match for the Czech Republic to take a 2-1 lead over Serbia in their quarterfinal.The Czech pair cruised past Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic, 6-4, 6-2, 7-6 (4), on a red clay indoor court at O2 Arena in Prague to extend their Davis Cup doubles record to 10-1.In Sunday’s reverse singles, Berdych will face Janko Tipsarevic in a matchup of two top-10 players.AUSTRIA HOLDS OFF SPAIN Austria reduced host Spain’s lead to 2-1 by winning the doubles in the Davis Cup quarterfinals.Alexander Peya and Oliver Marach overcame a shaky start after a rain delay to beat Marcel Granollers and Marc López, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (12), on the Marina d’Or clay court.The decisive reverse singles will be Sunday.

"'12-04-08,'0','ICON uses a valuation model that tries to gauge long-term earnings growth, along with risk and near-term earnings prospects. Analyst estimates are weighed against a company’s earnings over time. “We look at earnings forecasts and pit current estimates against historic performance,” he said.He sees the TJX Companies, owner of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, as a potential gainer. ICON estimates that over the next five years, TJX can increase its earnings at a 12 percent annual rate, more than many analysts predict. “The current price of TJX does not fully reflect the intrinsic value of the stock,” he said.As a “bottom up” investor, Mr. Straus focuses on the fundamentals of individual companies rather than on the larger economic picture that unfolds almost daily with new reports on jobs, housing and consumer spending.But economic reports often guide the stock selection of some managers. Jean Park, manager of the Fidelity Select Leisure Portfolio, has noticed a disconnect between pricing at supermarkets and restaurants. “Prices at supermarkets have increased faster than restaurant prices,” Ms. Park said. Restaurants can benefit either by raising prices or by keeping pricing flat while enjoying higher traffic.This food-price disconnect will come as no surprise to supermarket shoppers who have recently been introduced to $4 bread and $5 jars of mayonnaise. Last year, restaurant prices rose by 2.3 percent, on average, compared with 4.8 percent at supermarkets, Mr. Christopher says.Like other Fidelity fund managers, Ms. Park will not discuss individual portfolio holdings. But as of Jan. 31, five of the top nine holdings in Fidelity Select Leisure were restaurant chains, including McDonald’s at No. 2. Others were Chipotle Mexican Grill, Yum Brands, Panera Bread and Darden Restaurants.The fund also favors high-end hotel and lodging chains; it has a large position, for example, in Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide. High-end chains that cater to business travelers are faring better at increasing revenue per available room, an important industry metric. “The business environment is getting better,” Ms. Park said. “More companies are encouraging business travel.”The financial crisis has taken an uneven toll among retailers, a major subsector in consumer cyclicals. Many analysts divide retail stores into three segments, and say that both high- and low-end stores have benefited more than those in the broad middle market.“In the past three or four months, the year-over-year growth rates at luxury stores have far outstripped growth in the middle tier,” Mr. Christopher said. In January, year-over-year sales rose 6.2 percent for luxury outlets and 4.9 percent for discounters. But department stores increased sales by just 2.2 percent, according to recent data from the International Council of Shopping Centers.Peter Dixon, who manages another consumer-discretionary fund, Fidelity Select Retailing, looks for companies that have distinctive brands and can hold the line on pricing even as stressed consumers seek bargains. In times of recovery, weak or strong, “you are still going to have people who sell compelling products,” he said.The fund’s largest positions are in Amazon.com, Lowe’s and Home Depot. The fund also has a large position in Limited Brands, owner of Victoria’s Secret.At least one fund manager who was quick to see the potential in consumer cyclicals last fall is now backing off.That manager, Jerry Jordan of the Jordan Opportunity fund, said he did not think the pessimism last fall was warranted. And he’s not buying into today’s optimism. “Just as things weren’t as bad as people thought six months ago,” he said, “they’re not as good as people think now.”A buyer of hotels and other consumer cyclicals when they were beaten up last fall, he has trimmed his holdings in recent weeks. “I have been raising cash and taking some money off the table,” he said.Though he still holds shares of Starwood, Marriott International and Wyndham Worldwide, he has reduced his positions. Hotels still hold appeal, he said, because new ones “aren’t being built.” But he predicts that many hotels will increase revenue per available room more slowly.IN his view, sentiment, not fundamentals, has ruled the market, making it unduly pessimistic last fall and unduly optimistic now. “The world was at death’s door six months ago. Now everything seems fixed,” he said. But he sees “decelerating global growth” as a risk for many consumer cyclicals.The market often toggles between favoring consumer staples and consumer cyclicals. If conditions worsen and people must buy what they need instead of what they crave, the staples will again find favor. As such, Mr. Jordan has been trimming his positions in cyclicals while stocking up on staples vendors like Colgate-Palmolive and Procter & Gamble.'"

Markets there bottomed almost exactly 10 years ago, he noted, making the returns since then look especially robust.Gonzalo Pangaro, head of the emerging-markets group at T. Rowe Price, also mentioned improvement in leadership in Latin America, and said it extended from government ministries to corporate boardrooms.“Most governments, including the key ones in Brazil and Mexico, have implemented very sensible macroeconomic policies — fiscal prudence, controlling inflation — and public companies tend to be of very good quality,” he said. “The quality of management and protection of minority shareholders are right up there, and growth opportunities are as good as you can find in some of the fast-growing Asian countries.”The healthy increase in profits at Latin American companies has kept valuations reasonable, even as markets have continued to soar. Stocks in Brazil, the region’s dominant market, recently traded at about 10 times earnings, compared with a multiple of about 13 for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in the United States.Good management is crucial for maintaining robust profits, and so are good customers. Fund managers find plenty of those in Latin America, where growing demand for products and services from increasingly well-off people is helping to transform economies and businesses.“Seventy percent of Brazil is middle class or higher, and they’re active consumers,” said William Landers, manager of the BlackRock Latin America fund.Many of investors’ favored stocks in the region are of companies that cater to consumer needs and wants, particularly Brazilian banks and real estate developers. Housing is in short supply in Brazil, portfolio managers say, and a government program in which employers make regular contributions to subsidize employees’ mortgages should keep demand high for homes and financing.Mr. Landers likes Banco Itaú and the home builder PDG Realty, which he credits with having “one of the better managements in the sector.”Mr. Schmidt, meanwhile, holds Itaú and one of its main rivals, Banco Bradesco. Mr. Pangaro casts a third vote for Brazilian banks, especially Itaú, which he called “a very well-run bank with very good profitability.”Jonas Krumplys, manager of the Ivy Asset Strategy New Opportunities fund, holds a broad range of stocks tied to Brazilian real estate, including home builders and developers of shopping malls and warehouses. One company outside Brazil that he expects to benefit from the expansion of the Latin American middle class is Copa Airlines, which is doing brisk business flying passengers between North and South America via its base in Panama.Apart from banks, Mr. Schmidt recommends the brewers Ambev of Brazil and Femsa of Mexico, along with Coca-Cola Femsa, an affiliate of Femsa and Coca-Cola.One sector not on managers’ favored list is telecommunications. Use of cellphones and the Internet is much lower in Latin America than in mature economies, leaving great scope for growth, but managers find too many companies competing to offer services.As for the two Brazilian commodity producers that are the largest contributors to regional stock indexes — the oil company Petrobras and the iron ore mining company CVRD — investors tend to be indifferent. Although Mr. Pangaro considers Petrobras stock as inexpensive, the two stocks are widely seen as vulnerable to a slowdown in global growth.Investment advisers agree that Latin America has made spectacular progress in the last 10 to 20 years and, with exceptions, has recovered from the instability that once plagued the region. They caution, though, that investors may still face challenges in coming months, though of the run-of-the-mill variety that afflict economies and markets everywhere.Inflation has been about 5 percent a year in Brazil. That is nothing like the rates in the 1980s, when they reached percentages in the tens of thousands, but Mr. Landers cited mounting concern that politics, not just economics, would begin to guide decisions by Brazil’s central bank, leading to lax monetary policy.The concern may be justified, given history, but he said he expected inflation — and central bankers — to remain well behaved.The Brazilians “have worked so hard to get where they are,” he said. “If inflation comes back, the whole domestic growth trend starts to go the other way, the middle class loses purchasing power and the domestic growth story is called into question.”Mr. Krumplys is less optimistic that the problem can be sidestepped.“Brazil is probably going to have an inflation problem in the second half of this year,” he predicted.He identified several chronic impediments to long-term progress in Brazil, too, including high tax rates, deficient transportation and other infrastructure and a poor education system.AS worrisome as such developments might be, however, Latin America is on such a roll that having them lurking in investors’ thoughts could prove beneficial — by providing a vital measure of perspective and humility.“The real domestic worry would be hubris, getting too successful and blowing what they made in the past,” Mr. Schmidt said. “That’s what always destroys markets. They get overstretched; they push themselves. They think the rules don’t apply to them and they go for too much growth. That never ends well.”'"
"'12-04-08,'0','The Kalachakra ceremony, an important teaching ritual in Tibetan Buddhism, takes place some winters in Bodh Gaya, the site in the Indian state of Bihar where the Buddha is believed to have attained enlightenment. The Dalai Lama travels there from his home here in the Himalayan hill town of Dharamsala to give teachings, and Tibetans and other Buddhists from around the world attend.Though the Chinese government vilifies the Dalai Lama and calls him a “splittist,” some officials have been willing to quietly allow Tibetans to attend the ceremony, given its religious significance. This year, Chinese officials did not grant passports to many monks who wanted to attend, but they did loosen restrictions in other areas — Tibetans from Yunnan Province reportedly were allowed to attend for the first time. Many Tibetans going to the ceremony often travel with Chinese passports to India through Nepal or fly directly to India, and they avoid explicitly telling Chinese officials that they are planning to attend the Kalachakra. The Tibetan government-in-exile estimated that 8,000 Tibetans from Tibetan areas of China attended this year.It is unclear why Chinese officials allowed large numbers of Tibetan pilgrims to go abroad around the time of the Kalachakra, only to detain them upon their return. The crackdown appears to be part of the growing conflict in Tibetan areas, which in the last year have been the site of the most intense and sustained protests since the 2008 uprising. Most startling are the self-immolations: At least 32 people have set fire to themselves to protest Chinese rule; about two dozen of those have died. Chinese officials have said some of those who attempted self-immolation were mentally unstable or were acting under the Dalai Lama’s direction. The Dalai Lama has denied any involvement.“About the pilgrim returnees, last I heard was they were detained and many put in hotel rooms,” said Lobsang Sangay, the prime minister of the Tibetan government-in-exile. He added that the detainees had been “interrogated regularly,” with questions focusing on what various officials, including himself, the Dalai Lama and the previous prime minister, Samdhong Rinpoche, had said in speeches during the Kalachakra.Human rights organizations and Tibet advocacy groups have put out reports based on information collected through interviews. “This is the first known instance since the late 1970s in which the Chinese authorities have detained laypeople in Tibet in large numbers to force them to undergo re-education,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement. The group said that it was unclear how long the detainees were being held, and that there had been no reports of any of the 700 Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, who attended the Kalachakra being detained.Calls made Friday to the Beijing offices of the United Front Work Department, which helps oversee Tibet policy, and to the border affairs office of the Tibet Autonomous Region went unanswered.Some insight into the hard-line thinking on the Kalachakra may be gleaned from a commentary published on March 28 by China Daily, a state-run English-language newspaper. The commentary, written by Xiao Jie, an assistant researcher at the China Tibetology Research Center in Beijing, said this year’s Kalachakra “was not a political gathering, it was a political show staged by the Dalai Lama and his clique in the name of Tibetan Buddhism.”He added: “The assembly was filled with sermons instigating hatred, terror and extremism, and the self-proclaimed ‘government-in-exile of Tibet’ irresponsibly declared that it admired the spirit of the Tibetan people who committed suicide by self-immolation.”On Tuesday, Radio Free Asia, which is financed by the United States government, reported that a large number of the detainees being held in Lhasa had been released that day, while at least 200 others being held in Lhoka, outside Lhasa, were still in custody.One Tibetan woman living in Dharamsala said in an interview that a relative of hers who had come for the Kalachakra was told by family members in Lhasa that officials wanted all pilgrims to return before Losar, the Tibetan New Year, which fell in late February. The relative rushed back to Lhasa but has not been heard from since and is presumed to be detained.A writer and former employee of the exile government, Bhuchung Sonam, said a friend of his in Dharamsala had discovered that his mother was among those detained. The friend had called his sister in Lhasa to find out how their mother was doing. According to Mr. Bhuchung Sonam, the sister replied: “Mother had a cold and was hospitalized for a while after she came back. She is here for Losar but has to go back for further injections.”The friend later realized that the coded message indicated that their mother had been detained in a guesthouse for interrogation and was being forced to pay the expenses for her stay. The mother was released for Losar but asked to return for further interrogation, Mr. Bhuchung Sonam said.He added, “I think Beijing’s decision to detain those who were returning from India en masse reflects its total paranoia about the ‘Dalai clique’s’ influence.”'"
"'12-04-08,'0','Word of his death initially spread on Twitter, where veterans of the 1989 democracy movement mourned his passing and proposed a rights award in his honor.“No words can express my grief,” wrote Wang Dan, who was imprisoned for four years for his leadership role in the Tiananmen protests. “Fang Lizhi has inspired the ’89 generation and has awakened the people’s yearning for human rights and democracy.”Mr. Fang’s willingness to test the boundaries of his eventual academic discipline, the physics of the universe, seemed foreshadowed even at an early age by his penchant for questioning authority.Born in 1936 to a Hangzhou postal clerk and his wife, Mr. Fang entered the prestigious Beijing University as a youth and excelled in physics. According to a 1988 article in The Atlantic Monthly, he quickly flouted official norms, taking over a founding meeting of the university’s Communist Youth League and urging students to think independently instead of accepting party dogma on proper academic behavior.He joined China’s Institute of Modern Physics after graduating in 1956, only to be expelled from the Communist Party a year later during Mao Zedong’s Anti-Rightist Campaign, a movement against intellectuals and others who were seen to have strayed from Communist principles. His offense was writing an essay criticizing political interference in scientific research.Mr. Fang was considered too valuable to allow party censure to affect his work, and he continued to rise in academia. But when the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, he was again persecuted, first imprisoned and then sent to rural Anhui Province to work with peasants. He carried with him but one book, on astrophysics, and his repeated readings of it led him to change his research focus from fundamental physics to cosmology.Still an outcast, he continued to flout convention. In 1972, Mr. Fang and colleagues at the University of Science and Technology of China in Anhui province published a paper titled “A Solution of the Cosmological Equations in Scalar-Tensor Theory, with Mass and Blackbody Radiation.”“This innocuous-sounding article met with a furious response from leading theoretical circles of the party,” The China Quarterly recounted in a 1990 article. “Fang et al. had broken a longstanding taboo by introducing the Big Bang theory to the Chinese physics world. Insofar as the Big Bang contradicted Engels’s declaration that the universe must be infinite in space and time, Fang’s paper was tantamount to heresy.”Like most of the persecuted, Mr. Fang was rehabilitated after Mao’s death in 1976, and in Deng’s more open China he traveled to conferences abroad, earning a worldwide scientific reputation. But his exposure to foreign political concepts sharpened his doubts about the Communist system, and he began to write and lecture on its shortcomings.During a brief flowering of political openness, he gained a large following in China and abroad for his outspoken criticism of the Communist system. But in January 1987, after he helped organize pro-reform student demonstrations in cities across China, he was again expelled from the party and stripped of his job as vice president of the University of Science and Technology of China.Anger over the demonstrations among Communist Politburo members forced the resignation days later of Hu Yaobang, the reform-minded party general secretary, who had presided over the period of openness. Mr. Hu’s death in April 1989 set off the final round of student protests that ended with the occupation of Tiananmen Square and the subsequent assault on the demonstrators.Freedom did not change Mr. Fang’s disregard for authority. Not long after leaving the American Embassy for the West, he angered his host, James Lilley, the American ambassador to China, by publicly accusing the United States of holding China to a lower human rights standard than it applied to the Soviet Union and its treatment of dissidents. The charge prompted a brisk response from President Bush, who said Mr. Fang’s views were mistaken and outdated.But Mr. Fang consistently reserved his sharpest criticism for his homeland.“Human rights are fundamental privileges that people have from birth, such as the right to think and be educated, the right to marry, and so on. But we Chinese consider those rights dangerous,” he said 26 years ago in a speech to students at Tongji University in Shanghai.“If we are the democratic country we say we are, these rights should be stronger here than elsewhere. But at present they are nothing more than an abstract idea.”'"
"'12-04-08,'0','My wife and I retained a “fertility consultant” to help us find an egg donor who matched some of my wife’s diverse ethnic background, which, as we explained, is part ethnic Hawaiian. After a month of dead ends, we asked the consultant directly whether she had searched any Hawaiian donor agencies. She said no, and that she would not do so in the future. Now she refuses to refund our retainer. Did she behave ethically? NAME WITHHELD, CHICAGOAs a matter of professional ethics, no, the counselor should not have taken you on as clients if you made clear that you were interested in a service she did not intend to provide. That part is simple. The rest of it is anything but.All prospective parents have ideas — fantasies, really, though I don’t mean that disparagingly — about the shapes their families will take. Those ideas shouldn’t be subject to anyone else’s dictates. But they shouldn’t be taken at face value, either. And they certainly shouldn’t be taken as universal.For starters, if your fantasy is a child who resembles your wife, be forewarned that choosing a donor who shares your ethnicity might not get you there. Common ethnicity won’t guarantee a close genetic resemblance; given all the unseen variables, two people who have a common heritage might be further apart genetically than two people who do not. In any case, less than 6 percent of Hawaii’s population identifies itself as “ethnically Hawaiian.” Who knows what the numbers are among the state’s egg donors?Choosing a donor of the same ethnicity wouldn’t guarantee a close physical resemblance, either. As in any other group, one ethnic Hawaiian might look like the world’s most beautiful linebacker; another might look like a homely blade of grass. Your wife’s doppelgänger could be in another state, or even on another continent.'"

"'12-04-09,'0','NEW YORK (AP) — Google Inc. has announced plans to issue a new class of stock to existing shareholders, effectively splitting shares 2 to 1. It’s an unusual approach that reflects a desire by Google’s founders to preserve the company’s long-term interests.Here’s an explanation of the plan:Q. Why is Google doing this?A. Google’s current stock structure concentrates voting power with Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and with Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt. Google is afraid of diluting that power as it issues new shares to employees and to companies that it acquires through stock purchases. Google says there’s no immediate danger of that happening, but it sees no need to wait. “It’s important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term,” Page and Brin wrote in a letter. “It’s just that since we know what we want to do, there’s no reason to delay the decision.”Q. What does this mean for existing shareholders?A. Investors typically have Class A stock now. They will be given an equal number of Class C shares, which won’t have any voting power. The value of the Class A stock will be split between the two, so if the stock is trading at $600 when it happens, a Class A share will be worth $300 and a Class C share will be worth $300. Investors will have twice the number of shares they held before, but the total voting power and stock value won’t change. So if Bob owns 100 shares worth $600 each, he will own 200 shares worth $300 each. Bob will still have 100 votes, and the value of all his shares will still be $60,000. Investors will be free to buy and sell shares in either class independently, and the new class will get its own ticker symbol. If Bob sells his 100 Class C shares, he will have 100 votes through the Class A stock, and the shares will be worth $30,000. But if Bob sells his 100 Class A shares, he will have no vote on the Class C stock worth $30,000.Q. Is this a new strategy for Google?A. No. Since it went public in 2004, Google’s founders have emphasized the need for long-term governance. They believe they need to retain the voting power to do that. The stock structure had been designed from the start to leave power with Page, Brin and Schmidt. Page and Brin argue that Google will be more successful if it concentrates on the long term, even if that means short-term stumbles in meeting Wall Street’s targets for earnings and revenue. The founders note that it took three years for the first phones based on Google’s Android operating system to come out and another three years for the system to reach critical mass. They don’t want investors voting with short-term interests in mind. “These kinds of investments are not for the faint-hearted,” the founders said.Q. So is this a split or a dividend?A. It’s neither in the traditional sense. The stock is effectively being split, as the value of each share will be cut in half. Stock splits allow smaller investors to buy shares, but in this case, the move is driven more by a desire to retain control and less by shareholder pressure. It can be considered a dividend, but instead of getting cash, investors will get stock.A. Existing shareholders must approve the plan at Google’s annual stockholder meeting on June 21. Because Page, Brin and Schmidt control the majority of votes, it’s expected to pass.'"

"'12-04-09,'0','Mr. Rowe is featured in the campaign, along with Niecy Nash, the star of cable series like “Clean House” on Style Network and “Leave It to Niecy” on TLC. Mr. Rowe adds Dirty Jobs to a list of brands he pitches that also includes Caterpillar, Ford, Lee jeans and Viva paper towels.The commercials for the Dirty Jobs line are being created internally at My Dirty Jobs, which has a corporate office in Los Angeles, a sales office in Phoenix and a marketing office in Las Vegas. The Web ads are being handled by Ignite Media Solutions and the public relations duties are being handled by Trent & Company.The co-founders of My Dirty Jobs — Adam Lerner, president, and Christian Darby, executive vice president for product marketing — have extensive experience in the realm of direct response sales for companies like Ronco.“Direct response is about advertising the brand and building awareness,” Mr. Lerner says, “and there’s the benefit of selling some product directly to consumers.”“We plan to touch the customer in every way the customer can be reached,” he adds, citing examples like Facebook, where Walmart has almost 14.4 million likes and “Dirty Jobs” with Mr. Rowe has more than 2.1 million likes.Mr. Rowe says endorsing a line of cleaning products named after his series “wasn’t something I was affirmatively considering” before he was approached by the executives behind My Dirty Jobs. But he recalls an appearance in 2006, at the annual conference of the Association of National Advertisers, with an actor dressed as Mr. Clean.“There was the most recognizable guy in the cleaning category standing next to the dirtiest guy in TV,” Mr. Rowe says.Mr. Rowe says he became open to the idea of doing something in the category that was “authentic to me.”“My honest feeling is that I don’t know how much permission I have to do this” from consumers, Mr. Rowe says.But “somewhere in this weird nexus of social media, brand ubiquity and five minutes of fame, people are still looking for something that feels authentic,” he adds.From that came a concept for the Dirty Jobs products that “dirt is not the enemy,” Mr. Rowe says. Rather, he adds, “Dirt is good.”That sentiment is expressed in the videos that play at the checkouts in Walmart stores, in which Mr. Rowe jokes about how “I can finally say I’ve gotten filthy in all 50 states.”Mr. Rowe extols the Dirty Jobs products in the videos as “not just for people who get dirty, but for people who have to clean up after the people who get dirty.”In a commercial with Ms. Nash, she gives a shout-out to “Mr. ‘Dirty Jobs’ himself, Mike Rowe” in praising the Dirty Jobs stain remover. And in the videos for the Walmart stores, she declares: “Hey, Walmart shoppers, I’m a Walmart girl just like you. Ooh!”Dirty Jobs represents the first product endorsement for Ms. Nash, she says, prompted in part by how much of a fan she is of Mr. Rowe.Before agreeing to pitch Dirty Jobs, “I had to really give it the smell test” she adds, laughing, “and use it, and by that I mean force my children.”Ms. Nash calls herself “a good fit” for endorsing the line because “I am a mom, I am hands-on.”She says she enjoyed working with Mr. Rowe on the campaign and told him, “Baby, we are a TV series waiting to happen.”“His improv is impeccable,” Ms. Nash says. “It was so much fun, it didn’t feel like working.”As for whether she is interested in additional endorsements, Ms. Nash says, “it would depend on what the product is.”When a reporter lists the other brands endorsed by Mr. Rowe like Ford, Lee and Caterpillar, she says: “I can drive. I can wear jeans. You lost me at the tractor.”The decision by Discovery Communications to license the “Dirty Jobs” name for the cleaning products is not the first time the show’s title has been licensed.Is it, however, “the first time we’re doing any cleaning product or household product,” says Elizabeth Bakacs, vice president for licensing at Discovery Communications in Silver Spring, Md.The “Dirty Jobs” series “has been on the air for over seven years now and has great recognizability as a brand,” she adds. “It was really important we find the right partner.” (Discovery Channel, at its upfront presentation last week, announced that the show would return for the 2012-13 season.)It was also important that Mr. Rowe be involved in the Dirty Jobs product line, Ms. Bakacs says, because “the best successes” in licensing “come when we partner with our talent.”She offers as another example “a ‘Cake Boss’ line of products with Buddy Valastro,” who is the dessert king in the title of the series on the TLC channel, which is also part of Discovery Communications.The deal with My Dirty Jobs is multiyear, Ms. Bakacs says, and “a traditional licensing agreement, licensing our mark.” She declines to discuss additional terms.Mr. Rowe says there was some initial discussion of the cleaning products being sold under his name and without the “Dirty Jobs” name.But that did not proceed far because “part of me wanted to be a good scout and not do a big end-run” around Discovery, he says.“I don’t want to be that guy,” he adds. “I didn’t want to be Mr. Clean.”Also, Mr. Rowe says, he is aware that “‘Dirty Jobs’ and Mike have kind of become inseparable.”And there is a value to the “Dirty Jobs” name, he adds.For one thing, “very, very few TV shows have a name that sounds like it could be a product in a retail environment,” Mr. Rowe says.And “Discovery has probably spent $100 million in advertising and marketing support for the show,” he adds, which will help generate awareness for the Dirty Jobs line.Indeed, people have told him, he says, that they feel as if the products have “been on the shelf for 20 years.”Mr. Rowe says he is “not paid as an endorser” by My Dirty Jobs, nor he is an officer in the company.Rather, “I participate in the entity,” he adds, and “I’m in a position where I can say” yes or no to decisions.Hey, it’s Dirty Jobs, but someone’s got to do it.If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.Risks Related to Our Business and IndustryThe market for our software is new and unproven and may not grow.We believe our future success will depend in large part on the growth, if any, in the market for software that provides operational intelligence, particularly software designed to collect and index machine data. We market our software as a targeted solution for specific use cases and as an enterprise solution for machine data. In order to grow our business, we intend to expand the functionality of our product to increase its acceptance and use by the broader market. It is difficult to predict customer adoption and renewal rates, customer demand for our software, the size and growth rate of this market, the entry of competitive products or the success of existing competitive products. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost, performance and perceived value associated with such software. If the market for our software does not achieve widespread adoption or there is a reduction in demand for software in our market caused by a lack of customer acceptance, technological challenges, lack of accessible machine data, competing technologies and products, decreases in corporate spending, weakening economic conditions, or otherwise, it could result in reduced customer orders, early terminations, reduced renewal rates or decreased revenues, any of which would adversely affect our business operations and financial results. You should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter in this new and unproven market.We have a short operating history, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.We have a short operating history, which limits our ability to forecast our future operating results and subjects us to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for and model future growth. We have encountered and will continue to encounter risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in developing industries. If our assumptions regarding these uncertainties, which we use to plan our business, are incorrect or change in reaction to changes in our markets, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations and our business could suffer. Moreover, although we have experienced rapid growth historically, we may not continue to grow as rapidly in the future. Any success that we may experience in the future will depend in large part on our ability to, among other things:If we fail to address the risks and difficulties we face including those described elsewhere in this ""Risk Factors"" section, our business will be adversely affected and our operating results will suffer.Our future operating results may fluctuate significantly, and our recent operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.Our revenues and operating results could vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors, many of which are outside of our control. For example, we typically enter into perpetual license agreements, whereby we generally recognize the license fee portion of the arrangement upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Our customers also have the choice of entering into term licenses for our software, whereby the license fee is recognized ratably over the license term. At the beginning of each quarter, we do not know the ratio between perpetual licenses and term licenses that we will enter into during the quarter. As a result, our operating results could be significantly impacted by unexpected shifts in the ratio between perpetual licenses and term licenses. In addition, the size of our licenses varies greatly, and a single, large perpetual license in a given period could distort our operating results. Comparing our revenues and operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.We may not be able to accurately predict our future revenues or results of operations. In particular, since the beginning of fiscal 2011, more than 70% of the revenues we recognize each quarter has been attributable to sales made in that same quarter with the balance of the revenues being attributable to sales made in prior quarters in which the related revenues were not recognized upfront. As a result, our ability to forecast revenues on a quarterly or longer term basis is extremely limited. We base our current and future expense levels on our operating plans and sales forecasts, and our operating costs are expected to be relatively fixed in the short-term. As a result, we may not be able to reduce our costs sufficiently to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues, and even a small shortfall in revenues could disproportionately and adversely affect our financial results for that quarter.In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this ""Risk Factors"" section, factors that may cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:Many of these factors are outside our control, and the variability and unpredictability of such factors could result in our failing to meet or exceed our financial expectations for a given period. We believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our revenues, operating results and cash flows may not necessarily be indicative of our future performance.If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.Although our business has experienced significant growth, we cannot provide any assurance that our business will continue to grow at the same rate or at all. We have experienced and may continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which has placed and will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. As of January 31, 2012, nearly half of our employees had been with us for less than one year. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees, while maintaining the effectiveness of our business execution and the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. In particular, we intend to continue to make directed and substantial investments to expand our research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative organizations, as well as our international operations.To effectively manage growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures by, among other things:These systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth, ensure uninterrupted operation of key business systems and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to public reporting companies will beimpaired. Additionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our software could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand, operating results and overall business.We have a history of losses, and we may not be profitable in the future.We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception, including net losses of $7.5 million in fiscal 2010, $3.8 million in fiscal 2011 and $11.0 million in fiscal 2012. As a result, we had an accumulated deficit of $54.0 million at January 31, 2012. Because the market for our software is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our operating results. We expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we hire additional personnel, particularly in sales and marketing, expand and improve the effectiveness of our distribution channels, and continue to develop features and applications, or apps, for our software. In addition, as we grow and as we become a newly public company, we will incur additional significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. If our revenues do not increase to offset these increases in our operating expenses, we may not be profitable in future periods. Our historical revenue growth has been inconsistent and should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could slow or our revenues could decline for a number of reasons, including slowing demand for our software, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, or our failure, for any reason, to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities. Any failure by us to sustain or increase profitability on a consistent basis, could cause the value of our common stock to materially decline.Because we derive substantially all of our revenues and cash flows from one software product, failure of this product to satisfy customer demands or to achieve increased market acceptance would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.We derive and expect to continue to derive substantially all of our revenues and cash flows from Splunk Enterprise. As such, the market acceptance of our software is critical to our continued success. Demand for our software is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including continued market acceptance of our software by referenceable accounts for existing and new use cases, the timing of development and release of new products by our competitors, technological change, and growth or contraction in our market. In addition, users of software that provides operational intelligence may seek a cloud-based service and, to date, we have not offered a cloud-based service on a commercial basis. We expect the proliferation of machine data to lead to an increase in the data analysis demands of our customers, and our software may not be able to scale and perform to meet those demands. If we are unable to continue to meet customer demands or to achieve more widespread market acceptance of our software, our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects will be materially and adversely affected.We face intense competition in our markets, and we may be unable to compete effectively for sales opportunities.Although our product targets the new and emerging market for software that provides operational intelligence, we compete against a variety of large software vendors and smaller specialized companies, open source initiatives and custom development efforts, which provide solutions in the specific markets we address. Our principal competitors include:The principal competitive factors in our markets include product features, performance and support, product scalability and flexibility, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership and time to value. Some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. Further, competitors may be able to offer products or functionality similar to ours at a more attractive price than we can by integrating or bundling their software products with their other product offerings. In addition, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on operational intelligence and could directly compete with us. For example, companies may commercialize open source software, such as Hadoop, in a manner that competes with our product or causes potential customers to believe that such product and our software perform the same function. If companies move a greater proportion of their data and computational needs to the cloud, new competitors may emerge which offer services comparable to ours or that are better suited for cloud-based data, and the demand for our product may decrease. Smaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly.In recent years, there have been significant acquisitions and consolidation by and among our actual and potential competitors. We anticipate this trend of consolidation will continue, which will present heightened competitive challenges to our business. In particular, consolidation in our industry increases the likelihood of our competitors offering bundled or integrated products, and we believe that it may increase the competitive pressures we face with respect to our software. If we are unable to differentiate our product from the integrated or bundled products of our competitors, such as by offering enhanced functionality, performance or value, we may see decreased demand for those solutions, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, it is possible that continued industry consolidation may impact customers' perceptions of the viability of smaller or even medium-sized software firms and consequently their willingness to use software solutions from such firms. Similarly, if customers seek to concentrate their software purchases in the product portfolios of a few large providers, we may be at a competitive disadvantage regardless of the performance and features of our software. We believe that in order to remain competitive at the large enterprise level, we will need to develop and expand relationships with resellers and large system integrators that provide a broad range of products and services. If we are unable to compete effectively, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.If customers do not expand their use of our software beyond the current predominant use cases, our ability to grow our business and operating results may be adversely affected.Most of our customers currently use our software to support application management, IT operations, security and compliance functions. Our ability to grow our business depends in part on our ability to persuade current and future customers to expand their use of our software to additional use cases, such as facilities management, supply chain management, business analytics and customer usage analytics. If we fail to achieve market acceptance of our software for these applications, or if a competitor establishes a more widely adopted solution for these applications, our ability to grow our business and operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, as the amount of data indexed by our software for a given customer grows, that customer must agree to higher license fees for our software or limit the amount of data indexed in order to stay within the limits of its existing license. If their fees grow significantly, customers may reactadversely to this pricing model, particularly if they perceive that the value of our software has become eclipsed by such fees or otherwise. If customers react adversely to our pricing model, our ability to grow our business and operating results could be adversely affected.If we do not effectively expand and train our sales force, we may be unable to add new customers or increase sales to our existing customers and our business will be adversely affected.We continue to be substantially dependent on our sales force to obtain new customers and to drive additional use cases among our existing customers. We believe that there is significant competition for sales personnel with the skills and technical knowledge that we require. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining sufficient numbers of sales personnel to support our growth. New hires require significant training and may take significant time before they achieve full productivity. Our recent hires and planned hires may not become productive as quickly as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals in the markets where we do business or plan to do business. In addition, as we continue to grow rapidly, a large percentage of our sales force is new to the company and our product. If we are unable to hire and train sufficient numbers of effective sales personnel, or the sales personnel are not successful in obtaining new customers or increasing sales to our existing customer base, our business will be adversely affected.Our sales cycle is long and unpredictable, particularly with respect to large customers, and our sales efforts require considerable time and expense.Our operating results may fluctuate, in part, because of the resource intensive nature of our sales efforts, the length and variability of the sales cycle of our software offerings and the short-term difficulty in adjusting our operating expenses. Our operating results depend in part on sales to large customers and conversions of users that have downloaded the trial version of our software into paying customers. The length of our sales cycle, from initial evaluation to delivery of and payment for the software, varies substantially from customer to customer. Our sales cycle can extend to more than a year for large customers. It is difficult to predict exactly when, or even if, we will make a sale with a potential customer or if a user that has downloaded the trial version of our software will upgrade to the paid version of our software. As a result, large individual sales have, in some cases, occurred in quarters subsequent to those we anticipated, or have not occurred at all. The loss or delay of one or more large transactions in a quarter could impact our operating results for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is delayed. As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to forecast our revenues accurately in any quarter. Because a substantial portion of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short-term, our operating results will suffer if revenues fall below our expectations in a particular quarter, which could cause the price of our common stock to decline.Our business and growth depend substantially on customers renewing their maintenance agreements with us. Any decline in our customer renewals could adversely affect our future operating results.While most of our software is sold under perpetual license agreements, all of our maintenance and support agreements are sold on a term basis. In addition, we also enter into term license agreements for our software. In order for us to improve our operating results, it is important that our existing customers renew their term licenses, if applicable, and maintenance and support agreements when the initial contract term expires. Our customers have no obligation to renew their term licenses or maintenance and support contracts with us after the initial terms have expired. Our customers' renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their satisfaction or dissatisfaction with our software, our pricing, the effects of economic conditions or reductions in our customers' spending levels. If our customers do not renew their agreements with us or renew on terms less favorable to us, our revenues may decline.Incorrect or improper implementation or use of our software could result in customer dissatisfaction and negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth prospects.Our software is deployed in a wide variety of technology environments. Increasingly, our software has been deployed in large scale, complex technology environments, and we believe our future success will depend on our ability to increase sales of our software for use in such deployments. We often must assist our customers in achieving successful implementations for large, complex deployments. If we or our customers are unable to implement our software successfully, or unable to do so in a timely manner, customer perceptions of our company may be impaired, our reputation and brand may suffer, and customers may choose not to increase their use of our software. In addition, our software imposes server load and index storage requirements for implementation. If our customers do not have the server load capacity or the storage capacity required, they may not be able to effectively implement and use our software and, therefore, may not choose to increase their use of our software.Our customers and third-party partners may need training in the proper use of and the variety of benefits that can be derived from our software to maximize its potential. If our software is not implemented or used correctly or as intended, inadequate performance may result. Because our customers rely on our software and maintenance support to manage a wide range of operations, the incorrect or improper implementation or use of our software, our failure to train customers on how to efficiently and effectively use our software, or our failure to provide maintenance services to our customers, may result in negative publicity or legal claims against us. Also, as we continue to expand our customer base, any failure by us to properly provide these services will likely result in lost opportunities for follow-on sales of our software and services.Our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.In fiscal 2011 and 2012, we derived 21% and 24% of our revenues, respectively, from customers outside the United States, and we are continuing to expand our international operations as part of our growth strategy. We currently have sales personnel and sales and support operations in the United States and certain countries across Europe and Asia. However, our sales organization outside the United States is substantially smaller than our sales organization in the United States, and we rely heavily on resellers for non-U.S. sales. Our ability to convince customers to expand their use of our software or renew their maintenance agreements with us is directly correlated to our direct engagement with the customer. To the extent we are unable to engage with non-U.S. customers effectively with our limited sales force capacity or our indirect sales model, we may be unable to grow sales to existing customers to the same degree we have experienced in the United States.Our international operations subject us to a variety of risks and challenges, including:Any of these risks could adversely affect our international operations, reduce our international revenues or increase our operating costs, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition and growth prospects.In addition, compliance with laws and regulations applicable to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in government requirements as they change from time to time. Failure to comply with these regulations could have adverse effects on our business. In many foreign countries it is common for others to engage in business practices that are prohibited by our internal policies and procedures or U.S. regulations applicable to us. Although we implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and policies, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, contractors, channel partners and agents will comply with these laws and policies. Violations of laws or key control policies by our employees, contractors, channel partners or agents could result in delays in revenue recognition, financial reporting misstatements, fines, penalties, or the prohibition of the importation or exportation of our software and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.We are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international markets or subject us to liability if we violate the controls.Our products are subject to U.S. export controls, and we incorporate encryption technology into certain of our products. These encryption products and the underlying technology may be exported outside of the United States only with the required export authorizations, including by license, a license exception or other appropriate government authorizations, including the filing of an encryption registration. We shipped our encryption products prior to obtaining the required export authorizations. Accordingly, we have not fully complied with applicable encryption controls in the Export Administration Regulations. We have taken a number of actions to prevent such violations from recurring and continue to review and make enhancements to our export compliance procedures that are designed to further strengthen compliance with the laws.Furthermore, U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain products and services to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. While we are taking precautions to prevent our products and services from being shipped to U.S. sanctions targets, we believe that certain of our products that are available at no cost have been downloaded by persons in countries that are the subject of U.S. embargoes. These free downloads were likely made in violation of U.S. export control and sanctions laws. However, we cannot state with certainty that these downloadsconstituted a violation of the relevant laws because the regulatory agencies that administer and enforce the applicable regulations are responsible for determining whether a violation of the regulations has occurred. In March 2012, we filed our Final Voluntary Self Disclosures with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, and the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, concerning these potential violations. At this time, these agencies have not completed their review of these matters.Based upon our internal review, we believe that we have not had any paying customers in countries sanctioned by the U.S. Government, and have instituted procedures, including IP blocking, that are intended to prevent any downloads from being made into sanctioned countries in the future. In addition, we had not been screening our customers against the U.S. Government lists of prohibited persons, including the Treasury Department's List of Specially Designated Nationals and the Commerce Department's List of Denied Persons. Based upon our internal review, we believe that we do not have any paying or non-paying customers on any U.S. Government lists of prohibited persons. We have instituted a process for screening all paying and non-paying customers against U.S. Government lists of prohibited persons going forward.If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in fines or penalties for us and for individuals, including civil penalties of up to $250,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, per violation, and in the event of conviction for a criminal violation, fines of up to $1 million and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers for willful and knowing violations. We cannot predict when OFAC and BIS will complete their reviews or what enforcement action, if any, they will take.We also note that if our channel partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be adversely affected, through reputational harm as well as other negative consequences including government investigations and penalties. We presently incorporate export control compliance requirements in our channel partner agreements. Complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities.In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including import permitting and licensing requirements, and have enacted laws that could limit our ability to distribute our products or could limit our customers' ability to implement our products in those countries. Changes in our products or future changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our products in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our products globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, governments, or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our products by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our products to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our products or limitation on our ability to export or sell our products would likely adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to maintain successful relationships with our channel partners, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.In addition to our direct sales force, we use strategic indirect channel partners, such as distribution partners and resellers, to license and support our software. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of our software through our channel network, particularly in the Europe, Middle East and Africa, or EMEA, and Asia Pacific, or APAC, regions and for sales to government agencies. We expect that sales through channel partners will continue to grow as a portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.Our agreements with our channel partners are generally non-exclusive, meaning our channel partners may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. If our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our software, choose to use greater efforts to market and sell their own products or those of our competitors, or fail to meet the needs of our customers, our ability to grow our business and sell our software may be adversely affected. Our channel partners may cease marketing our software with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty. The loss of a substantial number of our channel partners, our possible inability to replace them, or the failure to recruit additional channel partners could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, sales by channel partners are more likely than direct sales to involve collectibility concerns, in particular sales by our channel partners in developing markets, and accordingly, variations in the mix between revenues attributable to sales by channel partners and revenues attributable to direct sales may result in fluctuations in our operating results.Our ability to achieve revenue growth in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our channel partners, and to help our channel partners enhance their ability to independently sell and deploy our software. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these channel partners, or otherwise develop and expand our indirect distribution channel, our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected.We employ a unique pricing model which subjects us to various challenges that could make it difficult for us to derive expected value from our customers.We charge our customers for their use of our software based on the customers' estimated daily indexing capacity. As the amount of machine data within our customers' organizations grows, we may face pressure from our customers regarding our pricing, which could adversely affect our revenues and operating margins. Furthermore, while our software can measure and limit customer usage, such limitations may be improperly circumvented or otherwise bypassed by certain users. Similarly, we provide our customers with an encrypted key for enabling their use of our software. To the extent that a customer improperly copies and distributes the encrypted key to others or uses the encrypted key to install our software on multiple machines, we may not be able to capture the full value for the use of our software. Our enterprise license is meant for our customers' internal use only. If customers improperly make our software available to their customers, for example, through a cloud or managed service offering, it may cannibalize our end user sales or commoditize our software in the market. Additionally, if a customer that has received a volume discount from us offers our software to its end customers, we may experience price erosion and be unable to capture the appropriate value from those end customers.Our license agreements generally provide that we can audit our customers' use of our software to ensure compliance with the terms of our license agreement. However, a customer may resist or refuse to allow us to audit their usage, in which case we may have to pursue legal recourse to enforce our rights under the license agreement, which would require us to spend money, distract management and potentially adversely affect our relationship with our customers and users.Interruptions or performance problems associated with our technology and infrastructure, and our reliance on SaaS technologies from third parties, may adversely affect our business and operating results.Our continued growth depends in part on the ability of our existing and potential customers to access our website and download our software or encrypted access keys for our software within an acceptable amount of time. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our website simultaneously and denial of service or fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these website performance problems within an acceptable period of time. It may become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our website performance, especially duringpeak usage times and as our software becomes more complex and our user traffic increases. If our website is unavailable or if our users are unable to download our software or encrypted access keys within a reasonable amount of time or at all, our business would be negatively affected. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and apps for our software. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.In addition, we rely heavily on hosted, Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, technologies from third parties in order to operate critical functions of our business, including enterprise resource planning services from NetSuite and customer relationship management services from salesforce.com. If these services become unavailable due to extended outages, interruptions or because they are no longer available on commercially reasonable terms or prices, our expenses could increase, our ability to manage our finances could be interrupted and our processes for managing sales of our software and supporting our customers could be impaired until equivalent services, if available, are identified, obtained and implemented, all of which could adversely affect our business.Our systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Our U.S. corporate offices and certain of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in interruptions, performance problems or failure of our infrastructure.One of our marketing strategies is to offer a trial version of our software, and we may not be able to realize the benefits of this strategy.We offer a trial version of our software to users free of charge as part of our overall strategy of developing the market for software that provides operational intelligence and promoting additional penetration of our software in the markets in which we compete. Some users never convert from the trial version to the paid version of our software. Further, we depend on individuals within an organization who download the trial version of our software being able to convince managers and decision-makers within their organization to convert to a paid version of our software. To the extent that these users do not become or lead to others who become paying customers, we will not realize the intended benefits of this marketing strategy and our ability to grow our revenues will be adversely affected.If customers demand software that provides operational intelligence via a ""Software-as-a-Service"" business model, our business could be adversely affected.Software-as-a-Service, or SaaS, is a model of software deployment in which a software provider typically licenses an application to customers for use as a service on demand through web browser technologies. While we do not currently offer a commercial version of our product through a SaaS model, we are investing in the development of Splunk Storm, our cloud-based service (currently in beta) that provides a subset of our software's capabilities but is tailored for supporting machine data processing in the cloud. A SaaS business model can require a vendor to undertake substantial capital investments and develop related sales and support resources and personnel. In recent years, companies have begun to expect that key software, such as customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning systems, be provided through a SaaS model. If customers were to require that we provide our product via a SaaS deployment, we would need to direct a significant portion of our capital investments to implement this alternative business model, which would negatively affect our gross margins. Even if we make these investments, we may be unsuccessful in implementing a SaaS business model. Moreover, sales of a potential future SaaS offering could cannibalize sales of Splunk Enterprise. In addition, the change to aSaaS model would result in changes in the manner in which we recognize revenues. Changes in revenue recognition would affect our operating results and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our business depends, in part, on sales to the public sector, and significant changes in the contracting or fiscal policies of the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business.We derive a portion of our revenues from contracts with federal, state, local and foreign governments, and we believe that the success and growth of our business will continue to depend on our successful procurement of government contracts. Factors that could impede our ability to maintain or increase the amount of revenues derived from government contracts, include:The occurrence of any of the foregoing could cause governments and governmental agencies to delay or refrain from purchasing our software in the future or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business could cause us to lose customers in the public sector or negatively impact our ability to contract with the public sector.We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts with the public sector, including U.S. federal, state and local governmental bodies, which affect how we and our channel partners do business in connection with governmental agencies. These laws and regulations may impose added costs on our business, and failure to comply with these or other applicable regulations and requirements, including non-compliance in the past, could lead to claims for damages from our channel partners, penalties, termination of contracts, loss of exclusive rights in our intellectual property, and temporary suspension or permanent debarment from government contracting. Any such damages, penalties, disruptions or limitations in our ability to do business with the public sector could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.Because our software is complex, undetected errors, failures or bugs may occur, especially when new versions or updates are released. Our software is often installed and used in large-scale computing environments with different operating systems, system management software, and equipment and networking configurations, which may cause errors or failures of our software or other aspects of the computing environment into which it is deployed. In addition, deployment of our software into complicated, large-scale computing environments may expose undetected errors, failures or bugs in our software. Despite testing by us, errors, failures or bugs may not be found in our software until it is released to our customers. In the past, we have discovered software errors, failures and bugs in some of our offerings after their introduction. Real or perceived errors, failures or bugs in our software could result in negative publicity, loss of or delay in market acceptance of our software, loss of competitive position or claims by customers for losses sustained by them. In such an event, we may be required, or may choose, for customer relations or other reasons, to expend additional resources in order to help correct the problem.In addition, if an actual or perceived failure of our software occurs in a customer's deployment, regardless of whether the failure is attributable to our software, the market perception of the effectiveness of our software could be adversely affected. Alleviating any of these problems could require significant expenditures of our capital and other resources and could cause interruptions, delays or cessation of our licensing, which could cause us to lose existing or potential customers and could adversely affect our operating results and growth prospects.If our new software and software enhancements do not achieve sufficient market acceptance, our results of operations and competitive position will suffer.We spend substantial amounts of time and money to research and develop new and enhanced versions of our existing software to incorporate additional features, improve functionality or other enhancements in order to meet our customers' rapidly evolving demands. In addition, we continue to invest in solutions that can be deployed on top of our core engine to target specific cases and to cultivate our community of application developers and users. When we develop a new or enhanced version of an existing product, we typically incur expenses and expend resources upfront to market, promote and sell the new offering. Therefore, when we develop and introduce new or enhanced products, they must achieve high levels of market acceptance in order to justify the amount of our investment in developing and bringing them to market. For example, if our cloud-based service, Splunk Storm, does not garner widespread market adoption and implementation, our operating results and competitive position could suffer.Further, we may make changes to our software that our customers do not like, find useful or agree with. We may also discontinue certain features, begin to charge for certain features that are currently free or increase fees for any of our features or usage of our software.Our new software or software enhancements and changes to our existing software could fail to attain sufficient market acceptance for many reasons, including:If our new software or enhancements and changes do not achieve adequate acceptance in the market, our competitive position will be impaired, and our revenues will be diminished. The adverse effect on our operating results may be particularly acute because of the significant research, development, marketing, sales and other expenses we will have incurred in connection with the new software or enhancements.If we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our business and operating results may be adversely affected.We believe that maintaining and enhancing the ""Splunk"" brand identity is critical to our relationships with our customers and channel partners and to our ability to attract new customers and channel partners. The successful promotion of our brand will depend largely upon our marketing efforts, our ability to continue to offer high-quality software and our ability to successfully differentiate our software from that of our competitors. Our brand promotion activities may not be successful or yield increased revenues. In addition, independent industry analysts often provide reviews of our product, as well as those of our competitors, and perception of our product in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by thesereviews. If these reviews are negative, or less positive as compared to those of our competitors' products and services, our brand may be adversely affected.Moreover, it may be difficult to maintain and enhance our brand in connection with sales through channel or strategic partners. The promotion of our brand requires us to make substantial expenditures, and we anticipate that the expenditures will increase as our market becomes more competitive, as we expand into new markets and as more sales are generated through our channel partners. To the extent that these activities yield increased revenues, these revenues may not offset the increased expenses we incur. If we do not successfully maintain and enhance our brand, our business may not grow, we may have reduced pricing power relative to competitors with stronger brands, and we could lose customers and channel partners, all of which would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our future performance depends in part on proper use of our community website, Splunkbase, and support from third-party software developers.Our software enables third-party software developers to build apps on top of our machine data engine. We operate a community website that we call Splunkbase for sharing these third party apps, including add-ons and extensions. While we expect Splunkbase to support our sales and marketing efforts, it also presents certain risks to our business, including:Many of these risks are not within our control to prevent, and our brand may be damaged if these apps, add-ons and extensions do not perform to our customers' satisfaction and that dissatisfaction is attributed to us.If poor advice or misinformation is spread through Splunk Answers, users of our software may experience unsatisfactory results from using our software, which could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to grow our business.In addition, as part of Splunkbase, we host a community site called Splunk Answers for sharing knowledge about how to perform certain functions with our software. Our users are increasingly turning to Splunk Answers for support in connection with their use of our software. We do not review or test the information that non-Splunk employees post on Splunk Answers to ensure its accuracy or efficacy in resolving technical issues. Therefore, we cannot ensure that all the information listed on Splunk Answers is accurate or that it will not adversely affect the performance of our software. Furthermore, users who post such information on Splunk Answers may not have adequate rights to the information to share it publicly, and we could be the subject of intellectual property claims based on our hosting of such information. If poor advice or misinformation is spread among users of Splunk Answers, our customers or other users ofour software may experience unsatisfactory results from using our software, which could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to grow our business.Failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our business.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect proprietary methods and technologies that we develop under patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States, so that we can prevent others from using our inventions and proprietary information. If we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors might gain access to our technology, and our business might be adversely affected. However, defending our intellectual property rights might entail significant expenses. Any of our patent rights, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. As of March 31, 2012, we had two issued U.S. patents covering our machine data technology. We also had one provisional patent application pending and eleven utility patent applications pending for examination in the United States. Finally, we also had six utility patent applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and eight pending Patent Cooperation Treaty utility patent applications, all of which are counterparts of our U.S. utility patent applications. Our issued patent, and any patents issued in the future, may not provide us with any competitive advantages or may be challenged by third parties, and our patent applications may never be granted. Additionally, the process of obtaining patent protection is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that these patents will adequately protect our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain.Any patents that are issued may subsequently be invalidated or otherwise limited, allowing other companies to develop offerings that compete with ours, which could adversely affect our competitive business position, business prospects and financial condition. In addition, issuance of a patent does not guarantee that we have a right to practice the patented invention. Patent applications in the United States are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all, and publications of discoveries in industry-related literature lag behind actual discoveries. We cannot be certain that we were the first to use the inventions claimed in our issued patents or pending patent applications or otherwise used in our software, that we were the first to file for protection in our patent applications, or that third parties do not have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from marketing or practicing our patented software or technology. Effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available to us in every country in which our software is available. The laws of some foreign countries may not be as protective of intellectual property rights as those in the United States (in particular, some foreign jurisdictions do not permit patent protection for software), and mechanisms for enforcement of intellectual property rights may be inadequate. Additional uncertainty may result from changes to intellectual property legislation enacted in the United States (including the recent ""America Invents Act"") and other national governments and from interpretations of the intellectual property laws of the United States and other countries by applicable courts and agencies. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may be unable to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property.We rely in part on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and other confidential information to maintain our competitive position. Although we endeavor to enter into non-disclosure agreements with our employees, licensees and others who may have access to this information, we cannot assure you that these agreements or other steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use, disclosure or reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, third parties may independently develop technologies or products that compete with ours, and we may be unable to prevent this competition.We might be required to spend significant resources to monitor and protect our intellectual property rights. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights orto establish the validity of our proprietary rights. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially viable. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We have been, and may in the future be, subject to intellectual property rights claims by third parties, which are extremely costly to defend, could require us to pay significant damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies.Companies in the software and technology industries, including some of our current and potential competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, many of these companies have the capability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. The litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners that have no relevant product revenues and against which our patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. We have received, and may in the future receive, notices that claim we have misappropriated, misused, or infringed other parties' intellectual property rights, and, to the extent we gain greater market visibility, we face a higher risk of being the subject of intellectual property infringement claims, which is not uncommon with respect to the enterprise software market. In this regard, we recently settled a dispute with respect to the Splunk trademark in the European Union. There may be third-party intellectual property rights, including issued or pending patents, that cover significant aspects of our technologies or business methods. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be very time-consuming, could be expensive to settle or litigate and could divert our management's attention and other resources. These claims could also subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights. These claims could also result in our having to stop using technology found to be in violation of a third party's rights. We might be required to seek a license for the intellectual property, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. Even if a license were available, we could be required to pay significant royalties, which would increase our operating expenses. As a result, we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. If we cannot license or develop technology for any infringing aspect of our business, we would be forced to limit or stop sales of our software and may be unable to compete effectively. Any of these results would adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our use of ""open source"" software could negatively affect our ability to sell our software and subject us to possible litigation.We use open source software in our software and expect to continue to use open source software in the future. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of, or seeking to enforce the terms of, an open source license, including by demanding release of the open source software, derivative works or our proprietary source code that was developed using such software. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our software, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if the license terms for the open source code change, we may be forced to re-engineer our software or incur additional costs. Finally, we cannot assure you that we have not incorporated additional open source software in our software in a manner that is inconsistent with our current policies and procedures.If our security measures are breached or unauthorized access to customer data is otherwise obtained, our software may be perceived as not being secure, customers may reduce the use of or stop using our software, and we may incur significant liabilities.Our software involves the storage and transmission of data, and security breaches could result in the loss of this information, litigation, indemnity obligations and other liability. While we have taken steps to protect the confidential information that we have access to, including confidential information we may obtain through our customer support services or customer usage of Splunk Storm, our cloud-based service currently in beta, we do not have the ability to monitor or review the content that our customers store, and therefore, we have no direct control over the substance of the content. Therefore, if customers use our software for the transmission or storage of personally identifiable information and our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer, and we could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not identified until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any or all of these issues could negatively impact our ability to attract new customers and increase engagement by existing customers, cause existing customers to elect to not renew their subscriptions, or subject us to third-party lawsuits, regulatory fines or other action or liability, thereby adversely affecting our operating results.Because our software could be used to collect and store personal information, domestic and international privacy concerns could result in additional costs and liabilities to us or inhibit sales of our software.Personal privacy has become a significant issue in the United States and in many other countries where we offer our software. The regulatory framework for privacy issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Many federal, state and foreign government bodies and agencies have adopted or are considering adopting laws and regulations regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. In the United States, these include rules and regulations promulgated under the authority of the Federal Trade Commission, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996 and state breach notification laws. Internationally, virtually every jurisdiction in which we operate has established its own data security and privacy legal framework with which we or our customers must comply, including the Data Protection Directive established in the European Union and the Federal Data Protection Act recently implemented in Germany.In addition to government regulation, privacy advocates and industry groups may propose new and different self-regulatory standards that either legally or contractually apply to us. Because the interpretation and application of privacy and data protection laws are still uncertain, it is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our existing data management practices or the features of our software. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, lawsuits and other claims, we could be required to fundamentally change our business activities and practices or modify our software, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy or data protection laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business.Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to the businesses of our customers may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our software. Privacy concerns, whether valid or not valid, may inhibit market adoption of our software particularly in certain industries and foreign countries.Federal, state and industry regulations as well as self-regulation related to privacy and data security concerns pose the threat of lawsuits and other liability.We may collect and utilize demographic and other information, including personally identifiable information, from and about users (such as customers, potential customers, and others) as they interact with Splunk over the internet and otherwise provide us with information whether via our website, through email, or through other means. Users may provide personal information to us in many contexts such as when signing up for certain services, registering for seminars, participating in a survey, when answering questions on Splunk Answers, when posting reviews or otherwise commenting on Splunk apps, when using other community or social networking features, when participating in polls or when signing up to receive e-mail newsletters.Within the United States, various federal and state laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of the data we receive from and about users. Outside of the United States, various jurisdictions actively regulate and enforce laws regarding the collection, retention, transfer, and use (including loss and unauthorized access) of personal information. Privacy advocates and government bodies have increasingly scrutinized the ways in which companies link personal identities and data associated with particular users or devices with data collected through the internet, and we expect such scrutiny to continue to increase. Loss, retention or misuse of certain information and alleged violations of laws and regulations relating to privacy and data security, and any relevant claims, may expose us to potential liability and may require us to expend significant resources on data security and in responding to and defending such allegations and claims.If we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be adversely affected.We depend on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key personnel, the loss of whom could adversely affect our business. All of our executive officers and key employees are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time. We do not maintain a key-person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees.Our future success also depends on our ability to identify, attract and retain highly skilled technical, managerial, finance and other personnel, particularly in our sales and marketing, research and development, general and administrative, and professional service departments. We face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous software and other technology companies. In addition, competition for qualified personnel, particularly software engineers, is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located. We may incur significant costs to attract and retain them, and we may lose new employees to our competitors or other technology companies before we realize the benefit of our investment in recruiting and training them. As we move into new geographies, we will need to attract and recruit skilled personnel in those areas. If we are unable to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing technical, operational and managerial requirements, on a timely basis or at all, our business will be adversely affected.Volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain our key employees. Many of our senior management personnel and other key employees have become, or will soon become, vested in a substantial amount of stock or stock options. Employees may be more likely to leave us if the shares they own or the shares underlying their vested options have significantly appreciated in value relative to the original purchase prices of the shares or the exercise prices of the options, or, conversely, if the exercise prices of the options that they hold are significantly above the market price of our common stock. If we are unable to retain our employees, or if we need to increase our compensation expenses to retain our employees, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would be adversely affected.Prolonged economic uncertainties or downturns could materially adversely affect our business.Current or future economic downturns could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economy both in the United States and abroad, including conditions resulting from financial and credit market fluctuations and terrorist attacks on the United States, Europe, Asia Pacific or elsewhere, could cause a decrease in corporate spending on enterprise software in general and negatively affect the rate of growth of our business.General worldwide economic conditions have experienced a significant downturn and continue to remain unstable. These conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to forecast and plan future business activities accurately, and they could cause our customers to reevaluate their decision to purchase our product, which could delay and lengthen our sales cycles or result in cancellations of planned purchases. Furthermore, during challenging economic times our customers may face issues in gaining timely access to sufficient credit, which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, which would adversely affect our financial results.We have a significant number of customers in the business services, financial services, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, high technology, manufacturing, media and entertainment, online services, retail, telecommunications and travel and transportation industries. A substantial downturn in any of these industries may cause firms to react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on information technology. Customers in these industries may delay or cancel information technology projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. To the extent purchases of our software are perceived by customers and potential customers to be discretionary, our revenues may be disproportionately affected by delays or reductions in general information technology spending. Also, customers may choose to develop in-house software as an alternative to using our products. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our software.We cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown, instability or recovery, generally or within any particular industry. If the economic conditions of the general economy or industries in which we operate worsen from present levels, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features or enhance our software, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing that we may secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be adversely affected.Future acquisitions could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may choose to expand by making acquisitions that could be material to our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our ability as an organization to successfully acquire and integrate technologies or businesses is unproven. Acquisitions involve many risks, including the following:The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.If currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, the results of our operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected.As we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our sales contracts are denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore substantially all of our revenues are not subject to foreign currency risk. However, a strengthening of the U.S. dollar could increase the real cost of our software to our customers outside of the United States, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-U.S. locations in the local currency. Fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies could result in the dollar equivalent of such expenses being higher. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies, and any such strategies, such as forward contracts, options and foreign exchange swaps related to transaction exposures that we may implement to mitigate this risk may not eliminate our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.The enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other tax reform policies could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.Recent changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to U.S. tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings. Due to expansion of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Our ability to use our net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.In general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, a corporation that undergoes an ""ownership change"" is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our existing NOLs may be subject to limitations arising from previous ownership changes, and if we undergo an ownership change in connection with or after this offering, our ability to utilize NOLs could be further limited by Section 382 of the Code. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Code. Furthermore, our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we attain profitability.Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we should have collected or in the future should collect sales and use, value added or similar taxes, and we could be subject to liability with respect to past or future sales, which could adversely affect our results of operations.We do not collect sales and use, value added and similar taxes in all jurisdictions in which we have sales, based on our belief that such taxes are not applicable. Sales and use, value added and similar tax laws and rates vary greatly by jurisdiction. Certain jurisdictions in which we do not collect such taxes may assert that such taxes are applicable, which could result in tax assessments, penalties and interest, and we may be required to collect such taxes in the future. Such tax assessments, penalties and interest or future requirements may adversely affect our results of operations.Our international operations subject us to potentially adverse tax consequences.We generally conduct our international operations through wholly owned subsidiaries and report our taxable income in various jurisdictions worldwide based upon our business operations in those jurisdictions. We are in the process of organizing our corporate structure to more closely align with the international nature of our business activities. Our intercompany relationships are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations administered by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions. The relevant taxing authorities may disagree with our determinations as to the income and expenses attributable to specific jurisdictions. If such a disagreement were to occur, and our position were not sustained, we could be required to pay additional taxes, interest and penalties, which could result in one-time tax charges, higher effective tax rates, reduced cash flows and lower overall profitability of our operations. We believe that our financial statements reflect adequate reserves to cover such a contingency, but there can be no assurances in that regard.We could be subject to additional tax liabilities.We are subject to federal, state and local taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and our worldwide provisionfor taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many activities and transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We recently discovered that we have not complied with various tax rules and regulations in certain foreign jurisdictions. We are working to resolve these matters. In addition, our tax obligations and effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, principles and interpretations, including those relating to income tax nexus, by our earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. We may be audited in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional taxes against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of any tax audits or litigation could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which a determination is made.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock and this OfferingThere has been no prior market for our common stock and an active market may not develop or be sustained and investors may not be able to resell their shares at or above the initial public offering price.There has been no public market for our common stock prior to this offering. The initial public offering price for our common stock will be determined through negotiations between the underwriters and us and may vary from the market price of our common stock following this offering. If you purchase shares of our common stock in this offering, you may not be able to resell those shares at or above the initial public offering price. An active or liquid market in our common stock may not develop upon completion of this offering or, if it does develop, it may not be sustainable.Our stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance resulting in substantial losses for investors purchasing shares in this offering.The trading prices of the securities of technology companies have been highly volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including:In addition, the stock markets, and in particular the market on which our common stock will be listed, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies. Stock prices of many technology companies have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.The trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.We may invest or spend the proceeds of this offering in ways with which you may not agree or in ways which may not yield a return.We expect to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, product development, and general and administrative matters. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. We do not have any agreements or commitments for any acquisitions at this time. Our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds, and you will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not increase the value of our business, which could cause our stock price to decline.Substantial future sales of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.The market price of shares of our common stock could decline as a result of substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders, a large number of shares of our common stock becoming available for sale or the perception in the market that holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares. After this offering, we will have outstanding 92,529,879 shares of our common stock, based on the number of shares outstanding as of January 31, 2012. This includes the shares included in this offering, which may be resold in the public market immediately. The remaining 79,029,879 shares are currently restricted as a result of market stand-off agreements. In addition, certain of these shares are also subject to lock-up agreements, as more fully described in ""Underwriters.""After this offering, the holders of an aggregate of 66,986,549 shares of our common stock as of January 31, 2012 will have rights, subject to some conditions, to require us to file registration statements covering their shares or to include their shares in registration statements that we may file for ourselves or our stockholders. Substantially all of these shares are subject to lock-up agreements restricting their sale for 180 days after the date of this prospectus, subject to potential extension in the event we release earnings results or a material event relating to us occurs near the end of the lock-up period. We also intend to register shares of common stock that we may issue under our employee equity incentive plans. Once we register these shares, they will be able to be sold freely in the public market upon issuance, subject to existing market stand-off and/or lock-up agreements. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC may, in its sole discretion, permit our officers, directors, employees and current stockholders who are subject to the180-day contractual lock-up to sell shares prior to the expiration of the lock-up agreements. The 180-day lock-up period is subject to extension in some circumstances.Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the book value of their investment.The initial public offering price per share will be substantially higher than the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our common stock outstanding prior to this offering. As a result, investors purchasing common stock in this offering will experience immediate dilution of $7.91 per share. This dilution is due in large part to the fact that our earlier investors paid substantially less than the initial public offering price when they purchased their shares of common stock. In addition, we have issued options to acquire common stock at prices significantly below the initial public offering price. To the extent outstanding options are ultimately exercised, there will be further dilution to investors in this offering. In addition, if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares from us or if we issue additional equity securities, you will experience additional dilution.The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management's attention and affect our ability to attract and retain executive management and qualified board members.As a public company, we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management's attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire more employees in the future or engage outside consultants, which will increase our costs and expenses.In addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to their application and practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be adversely affected.We also expect that being a public company and these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.As a result of disclosure of information in this prospectus and in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible, which we believe may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors and other third parties. If such claims are successful, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor, these claims, and the time and resources necessary to resolve them, could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business and operating results.As a result of becoming a public company, we will be obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.We may be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the SarbanesOxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year beginning after the effective date of this offering. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our independent registered public accounting firm has issued an opinion on our internal control over financial reporting.We are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective.If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline, and we may be subject to investigation or sanctions by the SEC.We do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our common stock.Provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as amended and restated in connection with this offering, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any ""interested"" stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an ""interested"" stockholder.Our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders will continue to have substantial control over us after this offering and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control.After this offering, our directors, executive officers and holders of more than 5% of our common stock, together with their affiliates, will beneficially own, in the aggregate, 74.3% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, these stockholders, acting together, would have the ability to control the management and affairs of our company. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership might adversely affect the market price of our common stock by:This prospectus contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. The forward-looking statements are contained principally in ""Prospectus Summary,"" ""Risk Factors,"" ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" ""Business"" and ""Compensation Discussion and Analysis."" Forward-looking statements include information concerning:Forward-looking statements include all statements that are not historical facts and can be identified by terms such as ""anticipates,"" ""believes,"" ""could,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" ""expects,"" ""intends,"" ""may,"" ""plans,"" ""potential,"" ""predicts, ""projects,"" ""should,"" ""will,"" ""would"" or similar expressions and the negatives of those terms.Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. We discuss these risks in greater detail in ""Risk Factors"" and elsewhere in this prospectus. Given these uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. Also, forward-looking statements represent our management's beliefs and assumptions only as of the date of this prospectus. You should read this prospectus and the documents that we have filed as exhibits to the registration statement, of which this prospectus is a part, completely and with the understanding that our actual future results may be materially different from what we expect.Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.You should rely only on the information contained in this prospectus or contained in any free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of us. Neither we, the selling stockholders nor the underwriters have authorized anyone to provide you with information different from, or in addition to, that contained in this prospectus or any related free writing prospectus. We, the selling stockholders and the underwriters are offering to sell, and seeking offers to buy, shares of our common stock only in jurisdictions where offers and sales are permitted. The information contained in this prospectus is current only as of its date, regardless of its delivery. Our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may have changed since that date.This prospectus also contains estimates and other information concerning our industry, including market size and growth rates, that are based on industry publications, surveys and forecasts, including those generated by IDC and Gartner. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations. The industry in which we operate is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to variety of factors, including those described in ""Risk Factors."" These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in these publications.We estimate that the net proceeds from our sale of 12,507,278 shares of common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the front cover of this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $100.7 million, or $117.7 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price would increase (decrease) the net proceeds to us from this offering by $11.6 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the front cover of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders.The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public market for our common stock. As of the date of this prospectus, we have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering. However, we currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and marketing activities, product development, general and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements to make any acquisitions or investments. We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation of our business and do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Our loan and security agreement restricts our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock and we may also enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to declare dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on our financial condition, operating results, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.The following table sets forth our cash and cash equivalents and capitalization as of January 31, 2012 on:The information below is illustrative only, and our capitalization following the completion of this offering will be adjusted based on the actual initial public offering price and other terms of this offering determined at pricing as well as our actual expenses. You should read this table together with ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and our financial statements and the related notes appearing elsewhere in this prospectus.The number of shares of our common stock to be outstanding after this offering is based on 80,022,601 shares of our common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2012, which excludes:If you invest in our common stock, your interest will be diluted to the extent of the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of shares of common stock in this initial public offering and the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share of common stock immediately after this offering.As of January 31, 2012, our pro forma net tangible negative book value was approximately $0.3 million, or $0.00 per share of common stock. Net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets less our total liabilities, divided by the shares of common stock outstanding as of January 31, 2012, assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock and Series C preferred stock warrants into common stock.After giving effect to our sale of shares of common stock in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the front cover of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of January 31, 2012 would have been $100.4 million, or $1.09 per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value of $1.09 per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $7.91 per share to new investors purchasing shares in this offering.The following table illustrates this dilution:A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the front cover of this prospectus, would increase (decrease) our pro forma net tangible book value, as adjusted to give effect to this offering, by $0.13 per share and the dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share to new investors in this offering by $0.87 per share, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the front cover of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.The following table summarizes, on a pro forma as adjusted basis as of January 31, 2012, assuming the conversion of all outstanding shares of our convertible preferred stock into common stock, the total number of shares of common stock purchased from us, the total consideration paid to us, and the average price per share paid to us by existing stockholders and by new investors purchasing shares in this offering at the initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, the midpoint of the price range set forth on the front cover of this prospectus, before deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses:Sales of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders in this offering will reduce the number of shares of common stock held by existing stockholders to 79,029,879, or approximately 85.4% of the total shares of common stock outstanding after this offering, and will increase the number of shares held by new investors to 13,500,000, or approximately 14.6% of the total shares of common stock outstanding after this offering.If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, sales by us in this offering will reduce the percentage of shares held by existing stockholders to 83.6% and will increase the number of shares held by our new investors to 15,525,000, or 16.4%.To the extent that any outstanding options are exercised, new investors will experience further dilution. In addition, we may grant more options or warrants in the future.The following selected consolidated financial data should be read together with our financial statements and accompanying notes and ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. The selected financial data in this section is not intended to replace our financial statements and the related notes. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of our future results.We derived the consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of January 31, 2011 and 2012 from our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus. The consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2009 and the consolidated balance sheet data as of January 31, 2009 and 2010 are derived from our audited consolidated financial statements, which are not included in this prospectus. The consolidated statements of operations data for fiscal 2008, and the consolidated balance sheet data as of January 31, 2008 are derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements, which are not included in this prospectus.We believe that the use of non-GAAP operating loss is helpful for an investor to determine whether to invest in our common stock. In computing non-GAAP operating loss, we exclude stock-based compensation expense which represents non-cash charges for the fair value of stock options and other non-cash awards granted to employees. Because of varying available valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of equity instruments that can impact a company's non-cash operating expenses, we believe that providing a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes stock-based compensation expense allows for meaningful comparisons between our core business operating results and those of other companies, as well as providing us with an important tool for financial and operational decision making and for evaluating our own core business operating results over different periods of time.Our non-GAAP operating loss may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to non-recurring, unusual items. Our non-GAAP operating loss is not a measurement of financial performance under GAAP, and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or as an indication of operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with GAAP. We do not consider non-GAAP operating loss to be a substitute for, or superior to, the information provided by GAAP financial results.The following table reflects the reconciliation of GAAP operating loss to non-GAAP operating loss.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under ""Risk Factors"" or in other parts of this prospectus. The last day of our fiscal year is January 31. Our fiscal quarters end on April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31.Splunk provides an innovative software platform that enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data. Our software collects and indexes data at massive scale, regardless of format or source, and enables users to quickly and easily search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real-time. Our software is designed to help users in various roles, including IT and business professionals, quickly analyze machine data and realize real-time visibility into and intelligence about their organization's operations.We believe the market for software that provides operational intelligence presents a substantial opportunity as data grows in volume and diversity, creating new risks, opportunities and challenges for organizations. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial amount of resources developing our products and technology to address this market, specifically with respect to machine data.Our software architecture is designed to accelerate adoption and return-on-investment for our customers. It does not require customization, long deployment cycles or extensive professional services commonly associated with traditional enterprise software applications. Users can simply download and install the software, typically in a matter of hours, connect to their relevant machine data sources and begin realizing operational intelligence. We also offer customers with complex IT infrastructure the ability to leverage the expertise of our professional services organization to deploy our software. We base our license fees on the estimated daily data indexing capacity our customers require. Prospective customers can download a trial version of our software that provides a full set of features but limited data indexing capacity. Following the 60-day trial period, prospective customers can purchase a license for our product or continue using our product with reduced features and limited data indexing capacity.While we believe that there is a significant market opportunity for software that provides operational intelligence, this market is largely new and unproven. As a result, we often must educate prospective customers about the value of our products, which can result in lengthy sales cycles, particularly for larger prospective customers, as well as the incurrence of significant marketing expenses. Prospective customers may view purchases of our software as discretionary when compared to more traditional IT applications, and as a result, our sales may be adversely affected by downturns in general economic conditions more quickly and dramatically than other software providers. In addition, we primarily license our software under perpetual licenses whereby we generally recognize the license fee portion of these arrangements upfront. As a result, the timing of when we enter into large perpetual licenses may lead to fluctuations in our revenues and operating results because our expenses are largely fixed in the short-term.We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested and expect to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling features, address customer needs and enable solutions that can address new end markets. In addition, we expect to continue to aggressively expand our sales and marketing organizations to market our software both in the United States and internationally. As a result, we do not expect to be profitable in the near future. We also intend to increase our investment in capital expenditures in future periods.We were incorporated in California in 2003 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2006. From 2003 until 2005, our activities were focused on research and development that resulted in the commercial release ofour software in 2005. Since then, we have opened sales and marketing offices in Hong Kong, Germany, Singapore and the United Kingdom. For fiscal 2012, 24% of our revenues were derived from customers located outside the United States. Our customers represent a wide variety of industries, including financial services, manufacturing, retail and technology, among others. As of January 31, 2012, we had over 3,700 customers, including a majority of the Fortune 100. Some of our largest customers include Autodesk, Bank of America, Comcast, Etsy, Harvard University, Viacom and Zynga.For fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, our revenues were $35.0 million, $66.2 million and $121.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 89% for fiscal 2011 and 83% for fiscal 2012, and our net loss was $7.5 million, $3.8 million and $11.0 million, respectively.License revenues reflect the revenues recognized from sales of licenses to new customers and additional licenses to existing customers. We are focused on acquiring new customers and increasing revenues from our existing customers as they realize the value of our software by indexing higher volumes of machine data and expanding the use of our software through additional use cases and broader deployment within their organizations. A substantial majority of our license revenues consists of revenues from perpetual licenses, under which we generally recognize the license fee portion of the arrangement upfront, assuming all revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. Customers can also purchase term license agreements, under which we recognize the license fee ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the term of the license. Due to the differing revenue recognition policies applicable to perpetual and term licenses, shifts in the mix between perpetual and term licenses from quarter to quarter could produce substantial variation in revenues recognized even if our sales remain consistent. In addition, seasonal trends that contribute to increased sales activity in the fourth fiscal quarter often result in lower sequential revenue in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue. For further discussion of seasonality, cyclicality and quarterly trends, as well as the impact on our margins and results, see ""Quarterly Results of OperationsSeasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Trends."" Comparing our revenues on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful, and you should not rely on our past results as an indication of our future performance.Maintenance and services revenues consist of revenues from maintenance agreements and, to a lesser extent, professional services and training. Typically, when purchasing a perpetual license, a customer also purchases one year of maintenance service for which we charge a percentage of the license fee. When a term license is purchased, maintenance service is typically bundled with the license for the term of the license period. Customers with maintenance agreements are entitled to receive support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they become available during the maintenance period. We recognize the revenues associated with maintenance agreements ratably, on a straight-line basis, over the associated maintenance period. In arrangements involving a term license, we recognize both the license and maintenance revenues over the license period. We have a professional services organization focused on helping some of our largest customers deploy our software in highly complex operational environments and train their personnel. We recognize the revenues associated with these professional services on a time and materials basis as we deliver the services or provide the training.Professional services and training revenues as a percentage of total revenues were 6% for fiscal 2012. We have experienced continued growth in our professional services revenues primarily due to the deployment of our software with some customers that have large, highly complex IT environments.We expect maintenance and services revenues to become a larger portion of our total revenues as our installed customer base grows.Cost of license revenues includes all direct costs to deliver our product, including salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, allocated overhead for facilities and IT, and amortization of acquired intangible assets. We recognize these expenses as they are incurred.Cost of maintenance and services revenues includes salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation for our maintenance and services organization, allocated overhead for facilities and IT, and consulting services. We recognize expenses related to our maintenance and services organization as they are incurred.Our operating expenses are classified into three categories: research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. For each category, the largest component is personnel costs, which includes salaries, employee benefit costs, bonuses, commissions as applicable, and stock-based compensation. Operating expenses also include allocated overhead costs for depreciation of equipment, facilities and IT. Allocated costs for facilities consist of leasehold improvements and rent. Our allocated costs for IT include costs for compensation of our IT personnel and costs associated with our IT infrastructure. Operating expenses are generally recognized as incurred.Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility-related costs attributable to our research and development personnel. We have devoted our product development efforts primarily to enhancing the functionality and expanding the capabilities of our software. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to increase as we increase our research and development headcount to further strengthen and enhance our software and invest in the development of our solutions and apps.Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility-related costs for our sales, marketing and business development personnel, commissions earned by our sales personnel, and the cost of marketing and business development programs. We expect that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase as we continue to hire additional personnel and invest in marketing programs.General and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and facility-related costs for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and administrative personnel, legal, accounting and other professional services fees, and other corporate expenses. We have recently incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional expenses as we grow our operations and prepare to operate as a public company, including higher legal, corporate insurance and accounting expenses, and the additional costs of achieving and maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations. We also expect that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we expand our operations, including internationally.Other income (expense), net consists primarily of the changes in the fair value of our preferred stock warrants, interest expense on our outstanding debt and interest income on our cash balances.Provision for income taxes consists of state and foreign income taxes. Because we have generated net losses, we have fully reserved for any potential future benefits for loss carryforwards and research and development and other tax credits.The following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our total revenues for those periods. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of financial results to be achieved in future periods.Total revenues increased $54.7 million primarily due to growth in license revenues. The increase in license revenues was primarily driven by increases in our total number of customers, sales to existing customers and an increase in the number of larger orders. For example, we had 151 and 282 orders greater than $100,000 in fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively. Our total number of customers increased from approximately 2,300 in fiscal 2011 to approximately 3,700 in fiscal 2012. The increase in maintenance and services revenues was due to increases in sales of maintenance agreements resulting from the growth of our installed customer base as well as sales of our professional services. We also experienced an increase in the proportion of our total revenues derived from customers outside the United States, which represented 21% and 24% of our total revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively.Total revenues increased $31.2 million, or 89.3%, primarily due to the increase in license revenues. The increase in license revenues of $22.7 million was primarily driven by increases in our total number of customers, sales to existing customers and an increase in the number of larger orders. For example, we had 151 orders greater than $100,000 in fiscal 2011 compared to 72 orders in fiscal 2010. Our total number of customers increased to approximately 2,300 in fiscal 2011 from approximately 1,400 in fiscal 2010. The increase in maintenance and services revenues of $8.5 million was primarily due to increases in sales of maintenance agreements resulting from the growth of our installed customer base. We also experienced an increase in the proportion of our total revenues derived from customers outside the United States, which represented 19% and 21% of our total revenues in fiscal 2010 and 2011, respectively.Total cost of revenues increased $4.9 million primarily due to the increase in cost of maintenance and services revenues. The increase in cost of maintenance and services revenues of $4.3 million was primarily related to an increase of $2.1 million in salaries and benefits expense due to increased headcount, $1.3 million related to professional services expense and $0.7 million related to facilities and other overhead costs. Total gross margin was flat, although maintenance and services gross margin increased 6.6 percentage points due to increased leverage resulting from the increase in maintenance and services revenues as well as an increase in maintenance revenues as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenues.Total cost of revenues increased $3.4 million primarily due to the increase in cost of maintenance and services revenues. The increase in cost of maintenance and services revenues of $3.2 million was primarily related to a $2.0 million increase in salaries and benefits expense due to increased headcount, $0.7 million in professional services fees and $0.3 million in travel expenses. Total gross margin was flat, although maintenance and services gross margin increased slightly due to increased leverage resulting from the increase in maintenance and services revenues as well as an increase in maintenance revenues as a percentage of total maintenance and services revenues.Research and development expense increased $9.5 million primarily due to a $6.7 million increase in salaries and benefits as we increased headcount as part of our focus on further developing and enhancing our product. We also had increases of $1.6 million related to overhead costs and $0.7 million related to consulting fees.Research and development expense increased $5.5 million primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in salaries and benefits expense as we increased headcount as part of our focus on further developing and enhancing our product. We also had increases of $0.4 million related to consulting fees and $0.3 million related to overhead costs.Sales and marketing expense increased $34.9 million primarily related to a $25.5 million increase in salaries and benefits, as we increased headcount to expand our field sales organization, as well as commissions on increased customer orders. During fiscal 2012, we opened sales offices in Hong Kong and Singapore, and expanded our field sales organization. We also had an increase in marketing related expenses of $4.7 million, primarily as a result of a significant increase in marketing events and advertising. Additionally, we experienced increases in overhead costs of $2.0 million and travel expenses of $2.1 million due to increased headcount.Sales and marketing expense increased $15.8 million primarily due to a $10.8 million increase in salaries and benefits expense as we expanded our field sales organization, as well as commissions on increased customer orders. Other increases included marketing-related expenses of $1.9 million, employee related expenses, such as recruiting, events and training, of $1.1 million, travel expenses of $0.8 million, overhead costs of $0.8 million, and consulting fees of $0.4 million.General and administrative expense increased $10.7 million primarily related to a $5.8 million increase in salaries and benefits, as we increased headcount to support our overall growth. Headcount increases in fiscal 2012 included the addition of a general counsel and a chief financial officer. We also had an increase of $4.8 million in consulting and professional services fees related to accounting, legal and recruiting activities.General and administrative expense increased $2.5 million primarily due to a $0.5 million increase in salaries and benefits expense as we grew headcount to support our overall growth. We also had an increase in professional services fees of $1.1 million related to accounting, legal and recruiting activities, and $0.5 million related to office expenses.Other income (expense), net decreased $1.7 million primarily due to expense associated with the revaluation of our preferred stock warrants.The decrease in other income (expense), net of $0.3 million was primarily related to the revaluation of our preferred stock warrants.In each of fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 we recorded income taxes that were principally attributable to state and foreign taxes.The following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly statements of operations data for the eight fiscal quarters ended January 31, 2012, as well as the percentage that each line item represents of total revenues. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which includes only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the results of operations for these periods. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this prospectus. These quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of our operating results for any future period.The following table reflects the reconciliation of operating income (loss) measured in accordance with GAAP to non-GAAP operating income (loss).Our quarterly results reflect seasonality in the sale of our products and services. Historically, a pattern of increased license sales in the fourth fiscal quarter as a result of industry buying patterns has positively impacted sales activity in that period, which can result in lower sequential revenue in the first fiscal quarter. We expect this seasonality to continue in fiscal 2013 and beyond. Other than the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2012, we have historically experienced relatively flat revenues in the third fiscal quarter compared to the second fiscal quarter. We believe that third fiscal quarter revenues have been and could continue to be flat compared to second fiscal quarter revenues due to a seasonal slow down in customer orders during the late summer months as a result of summer vacations and holidays in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world. Our gross margins and operating losses have been affected by these historical trends because the majority of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term. The timing of revenues in relation to our expenses, much of which does not vary directly with revenues, has an impact on the cost of revenues, research and development expense, sales and marketing expense, and general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in each fiscal quarter during the year. The majority of our expenses are personnel-related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and incentive-based compensation plan expenses. As a result, we have not experienced significant seasonal fluctuations in the timing of expenses from period to period. Although these seasonal factors are common in the technology industry, historical patterns should not be considered a reliable indicator of our future sales activity or performance.As is typical in the software industry, we expect a significant portion of our product license orders to be received in the last month of each fiscal quarter. We typically ship products shortly after the receipt of an order. We may have backlog consisting of product license orders that have not shipped and maintenance, professional and training services that have not been billed and for which the services have not yet been performed. Historically, our backlog has varied from quarter to quarter and has been immaterial to our total revenues.Other than the first quarter of fiscal 2012, our total revenues have increased over the periods presented due to increased sales to new customers as well as incremental sales to existing customers that seek to increase their daily indexing capacity or expand the use of our software through additional use cases or broader deployment within their organizations. Total revenues decreased in the first quarter of fiscal 2012 and were relatively flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, primarily as a result of the seasonality of our business described above.Other than the first quarter of fiscal 2012, research and development expenses increased sequentially in every quarter primarily due to increases in headcount-related expenses from continued hiring to develop and enhance our products. Research and development expenses modestly decreased on a sequential basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, primarily due to expenses recorded in connection with year-end bonuses to our research and development personnel in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011.Other than the first quarter of fiscal 2012, sales and marketing expenses increased sequentially in every quarter primarily due to increases in headcount-related expenses, as well as increased marketing programs and events. Increases in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year also relate to increased commissions earned on customer orders entered into at year-end. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, the increase in sales and marketing expenses related to sales commission, year-end bonuses and increased branding expenses.General and administrative expenses increased sequentially in every quarter primarily due to increases in headcount-related expenses, as well as increased consulting and professional services fees related to accounting, legal and recruiting activities to support growth in our business and additional costs incurred in preparation for our initial public offering.Since fiscal 2010 we have funded our operations primarily through cash generated from operations. At January 31, 2012, our cash and cash equivalents of $31.6 million were held for working capital purposes, a majority of which was invested in money market funds. We intend to increase our capital expenditures in fiscal 2013, consistent with the growth in our business and operations. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support development efforts, the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced software and services offerings, and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us if at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.For fiscal 2012, cash inflows from our operating activities were $14.6 million, which reflects our net loss of $11.0 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $8.2 million consisting primarily of $3.8 million for stock-based compensation, $2.0 million for the change in valuation of preferred stock warrants and $2.1 million for depreciation and amortization. Additional sources of cash inflows were from changes in our working capital, including a $30.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $11.1 million increase in accrued compensation and accrued expenses and other liabilities, primarily due to increased headcount, partially offset by a $20.6 million increase in accounts receivable, due to increased sales, and a $3.5 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current and non-current assets.For fiscal 2011, we generated $8.4 million of cash inflows from our operating activities, which reflects our net loss of $3.8 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $3.4 million consisting primarily of $1.6 million for stock-based compensation and $1.0 million for depreciation and amortization. Cash inflows included an increase of $11.0 million in deferred revenues, a $6.2 million increase in accrued compensation and accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a $0.5 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments, primarily due to an increase in headcount, partially offset by an $8.0 million increase in accounts receivable associated with increased sales, and a $0.9 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets.For fiscal 2010, cash inflows from our operating activities were $0.9 million, which reflects our net loss of $7.5 million, adjusted by non-cash charges of $2.6 million consisting primarily of $1.3 million for stock-based compensation and $0.9 million for depreciation and amortization. Additional sources of cash inflows were from changes in our working capital, including a $6.0 million increase in deferred revenues, a $1.5 million increase in accrued compensation and accrued expenses and other liabilities, and a$0.5 million increase in accounts payable due to the timing of payments, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable associated with increased sales.Our investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures to purchase property and equipment, sales of short-term investments and changes in our restricted cash. In the future, we expect to continue to invest in capital expenditures to support our expanding operations.During fiscal 2012, cash used in investing activities of $8.1 million was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for technology hardware to support the growth of our business, as well as leasehold improvements on our corporate headquarters.During fiscal 2011, cash used in investing activities of $1.3 million was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for technology and software to support our corporate infrastructure.During fiscal 2010, cash provided by investing activities of $4.7 million was attributable to $4.9 million from the sale of securities. This was partially offset by $0.4 million in capital expenditures related to the purchase of computer equipment to support the growth of our business.Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $5.3 million, $0.9 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and was primarily attributable to proceeds received from the exercises of stock options partially offset by payments related to our financing arrangements described below.In May 2009, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which was most recently amended in February 2011. The agreement includes a revolving line of credit facility and a term loan facility described below. The agreement contains financial covenants and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As part of the agreement, we granted the lender a security interest in our personal property, excluding intellectual property and other intangible assets. The agreement also contains customary events of default. We were in compliance with all covenants as of January 31, 2012.The agreement provides for a revolving line of credit facility, which expires May 27, 2012, and a term loan facility, with each advance amortized over a period of 36 months with equal monthly payments of principal and interest. We may borrow up to $10.0 million under the revolving line of credit facility, subject to a borrowing base determined on eligible accounts receivable and subject to a total maximum outstanding amount of $10.0 million. As of January 31, 2012, we had no balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit. Interest on any drawdown under the revolving line of credit accrues at the greater of prime rate plus 0.75% (4.0% as of January 31, 2012) and 4.75%. In addition to the line of credit facility, a $3.0 million term loan facility was available for draw through June 30, 2011. As of January 31, 2012, we had $2.3 million outstanding in term debt consisting of $1.0 million due between January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2013 and $1.3 million due between January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2015. The interest rate for the term debt is fixed at 5.5%.The following summarizes our contractual commitments and obligations as of January 31, 2012:Future operating lease obligations increased during fiscal 2012 for costs related to additional leases. During fiscal 2012, we executed amendments increasing the square footage of our headquarters in San Francisco. In addition, we entered into new operating lease agreements for our Cupertino and certain international locations. Payments associated with lease agreements increased by $4.1 million, of which $1.7 million is due by January 31, 2013, $2.0 million is due between January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2015, and $0.4 million is due between January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2017.During fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.During the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions within certain of our contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we will indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally parties with which we have commercial relations, in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to our products and services. To date, there have not been any costs incurred in connection with such indemnification clauses and therefore, there is no accrual of such amounts at January 31, 2011 and 2012.We prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of consolidated financial statements also requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.We generate revenues primarily in the form of software license fees and related maintenance and services fees. License fees include perpetual license fees, term license fees and royalties. Maintenance and services primarily consist of fees for maintenance services (including support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they are available), training and professional services that are not essential to functionality.We recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met:Signed agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we have used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer with access to the software via a license key. We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We do not generally offer extended payment terms with typical terms of payment due between 30 and 60 days from delivery of software. We assess collectibility of the fee based on a number of factors such as collection history and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine that collectibility is not probable, revenue is deferred until collectibility becomes probable, generally upon receipt of cash.When contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, exists for all undelivered elements and the services, if any, are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements, we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the ""Residual Method."" Perpetual license arrangements are typically accompanied by maintenance agreements. Maintenance revenues consist of fees for providing software updates on a when-and-if-available basis and technical support for software products, or post-contract support, or PCS, for an initial term. Maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. We have established fair value for maintenance on perpetual licenses due to consistently priced standalone sales of maintenance. Revenues related to term license fees are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date the customer has access to the software license key and continuing through the end of the contract term. In these cases we do not have VSOE of fair value for maintenance as fees for support and maintenance are bundled with the license over the entire term of the contract.License arrangements may also include professional services and training services, which are typically delivered early in the contract term. In determining whether professional services revenues should be accounted for separately from license revenues, we evaluate whether the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software using factors such as the nature of our software products; whether they are ready for use by the customer upon receipt; the nature of our implementation services, which typically do not involve significant customization to or development of the underlying software code; the availability of services from other vendors; whether the timing of payments for license revenues is coincident with performance of services; and whether milestones or acceptance criteria exist that affect the realizability of the software license fee. Substantially all of our professional services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and, accordingly, are recognized as the services are performed. Training revenues are recognized as training services are delivered. VSOE of fair value of professional and training services is based upon stand-alone sales of those services. Payments received in advance of services performed are deferred and recognized when the related services are performed.We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include term licenses, maintenance and services, due to the lack of VSOE for maintenance bundled with the term license. In these instances, all revenue is recognized ratably over the period that the services are expected to be performed. In arrangements where the expected service periods of maintenance services and professional or training services differ, we recognize all revenue over the longer of the two expected service periods, which is generally the maintenance period.We do not offer credits or refunds and therefore have not recorded any sales return allowance for any of the periods presented. Upon a periodic review of outstanding accounts receivable, amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our policy is to record revenues net of any applicable sales, use or excise taxes.We recognize revenues from the indirect sales channel upon sell-through by the partner or distributor. A sell-through is determined when we receive an order form from a reseller for a specific end-user sale. We do not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our channel partners. We also have licensing arrangements with Original Equipment Manufacturer, or OEM, and Managed Service Provider, or MSP, customers for which royalty fees are generally recognized as revenue upon receipt of reports of units shipped or usage levels, respectively.In our consolidated statements of operations, revenues are categorized as license or maintenance and services revenues. We allocate revenues from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these categories based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in each revenue arrangement and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenues to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established, then allocate revenues to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established based upon management's best estimate of fair value of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Management's best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of similar offerings and other objective criteria.We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option-pricing model is affected by our estimated common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include the fair value of our common stock, the expected term of the options, our expected stock price volatility, risk-free interest rates, and expected dividends, which are estimated as follows:If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model changes significantly, stock-based compensation for future awards may differ materially compared with the awards granted previously.The following table presents the weighted-average assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options granted during the periods presented:The fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options was determined by our board of directors, which intended all options granted to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on the date of grant. The valuations of our common stock were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, . The assumptions we used in the valuation model were based on future expectations combined with management judgment. In the absence of a public trading market, our board of directors with input from management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of our common stock as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:We granted stock options with the following exercise prices since February 1, 2011:Based upon the assumed initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, the aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of January 31, 2012 was $155.2 million, of which $67.1 million related to vested options and $88.1 million related to unvested options.In order to determine the fair value of our common stock underlying option grants, we considered contemporaneous valuations of our stock from an independent valuation firm that provided us with their estimation of our enterprise value and the allocation of that value to each element of our capital structure (preferred stock, common stock, warrants and options). For stock options granted on or prior to October 26, 2011, our enterprise value was estimated using the market-based approach and, within the market-based approach, the comparable company method and the recent transaction method. The market-based approach considers multiples of financial metrics based on both acquisitions and trading multiples of a selected peer group of technology companies. We selected the peer group of companies based on their size, business model, industry, business description and developmental stage. While we believe that the operational intelligence that our software provides to organizations differentiates us from other software companies, we selected this peer group from publicly traded companies and acquired companies that are similarly viewed as being in the information technology, application management and data monitoring industries.For stock options granted on or prior to October 26, 2011, we used a revenue multiple to determine our enterprise value under this market-based approach. We selected a revenue multiple because we believe it best represented the fact that our projected revenue growth was greater than the revenue growth of these comparable companies, but at the same time, our company was smaller in size compared to the peer group and remained unprofitable. The revenue multiple of these publicly traded, comparable companies was based on their revenue expectations for 2011. For the acquired company comparables, the revenue multiple was based on their trailing 12-month revenues when such information was available. Theserevenue multiples of the peer group of companies were then applied to our forward revenue estimates for 2011 to generate a valuation. For these option grants, our indicated enterprise value at each valuation date was allocated to the shares of preferred stock, common stock, warrants and options using an option pricing method, or OPM. Estimates of the volatility were based on available information on the volatility of common stock of the same peer group of technology companies for each valuation period.Significant factors considered by our board of directors in determining the fair value of our common stock at these grant dates include:In March and April 2011, the U.S. economy and the financial and stock markets were continuing to recover from the global financial crisis that began in 2008 and continued in 2009. The outlook for economic growth in 2011 remained uncertain as a result of the continued unpredictable nature of economic factors such as the unemployment rate, financial contagion from Europe, budget problems at federal, state and local governments, and falling housing prices. During this period, we experienced a seasonal decline in sequential revenue growth, generating revenues of $20.6 million for the quarter ended April 30, 2011, compared to revenues of $22.8 million for the quarter ended January 31, 2011. However, our revenues exceeded our forecast, we added approximately 275 customers, and we released a new version of our software. As a result, we increased our revenue forecast for the remainder of fiscal 2012. During this period we also hired our first general counsel.Our board of directors considered these market conditions, especially for companies in the information technology, application management and data monitoring industry, our better than anticipated operating performance, our increased revenue forecast and the reduced operating risk in our business when it determined the fair value of our common stock.In addition, our board of directors considered our enterprise value and related allocation of our enterprise value to each element of our capital structure as detailed in a report from an independent valuation firm. The enterprise value was determined by using a market approach weighing public company comparables at 50% and acquired company comparables at 50%. With respect to the public company comparables and based on our growth expectations, relative size and lack of profitability, a revenue multiple of 2.3x was applied to our estimated revenues for 2011. This multiple was between the first quartile and median multiple of the peer group of technology companies. With respect to the acquired company comparables which were based on similar companies in terms of size and revenues, as well as our strong operating performance and increased revenue forecast but lack of profitability, a revenue multiple of 3.3x was applied to our estimated revenues for 2011. This multiple was the mean revenue multiple of the peer group.A discount rate of 25% was applied, based on the industry cost of capital for newly public companies in the technology industry. The enterprise value was then allocated to the common stock utilizing an OPM with the following assumptions: a time to liquidity event of two years, a risk free rate of 0.58% and volatility of 52% over the time to a liquidity event. The results of the OPM were reduced by a discount for lack of marketability of 20%.After consideration of all these factors, our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common stock was $2.14 per share.In June and July 2011, the U.S. economy and the financial and stock markets were continuing to recover. While the strengthening of the U.S. private sector and the improving credit conditions for individuals and smaller businesses suggested stronger economic growth in 2011, the economic outlook continued to be uncertain due to a number of factors, including the large federal budget deficit, budget problems at state and local governments, financial contagion from Europe, the U.S. debt ceiling crisis, large increases in commodity prices and continued weakening of housing prices. During this period, we experienced sequential revenue growth, generating revenues of $25.9 million for the quarter ended July 31, 2011, compared to revenues of $20.6 million for the quarter ended April 30, 2011, whichexceeded our quarterly revenue forecast. As a result of these positive operating results, we increased our revenue forecast for fiscal 2012. During this period, we also hired our first chief financial officer, added approximately 325 customers and were granted our first U.S. patent covering our machine data web technology.Our board of directors considered these market conditions, our better than anticipated operating performance, reduced operating risk in our business, the hiring of our first chief financial officer, and a shorter time to an expected liquidity event when it determined the fair value of our common stock.In addition, our board of directors considered our enterprise value and related allocation of our enterprise value to each element of our capital structure as detailed in a report from an independent valuation firm. The enterprise value was determined using a market approach weighing public company comparables at 50% and acquired company comparables at 50%. With respect to the public company comparables and based on our growth expectations, including our revised revenue forecast for fiscal 2012, relative size and lack of profitability, a revenue multiple of 3.3x was applied to our estimated revenues for 2011. This multiple was between the first quartile and median multiple of the peer group of technology companies. With respect to the acquired company comparables which were based on similar companies in terms of size and revenues, as well as our strong operating performance and increased revenue forecast but lack of profitability, a revenue multiple of 3.8x was applied to our estimated revenues for 2011. This multiple was the average revenue multiple of the closest comparable companies in the peer group based on business description. The selection of these acquired companies from the peer group resulted in a higher multiple than the multiple applied in the prior period and the mean multiple of all of the acquired companies in the peer group. In addition, these selected companies had the most recent acquisition dates of all of the companies in the peer group and therefore better reflected the dynamics in the overall market.A discount rate of 25% was applied, based on the industry cost of capital for newly public companies in the technology industry. The enterprise value was then allocated to the common stock utilizing an OPM with the following assumptions: a time to liquidity event of 1.75 years, a risk free rate of 0.51% and volatility of 42% over the time to a liquidity event. The results of the OPM were reduced by a discount for lack of marketability of 20%.After consideration of all these factors, our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common stock was $2.94 per share.In September and October 2011, the U.S. economy and the financial and stock markets began to stabilize from the uncertainty and high volatility that they experienced in the late summer of 2011. However, the overall economic recovery remained tenuous. During this period, we experienced sequential revenue growth, generating $31.2 million of revenues for the quarter ended October 31, 2011 compared to $25.9 million for the quarter ended July 31, 2011. As a result of our positive revenue growth for the quarter ended July 31, 2011, we increased our revenue forecast for fiscal 2012. During this period, we also added approximately 350 customers and introduced Splunk Storm, our cloud-based service currently in beta.Our board of directors considered these market conditions, especially for companies in the information technology, application management and data monitoring industry, our generally better than anticipated operating performance, our increased revenue forecast, the reduced operating risk in our business, and a shorter time to an expected liquidity event when it determined the fair value of our common stock.In addition, our board of directors considered our enterprise value and related allocation of our enterprise value to each element of our capital structure as detailed in a report from an independent valuation firm. The enterprise value was determined using a market approach weighing public company comparables at 37.5%, acquired company comparables at 37.5%, and the recent transaction method at 25%. The recent transaction method was added as a valuation methodology due to the purchase by existingpreferred stock investors of 46,812 shares of common stock held by some of our employees at a price of $5.55 per share (the same price as the sale by Messrs. Swan and Das in June 2011) on September 9, 2011. The September purchases were made by certain affiliated holders of shares of our preferred stock pursuant to an offer to purchase shares of common stock from each of our employees at a purchase price of $5.55 per share. The offered price was solely based upon the price per share paid to Messrs. Das and Swan in June 2011. A small percentage of our employees elected to sell shares of common stock in connection with this transaction. Based on the terms of the transaction, the relatively small number of shares purchased in the transaction, the limited number of parties involved in the transaction, the manner in which the offer price was fixed, and the purchasers' desire to increase the size of their investments in the company and their belief that the value of the company will appreciate over time, a 25% weighing was deemed appropriate as an indication of our value. With respect to the public company comparables and based on our growth expectations, relative size and lack of profitability, a revenue multiple of 3.2x was applied to our estimated revenues for 2011. This multiple was the median multiple of the peer group of technology companies. The selection of the median revenue multiple was based on a review of the business description, size, and operating metrics of the comparable companies and reflected our strong growth expectations, including our revised revenue forecast for fiscal 2012, and historical performance, while accounting for our smaller size and lack of profitability. With respect to the acquired company comparables which were based on similar companies in terms of size and revenues, as well as our strong operating performance and increased revenue forecast but lack of profitability, a revenue multiple of 3.8x was applied to our estimated revenues for 2011. This multiple was the average revenue multiple of the closest comparable companies in the peer group based on business description. These were the same acquired company comparables and the same revenue multiple used in the prior period.A discount rate of 25% was applied, based on the industry cost of capital for newly public companies in the technology industry. The enterprise value was then allocated to the common stock utilizing an OPM with the following assumptions: a time to liquidity event of 1.25 years, a risk free rate of 0.24% and volatility of 38% over the time to an expected liquidity event. The results of the OPM were reduced by a discount for lack of marketability of 15%.After a consideration of all these factors, our board of directors determined that the fair value of our common stock was $3.94 per share.In December 2011, the overall economic outlook remained uncertain, with some economists foreseeing significantly weaker prospects for the U.S. economy in 2011 and 2012 as the country struggled to avoid another recession. However, during this period, we continued to experience sequential revenue growth and expected to exceed our revenue forecast for fiscal 2012. We also made significant progress in our preparation for a potential initial public offering, including engaging the underwriters for this offering, selecting outside counsel, preparing drafts of the prospectus for this offering, and finalizing appropriate corporate governance policies and processes for a public company.Our board of directors considered market conditions, especially for technology companies, our better than anticipated operating performance, our increased revenue forecast, the reduced operating risk in our business, and a shorter time to an expected liquidity event when it determined the fair value of our common stock. After consideration of all of these factors, we decided to use a probability-weighted expected return model, or PWERM, to determine our enterprise value and related allocation. This approach models potential future liquidity events and applies probabilities to each scenario. These future liquidity events are then discounted to present value and, after applying the relevant probability for each potential event, result in a probability-weighted equity value of the company. We estimated the probability of an initial public offering in 2012 at 40%, an initial public offering in 2013 at 10%, a merger or sale of the company in 2012 at 35%, and a merger or sale of the company in 2013 at 15%. The implied revenue multiples resulting from the exit values for each of these future liquidity events ranged from approximately 2.2x to 5.6x, which was between the first quartile to third quartile of the last 12-month revenue multiples of the public company comparables and ranged from approximately 1.5x to 6.7x, which was between the lowto the third quartile of the last 12-month revenue multiples of the acquired company comparables. A discount rate of 25% was applied, based on the industry cost of capital for newly public companies in the technology industry. The results of the PWERM were reduced by a discount of 13% for lack of marketability. This resulted in our board of directors determining that the fair value of our common stock was $4.82 per share.In February 2012, the overall economic outlook remained uncertain, with some economists foreseeing significantly weaker prospects for the U.S. economy in 2012 as the country struggled to avoid another recession. While the U.S. economy was showing signs of growth, the pace of such growth was expected to slow in the first half of 2012 and pick up slightly by the end of 2012. Between the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012, we experienced sequential revenue growth, generating $43.2 million of revenues for the quarter ended January 31, 2012, compared to $31.2 million for the quarter ended October 31, 2011, which exceeded our forecast. During this period, we also added approximately 400 customers, entered into a significant transaction with a large customer, and released the latest version of our software, which included a number of new features, including mobility, increased power and speed, and an improved user interface. In addition, we continued to make significant progress in our preparation for a potential initial public offering, including filing the registration statement for this offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Our board of directors considered market conditions, especially for companies in the information technology, application management and data monitoring industry, our better than anticipated operating performance, reduced operating risk in our business, and a shorter time to an expected liquidity event when it determined the fair value of our common stock. After consideration of all of these factors, we determined to use a probability-weighted expected return model, or PWERM, to determine our enterprise value and related allocation. This approach models potential future liquidity events and applies probabilities to each scenario. These future liquidity events are then discounted to present value and, after applying the relevant probability for each potential event, result in a probability-weighted equity value of the company. We estimated the probability of an initial public offering in 2012 at 50%, an initial public offering in 2013 at 10%, a merger or sale of the company in 2012 at 30%, and a merger or sale of the company in 2013 at 10%. The implied revenue multiples resulting from the exit values for each of these future liquidity events ranged from approximately 2.1x to 5.6x, which was between the first quartile and third quartile of the last 12-month revenue multiples of the public company comparables and ranged from 2.2x to 6.8x, which was between the low to the third quartile of the last 12-month revenue multiples of the acquired company comparables. A discount rate of 25% was applied, based on the industry cost of capital for newly public companies in the technology industry. The results of the PWERM were reduced by a discount of 10% for lack of marketability. This resulted in our board of directors determining that the fair value of our common stock was $5.79 per share.In March 2012, we reviewed our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2012. Based on our strong financial performance and the fact that our financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 exceeded our forecasts, we increased our projected revenue for fiscal 2013 and provided an updated forecast to the underwriters during the first week of March. The updated forecast was utilized in the valuation models that we reviewed to determine the preliminary price range. In addition, during this period, we continued to make significant progress in our preparation for a potential initial public offering and determined that it was appropriate to apply a 100% weighting that we would successfully complete the offering. By doing so, we excluded any marketability or illiquidity discount for our common stock. We also determined that the fair value of our common stock should assume the completion of the offering and that a public market for our common stock had been created. After considering the preliminary valuation range proposed by the underwriters relative to these financial results, current economic and market conditions, our updated forecast, the removal of any illiquidity discount and a 100% weighting that we would complete the offering, our board of directors concluded thatthe midpoint of the range provided by our managing underwriters, $9.00 per share, was not less than the fair value of our common stock.In April 2012, our board of directors determined that there were no material changes in the factors that the board of directors considered in March 2012 when it determined the fair value of our common stock. Therefore, for the same reasons described above, our board of directors concluded that the midpoint of the range provided by our managing underwriters, $9.00 per share, continued to be not less than the fair value of our common stock.Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with authoritative guidance for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying accounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.We adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10, , on February 1, 2009. There was no impact upon adoption of ASC 740-10 as our liability recognized under previous accounting guidance was consistent with that required under the new guidance. We have adopted the accounting policy that interest expense and penalties relating to income tax position are classified within the provision for income taxes.We are exposed to financial market risks, primarily changes in interest rates.Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investments and any variable rate indebtedness.The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk. This objective is accomplished by making diversified investments, consisting only of investment grade securities.Any draws under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate tied to the prime rate. As of January 31, 2012, we had no outstanding debt under our revolving credit facility.Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenues are generated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements. To date, we have not engaged in any hedging strategies. As our international operations grow, we will continue to reassess our approach to manage our risk relating to fluctuations in currency rates.We do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the last three fiscal years. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. Our inability or failure to do so could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.In May 2011, the FASB further amended its guidance related to fair value measurements in order to achieve common fair value measurements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments in the updated guidance explain how to measure fair value. They do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the updated guidance should not result in a change in the application of previous fair value measurement guidance. The updated guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance on February 1, 2012 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.In June 2011, the FASB updated its guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income. Under the updated guidance, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. The updated guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The updated guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The updated guidance must be applied retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance on February 1, 2012 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Splunk provides an innovative software platform that enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data. Our software collects and indexes data at massive scale, regardless of format or source, and enables users to quickly and easily search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real time. Our software addresses the risks, challenges and opportunities organizations face with increasingly large and diverse data sets, commonly referred to as big data, and is specifically tailored for machine-generated data. Machine data is produced by nearly every software application and electronic device in an organization and contains a definitive, time-stamped record of various activities, such as transactions, customer and user activities, and security threats. Our software is designed to help users in various roles, including IT and business professionals, quickly analyze their machine data and realize real-time visibility into and intelligence about their organization's operations. This operational intelligence enables organizations to improve service levels, reduce costs, mitigate security risks, demonstrate and maintain compliance and gain new insights that enable them to drive better business decisions.The core of our software is a proprietary machine data engine, comprised of collection, indexing, search and data management capabilities. Our software can collect and index terabytes of information daily irrespective of format or source. Our machine data engine uses our innovative data architecture that enables dynamic, schema creation on the fly, allowing users to run queries on data without having to understand the structure of the data prior to collection and indexing. Our machine data fabric for data collection and indexing delivers speed and scalability when processing massive amounts of machine data. Our software leverages improvements in the cost and performance of commodity computing and can be deployed in a wide variety of computing environments, from a single laptop to large globally distributed data centers.To extend our software's functionality, customers can deploy additional solutions as well as lightweight applications, or apps, on top of our core data engine. Our apps, which are available for download via our Splunkbase website, provide incremental functionality in the form of pre-built data inputs, searches, reports, alerts and dashboards, and are generally available for free. We, along with a number of third-party developers and customers, have developed approximately 350 apps for specific use cases in our core and adjacent markets. We also build and deliver a select number of packaged solutions that provide more robust functionality targeting a specific end market or use case. We currently provide Splunk for Enterprise Security and Splunk for PCI Compliance and have made available, through a controlled preview, Splunk for VMware. These packaged solutions and apps allow our customers to further extend the value of their machine data using our software. We provide APIs and SDKs in various programming languages that enable developers to leverage our machine data engine and its broad capabilities in their own software. In addition to our packaged solutions and apps, we are investing in the development of Splunk Storm, which is a cloud-based service currently in beta that provides a subset of our software's capabilities, but is tailored for machine data in the cloud. Our online user communities, Splunkbase and Splunk Answers, provide our customers with an environment to share these apps, collaborate on the use of our software and provide community-based support. We believe this user-driven ecosystem results in greater use of our software and drives cost-effective marketing, increased brand awareness and viral adoption of our product.Our software is designed to accelerate adoption and return-on-investment for our customers. It does not require customization, long deployment cycles or extensive professional services commonly associated with traditional enterprise software applications. Users can simply download and install the software, typically in a matter of hours, to connect to their relevant machine data sources and begin realizing operational intelligence. We also offer customers with complex IT infrastructure the ability to leverage the expertise of our professional services organization to deploy our software.As of January 31, 2012, we had over 3,700 customers, including a majority of the Fortune 100. Some of our largest customers include Autodesk, Bank of America, Comcast, Etsy, Harvard University, Viacom and Zynga. Our customers pay license fees based on their estimated indexing capacity needs. For fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, our revenues were $35.0 million, $66.2 million and $121.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 89% for fiscal 2011 and 83% for fiscal 2012, and our net loss was $7.5 million, $3.8 million and $11.0 million, respectively.Organizations have broadly deployed business applications and related IT infrastructure to automate processes and improve performance in sales, marketing, customer support, human resources, product development, engineering, finance and operations. As more business processes involving employees, customers, partners, suppliers and other constituents are transacted through software and web-based applications, the amount of digital information produced by these applications and the hardware devices that run them has grown substantially.According to IDC, the volume of digital information created and replicated worldwide will grow approximately 45% annually from 1.8 trillion gigabytes in 2011 to 7.9 trillion gigabytes in 2015. The large and diverse data sets that make up this digital information are often referred to as big data and are generally categorized into business application data, human-generated content and machine data. The growth of digital information estimated by IDC may not be indicative of the growth in machine data, which is our primary market and only one of the three types of data included in the estimated growth figure by IDC.The increasing complexity of IT infrastructures driven by the adoption of virtual servers and desktops, as well as cloud-based services and mobile technologies, has accelerated the growth of machine data. For example, according to Gartner, the number of x86 server instances deployed globally per year, including virtual servers, is expected to grow from 19.4 million in 2010 to over 59.3 million in 2015. Additionally,according to IDC, the number of internet-enabled access devices globally is expected to grow from 2.3 billion devices in 2010 to over 4.6 billion devices in 2015.As organizations have become highly reliant on their technology assets, they require end-to-end visibility, analytics, and real-time intelligence across all of their applications, services and IT infrastructure to achieve required service levels, manage costs, mitigate security risks, demonstrate and maintain compliance and gain new insights to drive better business decisions. Machine data provides a definitive, time-stamped record of current and historical activity and events within and outside an organization, including application and system performance, user activity, system configuration changes, electronic transaction records, security alerts, error messages and device locations. Machine data in a typical enterprise is generated in a multitude of formats and structures, as each software application or hardware device records and creates machine data associated with their specific use. Machine data also varies among vendors and even within the same vendor across product types, families and models.The table below illustrates the type of machine data created and the business and IT insights that can be derived when a single web visitor makes a purchase in a typical ecommerce environment:The illustration above is an example of the type and amount of valuable information generated by a single website visitor that is recorded in the machine data of IT systems. A typical ecommerce site serving thousands of users a day will generate gigabytes of machine data which can be used to provide significant insights into the IT infrastructure and business operations. As this information is constantly being generated by IT systems, enterprises have the opportunity to realize real-time intelligence about their operations by analyzing machine data.While machine data has always been generated by computing environments, many organizations have failed to recognize the value of this data or have encountered challenges extracting value from it. As a result, diverse, heterogeneous machine data is largely ignored and restricted to ad hoc use at the time of troubleshooting IT failures or errors.A number of IT management products are available to analyze log files and other information related to specific devices, applications or use cases. However, these point solutions are generally narrowly scoped to only work with specific data formats and systems and are unable to correlate machine data from multiple sources, formats and systems for both historical and real-time analysis without significant configuration. Because each point solution targets a specific use case or data format, multiple pointsolutions are required to understand, cross-correlate and take advantage of the multitude of machine data sets available to an organization. This can lead to significant IT management complexity as well as significant capital and IT resource expenditures.While computing environments have always generated large amounts of machine data, current legacy IT operations management, security and compliance and business intelligence technologies, such as relational databases, online analytical processing, or OLAP, engines and other analytical tools are built on software optimized for structured data, namely data where the structure is known and can thus be placed into pre-defined relational databases. Most of today's enterprise applications are architected for managing data in legacy relational databases. However, because machine data exists in a variety of formats and can be structured or unstructured, these legacy systems are not optimized to address the massive amounts of dynamic machine data generated within an organization. According to IDC, nearly 90% of data growth over the next few years, across IT and other operating environments, will come from unstructured content, a tangible portion of which will be machine data. Unstructured data generally, and machine data in particular, is extremely diverse and complex. Legacy data tools, which are generally designed to handle structured data, need to be re-architected to effectively address the complexity of machine data. If either the analysis or the format of the data changes, the legacy systems needs to re-collect and normalize the data, and the application that leveraged the database need to modify their structure to handle the new data formats. Many legacy solutions are also expensive to install and maintain, often needing extended deployment and update cycles that require significant professional services, extensive training and technical support over several months, and sometimes years.Point products as well as legacy IT systems were not built to address the challenges and opportunities of machine data. Moreover, existing solutions and systems are not architected to take advantage of recent improvements in the price and performance of computing and storage systems, and in many cases require significant investment in computing hardware. Because of these limitations, these solutions and systems are unable to fully leverage the information and value in machine data to provide historical and real-time operational intelligence across a wide variety of use cases.We believe there is a large opportunity to help organizations unlock the value of machine data. Organizations need to capture the value locked in their machine data to enable more effective application management, IT operations management, security and compliance, and to derive intelligence and insight across the organization. Our software enables users to realize real-time operational intelligence across their business. While our software may be used to collect and index all types of data, including business application data and human-generated content, our primary market opportunity is focused on enabling our users to harness the value of their machine data.We believe software that provides operational intelligence addresses several established markets that in aggregate have been estimated by Gartner to be approximately $32 billion in 2012. Specifically, Gartner expects the market that our products address for IT operations, in which, for purposes of its market study, Gartner includes application management, to be approximately $18.6 billion in 2012; the market that our products address for business intelligence, including web analytics software, to be approximately $12.5 billion in 2012; and the market that our products address for security information and event management software to be approximately $1.3 billion in 2012. Beyond these areas, we believe software that provides operational intelligence can address a wide variety of additional markets in areas such as online marketing optimization, video-on-demand analytics, radio-frequency indentification tracking and scientific applications using time-series data.Our mission is to make machine data accessible, usable and valuable to everyone in an organization. Splunk enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of theirmachine data. Splunk's intuitive, browser-based approach to analyzing machine data makes our software easy to use and extend, allowing both technical and non-technical users to, with minimal training, use our products. Our customers leverage our software for various use cases, including infrastructure and operations management, applications management, security and compliance, business and web analytics, and scientific applications, among many others. Our software helps users derive new insights from machine data that can be used to, among others, improve service levels, reduce operational costs, mitigate security risks, demonstrate and maintain compliance and gain new insights that enable them to drive better business decisions. The result is a new level of operational visibility enabling more informed business decisions that can provide significant competitive advantage for our customers.Our software collects and indexes data at massive scale, regardless of the format or source, and enables users to quickly and easily search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data, all in real time. Our software enables users to identify problems, get answers and gain new business insights and intelligence from machine data across their globally distributed enterprise all through one platform. On the other hand, multiple point solutions, such as traditional application management, IT operations management, security and compliance and business intelligence tools, provide a more narrow view of the customer's operations as these products are only focused on one area of the infrastructure.Our software enables customers to improve their customer service levels and systems availability, reduce operational costs, improve security and compliance, and increase business insights. Although our data engine can index terabytes of data daily, it does not require the high-end hardware, software, extensive professional services or other capital intensive IT investments commonly associated with traditional enterprise software. In addition, our customers have the option of purchasing our software on either a perpetual or term basis.Unlike traditional relational databases or business and IT applications, our software does not require custom implementations or long deployment cycles. While some enterprises leverage our professional services team to deploy our software in large, highly complex IT environments, most users simply download and install the software, typically in a matter of hours, to connect to the relevant machine data sources and begin realizing operational intelligence. Given our software's ease-of-use, our professional services engagements are typically short in duration and last from a few days to up to several weeks, significantly shorter than the professional services engagements associated with traditional enterprise software.While we utilize complex data structures and algorithms in our machine data engine, we abstract that complexity to provide a compelling, intuitive interface similar to that of an internet search engine. Our software can be accessed through a standard web browser and requires limited training, saving on time and cost as well as making it accessible to the broader set of non-technical users. In addition, we provide flexible and easy-to-use tools to create ad-hoc searches, reports and custom dashboards to visualize business and operational activity and trends derived from machine data.Our machine data engine, machine data fabric and broad technology stack are built to be highly flexible and scalable, allowing our customers to index terabytes of data daily and search petabytes of historical data. Our software can operate in a single data center or globally across multiple data centers both inside and outside an organization, and all from a single user interface. This architecture also allows for flexible deployment of additional commodity hardware as needed.Our machine data engine is a powerful, extensible platform on which custom reports, dashboards and applications can be run to analyze machine data for specific use cases.Splunk provides software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) free of charge, making it easy for developers to leverage our platform. Splunk, as well as a number of customers and third-party developers, have developed numerous applications for specific use cases across application management, IT operations management, security and compliance and business intelligence. Some customers have started to utilize our platform and its SDKs/APIs to address machine data challenges outside of our core markets, including health data monitoring, fraud detection and smart grid management, among others. Our community of users, through Splunkbase and Splunk Answers, drives additional value to fellow users through pre-built apps and free, online technical support.Our goal is to make our software the platform for delivering operational intelligence and real-time business insights from machine data. The key elements of our strategy are to:We intend to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional features, address customer needs and enable solutions that can address new end markets. We will continue to expand into adjacent product and technology areas that enable organizations to further unlock the value of their machine data. For example, we are actively investing in Splunk Storm, a cloud-based service that provides a subset of capabilities relative to our current software, and is tailored for machine data in the cloud.Continue to expand our direct and indirect sales organization, including our channel relationships, to acquire new customers.     We will continue to increase investments in our sales and marketing organizations to drive efficient acquisition of new customers across geographies and industries. We will continue to expand our sales operations globally to support new and existing customers in these regions. We will continue to invest in and foster the growth of our channel relationships, particularly outside the United States where channel partners provide greater sales leverage and play a greater role in the sales process. For example, we have increased the number of sales representatives and sales engineers in our direct and indirect sales teams and have grown our distributor and reseller partner network to over 250 channel partners worldwide as of January 31, 2012.We will continue to cultivate incremental sales from our existing customers by driving increased use of our software within organizations. In particular, we continue to seek to upsell existing customers for additional deployments and new use cases which will drive higher daily indexing needs. We believe our existing customer base serves as a strong source of incremental revenues given the horizontal applicability of our software and the growing machine data volumes our customers face. Our sales teams are responsible for driving renewals of existing contracts as well as increased adoption of our software by existing customers.Develop additional solutions in adjacent markets as well as products that enable organizations to use our software in different ways, such as Splunk Storm, our cloud-based service.     We believe there is a significant opportunity to provide additional solutions that leverage our core machine data engine to help organizations understand and unlock the value of their machine data in specific end markets and use cases. For example, our Splunk Enterprise Security solution enables customers to effectively target enterprise security events. We will continue to invest in both our core machine data engine as well as end-market specific packaged solutions to drive Splunk market penetration, expand our addressable market opportunity and make Splunk a more targeted solution for the machine data problems our customers and prospects encounter.Grow our user communities and partner ecosystem to increase awareness of our brand, target new use cases, drive operational leverage and deliver more targeted, higher value solutions.     We believe our user community has the potential to provide significant operating leverage by delivering apps that extend our software's functionality to new use cases. We will continue to invest in business development initiatives inorder to add additional OEM and strategic relationships to enable new sales channels for our software as well as extend our integration with third party products. In addition, once these relationships have been established, we expect that OEM vendors and managed service providers will invest in and create customized application functionality based on our machine data engine.Become the developer platform for machine data.     We intend to continue our investments in SDKs and APIs that help software developers leverage the functionality of our machine data engine. Our SDKs enable developers to build solutions that deeply integrate the functionality of our machine data engine and machine data fabric as well as access the data stored in the data indexes. Through our investments in SDKs and APIs, we intend to promote and extend the capabilities of our platform to customers who wish to build sophisticated applications and interfaces that leverage our software.We believe our investments in our product and key technologies drive significant competitive differentiation. The key technologies of our software, described below, have been built to address today's explosive growth in machine data. Our software has been architected to handle large volumes of machine data at a massive scale with minimal overhead, enabling robust throughput in a high availability environment. Our software platform is highly flexible and is able to collect and index large amounts of heterogeneous data formats, from physical, virtual and/or cloud environments.Our software collects and indexes data irrespective of source and format. Rather than requiring that data be input into a pre-defined structure, our software's innovative schema-on-the-fly technology creates structure as it searches the data from a single query. This allows users to ask new and different questions at any time without having to re-architect a schema as would be required in a relational database. Our software builds schema in real time and does not require any user intervention or pre-defined knowledge about the data it is processing. Our software allows different users to run a variety of queries, regardless of changes in format to the data being input into the system.Our software provides robust machine data collection and indexing on terabytes of data daily. Our software enables users to process machine data no matter the infrastructure topology, from a single machine to a globally distributed, virtualized IT infrastructure. This machine data fabric allows customers to address the complexities of handling massive amounts of real-time, dynamic, heterogeneous machine data. Our APIs enable users to forward data from our software to other parts of their IT network, creating a machine data fabric across the organization irrespective of whether the data is used by our software for analysis and reporting or as a conduit to other systems.Our software provides a comprehensive, intuitive and powerful proprietary search language that is specifically designed for working with machine data. Our search language supports basic arithmetic operations to refine searches and conduct calculations with the results of a query in real time. Powerful statistical and reporting commands native to our search language let users perform more robust calculations and analysis. Our software can also learn about the structure of the machine data through the searches users conduct. This learning mechanism allows users to leverage the machine data structure and knowledge garnered by previous Splunk searches. And finally, our search language makes it easier for us to distribute large work loads to the Splunk machine data fabric.Our software contains the following features and functionality:Splunk's technology has been internally developed since our inception. The diagram below describes the various components of Splunk's technology architecture:Our software collects machine data from a number of different sources across a distributed environment including servers, network devices, desktop and laptop computers, mobile devices and various other systems that organizations have deployed to support their operations. Our software acts as a recording mechanism, collecting, storing and making available all of the machine data that it receives.Our proprietary indexing technology allows for real-time indexing of any data collected by our software regardless of its source or format and without the use of any specific parsers or data connectors. Our software indexes the data intelligently and stores the data in a scalable storage format, which can reside on commodity servers and storage devices. Our software stores both the raw data and the index in an efficient, compressed, flat file format.Our software enables users to search through the massive amounts of machine data that have been indexed and stored. At its most basic level, the search engine allows users to type and search for keywords or data fields that are of interest. This foundational capability forms the basis for deriving business insights from our dashboards and customized views. Users can leverage our search language and functionality to filter through indexed data and refine search results to obtain more precise information.Our software's core functionality includes alerts, access control, statistics and correlation capabilities. With our software's granular, role-based access, an administrator can control various aspects of a given user's search including the data to which the user has access as well as what portions of the data may be visible in results. Search results and reports can be defined according to a particular user's business function and level of access. Different users can see completely different views on the same data, depending on what's important to them.Our SDKs allow third-party software developers to build apps on top of our software. Our APIs allow users to access the machine data stored within the Splunk instance as well as access machine data engine functionality from third party software.We internally develop robust packaged solutions that target specific end markets and run on top of our machine data engine. We currently provide Splunk for Enterprise Security and Splunk for PCI Compliance and have made available, through a controlled preview, Splunk for VMware. Over time, we believe these packaged solutions will enable us to target new end markets with highly focused and compelling offerings that can disrupt existing point products, increase adoption of our machine data engine, expand our total addressable market and ultimately drive license revenues.We provide the ability for users to write their own lightweight apps using standard Web technologies, such as HTML and CSS, as well as our query language, to provide incremental functionality targeting a particular use case. To date, we have approximately 350 apps available for download via our Splunkbase website, with over 200 developed by third parties.Our software can be deployed in a variety of environments ranging from a single laptop to a distributed enterprise IT environment handling massive amounts of data. Our customers use Splunk forwarders, indexers, and search heads to create a machine data fabric that allows for the efficient, secure and real-time collection and indexing of machine data regardless of network, data center or ITinfrastructure topology. The diagram below shows a representative Splunk deployment topology in a distributed environment making use of our machine data fabric:This distributed machine data processing architecture illustrated above provides near-linear scalability, resulting in the ability to index and search across many petabytes of data. Our software can operate in a single data center or globally across multiple data centers both inside and outside an organization, and all from a single user interface. This architecture also allows for flexible deployment of hardware, as commodity hardware can be added as needed.Our customer base has grown from approximately 450 customers at the end of fiscal 2008 to over 3,700 customers in more than 75 countries, including a majority of the Fortune 100, as of January 31, 2012. Our customers count consists of organizations that have purchased our software; we exclude users of our trial software from our customer count. We provide products and services to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, educational institutions and government agencies. Our business is not dependent onany particular customer as no customer represented more than 10% of our revenues in fiscal 2010, 2011 or 2012. Our current customer base spans numerous industry verticals, including cloud and online services; education; financial services; government; healthcare/pharmaceuticals; industrials/manufacturing; media/entertainment; retail/ecommerce; technology and telecommunications.Representative customers during the eight fiscal quarters ended January 31, 2012 are provided below by industry:The following are a few examples of how some of our customers, across industries and use cases, have benefited from our software.Expedia, Inc., the world's largest online travel company, faced challenging demands managing its widely-dispersed, silo-oriented IT infrastructures. In just one part of its IT infrastructure, Expedia utilized 20 different troubleshooting and root cause analysis solutions, ranging from recognized industry products to in-house developed tools. Most of these solutions were unable to communicate or share data among them.Expedia initially deployed our software to streamline its e-commerce logging environment, reduce redundant and disparate tool sets and deliver a more highly optimized user experience for its customers. With our software, Expedia was able to create a common platform that its entire team could leverage to identify and diagnose system and process failures, resulting in reduced outages. Expedia reported that the consolidation of data using our software allowed it to decommission nearly 200 servers and 22 database licenses, reducing license and hardware costs.iRhythm Technologies, a rapidly growing medical device and service company, has pioneered an innovative approach to cardiac diagnostic monitoring. iRhythm needed to focus on quality control and product development to support its value-driven, high-competency model for cardiac diagnostic monitoring. To achieve this model and to keep pace with their growth and limited resources, iRhythm needed an efficient and effective way to establish baseline performance across their entire operation, and to track that performance as the business expanded.iRhythm deployed our software as their enterprise data warehouse in less than two weeks. Today iRhythm is utilizing our software to monitor business processes and product performance. iRhythm has built executive performance dashboards with our software that aggregate manufacturing, product performance, business process and logistics data to pinpoint quality or business performance issues. Oursoftware has thus played a key role in enabling iRhythm to validate its business processes, measure key performance indicators and quickly identify and address product quality issues.As a leading provider of security identity solutions, Ping Identity provides more than 700 of the world's largest companies and organizations with single sign-on, mobile app identity security, API security, centralized cloud access and user identity and access management.

With respect to our OEM relationships, we provide our partners with a limited use license to expose certain data and analytics functionalities in their products, for which they pay us a royalty based on units shipped.We have partnered with several leading technology companies to build Splunk apps that allow users to capture data and gain insights into the partner's respective products. Several technology partners offer apps for free via Splunkbase. These apps typically consist of collections of reports, dashboards and data extractions which put our software in context for users of those specific technologies and allows them to easily and quickly understand the performance of their IT systems or correlate this data with other data sources.We engage with Managed Service Providers, or MSPs, to enable specific service offerings, or offer our software as a hosted service. These services are typically offered on a subscription basis, for which we are paid a royalty based on monthly indexing volume.We offer a developer license that allows third party developers to build software using Splunk's existing developer framework and we have published information about our API to enable developers to build new user interfaces on top of our core engine. We are creating additional SDKs based on various programming languages to make our software more extensible and allow developers to build applications and services on our platform that extend its functionality.Our online communities provide us with a rapidly growing network of active users who promote the usage of our software and provide technical support to each other.Our online communities include Splunkbase, our online apps repository, Splunk Answers, our community collaboration site, and Splunk Dev, where developers can download SDKs, access API documentation and see sample code for building software on our core engine. We also maintain active communities on leading social internet platforms, including Facebook and LinkedIn.Users and partners contribute and share custom lightweight apps and add-ons that run on our software. Generally, these lightweight apps provide pre-built functionality that addresses specific use cases. To date, we have approximately 350 apps available for download on Splunkbase, of which over 200 are developed by third parties. We do not receive any revenues from the sale of apps by third party application providers, as most apps posted to Splunkbase are free.Users ask questions in an online community forum and share best practices about how to build searches, create data visualizations and configure and deploy our software. While our product, support, engineering and professional services teams participate in the Splunk Answers forum, as of January 31, 2012, approximately 70% of questions appearing on Splunk Answers were answered by non-Splunk personnel, largely the result of a growing, active user community.In addition to documentation about the Splunk API and SDKs, our developer portal contains documentation about best practices for building machine data output into third party software.We also promote and support offline meetings for our community, including regional user group meetings and an annual user conference.Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, build a strong sales pipeline, and cultivate customer relationships to drive revenue growth.We sell our software through direct field sales, direct inside sales and indirect channel sales. We gather prospects through a broad range of marketing programs and events and through users who download our trial software from our website. Our inside sales team handles lead qualifications as well as smaller transactions, while larger or more complex transactions are handled by our globally distributed direct field sales teams. Our sales engineers help define customer use cases and on pre-sales qualification and evaluation.We maintain a distributor and reseller partner network, or channel, that often co-sells with our field sales organization, especially in EMEA and APAC. Our channel provides us with additional sales leverage by sourcing new prospects, providing technical support to existing customers, upselling for additional usecases and daily indexing capacities, and maintenance renewals. This channel expands our geographic sales reach worldwide, particularly in key international markets such as Japan and China. As of January 31, 2012, we had over 250 channel partners worldwide. Historically, the majority of EMEA and APAC sales have been fulfilled through channel partners and we expect this trend to continue for the near term.In addition to acquiring new customers, our sales teams are responsible for driving renewals of existing contracts as well as increased adoption of our software by existing customers. To accomplish this, our field sales teams work closely with our inside sales team to drive expanded licenses and additional use cases within existing customers. Our field sales teams are organized geographically across the Americas, EMEA, and APAC. We intend to invest in our international sales organization to drive greater market penetration in EMEA and APAC. We also have a dedicated sales team focused on government customers, which covers U.S. federal, state and local government entities.We focus our marketing efforts on increasing Splunk's brand and product awareness, driving viral adoption, communicating product advantages and business benefits, and generating leads for our sales force and channel partners.

We host an annual worldwide user and partner conference (.CONF) as another way to support the Splunk community to foster collaboration and help our customers drive further business results from our software.While users can easily download, install and deploy our software on their own, certain enterprise customers that have large, highly complex IT environments or deployment requirements, may choose to leverage our customer support and professional services organization. Many users leverage the community-based support of Splunkbase and Splunk Answers before engaging with our customer support or services organizations. Some of our certified partners also provide limited, first level support and professional services before a customer reaches out to our internal Splunk customer support and professional services teams.Our customers typically purchase one year of software maintenance and support as part of their initial purchase of our products, with an option to renew their maintenance agreements. These maintenance agreements provide customers the right to receive unspecified software updates, maintenance releases and patches, and access to our technical support services during the term of the agreement.We maintain a customer support organization that offers multiple service levels for our customers based on their needs. These customers receive guaranteed response times, direct telephonic support and access to online support portals. Our highest levels of support provide 24x7x365 support for critical issues, a dedicated resource to manage the account and quarterly reviews of the customer's deployments. Our customer support organization has global capabilities, delivering support in multiple languages with deep expertise in both our software as well as complex IT environments and associated third party infrastructure.We provide consulting, training and implementation services to customers through our professional services team. They are typically utilized by large enterprises looking to deploy our software across theirlarge, disparate and complex IT infrastructure. We generally provide these services at the time of initial installation to help the customer with configuration and implementation. Given our software's ease-of-use, our professional services engagements are typically short in duration and last from a few days to up to several weeks, significantly shorter than the professional services engagements associated with traditional enterprise software.We invest substantial resources in research and development to enhance our software, develop new end market specific solutions and apps, conduct software and quality assurance testing and improve our core technology. Our technical staff monitors and tests our software on a regular basis, and we maintain a regular release process to refine, update, and enhance our existing products.Research and development expense totaled $8.5 million, $14.0 million and $23.6 million for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As of March 31, 2012, we had two issued U.S. patents covering our machine data web technology, one provisional patent application and eleven utility patent applications pending for examination in the United States. We also had six utility patent applications pending for examination in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and eight pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) utility patent applications, all of which are counterparts of our U.S. utility patent applications. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. In particular, leading companies in the technology industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time-to-time, third parties, including certain of these leading companies, have asserted and may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our customers. For example, we recently settled a dispute with respect to the Splunk trademark in the European Union for an immaterial amount.We compete against a variety of large software vendors and smaller specialized companies, open source initiatives and custom development efforts, which provide solutions in the specific markets we address. Our principal competitors include:The principal competitive factors in our markets are product features, performance and support, product scalability and flexibility, ease of deployment and use, total cost of ownership and time to value. We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors. Our software contains a rich feature set starting with its powerful, intuitive search-engine interface and continuing with its ability to provide results to customized user queries in real time. We offer a broad range of support options, and our customers consistently provide us with high ratings for our support. Our software has the capability to collect and index data at massive scale and enables users to quickly and easily define customized searches and to correlate, analyze, monitor and report on their data. In addition, our software does not require long, costly deployment cycles typically associated with enterprise software. The ability to rapidly capture and analyze massive amounts of data results in a broad set of use cases for our software and enables our software to displace traditional enterprise software and discrete solutions providing IT operations management, security and compliance, and business intelligence. While we believe that our software provides a broad variety of use cases at a low total cost of ownership, we price our software licenses based upon estimated daily indexing capacity. Our pricing method may ultimately result in a higher total cost to users as data volumes increase over time, making it more difficult for us to compete in our markets.Some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. In addition, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on operational intelligence and could directly compete with us. Smaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly.As of January 31, 2012, our total headcount was 463 employees. None of our U.S. employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. Employees in certain European countries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We have not experienced any work stoppages.Our corporate headquarters occupy approximately 58,000 square feet in San Francisco, California under leases that expire in October 2013. As of January 31, 2012, we also lease approximately 11,000 square feet of office space in Cupertino, California to support our expanding business operations and hiring needs. As of January 31, 2012, we also lease smaller regional offices for sales, support and some product development in Seattle, Plano and Bethesda in the United States, and outside of the United States in Germany, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom. While we believe our facilities are sufficient and suitable for the operations of our business today, we are in the process of adding new facilities and expanding our existing facilities as we add employees and expand into additional markets.From time to time, we are a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, we currently believe that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business. Regardless of the outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources and other factors.The following table sets forth the names, ages and positions of our executive officers, key employees and directors as of April 5, 2012:has served as our President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of our board of directors since September 2008, and as our Chairman since December 2011.

See ""Description of Capital StockAnti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws"" for a discussion of other anti-takeover provisions found in our certificate of incorporation.In connection with this offering, we intend to list our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company's board of directors within a specified period of the completion of an initial public offering. In addition, the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company's audit, compensation and nominating and corporate governance committees must be independent. Under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market, a director is independent only if our board of directors makes an affirmative determination that the director has no material relationship with us.In December 2011, our board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. The determination of independence of members ofour board of directors was based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships. In making this determination, our board of directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with us and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director. Our board of directors has determined that Messrs. Connors, Hornik, Neustaetter, Smith, Sturiale and Thompson, representing six of our eight directors, are ""independent"" as that term is defined under the rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market for purposes of serving on our board of directors.We have entered into commercial dealings with eBay, including its subsidiary PayPal, and salesforce.com that we consider arms-length. eBay and salesforce.com are both our customers, and we are a customer of salesforce.com. We entered into these commercial dealings in the ordinary course of our business. In making the determinations as to which members of our board of directors are independent, our board of directors considered the fact that Mr. Thompson, one of our directors, was an executive officer of eBay and Mr. Smith, one of our directors, is an executive officer of salesforce.com. In reviewing these relationships, our board of directors determined that Messrs. Thompson and Smith do not and did not have a direct or indirect material interest in any such commercial dealings and that such relationships do not impede the ability of Messrs. Thompson and Smith to act independently on our behalf and on behalf of our stockholders.Our board of directors has the authority to appoint committees to perform certain management and administrative functions. Our board of directors has an audit committee, a compensation committee and a nominating and corporate governance committee, each of which has the composition and the responsibilities described below.Our audit committee oversees our accounting and financial reporting process and the audit of our financial statements and assists our board of directors in monitoring our financial systems and our legal and regulatory compliance. Our audit committee is responsible for, among other things:We believe that the functioning of our audit committee complies with the applicable requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and SEC rules and regulations.The members of our audit committee are Messrs. Connors, Hornik and Smith. Our board of directors has determined that both Messrs. Connors and Smith are financial experts as contemplated by the rules of the SEC implementing Section 407 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Mr. Connors has also been appointed to serve as our audit committee chairman.Our board of directors has considered the independence and other characteristics of each member of our audit committee and has concluded that the composition of our audit committee meets the requirements for independence under the current requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and SEC rules and regulations. Audit committee members must satisfy additional independence criteria set forth under Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. In order to be considered independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, an audit committee member may not, other than in his capacity as a member of the audit committee, accept consulting, advisory or other fees from us or be an affiliated person of us. Each of the members of our audit committee qualifies as an independent director pursuant to Rule 10A-3.Our compensation committee oversees our compensation policies, plans and programs. The compensation committee is responsible for, among other things:The members of our compensation committee are Messrs. Neustaetter, Sturiale and Thompson. Mr. Sturiale is the chairman of our compensation committee. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our compensation committee is independent within the meaning of the independent director guidelines of The NASDAQ Stock Market. We believe that the composition of our compensation committee meets the requirements for independence under, and the functioning of our compensation committee complies with, any applicable requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market and SEC rules and regulations, as well as Section 162(m) of the Code.Our nominating and corporate governance committee oversees and assists our board of directors in reviewing and recommending corporate governance policies and nominees for election to our board of directors and its committees. The nominating and corporate governance committee is responsible for, among other things:The members of our nominating and corporate governance committee are Messrs. Connors and Sturiale. Mr. Connors is the chairman of our nominating and corporate governance committee. Our board of directors has determined that each member of our nominating and corporate governance committee is independent within the meaning of the independent director guidelines of The NASDAQ Stock Market.Our board of directors may from time to time establish other committees.We have adopted a code of business conduct and ethics that is applicable to all of our employees, officers and directors, including our chief executive and senior financial officers. The code of business conduct and ethics will be available on our website at www.splunk.com. We expect that any amendment to the code, or any waivers of its requirements, will be disclosed on our website. The inclusion of our website in this prospectus does not include or incorporate by reference the information on our website into this prospectus.None of the members of our compensation committee is an officer or employee of our company. None of our executive officers currently serves, or in the past year has served, as a member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any entity that has one or more executive officers serving on our board of directors or compensation committee.We reimburse our non-employee directors for expenses incurred in connection with attending board and committee meetings. After this offering, we will continue to reimburse our non-employee directors for expenses incurred in attending board and committee meetings.The following table shows, for fiscal 2012, certain information with respect to the compensation of all of our non-employee directors.The compensation provided to our ""named executive officers"" for fiscal 2012 is set forth in detail in the Summary Compensation Table and other tables and the accompanying footnotes and narrative that follow this section. This section provides an overview of our executive compensation philosophy, the overall objectives of our executive compensation program, and each component of compensation that we provide. In addition, we explain how and why our board of directors, the compensation committee of our board of directors, and/or our Chief Executive Officer arrived at the specific compensation policies and decisions involving our executive officers, including the named executive officers listed in the Summary Compensation Table set forth below, during fiscal 2012.This section contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current plans, considerations, expectations, and determinations regarding future compensation plans and arrangements. The actual compensation plans and arrangements that we adopt may differ materially from currently anticipated plans and arrangements as summarized in this section.Our named executive officers for fiscal 2012, which consist of those executive officers who appear in the Summary Compensation Table, were:We operate in a highly competitive business environment, which is characterized by frequent technological advances, rapidly changing market requirements, and the emergence of new market entrants. To grow our business successfully in this dynamic environment, we must continually develop and enhance our products and services to stay ahead of customer needs and challenges. To achieve these objectives, we need a highly talented and seasoned team of technical, sales, marketing, operations, and other business professionals.We compete with many other companies in seeking to attract and retain a skilled management team. To meet this challenge, we have implemented compensation practices that are designed to motivate them to pursue our corporate objectives while encouraging the creation of long-term value for our stockholders. We evaluate and reward our executive officers through compensation intended to motivate them to identify and capitalize on opportunities to grow our business. We strive to provide a compensation package to each executive that is competitive, rewards achievement of our business objectives, drives thedevelopment of a successful and profitable business, and aligns the interests of executives with our stockholders through equity ownership in the company.We strive to ensure that the total compensation paid to our executive officers is fair, reasonable and competitive, and aligns with our general compensation practices. Our executive compensation program combines short- and long-term components, and cash and equity in amounts and proportions that we believe are most appropriate to incentivize and reward our executive officers for achieving our objectives.Our historic executive compensation program reflects our operations as a private company, as we have relied upon our board of directors, our compensation committee, the experience of our executive management, and market data in determining the appropriate compensation levels with respect to our executives.Historically, compensation decisions for our named executive officers have been determined by our board of directors, except for Mr. Kapur's compensation, which has been determined by our CEO and, following the hiring of Mr. Conte, by Mr. Conte, Mr. Kapur's direct supervisor. For all other named executive officers other than our CEO, our CEO has made recommendations and provided substantial input for setting compensation. Our CEO has recommended compensation adjustments for our executive officers following his evaluation of each named executive officer's performance (other than himself) relative to expectations and to the performance of our other employees. Prior to fiscal 2011, our CEO's compensation was set by the board of directors, in its discretion and based on the collective experience of our directors.At the end of fiscal 2010, we established our compensation committee, which generally evaluated, reviewed, and made recommendations to our board of directors on compensation for our executive officers (including our CEO) for fiscal 2011, except with respect to Mr. Kapur's compensation. Our CEO continued to make recommendations and provide input on compensation for the other named executive officers, other than himself. Our compensation committee reviewed our CEO's compensation for fiscal 2011 and made recommendations to our board of directors. Compensation decisions for all of our named executive officers ultimately have been made by our board of directors, except for Mr. Kapur's compensation.At the beginning of each fiscal year, our board of directors, after consulting with management and the compensation committee, has been responsible for establishing our corporate performance objectives, making decisions with respect to any base salary adjustment, and approving the target annual cash bonus opportunities for our named executive officers and any applicable individual performance objectives for our CEO. Our CEO then used these objectives as guidelines for developing the individual performance objectives for the other members of the management team, including the named executive officers. Any recommendations for equity awards to our named executive officers have been submitted to our compensation committee for its evaluation, and the compensation committee then made recommendations to the board of directors for its consideration and ultimate approval.For fiscal 2012, as we began to consider transitioning from a private company to a public company, we engaged Radford, an independent compensation consulting firm, to provide executive compensation data for comparable executives working for technology companies similarly situated to ours. Our board of directors considered the Radford analysis as references for establishing cash and equity compensation levels for our CEO and Messrs. Swan and Schodorf with an emphasis on technology companies with a similar size, stage of development, and growth potential. This data, along with the board's collective experience and the recommendations of our management and/or compensation committee, was considered in setting compensation for these named executive officers. The board of directors believed that this data served as a useful mechanism to stay competitive against industry norms and, at the same time, meet one of our principal compensation objectives of motivating our named executives to pursue our corporateobjectives. The board of directors did not use the data to benchmark the compensation for these named executive officers but to gain a general understanding of the market compensation practices and policies.Mr. Kapur's fiscal 2012 compensation was set by our CEO, based on his experience and his assessment of compensation levels for comparable positions. We concluded that our CEO was in the best position to assess his performance because he was not an executive officer. Our CEO determined cash and equity compensation levels for fiscal 2012 that would incentivize Mr. Kapur to assist us in achieving our strategic and financial goals. Following the hiring of Mr. Conte, Mr. Conte reviewed Mr. Kapur's compensation, including achievement of his incentive compensation and recommendations for new equity award grants. We believed that as Mr. Kapur's direct supervisor, Mr. Conte was in the best position to assess Mr. Kapur's performance.The compensation for Messrs. Conte and Stein during fiscal 2012 was determined through individual negotiations with our CEO in connection with their hiring during the year. In negotiating these arrangements, our CEO considered the market data and developed compensation packages that were competitive with industry norms for comparable executives and would incent Messrs. Conte and Stein to join the company. These compensation packages were submitted and approved by our board of directors. Going forward, the compensation for Messrs. Conte and Stein will be reviewed and established in a similar manner as Messrs. Swan and Schodorf.Our board of directors has emphasized remaining competitive by differentiating total cash compensation levels through the use of annual cash bonus arrangements. Equity compensation generally has been delivered on a discretionary basis with the goal to retain top talent and align the interests of our executive officers with the long-term interests of our stockholders. We granted equity awards to Messrs. Conte and Stein in fiscal 2012 in connection with their commencement of employment. The sizes of the equity grants to Messrs. Conte and Stein were established to be competitive with industry norms for comparable executives and to incent them to join the company.In June 2011, we conducted a review of internal pay equity and made an equity award grant to Mr. Kapur to reward him for his service as our principal financial officer and to continue to drive his performance to enhance stockholder value.In December 2011, our compensation committee engaged Radford to assist us in making equity grants to our executive officers, including our named executive officers (except for our CEO), to align their equity holdings with comparable executives at similarly situated companies. This process involved Radford developing a peer group of companies, reviewing the equity holdings of our executives as compared to this peer group of companies and making recommendations for potential refresh grants to our compensation committee. Our compensation committee reviewed the data and made refresh grants that were informed by the peer data but that were designed to achieve our incentive and retention goals. Our board of directors then approved our compensation committee recommendations for new equity awards to all named executive officers (except for our CEO). Our compensation committee and board determined that our CEO was properly incentivized with his current equity holdings.Following this offering, we anticipate our compensation committee, in consultation with management, will be primarily responsible for establishing, approving and adjusting compensation arrangements for our named executive officers, except for our CEO's compensation, which we anticipate will continue to be determined without input from management.Our compensation committee currently is comprised of Messrs. Neustaetter, Sturiale, and Thompson. Mr. Sturiale is the chairman of our compensation committee. Each member of our compensation committee qualifies as an ""outside director"" for purposes of Section 162(m) of the Code and a ""non-employee director"" for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act as well as an ""independent director"" under the requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market. Our compensation committee operates under a written charter that specifies its duties and responsibilities.The fundamental responsibilities of our compensation committee are:The compensation committee has the authority to engage its own advisors to assist it in carrying out its responsibilities. In late January 2011, the compensation committee engaged Radford to assist in reviewing our executive compensation for fiscal 2012. Radford was asked to provide executive compensation data to allow our compensation committee to understand the market practices for compensation paid to executives at similarly situated companies. After consideration of Radford's proposals, the compensation committee recommended increases to the base salaries and target incentive compensation opportunities of certain named executive officers to make these cash compensation opportunities competitive, and such increases subsequently were approved by our board of directors.In carrying out its responsibilities, our board of directors and the compensation committee work with members of our management, including our CEO and our human resources professionals. Typically, our management assists our board of directors and the compensation committee by providing information on corporate and individual performance, market data, and management's perspective and recommendations on compensation matters.Historically, the initial compensation arrangements with our executive officers, including the named executive officers, have been determined in negotiations with each individual executive at the time that he or she joined the company. Except for his own compensation arrangement, our CEO has been responsible for negotiating these arrangements, with the oversight and final approval of our board of directors and/or the compensation committee. Our CEO's initial compensation arrangement was negotiated by our board of directors. In negotiating the initial compensation arrangements with our CEO and executive officers, our board of directors or CEO considered external market data, which supported the determination that the initial compensation opportunities for our CEO and executive officers were comparable to the compensation opportunities of executives holding analogous positions at similarly situated companies.Typically, our CEO will make recommendations to our board of directors and/or compensation committee regarding compensation matters, including the compensation of our named executive officers (except with respect to his own compensation and Mr. Kapur's compensation). In setting compensation levels for Mr. Kapur, our CEO relies on market data, his experience, and his assessment of compensation levels for comparable positions. Our CEO also attends our board meetings, except with respect to discussions involving his own compensation and meetings of our non-employee directors.While our board of directors solicits and reviews our CEO's recommendations and proposals with respect to compensation-related matters, our board of directors only uses these recommendations and proposals as one factor in making compensation decisions, along with the market data and compensation committee recommendations.In December 2011, our compensation committee considered compensation data provided by Radford from certain publicly traded companies in order to determine the appropriate size of the ""refresh"" equity grants to make to its executive officers (other than its CEO). These publicly traded companies had revenues generally between $50 million and $500 million, had experienced strong year-over-year growth, and had a market capitalization between $500 million and $3 billion. The following is a list of the public companies that we reviewed, which we generally refer to as our ""peer group"":Our compensation committee asked Radford to provide data regarding option grants to our executives that would place them between the 50th and 75th percentiles for total direct compensation for comparable executives at peer group companies. Our compensation committee believed that assessing total direct compensation at the 50th and 75th percentiles of our peer group would assist us in retaining these executives and incentivizing them to enhance stockholder value. Our compensation committee reviewed the Radford recommendations and made slight adjustments to the equity award sizes provided by Radford to achieve our incentive goals. Each ""refresh"" equity award grant recommended by the compensation committee to our board of directors placed the applicable executive officer's total direct compensation at approximately the 50th percentile for comparable executives at peer group companies. Our board of directors approved the ""refresh"" equity awards in December 2011.The compensation program for our named executive officers consists of:These elements comprise our compensation program for our named executive officers because we believe they provide a compensation package that attracts and retains qualified individuals, links individual performance to company performance, focuses the efforts of our named executive officers on the achievement of both our short-term and long-term objectives, and aligns the interests of our named executive officers with those of our stockholders.As our needs evolve, we intend to continue to evaluate our philosophy and compensation programs as circumstances require, and at a minimum, we will review executive compensation annually.Currently, we do not have any pre-determined formula or target for allocating compensation between short-and long-term, fixed and variable, or cash and non-cash compensation. As a privately held company,executive compensation has been heavily weighted towards equity, which has been awarded in the form of stock options. Our board of directors determined that this form of compensation has encouraged our executives to achieve our strategic and financial goals, including revenue growth and continuous enhancement of our software. Our board of directors believes that making stock options a key component of executive compensation aligned the executive team with the long-term interests of our stockholders. To maintain a competitive compensation program, we have also offered cash compensation in the form of (i) base salaries to reward individual contributions and compensate our employees for their day-to-day responsibilities, and (ii) annual incentive compensation to drive excellence and leadership and incentivize achievement of our shorter-term objectives.We provide base salaries to our named executive officers and other employees to compensate them for services rendered on a day-to-day basis during the year. Base salaries typically will be used to recognize the experience, skills, knowledge and responsibilities required of each named executive officer, although competitive market conditions also may play a role in setting the level of base salary. Historically, we have not applied specific formulas to determine changes in base salary. Rather, the base salaries of our executive officers (other than the CEO and Mr. Kapur) were reviewed on an annual basis by the CEO and the board of directors and/or compensation committee based on their experience with respect to setting salary levels and supplemented by market data and assessments of the performance of the named executive officers. The market data historically has not driven compensation decisions but instead has been used as a reference for the CEO, the compensation committee and board of directors to understand the market compensation paid to executives holding comparable positions at similarly situated companies. Base salary increases have been made to reflect these considerations as well as our business condition and future expected performance and what our named executive officers could be expected to receive if employed at companies similarly situated to ours.While we historically have reviewed market data when setting compensation levels for our executive officers, in fiscal 2012, as we began to consider transitioning from a private company to a public company, we engaged Radford to provide executive compensation data for comparable executives working for technology companies similarly situated to ours to understand the market practices for paying compensation. After consideration of Radford's analysis, the recommendations of the CEO and/or the compensation committee, their review of market data, and negotiated terms (in the case of Messrs. Conte and Stein), the board of directors, exercising its judgment and discretion, determined to increase base salaries for certain of our named executive officers as set forth in the chart below. These increases were intended to bring them to a level that our board of directors, in consultation with our compensation committee and CEO, believed was competitive with industry norms. In making these increases, we did not benchmark the base salary for our executives to any specific level or percentage. Instead, the board of directors considered the increased contributions expected by certain members of the executive team in enabling our further growth and in preparing us to transition from a privately-held entity and determined that the salary increases would be appropriate in order to drive the desired performance. The base salary for each of Messrs. Conte and Stein were set during negotiations between our CEO and the applicable named executive officer as part of his initial compensation arrangement, and approved by our board of directors. In conducting these negotiations, our CEO consulted external market data and discussed the proposed compensation packages with Radford. The base salaries of Messrs. Conte and Stein ultimatelywere approved by our board of directors and generally were competitive with the base salaries of executives holding analogous positions at other technology companies similarly situated to ours.One of our compensation objectives is to have a significant portion of each named executive officer's compensation tied to performance. To accomplish this end, we provide for performance-based cash incentive opportunities for our named executive officers. Performance-based cash incentives are paid to our named executive officers based on the achievement of corporate performance objectives and, in most cases, individual performance objectives. Individual performance objectives generally are determined by our CEO, except for the CEO's compensation, which is determined by our compensation committee and approved by our board of directors. After we become a public company, these corporate and individual performance objectives will be established for the named executive officers by the compensation committee, in consultation with the CEO and management (except for the CEO's own incentive compensation opportunity), and performance against them will be determined or approved by the compensation committee. These objectives may change from year to year as the company and market conditions continue to evolve and different priorities are established.Historically, cash incentive compensation generally is paid based on the sum of the percentage achievement against each of the corporate goals and the individual performance goals, if any, although we have the authority to deviate from this approach. We believe this approach to our incentive compensation allows us to create a strong link of pay for performance, remain competitive and drive performance toward our goals.Each of our named executive officers (other than Mr. Kapur) entered into a written, individualized incentive compensation arrangement that provided for potential cash bonus payouts for fiscal 2012. These target cash bonus payouts generally were based on our actual achievement against pre-established corporate financial objectives as well as achievement againstindividual performance goals during the year (except for our CEO whose incentive compensation opportunity was based solely on achievement against our corporate financial objectives). Prior to the beginning of fiscal 2012, our board of directors approved our fiscal 2012 operating plan, which included financial objectives that our board of directors, in consultation with our compensation committee, used to design our CEO's incentive compensation opportunity for fiscal 2012. At the time these objectives were established, we were completing our prior fiscal year during which we exceeded our target bookings objective by approximately 129%. In recognition of the extraordinary efforts of our CEO and the management team in exceeding this objective, and consistent with the terms of their compensation plans, our CEO and other executive officers received cash bonus payouts in excess of their target incentive compensation opportunity for the prior year. Our board of directors, in an effort to continue to motivate our CEO and management team to further expand the growth and development of our business, established financial objectives for fiscal 2012 that it considered aggressive and attainable only with focused effort and execution by our CEO and management team. These financial objectives were designed to drive increased revenues, which our board of directors and management felt would directly result in increased stockholder value creation.Our CEO used the overall corporate objectives as guidelines for developing the individual performance goals for each named executive officer. These individual performance goals were intended to incentivize and drive performance towards attaining our company objectives.Mr. Kapur did not enter into a written, individualized compensation arrangement but was eligible to receive quarterly cash bonus payouts based on our actual achievement of pre-established corporate financial objectives and his achievement of pre-determined individual performance goals, as mutually determined by our CEO and Mr. Kapur.As in prior years, the target annual cash incentive compensation opportunities for our named executive officers were expressed as a target cash amount. The table below shows the target cash incentive compensation for each named executive officer:Our board of directors, compensation committee and CEO, exercising their judgment and discretion, based the fiscal 2012 target incentive cash opportunities for our named executive officers on the following factors: our overall financial and operational results for the prior fiscal year, the performance of the individual named executive officer, his potential to contribute to our long-term strategic goals, his role and scope of responsibilities within the company, his individual experience and skills, competitive market practices for annual cash incentive compensation opportunities, survey data of comparable executives at similarly situated companies, the Radford analysis, the recommendations of our management team, and, with respect to Messrs. Conte and Stein, their individual negotiations with our CEO.The target bonus opportunity for our CEO was based 100% on achievement of target revenues. The target bonus opportunities for Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein were based 50% on achievement of target revenues and 50% on achievement of individual performance goals. For the portion of the target bonus attributable to target revenues, these named executive officers would be eligible to receive a bonus only to the extent, and in the amount, that we achieved 90% of our revenues target (with payment opportunities for our CEO measured annually and for Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein measured at 85% of the calculated level for the first three quarters and the remaining 15% for those quarters measured along with the final quarter after the completion of the fiscal year and, for Messrs. Conte and Stein, prorated to the number of days they were employed). For our CEO to be eligible to receive a bonus payout at 100% of his target level, we would have to achieve our revenues target for fiscal 2012. For Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein to be eligible to receive bonus payouts at 100% of their target level, we would have to achieve our revenues target (with the bonus for the first three fiscal quarters paid at 85% of the calculated level and the remaining 15% for those quarters paid after the completion of the fiscal year with the final quarter bonus and prorated for the number of days they were employed with us, in the case of Messrs. Conte and Stein).In addition, to the extent that our revenues exceeded the target level for the year, our CEO and Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein would be eligible to receive a bonus payout based on a multiple of the payout at target level, payable following the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. The target level for the revenues performance measure was set to be aggressive, yet achievable, with diligent effort. As a result, the accelerator multiples set forth in the plans were significant and would yield up to a 3x cash bonus payout if revenues were in excess of the target. In setting target bonus opportunities for fiscal 2012, our compensation committee recommended and our board of directors approved a maximum fiscal 2012 bonus opportunity for our CEO of 3x his target bonus, which was consistent with the market practices reflected in the survey data and Radford analysis in light of the company's goals for fiscal 2012. Our compensation committee, after reviewing the cash bonuses paid to executives at similarly situated companies included in the survey data and the Radford analysis and consulting with our CEO, approved the same maximum threshold of 3x each named executive officer's target bonus opportunity for the portion of the target bonus opportunity applicable to revenue achievement.We believed this arrangement was appropriate given the aggressive nature of the revenues target and the diligent effort that would be required to exceed the target. The chart below illustrates the correlationsbetween performance as compared to our revenues target and the impact of varying levels of performance on the percentage of bonus earned.For the portion of their target bonuses attributable to individual performance, Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein would be eligible to receive bonus payouts based on our CEO's evaluation of each named executive officer's performance against his performance goals and, for each of Messrs. Conte and Stein, prorated to the number of days he was employed with us during fiscal 2012. The target bonus attributable to individual performance was adjustable based on the achievement of the corporate financial objectives. Thus, to the extent that our revenues exceeded the target level for fiscal 2012, Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein would be eligible to receive an increased bonus payout for the portion of the target bonus applicable to individual performance using the same accelerator multiple used for calculating the portion of the target bonus applicable to revenue achievement multiplied by up to a maximum of 1.1x the portion of the target bonus opportunity for individual performance. Our CEO believed this arrangement was appropriate given the diligent and focused effort that would be required to achieve the revenues target.The individual performance goals for Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein were established by our CEO and were based on the overall strategic objectives described below. There was no specific weighting assigned to these individual performance goals:As our Senior Vice President, Field Operations, Mr. Schodorf's target incentive compensation opportunity primarily was structured as a commission-based program, which provided for quarterly and annual cash payments based on the ability of our sales organization to achieve specified pre-established sales quotas (measured exclusively on bookings) throughout the year. Mr. Schodorf would be eligible to receive quarterly commission payments only to the extent, and in the amount, that we achieved at least 70% of our quota. For Mr. Schodorf to be eligible to receive commission payouts at 100%of the target level, we would have to achieve our quota (with commissions for the first three fiscal quarters paid at 85% of the calculated level and the remaining 15% for those quarters paid after the completion of the fiscal year with the fourth quarter commission payment). In addition, to the extent that we exceeded our quota for the year, Mr. Schodorf would be eligible to receive additional commission payments based on a multiple of the payout at target level, payable following the fourth quarter. The target level for this performance measure was set to be aggressive, yet achievable, with diligent effort during the year. As a result, the accelerator multiples set forth in Mr. Schodorf's plan were significant and would yield large commission payments if we exceeded our quota. There was no maximum threshold for Mr. Schodorf's commission opportunity because his commissions directly corresponded to achievement against our quota, as measured by bookings.As our senior sales executive, Mr. Schodorf's target commission opportunity was higher than the target incentive compensation opportunity of our named executive officers (other than our CEO) due to the strong link between his job responsibilities and our sales quota achievement. This was consistent with the incentive compensation opportunities for the top sales executives at similarly situated companies included in the survey data and the Radford analysis that our compensation committee and CEO reviewed before setting his fiscal 2012 incentive compensation opportunity. Therefore, the accelerator multiples used for calculating commissions based on sales quota achievement above target were lower than the multiples for the other named executive officers.We believed this arrangement was appropriate given the aggressive nature of the sales quota and the diligent and focused effort that would be required to exceed the target. The chart below illustrates the correlations between performance as compared to our quota and the impact of varying levels of performance on the percentage of commissions earned. As described above, there was no maximum threshold for Mr. Schodorf's commission opportunity.Under his incentive plan, Mr. Schodorf also was eligible to receive five $10,000 cash bonuses (a maximum of $50,000 in fiscal 2012) for achieving each of the following during fiscal 2012: (1) obtain customer reference stories in our core markets describing return on investment using Splunk, (2) drive a field plan to win accounts in web intelligence space, (3) design a sales management plan showing how accounts will be assigned, to whom, and how remote territory cooperation and splits will be achieved, (4) drive quarterly reporting for our reference accounts, and (5) recruit an executive for the education market. In addition, Mr. Schodorf was entitled to receive an additional commission payment of $6,517.The target bonus opportunity for Mr. Kapur was payable on a quarterly basis and was based (1) 50% on achievement of our bookings target and (2) 50% on achievement of individual performance objectives. For the portion of Mr. Kapur's target bonus attributable to corporate performance, Mr. Kapur's bonus payment would be determined on a straight-line basis based on our percentage achievement against our bookings target. For example, if we achieved 90% of bookings target in fiscal 2012, the portion of Mr. Kapur's target bonus attributable to corporate performance would be determined based on a multiple of 0.9x; if, on the other hand, we achieved 120% of our bookings target in fiscal 2012, the portion of Mr. Kapur's target bonus attributable to corporate performance would be determined based on a multiple of 1.2x. There were no minimum or maximum limitations. Our CEO believed this arrangement would incentivize Mr. Kapur and other non-executive employees, and provide financial rewards that directly correspond with the growth in our business, as measured by bookings.For the portion of Mr. Kapur's target bonus attributable to individual performance, our CEO, in consultation with Mr. Kapur, used our corporate performance goals, which included building and enhancing a developer ecosystem, expanding and developing products to generate new revenue streams, preparing us for an initial public offering, and driving revenue growth, to determine the portion of Mr. Kapur's target bonus attributable to individual performance. Mr. Kapur was eligible to earn up to 1.1x the portion of his target bonus opportunity relating to individual performance. There was no specific weighting assigned to these performance goals.After the conclusion of fiscal 2012, our compensation committee and our board of directors evaluated our performance against the revenues target set forth in the CEO's individual compensation arrangement. Our board of directors concluded that the company had achieved outstanding results including revenues that exceeded our target revenues for fiscal 2012. Our compensation committee recommended and our board of directors approved a bonus payment to our CEO equal to 2.1x his target bonus amount in accordance with the payment accelerators under his incentive compensation arrangement.Our CEO, in consultation with our management team, determined the extent to which our revenues target and the individual performance goals of Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein were achieved for the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, and approved the payment of quarterly bonuses to these executives at their respective target quarterly bonus amount for each of the first three quarters, and for Messrs. Conte and Stein, prorated to the number of days during the quarter in which they were employed. Following the end of fiscal 2012, our board of directors, in consultation with our compensation committee and CEO, reviewed the financial data and annual revenue achievement, and determined that we exceeded our annual revenues target. In accordance with the terms and payment accelerators in their incentive compensation arrangements, our compensation committee recommended and our board of directors approved for Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein cash bonuses following the end of fiscal 2012 equal to the full portion applicable to the fourth quarter, plus an additional amount resulting in the total cash bonuses payable to them relating to revenues achievement equaling 2.1x the portion of their target annual bonus relating to corporate performance.In addition, our CEO, in consultation with our management team, reviewed the performance of Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein and determined that each named executive officer's performance exceeded his individual performance goals and that each of them should be entitled to 110% of his target bonus relating to individual performance. Such determination was based on our CEO's overall subjective assessment of each named executive officer's performance, and no single factor was determinative in setting his achievement percentage, nor was the impact of any factor on their bonuses quantifiable. In consideration of exceeding our revenues target and the payment accelerators set forth in each named executive officer's incentive compensation arrangements, our compensation committee recommended andour board of directors approved for Messrs. Conte, Swan and Stein cash bonuses related to individual performance following the end of fiscal 2012 equal to 1.1x the portion of their respective target annual bonus relating to individual performance.Our CEO, in consultation with our management team, determined the extent to which our quota was achieved for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2012 and approved payments of quarterly commissions to Mr. Schodorf at his target quarterly amount for the first three quarters. Following the end of fiscal 2012, our board of directors, in consultation with our compensation committee and CEO, reviewed the financial data and achievement against our annual quota and determined that we achieved approximately 150% of our annual quota. In accordance with the terms and payment accelerators in his incentive compensation arrangement, our compensation committee recommended and our board of directors approved for Mr. Schodorf a cash commission payment following the end of fiscal 2012 equal to the full portion applicable to the fourth quarter, plus an additional amount resulting in the total commissions payable to him in fiscal 2012 equaling 2.97x his target annual commissions.Mr. Schodorf also received bonuses in fiscal 2012 for achieving certain of his performance goals. Our CEO and compensation committee recommended and our board of directors approved additional bonuses based on achieving his remaining performance goals, plus an additional $2,500 in recognition of his overall outstanding performance in rapidly expanding the growth of our business. We believed that paying him bonuses in excess of his target bonus amount was important to reward Mr. Schodorf for his role in procuring new customers and to continue to drive his performance throughout the next year to expand our business. Mr. Schodorf also received the additional $6,517 commission payment to which he was entitled under his incentive compensation arrangement.Our CEO (and after his hiring, Mr. Conte), in consultation with the rest of our management team, determined the extent to which our corporate bookings goals were achieved for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2012 and approved payments of quarterly bonus payments to Mr. Kapur above his target quarterly bonus amount for each of the first three quarters, based on our outstanding bookings achievement during those quarters. Following the end of fiscal 2012, our CEO and Mr. Conte reviewed the financial data and annual bookings achievement, and determined that we achieved approximately 150% of our annual bookings target. Mr. Conte approved a payment to Mr. Kapur equal to the full portion applicable to the fourth quarter resulting in the total cash bonuses payable to him relating to bookings equaling approximately 1.5x the portion of his target annual bonus relating to corporate performance.Mr. Conte also reviewed Mr. Kapur's individual performance against his performance goals and determined that Mr. Kapur's performance exceeded his individual performance goals and that he should be entitled to 1.1x his target bonus relating to individual performance. Such determination was based on Mr. Conte's overall subjective assessment of Mr. Kapur's performance, and no single factor was determinative in setting his bonus levels, nor was the impact of any factor on his bonus quantifiable. Mr. Conte approved a cash bonus payout to Mr. Kapur equal to 1.1x the portion of his target annual bonus relating to his individual performance.The chart below summarizes the total amount of incentive compensation payable to our named executive officers for fiscal 2012:We believe that strong, long-term corporate performance is achieved with a corporate culture that encourages a long-term focus by our named executive officers through the use of stock-based awards, the value of which depends on our stock performance. Our equity-based incentives historically have been granted in the form of stock options. We grant stock options to provide our named executive officers with incentives to help align their interests with the interests of our stockholders and to enable them to participate in the long-term appreciation of our stockholder value. Additionally, stock options provide an important retention tool for us to retain our named executive officers, as they are subject to vesting over an extended period of time subject to continued service with us. Going forward, we may introduce other forms of stock-based compensation awards as we deem appropriate into our executive compensation program to offer executive officers additional types of long-term equity incentives that further this objective.Historically, the size and material terms of the initial stock option grants made to our executive officers, including our named executive officers, were determined after consideration of external market data and our assessment of initial equity grants made to comparable executives at similarly situated companies. Following the initial stock option grants, we have not followed an established set of criteria for granting equity awards. Instead, our board of directors has exercised its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our CEO and compensation committee, and considered, the following factors: the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive factors, external market data, the amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named executive officer relative to our then-outstanding equity securities, peer group equity compensation data (for December 2011 grants only), andthe cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer, to determine its recommendations for stock options. We do not have any program, plan or practice to time stock option grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information.At this time, the board of directors has not adopted stock ownership guidelines with respect to the named executive officers or otherwise, although it may consider doing so in the future. In connection with the offering, we have established an insider trading policy that prohibits, among other things, short sales, hedging of stock ownership positions, and transactions involving derivative securities relating to our common stock.In fiscal 2012, our compensation committee recommended and our board of directors approved the equity grants listed in the table below to Messrs. Conte and Stein in connection with their commencement of employment. The size of the equity grants was negotiated with our CEO as part of the employment offer letter that each of these named executive officer's entered into with us. In negotiating the size of the equity grants, our CEO considered the market data and recommended option grants that were competitive with industry norms and would offer retention and incentive value to the applicable named executive officer.In June 2011, our compensation committee recommended and our board of directors approved the grant of a ""refresh"" stock option to Mr. Kapur to purchase up to 37,500 shares of common stock after its review of internal equity among its employees. This stock option grant was made to continue to drive his performance to enhance our value and better align his interests with the interests of our stockholders. In determining the number of shares subject to the stock option, the board of directors considered his current equity holdings, his responsibilities as our principal financial officer at the time, as well as what they believed Mr. Kapur could obtain from other companies if he were to leave for new employment.In December 2011, our compensation committee recommended, and our board of directors approved, ""refresh"" grants for our named executive officers after consulting the Radford equity compensation data for our peer group (except for Mr. Kapur's grant). The size of the equity awards granted to our named executives was determined by our compensation committee, after consideration of Radford's recommendations for executive officers (other than Mr. Kapur), and approved by our board of directors, place these named executive officers' total direct compensation at approximately the 50th percentile for comparable executives of our peer group. Mr. Conte exercised his discretion and judgment in recommending to the board of directors an additional equity award for Mr. Kapur that would properly incentivize him. This award was approved by our board of directors. We believed this was important to retain our named executive officers, including Mr. Kapur. The chart below summarizes the ""refresh"" equity awards made in December 2011:We did not make any equity grants to our CEO. The board of directors determined that, given his then-current equity holdings, he was, at that time, sufficiently incentivized and had a stake in the success ofthe company that appropriately aligned his interests with those of our stockholders. Our compensation committee and board of directors review the equity compensation, including the retention and incentive value of the awards, in order to determine whether and when additional equity compensation is appropriate.Our named executive officers are eligible to participate in the same group insurance and employee benefit plans generally available to our other salaried employees in the United States. We provide employee benefits to all eligible employees in the United States, including our named executive officers, which the compensation committee believes are reasonable and consistent with its overall compensation objective to better enable us to attract and retain employees. These benefits include medical, dental, vision, and disability benefits and other plans and programs made available to eligible employees. In September 2011, we implemented special long-term disability coverage for our executive officers, including our named executive officers, who are eligible for disability coverage until approximately age 66 if they cannot return to their own occupation. At this time, we do not provide any other special plans or programs for our named executive officers. Accordingly, employee benefits and perquisites are reviewed from time to time only to ensure that benefit levels remain competitive for the company as a whole but are not included in the compensation committee's annual determination of a named executive officer's compensation package.The offer letters and amendments entered into with our named executive officers provide certain protections in the event of their termination of employment under specified circumstances, including following a change in control of our company. Mr. Swan did not previously have a written employment arrangement and his letter states the current terms of his employment. We believe that these protections serve our executive retention objectives by helping our named executive officers maintain continued focus and dedication to their responsibilities to maximize stockholder value, including in the event of a transaction that could result in a change in control of our company. The terms of these letters and amendments were determined after review by the compensation committee and our board of directors of our retention goals for each executive and thereafter considered and approved by our board of directors. For a summary of the material terms and conditions of these severance and change in control arrangements, see ""Potential Payments Upon Termination and Upon Termination Following Change in Control.""Generally, Section 162(m) of the Code disallows a tax deduction to any publicly-held corporation for any remuneration in excess of $1 million paid in any taxable year to its chief executive officer and to certain other highly compensated officers. Remuneration in excess of $1 million may be deducted if, among other things, it qualifies as ""performance-based compensation"" within the meaning of the Code.As a privately-held corporation, we have not previously taken the deductibility limit imposed by Section 162(m) into consideration in setting compensation for our executive officers. Further, under a certain Section 162(m) exception, certain compensation paid pursuant to a compensation plan in existence before the effective date of this public offering will not be subject to the $1 million limitation until the earliest of: (i) the expiration of the compensation plan, (ii) a material modification of the compensation plan (as determined under Section 162(m)), (iii) the issuance of all the employer stock and other compensation allocated under the compensation plan, or (iv) the first meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected after the close of the third calendar year following the year in which the offering occurs. We expect that, where reasonably practicable, we will seek to qualify the variable compensation paid to our executive officers for the ""performance-based compensation"" exemption from the deductibility limit. As such, in approving the amount and form of compensation for our executive officers in the future,we will consider all elements of the cost to us of providing such compensation, including the potential impact of Section 162(m). Our compensation committee may, in its judgment, authorize compensation payments that do not comply with an exemption from the deductibility limit when it believes that such payments are appropriate to attract and retain executive talent.We did not provide any executive officer, including any named executive officer, with a ""gross-up"" or other reimbursement payment for any tax liability that he or she might owe as a result of the application of Sections 280G, 4999, or 409A of the Code during fiscal 2012, and we have not agreed and are not otherwise obligated to provide any named executive officer with such a ""gross-up"" or other reimbursement. Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code provide that executive officers and directors who hold significant equity interests and certain other service providers may be subject to an excise tax if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control that exceeds certain prescribed limits, and that the company, or a successor, may forfeit a deduction on the amounts subject to this additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or other service provider receives ""deferred compensation"" that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A of the Code.We follow Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718 (""ASC Topic 718""), formerly known as SFAS 123(R), for our stock-based awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to employees and directors, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on the grant date ""fair value"" of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.We account for equity compensation paid to our employees under the rules of ASC Topic 718, which requires us to estimate and record an expense for each award of equity compensation over the service period of the award. Accounting rules also require us to record cash compensation as an expense at the time the obligation is incurred.Our management assesses and discusses with our compensation committee our compensation policies and practices for our employees as they relate to our risk management, and based upon this assessment, we believe that any risks arising from such policies and practices are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us in the future.The following table provides information regarding the compensation of our named executive officers during fiscal 2012 and 2011.The following table presents information concerning grants of plan-based awards to each of our named executive officers during fiscal 2012.The following table presents information concerning equity awards held by our named executive officers at the end of fiscal 2012.The following table presents information concerning the exercise of options by our named executive officers during fiscal 2012. None of our named executive officers held any other stock awards during fiscal 2012.We do not provide a pension plan for our employees and none of our named executive officers participated in a nonqualified deferred compensation plan during fiscal 2012.The initial terms and conditions of employment for each of our named executive officers are set forth in written executive employment offer letters. With the exception of his offer letter, each of these letters was negotiated on our behalf by our CEO, with the oversight and approval of our board of directors. In January 2012, we entered into employment offer letters with Messrs. Sullivan, Conte, Swan, Stein and Schodorf setting forth the terms and conditions of such executive's employment with us. In March 2012, we entered into an amendment to Mr. Kapur's offer letter. Each of these employment offer letters and amendments provides for severance and change in control benefits, as described below under the ""Executive CompensationPotential Payments Upon Termination or Upon Termination Following a Change in Control"" section.We entered into an employment offer letter, dated August 19, 2008, with Godfrey R. Sullivan, our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, which set forth the initial terms and conditions of his employment with us. These terms and conditions were negotiated between Mr. Sullivan and our board of directors. We subsequently entered into a revised employment offer letter, dated January 11, 2012, with Mr. Sullivan. This letter supersedes the terms of his original employment offer letter and sets forth Mr. Sullivan's current annual base salary of $350,000 and his current annual target cash bonus of 90% of his base salary.We entered into an employment offer letter, dated June 30, 2011, with David F. Conte, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We subsequently entered into a revised employment offer letter, dated January 11, 2012, with Mr. Conte. This letter supersedes the terms of his original employmentoffer letter and sets forth Mr. Conte's current annual base salary of $275,000 and his current annual target incentive compensation of 50% of his base salary.We entered into an employment offer letter, dated January 11, 2012, with Erik M. Swan, our Chief Technology Officer. This agreement sets forth Mr. Swan's current annual base salary of $275,000 and his current annual target cash bonus of 50% of his base salary. Prior to January 2012, the terms of Mr. Swan's employment were not memorialized in any written employment offer letter or agreement.We entered into an employment offer letter, dated March 28, 2011, with Leonard R. Stein, our Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary, which sets forth the initial terms and conditions of his employment with us. We subsequently entered into a revised employment offer letter, dated January 11, 2012, with Mr. Stein. This letter supersedes the terms of his original employment offer letter and sets forth Mr. Stein's current annual base salary of $250,000 and his current annual target incentive compensation of 50% of his base salary.We entered into an employment offer letter, dated September 21, 2009, with Thomas E. Schodorf, our Senior Vice President, Field Operations, which sets forth the initial terms and conditions of his employment with us. We subsequently entered into a revised employment offer letter, dated January 9, 2012, with Mr. Schodorf. This letter supersedes the terms of his original employment offer letter and sets forth Mr. Schodorf's current annual base salary of $275,000 and his current annual target incentive compensation of 100% of his base salary.We entered into an employment offer letter, dated August 28, 2009, with Raman Kapur, our Vice President, Finance. This letter sets forth Mr. Kapur's initial annual base salary of $165,000 and eligibility for first year variable compensation of $16,500 based on achievement of individual goals and a company sales bookings goal. In connection with his appointment, Mr. Kapur was granted an option to purchase 75,000 shares of common stock at $0.62, which vests over four years. In March 2012, we entered into an amendment with Mr. Kapur to amend his offer letter to provide him certain severance and change in control benefits.Potential Payments Upon Termination or Upon Termination Following a Change in ControlWe have entered into agreements with Messrs. Sullivan, Conte, Swan, Stein, Schodorf and Kapur that may provide for benefits under the circumstances described below if the named executive officer's employment is terminated under certain conditions and enhanced benefits if the termination occurs in connection with a change in control. The material terms of these benefits are set forth below.If, prior to the three-month period before a change in control or following the 12-month period after a change in control, a named executive officer's employment is terminated without cause, he will be eligible to receive the following benefits if he timely signs a release of claims:If, within the period commencing three months before a change in control and ending 12 months after a change in control, his employment is terminated without cause or he resigns for good reason, he will be entitled to the following benefits if he timely signs a release of claims:The following table provides information concerning the estimated payments and benefits that would be provided in the circumstances described above for each of the named executive officers. For purposes of this table, a qualifying termination of employment is considered ""in connection with a change in control"" if such termination occurs within the period commencing three months before and ending 12 months after a ""change in control."" Payments and benefits are estimated assuming that the triggering event took place on January 31, 2012. For purposes of valuing accelerated vesting, the values indicated in the table are calculated as the aggregate difference between the fair market value of a share of our common stock underlying the option on January 31, 2012 and the exercise price of the applicable option, multiplied by the number of unvested shares accelerated. There can be no assurance that a triggering event would produce the same or similar results as those estimated below if such event occurs on any other date or at any other price, of if any other assumption used to estimate potential payments and benefits is not correct. Due tothe number of factors that affect the nature and amount of any potential payments or benefits, any actual payments and benefits may be different.Our board approved the 2012 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2012 Plan, in March 2012. The 2012 Plan will become effective as of the effective date of this offering, but is not expected to be utilized until after the completion of this offering. Our 2012 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code, to our employees and any parent and subsidiary corporations' employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants and our parent and subsidiary corporations' employees and consultants.The maximum aggregate number of shares of our common stock that is reserved for issuance pursuant to the 2012 Plan is equal to the greater of (1) nine percent of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the effective date of this offering or (2) 10,000,000, of which no awards are issued and outstanding. In addition, the shares reserved for issuance under our 2012 Plan will also include (a) those shares reserved but unissued under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2003 Plan, as of the effective date described above and (b) shares returned to the 2003 Plan as the result of expiration or termination of awards (provided that the maximum number of shares that may be added to the 2012 Plan pursuant to (a) and (b) is 25,000,000 shares). The number of shares available for issuance under the 2012 Plan will also include an annual increase on the first day of each fiscal year beginning in 2014, equal to the least of:Our board or a committee appointed by our board has the authority to administer our 2012 Plan. Our compensation committee will administer our 2012 Plan. In the case of awards intended to qualify as ""performance-based compensation"" within the meaning of Section 162(m) of the Code, the compensation committee will consist of two or more ""outside directors"" within the meaning of Section 162(m). Subject to the provisions of our 2012 Plan, the administrator has the power to determine the terms of the awards, including the exercise price, the number of shares subject to each such award, the exercisability of the awards and the form of consideration, if any, payable upon exercise. The administrator also has the authority to amend existing awards to reduce their exercise price, to allow participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator and to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered in exchange for awards with a higher or lower exercise price.The exercise price of options granted under our 2012 Plan must at least be equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The term of an incentive stock option may not exceed 10 years, except that with respect to any participant who owns more than 10% of the voting power of all classes of our outstanding stock, the term must not exceed five years and the exercise price must equal at least 110% of the fair market value on the grant date. Subject to the provisions of our 2012 Plan, the administrator determines the term of all other options. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, he or she may exercise his or her option for the period of time stated in his or her option agreement. Generally, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for 12 months. In all other cases, the option will generally remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. However, in no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term.Stock appreciation rights may be granted under our 2012 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Subject to the provisions of our 2012 Plan, the administrator determines the terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights become exercisable and whether to pay any increased appreciation in cash or with shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant.Restricted stock may be granted under our 2012 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of our common stock that vest in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. The administrator will determine the number of shares of restricted stock granted to any employee, director or consultant. The administrator may impose whatever conditions to vesting it determines to be appropriate (for example, the administrator may set restrictions based on the achievement of specific performance goals or continued service to us); provided, however, that the administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Shares of restricted stock that do not vest are subject to our right of repurchase or forfeiture.Restricted stock units may be granted under our 2012 Plan. Restricted stock units are bookkeeping entries representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of our common stock. The administrator determines the terms and conditions of restricted stock units including the vesting criteria (which may include accomplishing specified performance criteria or continued service to us) and the form and timing of payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator, in its sole discretion may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed.Performance units and performance shares may be granted under our 2012 Plan. Performance units and performance shares are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator will establish organizational or individual performance goals in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or the value of performance units and performance shares to be paid out to participants. After the grant of a performance unit or performance share, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such performance units or performance shares. Performance units shall have an initial dollar value established by the administrator prior to the grant date. Performance shares shall have an initial value equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned performance units or performance shares in the form of cash, in shares or in some combination thereof.Our 2012 Plan provides that all non-employee directors will be eligible to receive all types of awards (except for incentive stock options) under the 2012 Plan.Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our 2012 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards and only the recipient of an award may exercise an award during his or her lifetime.In the event of certain changes in our capitalization, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under the 2012 Plan, the administrator will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the plan and/or the number, class, and price of shares covered by each outstanding award, and the numerical share limits set forth in the 2012 Plan. In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.Our 2012 Plan provides that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under the 2012 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, except that if a successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary does not assume or substitute an equivalent award for any outstanding award, then such award will fully vest, all restrictions on such award will lapse, all performance goals or other vesting criteria applicable to such award will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction. The award will then terminate upon the expiration of the specified period of time. If the service of an outside director is terminated on or following a change in control, other than pursuant to a voluntary resignation, his or her options, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights, if any, will vest fully and become immediately exercisable, all restrictions on his or her restricted stock will lapse, and all performance goals or other vesting requirements for his or her performance shares and units will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and all other terms and conditions met.Our board has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the 2012 Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. Our 2012 Plan will automatically terminate in 2022, unless we terminate it sooner.Our board approved the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ""ESPP"") in March 2012. The ESPP will become effective as of the effective date of this offering.A total of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock will be made available for sale. In addition, our ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP on the first day of each fiscal year beginning in fiscal 2014, equal to the lesser of:Our compensation committee will administer the ESPP. Our compensation committee has full and exclusive authority to interpret the terms of the ESPP and determine eligibility to participate subject to the conditions of our ESPP as described below.Generally, all of our employees are eligible to participate if they are employed by us, or any participating subsidiary, for at least 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase stock under the ESPP if such employee:Our ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, and provides for consecutive 12-month offering periods. The offering periods generally start on the first trading day on or after June 15 and December 15 of each year, except that the first offering period will begin on the first trading day on or after the effective date of the registration statement and end on June 15, 2013. The administrator may, in its discretion, modify the terms of future offering periods.Our ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, which includes a participant's base straight time gross earnings, commissions, overtime and shift premium, but exclusive of payments for incentivecompensation, bonuses and other compensation. A participant may purchase a maximum of 5,000 shares during a purchase period.Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant are used to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of each 6-month purchase period. The purchase price of the shares will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of each offering period or on the exercise date. If the fair market value of our common stock on the exercise date is less than the fair market value on the first trading day of the offering period, participants will be withdrawn from the current offering period following their purchase of shares on the purchase date and will be automatically re-enrolled in a new offering period. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period, and will be paid their accrued payroll deductions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us.A participant may not transfer rights granted under the ESPP other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution, or as otherwise provided under the ESPP.In the event of our merger or change in control, as defined under the ESPP, a successor corporation may assume or substitute each outstanding purchase right. If the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the outstanding purchase right, the offering period then in progress will be shortened, and a new exercise date will be set. The administrator will notify each participant that the exercise date has been changed and that the participant's option will be exercised automatically on the new exercise date unless prior to such date the participant has withdrawn from the offering period.Our ESPP will automatically terminate in 2032, unless we terminate it sooner. Our board of directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate our ESPP, except that, subject to certain exceptions described in the ESPP, no such action may adversely affect any outstanding rights to purchase stock under our ESPP.Our board adopted and our stockholders approved the 2003 Plan in November 2003. The 2003 Plan was most recently amended by our board of directors in December 2011.Our 2003 Plan will be terminated in connection with this offering, and accordingly, no shares will be available for issuance under this plan. The 2003 Plan will continue to govern outstanding awards granted thereunder. The 2003 Plan provided for the grant of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options and restricted stock. As of January 31, 2012, options to purchase 21,905,290 shares of our common stock remained outstanding under the 2003 Plan.Our board or a committee thereof appointed by our board has the authority to administer the 2003 Plan. Currently, the compensation committee administers the 2003 Plan. Subject to the provisions of our 2003 Plan, the administrator has the power to determine the terms of awards, including the recipients, the number of shares subject to each award, the exercise price (if any), the fair market value of a share of our common stock, the vesting schedule applicable to the awards, together with any vesting acceleration, and the terms of the award agreement for use under the 2003 Plan. The administrator also has the authority, subject to the terms of the 2003 Plan, to institute an exchange program under which (i) outstanding options may be surrendered in exchange for options of the same type (which may have lower or higher exercise prices and different terms), options of a different type and/or cash and/or (ii) the exercise price of an outstanding option is reduced, to prescribe rules and regulations pertaining to the 2003 Plan, including the establishment of sub-plans for the purposes of satisfying applicable foreign laws, and to construe and interpret the 2003 Plan and awards granted thereunder.The administrator may grant options. The exercise price per share of all options must equal at least 100% of the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant. The term of an option may not exceed 10 years. An incentive stock option held by a participant who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, or any parent or subsidiary corporations, may not have a term in excess of five years and must have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value per share of our common stock on the date of grant. The administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares or certain other property or other consideration acceptable to the administrator. After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, the participant may exercise his or her option, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, within three months of termination or such shorter or longer period of time as stated in his or her option agreement, no less than 30 days or to exceed five years. If termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, for six months or such longer period of time as stated in his or her option agreement not exceeding five years. However, in no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term.Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our 2003 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards, and only the recipient of an option may exercise such an award during his or her lifetime.In the event of certain changes in our capitalization, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under the 2003 Plan, the administrator will adjust the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the 2003 Plan and/or the number, class and price of shares covered by each outstanding award. In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable, and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.Our 2003 Plan provides that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under the 2003 Plan, each outstanding award will be assumed or substituted for an equivalent award. In the event that awards are not assumed or substituted for, then the awards will expire on such transaction at such time and on such conditions as the board will determine.Our board may amend the 2003 Plan at any time. As noted above, in connection with this offering, the 2003 Plan will be terminated and no further awards will be granted thereunder. All outstanding awards will continue to be governed by their existing terms.Our Executive Bonus Plan, or the Bonus Plan, was adopted by our board of directors in April 2012. The Bonus Plan allows our board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors to provide cash incentive awards to certain of our employees, including our named executive officers, based upon performance goals established by our board of directors or the compensation committee.Under the Bonus Plan, our board of directors or the compensation committee determines the performance goals applicable to any award, which goals may include, bookings, revenue, cash flow, earnings (which may include earnings before interest and taxes, earnings before taxes and net earnings), net income, net profit, net sales, operating cash flow, operating expenses, operating income, operating margin, overhead or other expense reduction, product release timelines, profit, return on assets, return on capital, return on equity, return on investment, return on sales, revenue growth, sales results, sales growth, stock price, time to market, total stockholder return, and individual objectives such as peer reviews or other subjective or objective criteria. Performance goals that include our financial results may be determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, or such financial results may consist of non-GAAP financial measures. The performance goals may differ from participant to participant and from award to award.Our board of directors or the compensation committee may, in its sole discretion and at any time, increase, reduce or eliminate a participant's actual award, and/or increase, reduce or eliminate the amount allocated to the bonus pool for a particular performance period. The actual award may be below, at or above a participant's target award, in the discretion of the board of directors or the compensation committee. Our board of directors or the compensation committee may determine the amount of any reduction on the basis of such factors as it deems relevant, and it is not required to establish any allocation or weighting with respect to the factors it considers.Actual awards are paid in cash only after they are earned. Payment of bonuses occurs as soon as practicable after they are earned, but no later than the dates set forth in the Bonus Plan.Our board of directors has the authority to amend, alter, suspend or terminate the Bonus Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant with respect to any earned bonus.We maintain a tax-qualified retirement plan that provides eligible employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax advantaged basis. Eligible employees are able to participate in the 401(k) plan as of the first day of the month following the date they meet the plan's eligibility requirements, and participants are able to defer up to 90% of their eligible compensation subject to applicable annual Code limits. All participants' interests in their deferrals are 100% vested when contributed. The 401(k) plan permits us to make matching contributions and profit sharing contributions to eligible participants, although we have not made any such contributions to date. Pre-tax contributions are allocated to each participant's individual account and are then invested in selected investment alternatives according to the participants' directions. The 401(k) plan is intended to qualify under Sections 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code. As a tax-qualified retirement plan, contributions to the 401(k) plan and earnings on those contributions are not taxable to the employees until distributed from the 401(k) plan and all contributions are deductible by us when made.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will become effective upon the completion of this offering contain provisions that limit the personal liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that will become effective upon the completion of this offering provides that we indemnify our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. In addition, our amended and restated bylaws that will become effective upon the completion of this offering provide that we indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our amended and restated bylaws that will become effective upon the completion of this offering also provide that we shall advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee orother agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity, regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions of Delaware law. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our board of directors. With certain exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including, among others, attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding. We believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. We also maintain directors' and officers' liability insurance.The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws that will become effective upon the completion of this offering may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty of care. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and our stockholders. Further, a stockholder's investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers. At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification.Below we describe transactions and series of similar transactions, during our last three fiscal years, to which we were a party or will be a party, in which:Other than as described below, there has not been, nor is there any currently proposed transactions or series of similar transactions to which we have been or will be a party other than compensation arrangements, which are described where required under ""Executive Compensation.""We are party to an investors' rights agreement which provides, among other things, that holders of our preferred stock, including stockholders affiliated with some of our directors, have the right to demand that we file a registration statement or request that their shares be covered by a registration statement that we are otherwise filing. For a more detailed description of these registration rights, see ""Description of Capital StockRegistration Rights.""We have entered into employment and consulting arrangements with certain of our current and former executive officers. See ""Executive CompensationExecutive Employment Arrangements.""We have also entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and officers. The indemnification agreements and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect upon the completion of this offering require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. See ""Executive CompensationLimitation on Liability and Indemnification Matters.""Many of our executive officers are entitled to certain severance benefits. See ""Executive CompensationPotential Payments Upon Termination or Upon Termination Following a Change in Control.""We have granted stock options to our executive officers and one of our non-employee directors. See ""Executive Compensation"" and ""ManagementNon-Employee Director Compensation.""Prior to this offering, we historically did not enter into transactions with related parties, including those described above unless a majority of the non-interested directors approved the transaction. In determining whether to approve a related party transaction, the board of directors would consider the material facts as to the related party's relationship or interest in the transaction.We have adopted a formal written policy that will be effective upon the closing of this offering providing that our executive officers, directors, nominees for election as directors, beneficial owners of more than 5% of any class of our common stock, any member of the immediate family of any of the foregoing persons, and any firm, corporation or other entity in which any of the foregoing persons is employed or is a general partner or principal or in a similar position or in which such person has a 5% orgreater beneficial ownership interest, are not permitted to enter into a related party transaction with us without the prior consent of our audit committee, subject to the exceptions described below. In approving or rejecting any such proposal, our audit committee will consider the relevant facts and circumstances available and deemed relevant to our audit committee, including, but not limited to, whether the transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances and the extent of the related party's interest in the transaction. Our audit committee has determined that certain transactions will not require audit committee approval, including certain employment arrangements of executive officers, director compensation, transactions with another company at which a related party's only relationship is as an employee or beneficial owner of less than 5% of that company's shares, transactions where a related party's interest arises solely from the ownership of our common stock and all holders of our common stock received the same benefit on a pro rata basis, and transactions available to all employees generally.The following table sets forth information regarding beneficial ownership of our common stock as of March 31, 2012 and as adjusted to reflect the shares of common stock to be issued and sold in the offering assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, by:We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with SEC rules. The information does not necessarily indicate beneficial ownership for any other purpose. Under these rules, the number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding includes shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants held by the respective person or group that may be exercised or converted within 60 days after March 31, 2012. For purposes of calculating each person's or group's percentage ownership, stock options and warrants exercisable within 60 days after March 31, 2012 are included for that person or group but not the stock options or warrants of any other person or group.Applicable percentage ownership is based on 80,486,577 shares of common stock outstanding at March 31, 2012, and assumes the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock on a one-for-one basis into 56,930,194 shares of common stock. For purposes of the table below, we have assumed that 92,993,855 shares of common stock will be outstanding upon completion of this offering.Unless otherwise indicated and subject to applicable community property laws, to our knowledge, each stockholder named in the following table possesses sole voting and investment power over the shareslisted. Unless otherwise noted below, the address of each person listed on the table is c/o Splunk Inc., 250 Brannan Street, San Francisco, California 94107.The following is a summary of the rights of our common stock and preferred stock and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as they will be in effect upon the completion of this offering. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.Immediately following the completion of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of 1,020,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which:As of January 31, 2012, we had outstanding 80,022,601 shares of common stock, held by approximately 192 stockholders of record, assuming the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock as of January 31, 2012 into 56,930,194 shares of common stock. Pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation, our preferred stock will automatically convert into common stock effective upon the closing of this offering. In addition, as of January 31, 2012, we had outstanding options to acquire 21,905,290 shares of our common stock and outstanding warrants that will become exercisable into 469,557 shares of common stock.The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders and do not have cumulative voting rights. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors standing for election. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to receive ratably any dividends declared by our board of directors out of assets legally available. See the section entitled ""Dividend Policy."" Upon our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock.After the completion of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding. Pursuant to our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by the stockholders, to issue from time to time up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, redemption rights, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on the common stock, diluting the voting power of the common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of the common stock or delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. Such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. We currently have no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.As of January 31, 2012, a warrant to purchase 404,651 shares of our Series C preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.56 per share was outstanding. Upon the closing of this offering, this warrant will become exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock.As of January 31, 2012, a warrant to purchase 26,444 shares of our Series C preferred stock and a warrant to purchase 38,462 shares of our Series C preferred stock were outstanding at an exercise price of $1.56 per share. Upon the closing of this offering, these warrants will become exercisable for the same number of shares of common stock.All of these warrants have a net exercise provision under which its holder may, in lieu of payment of the exercise price in cash, surrender the warrant and receive a net amount of shares based on the fair market value of our preferred stock at the time of exercise of the warrant after deduction of the aggregate exercise price. Each warrant contains provisions for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrant in the event of certain stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations, reclassifications and consolidations. Certain of the holders of the shares issuable upon exercise of our warrants are entitled to registration rights with respect to such shares as described in greater detail under the heading ""Registration Rights.""Following this offering's completion, the holders of an aggregate of 66,986,549 shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act. These rights are provided under the terms of an investors' rights agreement between us and the holders of these shares, which was entered into in connection with our preferred stock financings, and include demand registration rights, short-form registration rights and piggyback registration rights. These registration rights are assignable, subject to certain conditions, including that the assignee be bound by the terms and conditions of the investors' rights agreement.The holders of an aggregate of 66,986,549 shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to demand registration rights. Under the terms of the investors' rights agreement, at any time after the earlier of (i) one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date of this offering and (ii) August 31, 2010, we will be required, upon the written request by the holders of at least thirty percent (30%) of the shares that are entitled to rights under the investors' rights agreement, to use our best efforts to register all or a portion of these shares for public resale. We are not required to effect a registration pursuant to this provision of the investors' rights agreement if (i) the shares requested to be registered do not represent twenty percent (20%) or more of the total number of registrable securities then outstanding and the aggregate public offering price would be less than $5.0 million or (ii) during any ninety (90) days prior to our good faith estimate of the date of filing of, and ending on a date one hundred eighty (180) days following the effective date of, any company-initiated registration under the Securities Act (other than a registration relating solely to any employee benefit plan or a corporate reorganization). If such a registration is to be an underwritten offering, then the holders' registration rights are conditioned on such holders' participation in such underwriting. We may defer the filing of a registration statement once during any twelve (12) month period for a period of not more than ninety (90) days, if we provide a certificate stating that in good faith our board of directors believes it would be seriously detrimental to us and our stockholders for the registration statement to be effected at that time.The holders of an aggregate of 66,986,549 shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are also entitled to S-3 registration rights. If we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3 andhave not done so within the preceding 12 month period, these holders have the right, upon written request to us, to have such shares registered by us if the proposed aggregate offering price of the shares to be registered by the holders requesting registration is at least $1.0 million, subject to certain exceptions. However, we may defer the filing of the Form S-3 registration statement once during any 12 month period for a period of not more than 90 days, if we provide a certificate stating that in good faith our board of directors believes it would be seriously detrimental to us and our stockholders for the Form S-3 registration statement to be effected at that time.The holders of an aggregate of 66,986,549 shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to piggyback registration rights. If we register any of our securities for our own account (other than to any employee benefit plan or a corporate reorganization), the holders of these shares are entitled to include their shares in the registration. If such a registration is to be an underwritten offering, then the holders' registration rights are conditioned on such holders' participation in such underwriting.The registration rights are subject to certain conditions and limitations, including the right of the underwriters of an offering to limit the number of shares of common stock to be included in the registration. We are generally required to bear the expenses of all registrations, except underwriting discounts and commissions. The investors' rights agreement also contains the mutual commitment of us and the holders to indemnify each other for losses attributable to untrue statements or omission of a material fact or violations of the Securities Act or state securities laws incurred by us with registrations under the agreement. The investors' rights agreement also contains an agreement by the holders not to sell or otherwise transfer or dispose of securities for a period of up to 180 days (or such other period as may be requested by the company or the underwriters) following the completion of this offering.With respect to all holders of registrable securities who hold less than two percent of our outstanding capital stock immediately following the closing of this offering, the registration rights and our obligations terminate five years after the closing of this offering. With respect to all holders of registrable securities who hold equal to or greater than two percent of our outstanding capital stock immediately following the closing of this offering and at all times thereafter hold a number of registrable securities equal to or greater than one percent of our outstanding capital stock, the registration rights and our obligations terminate seven years after the closing of this offering. The registration rights and our obligations terminate with respect to all registrable securities that may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, unless the holder of such securities holds a number of registrable securities equal to more than one percent of our outstanding capital stock.Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and BylawsOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain certain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging another party from acquiring control of us. These provisions and certain provisions of Delaware law, which are summarized below, could discourage takeovers, coercive or otherwise. These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us.As discussed above, our board of directors has the ability to designate and issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could deter hostile takeovers or delay changes in our control or management.Our certificate of incorporation provides that our stockholders may not act by written consent. This limit on the ability of stockholders to act by written consent may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions. As a result, the holders of a majority of our capital stock would not be able to amend bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of stockholders called in accordance with the bylaws.In addition, our bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer, the president (in the absence of a chief executive officer) or our board of directors. A stockholder may not call a special meeting, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for holders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.Our bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee of the board of directors. These may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed, and may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempt to obtain control of our company.Our board of directors is divided into three classes. The directors in each class will serve for a three-year term, one class being elected each year by our stockholders. In addition, directors may only be removed for cause. This system of electing and removing directors may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us because it generally makes it more difficult and takes more time for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors.We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless:Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporation's outstanding voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of directors does not approve in advance. We also anticipate that Section 203 may discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.The provisions of Delaware law and the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they might also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions might also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is also possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.Upon the completion of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC. The transfer agent's address is 6201 15th Avenue, Brooklyn, New York 11219.We have applied to list our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol ""SPLK.""Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of shares of common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market after this offering, or the possibility of these sales occurring, could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock or impair our ability to raise equity capital.Upon the completion of this offering based on shares outstanding as of January 31, 2012, a total of 92,529,879 shares of common stock will be outstanding, assuming the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock as of January 31, 2012 into shares of common stock upon the completion of this offering. Of these shares, all shares of common stock sold in this offering by us or the selling stockholders, plus any shares sold upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, will be freely tradable in the public market without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless these shares are held by ""affiliates,"" as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. The remaining 79,029,879 shares of common stock will be ""restricted securities,"" as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These restricted securities are eligible for public sale only if they are registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rules 144 or 701 under the Securities Act. As a result of market standoff agreements, lock-up agreements with the underwriters described in ""Underwriters"", and the provisions of Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, the restricted securities will be available for sale in the public market as follows:In addition, of the 21,905,290 shares of our common stock that were subject to stock options outstanding as of January 31, 2012, options to purchase 8,046,806 shares of common stock were vested as of January 31, 2012 and will be eligible for sale 180 days following the effective date of this offering, subject to extension as described in the section entitled ""Underwriters.""In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, once we have been subject to public company reporting requirements for at least 90 days, a person who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, is entitled to sell such shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144. If such a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, then such person is entitled to sell such shares without complying with any of the requirements of Rule 144.In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell upon expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, within any three-month period beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.Rule 701 generally allows a stockholder who purchased shares of our common stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but without being required to comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares, however, are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling such shares pursuant to Rule 701.We, the selling stockholders, all of our directors and officers and the holders of approximately 96% of our stock and other equity securities outstanding immediately prior to this offering have agreed that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC on behalf of the underwriters, we and they will not, during the period ending 180 days after the date of this prospectus:whether any transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of shares of our common stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. These agreements are subject to certain exceptions. For example, certain of our officers may exercise options to purchase shares of common stock during the restricted period described above; no sales of the shares received upon exercise may occur until after the expiration of the applicable lock-up agreements entered into by such officer in connection with this offering. These agreements are also subject to extension for up to an additional 34 days, as set forth in the section entitled ""Underwriters.""Following the closing of this offering, certain of our officers and directors may adopt written plans, known as Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, in which they will contract with a broker to buy or sell shares of our common stock on a periodic basis to diversify their assets and investments. Under these 10b5-1 trading plans, a broker may execute trades pursuant to parameters established by the officer or director when entering into the plan, without further direction from such officer or director. Such sales would not commence until the expiration of the applicable lock-up agreements entered into by such officer or director in connection with this offering.Upon completion of this offering, the holders of 66,986,549 shares of common stock or their transferees will be entitled to various rights with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in these shares becoming fully tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of theregistration, except for shares purchased by affiliates. See ""Description of Capital StockRegistration Rights"" for additional information.We intend to file a registration statement on Form S-8 under the Securities Act to register the shares of common stock issued or reserved for issuance under our stock option plans. We expect to file this registration statement after this offering. Shares covered by this registration statement will be eligible for sale in the public market upon the expiration or release from the terms of the lock-up agreements and subject to vesting of such shares.The following discussion is a summary of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable to non-U.S. holders (as defined below) of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of our common stock sold pursuant to this offering. This discussion is not a complete analysis of all the potential U.S. federal income tax consequences relating thereto, nor does it address any tax consequences arising under any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws, the U.S. federal estate tax or gift tax rules or any other U.S. federal tax laws. This discussion is based on the Code, Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, judicial decisions and published rulings and administrative pronouncements of the Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, all as in effect as of the date of this prospectus. These authorities may change, possibly retroactively, resulting in U.S. federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below.This discussion is limited to non-U.S. holders who purchase our common stock pursuant to this offering and who hold our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, property held for investment). This discussion does not address all U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a particular holder in light of that holder's particular circumstances. This discussion also does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may be relevant to holders subject to special rules under the U.S. federal income tax laws, including, without limitation, persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than 5% of our capital stock (except to the extent specifically set forth below), certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States, an integral part or controlled entity of a foreign sovereign, partnerships and other pass-through entities, real estate investment trusts, regulated investment companies, ""controlled foreign corporations,"" ""passive foreign investment companies,"" corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid U.S. federal income tax, banks, financial institutions, insurance companies, brokers, dealers or traders in securities, commodities or currencies, tax-exempt organizations, tax-qualified retirement plans, persons subject to the alternative minimum tax, persons holding our common stock as part of a hedge, straddle or other risk reduction strategy or as part of a conversion transaction or other integrated investment or persons deemed to sell our common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.If a partnership (or other entity taxed as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes) holds our common stock, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, partnerships that hold our common stock and partners in such partnerships are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the specific U.S. federal income tax consequences to them of acquiring, owning or disposing of our common stock.PROSPECTIVE INVESTORS ARE URGED TO CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF ACQUIRING, OWNING AND DISPOSING OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITH RESPECT TO THEIR PARTICULAR SITUATIONS, AS WELL AS ANY TAX CONSEQUENCES ARISING UNDER ANY STATE, LOCAL OR NON-U.S. TAX LAWS, THE U.S. FEDERAL ESTATE OR GIFT TAX RULES, ANY OTHER U.S. FEDERAL TAX LAWS AND ANY APPLICABLE TAX TREATY.For purposes of this discussion, a non-U.S. holder is any beneficial owner of our common stock that is not a ""U.S. person"" or a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. person is any of the following:As described in the section titled ""Dividend Policy,"" we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock. If, however, we make distributions of cash or property on our common stock, such distributions will constitute dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under U.S. federal income tax principles. Amounts not treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes will constitute a return of capital and will first be applied against and reduce a non-U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in its common stock, but not below zero. Any excess will be treated as gain from the sale of stock and will be treated as described under the section titled ""Gain on Sale or Disposition of Our Common Stock.""Dividends paid to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock that are not effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business conducted by such holder generally will be subject to U.S. federal withholding tax at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividends, or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty. To receive the benefit of a reduced treaty rate, a non-U.S. holder must timely furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8BEN (or applicable successor form) certifying such holder's qualification for the reduced rate. This certification must be provided to us or our paying agent prior to the payment of dividends and must be updated periodically. If the non-U.S. holder holds the stock through a financial institution or other agent acting on the non-U.S. holder's behalf, the non-U.S. holder will be required to provide appropriate documentation to the agent, who then will be required to provide certification to us or our paying agent, either directly or through other intermediaries. Non-U.S. holders that do not timely provide us or our paying agent with the required certification, but that qualify for a reduced treaty rate, may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld by timely filing an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding possible entitlement to benefits under a tax treaty.If a non-U.S. holder holds our common stock in connection with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, and dividends paid on the common stock are effectively connected with such holder's U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States), dividends paid to the non-U.S. holder will be exempt from the U.S. federal withholding tax described above. To claim the exemption, the non-U.S. holder must furnish to us or our paying agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI (or applicable successor form), certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the non-U.S. holder's conduct of a trade or business within the United States.Any dividends paid on our common stock that are effectively connected with a non-U.S. holder's U.S. trade or business (and, if required by an applicable tax treaty, attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the non-U.S. holder in the United States) generally will be subject to graduated U.S. federal income tax rates, net of deductions and credits, in the same manner as if such holder were a U.S. person. Dividends that are effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business and paid to a non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty). Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules.Gain on Sale or Disposition of Our Common StockSubject to the discussions below regarding backup withholding and legislation relating to foreign accounts, a non-U.S. holder generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or disposition of our common stock unless:The gain described in the first bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at graduated tax rates on a net income basis in the same manner as if such holder were a U.S. person. A non-U.S. holder that is a corporation also may be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% (or such lower rate specified by an applicable tax treaty). Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding any applicable tax treaties that may provide for different rules.Gain described in the second bullet point above generally will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at a flat 30% rate (or such a lower rate specified by an applicable income tax treaty), but may be offset by U.S. source capital losses of the non-U.S. holder (even though the individual is not considered a resident of the United States), provided that the non-U.S. holder has timely filed U.S. federal income tax returns with respect to such losses.With respect to the third bullet point above, we believe that we currently are not, and we do not anticipate becoming, a USRPHC for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our U.S. real property interests relative to the fair market value of our non-U.S. real property interests and other trade or business assets, however, there can be no assurance that we will not become a USRPHC in the future. In the event we do become a USRPHC, as long as our common stock is ""regularly traded,"" as defined by applicable Treasury Regulations, on an established securities market, our common stock will be treated as a U.S. real property interest only with respect to a non-U.S. holder that actually or constructively holds more than 5% of our common stock at any time during the shorter of the five-year period preceding the date of disposition or the holder's holding period. We expect our common stock to be ""regularly traded"" on an established securities market, although we cannot guarantee that it will be so traded. If gain on the sale or other taxable disposition of our stock were subject to taxation under the third bullet point above, the non-U.S. holder would be subject to regular U.S. federal income tax with respect to such gain in generally the same manner as a U.S. person.Generally, we must report annually to the IRS and to each non-U.S. holder the amount of dividends paid to such holder, the name and address of the non-U.S. holder, and the amount of any tax withheld with respect to those dividends. This information also may be made available under a specific treaty or agreement with the tax authorities of the country in which the non-U.S. holder resides or is established. Under certain circumstances, the Code imposes an information reporting and a backup withholding obligation (currently at a rate of 28% but scheduled to increase to 31% for payments made after December 31, 2012) on certain reportable payments such as dividends paid on or the gross proceeds from disposition of our common stock. Backup withholding generally will not, however, apply to payments ofdividends to a non-U.S. holder of our common stock provided the non-U.S. holder furnishes to us or our paying agent the required certification as to its non-U.S. status, such as by providing a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI, or otherwise establishes an exemption. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding may apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that the holder is a U.S. person that is not an exempt recipient.Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be allowed as a refund or a credit against a non-U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.Legislation enacted in 2010 may impose withholding taxes on certain types of payments made to ""foreign financial institutions"" (as specially defined under these rules) and certain other non-U.S. entities. Under this legislation, the failure to comply with additional certification, information reporting and other specified requirements could result in withholding tax being imposed on payments of dividends and sales proceeds to foreign intermediaries and certain non-U.S. holders. The legislation imposes a 30% withholding tax on dividends on, or gross proceeds from the sale or other disposition of, our common stock paid to a foreign financial institution or to a foreign non-financial entity, unless (i) the foreign financial institution undertakes certain diligence and reporting obligations or (ii) the foreign non-financial entity either certifies it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or furnishes identifying information regarding each substantial U.S. owner. If the payee is a foreign financial institution, it must enter into an agreement with the U.S. Treasury requiring, among other things, that it undertake to identify accounts held by certain U.S. persons or U.S.-owned foreign entities, annually report certain information about such accounts, and withhold 30% on payments to account holders whose actions prevent it from complying with these reporting and other requirements. Under certain transition rules, any obligation to withhold under the legislation with respect to dividends on our common stock will not begin until January 1, 2014 and with respect to the gross proceeds of a sale or other disposition of our common stock will not begin until January 1, 2015. Under certain circumstances, a non-U.S. holder might be eligible for refunds or credits of such taxes. Prospective investors should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in our common stock.Under the terms and subject to the conditions contained in an underwriting agreement dated the date of this prospectus, the underwriters named below, for whom Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated are acting as representatives, have severally agreed to purchase, and we and the selling stockholders have agreed to sell to them, severally, the number of shares indicated below:The underwriters and the representatives are collectively referred to as the ""underwriters"" and the ""representatives,"" respectively. The underwriters are offering the shares of common stock subject to their acceptance of the shares from us and the selling stockholders and subject to prior sale. The underwriting agreement provides that the obligations of the several underwriters to pay for and accept delivery of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus are subject to the approval of certain legal matters by their counsel and to certain other conditions. The underwriters are obligated to take and pay for all of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus if any such shares are taken. However, the underwriters are not required to take or pay for the shares covered by the underwriters' over-allotment option described below.The underwriters initially propose to offer part of the shares of common stock directly to the public at the initial public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus and part to certain dealers at a price that represents a concession not in excess of $            a share under the public offering price. After the initial offering of the shares of common stock, the offering price and other selling terms may from time to time be varied by the representatives.We have granted to the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days from the date of this prospectus, to purchase up to an aggregate of 2,025,000 additional shares of common stock at the public offering price listed on the cover page of this prospectus, less underwriting discounts and commissions. The underwriters may exercise this option solely for the purpose of covering over-allotments, if any, made in connection with the offering of the shares of common stock offered by this prospectus. To the extent the option is exercised, each underwriter will become obligated, subject to certain conditions, to purchase about the same percentage of the additional shares of common stock as the number listed next to the underwriter's name in the preceding table bears to the total number of shares of common stock listed next to the names of all underwriters in the preceding table.The following table shows the per share and total public offering price, underwriting discounts and commissions, and proceeds before expenses to us and the selling stockholders. These amounts are shownassuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase up to an additional 2,025,000 shares of common stock from us.The estimated offering expenses payable by us, exclusive of the underwriting discounts and commissions, are approximately $4.0 million, which includes legal, accounting and printing costs and various other fees associated with the registration and listing of our common stock.The underwriters have informed us that they do not intend sales to discretionary accounts to exceed five percent of the total number of shares of common stock offered by them.Application has been made to have our common stock approved for listing on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the trading symbol ""SPLK.""We, the selling stockholders, all of our directors and officers and the holders of approximately 96% of our outstanding stock and other equity securities outstanding immediately prior to this offering have agreed that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC on behalf of the underwriters, we and they will not, during the period ending 180 days after the date of this prospectus (the ""restricted period""):whether any such transaction described in the first two bullet points above is to be settled by delivery of common stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. In addition, we and each such person agree that, without the prior written consent of Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC on behalf of the underwriters, we or such other person will not, during the restricted period, make any demand for, or exercise any right with respect to, the registration of any shares of common stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for common stock.The restrictions described in the immediately preceding paragraph do not apply to:The restricted period will be extended if:in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraphs will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or material event.Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, in its sole discretion, may release the common stock and other securities subject to the lock-up agreements described above in whole or in part at any time. When determining whether or not to release common stock and other securities from lock up agreements, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC will consider, among other factors, the holder's reasons for requesting the release, the number of shares of common stock and other securities for which the release is being requested and market conditions at the time.In order to facilitate this offering of common stock, the underwriters may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the common stock. Specifically, the underwriters may sell more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement, creating a short position. A short sale is covered if the short position is no greater than the number of shares available for purchase by the underwriters under the over-allotment option. The underwriters can close out a covered short sale by exercising the over-allotment option or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out a covered short sale, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the open market price of shares compared to the price available under the over-allotment option. The underwriters may also sell shares in excess of the over-allotment option, creating a naked short position. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in this offering. As an additional means of facilitating this offering, the underwriters may bid for, and purchase, shares of common stock in the open market to stabilize the price of the common stock. These activities may raise or maintain the market price of the common stock above independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in the market price of the common stock. The underwriters are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time.We, the selling stockholders and the underwriters have agreed to indemnify each other against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.A prospectus in electronic format may be made available on websites maintained by one or more underwriters, or selling group members, if any, participating in this offering. Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC may agree to allocate a number of shares of common stock to underwriters for sale to their online brokerage account holders. Internet distributions will be allocated by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC to underwriters that may make internet distributions on the same basis as other allocations.Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price was determined by negotiations between us and the representatives. Among the factors considered in determining the initial public offering price were our future prospects and those of our industry in general, our sales, earnings and certain other financial and operating information in recentperiods, and the price earnings ratios, price sales ratios, market prices of securities, and certain financial and operating information of companies engaged in activities similar to ours.The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment management, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates may in the future perform various financial advisory and investment banking services for us, for which they will receive customary fees and expenses. In the ordinary course of their various business activities, the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers and may at any time hold long and short positions in such securities and instruments. Such investment and securities activities may involve our securities and instruments.In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive (each, a ""Relevant Member State""), an offer to the public of any shares of our common stock may not be made in that Relevant Member State, except that an offer to the public in that Relevant Member State of any shares of our common stock may be made at any time under the following exemptions under the Prospectus Directive, if they have been implemented in that Relevant Member State:For the purposes of this provision, the expression an ""offer to the public"" in relation to any shares of our common stock in any Relevant Member State means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and any shares of our common stock to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase any shares of our common stock, as the same may be varied in that Member State by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that Member State, the expression ""Prospectus Directive"" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including the 2010 PD Amending Directive, to the extent implemented in the Relevant Member State), and includes any relevant implementing measure in the Relevant Member State, and the expression ""2010 PD Amending Directive"" means Directive 2010/73/EU.Each underwriter has represented and agreed that:The shares may not be and will not be publicly offered, sold or advertised, directly or indirectly in or from Switzerland and will not be listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange (""SIX"") or on any other stock exchange or regulated trading facility in Switzerland.

SPLUNK INC.   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   FISCAL YEARS ENDED JANUARY 31, 2010, 2011 AND 2012 Splunk Inc. (""Splunk"" or the ""Company"") provides an innovative software platform that enables organizations to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data. The Company's software collects and indexes data regardless of format or source, and enables users to search, correlate, analyze, monitor and report on this data. Splunk's software addresses large and diverse data sets, commonly referred to as big data, and is specifically tailored for machine-generated data. Machine data is produced by nearly every software application and electronic device in an organization and contains a definitive, time-stamped record of various activities, such as transactions, customer and user activities, and security threats. The Company's software is designed to help users in various roles, including IT and business professionals, analyze machine data and realize real-time visibility into and intelligence about their organization's operations. This operational intelligence enables organizations to improve service levels, reduce costs, mitigate security risks, demonstrate and maintain compliance and gain new insights that enable them to drive better business decisions.The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Splunk Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods covered by the financial statements and accompanying notes. In particular, we make estimates with respect to the fair value of multiple elements in revenue recognition, uncollectible accounts receivable, stock-based compensation, income taxes and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Immediately prior to the closing of a qualifying public offering (""IPO""), all of the outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock will automatically convert into shares of common stock. In addition, the outstanding preferred stock warrants will automatically be converted into warrants to purchase common stock upon effectiveness of an IPO. The January 31, 2012 unaudited pro forma consolidated balance sheet has been prepared assuming the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into 56,930,194 shares of our common stock and the automatic conversion of the outstanding Series C preferred stock warrants into common stock warrants. The exercise of the Series A preferred stock warrant occurred on December 24, 2011.For the three years ended January 31, 2012, international sales were primarily sourced in their respective countries and were denominated in U.S. dollars. We determined that for transactions during thisperiod, the functional currency was the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary balance sheet accounts were remeasured using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date and non-monetary items were remeasured at the historical exchange rate. Expenses were remeasured at the average exchange rates for the period. Foreign currency remeasurement and transaction gains and losses are included in Other Income (Expense), Net and were not material for the three years ended January 31, 2012. During fiscal 2012, in connection with the creation of foreign subsidiaries in Germany, Singapore, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, we determined the functional currency of each of these foreign subsidiaries is the respective local currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each period-end. Income statement amounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments arising from the use of differing exchange rates from period to period are included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss within Stockholders' Equity (Deficit).We generate revenues primarily in the form of software license fees and related maintenance and services fees. License fees include perpetual license fees, term license fees and royalties. Maintenance and services primarily consist of fees for maintenance services (including support and unspecified upgrades and enhancements when and if they are available), training and professional services that are not essential to functionality.We recognize revenues when all of the following conditions are met:Signed agreements are used as evidence of an arrangement. If a contract signed by the customer does not exist, we have used a purchase order as evidence of an arrangement. In cases where both a signed contract and a purchase order exist, we consider the signed contract to be the final persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Electronic delivery occurs when we provide the customer with access to the software via a license key. We assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement, primarily based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. We do not generally offer extended payment terms with typical terms of payment due between 30 and 60 days from delivery of software. We assess collectibility of the fee based on a number of factors such as collection history and creditworthiness of the customer. If we determine that collectibility is not probable, revenue is deferred until collectibility becomes probable, generally upon receipt of cash.When contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence (""VSOE"") exists for all undelivered elements and the services, if any, are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements, we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the ""Residual Method."" Perpetual license arrangements are typically accompanied by maintenance agreements. Maintenance revenues consist of fees for providing software updates on a when and if available basis and technical support for software products (""post-contract support"" or ""PCS"") for an initial term. Maintenancerevenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement. We have established fair value for maintenance on perpetual licenses due to consistently priced standalone sales of maintenance. Revenues related to term license fees are recognized ratably over the contract term beginning on the date the customer has access to the software license key and continuing through the end of the contract term. In these cases we do not have VSOE of fair value for maintenance as fees for support and maintenance are bundled with the license over the entire term of the contract.License arrangements may also include professional services and training services, which are typically delivered early in the contract term. In determining whether professional services revenues should be accounted for separately from license revenues, we evaluate whether the professional services are considered essential to the functionality of the software using factors such as the nature of our software products; whether they are ready for use by the customer upon receipt; the nature of our implementation services, which typically do not involve significant customization to or development of the underlying software code; the availability of services from other vendors; whether the timing of payments for license revenues is coincident with performance of services; and whether milestones or acceptance criteria exist that affect the realizability of the software license fee. Substantially all of our professional services arrangements are billed on a time and materials basis and, accordingly, are recognized as the services are performed. Training revenues are recognized as training services are delivered. VSOE of fair value of professional and training services is based upon stand-alone sales of those services. Payments received in advance of services performed are deferred and recognized when the related services are performed.We are unable to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements in certain arrangements that include term licenses, maintenance and services, due to the lack of VSOE for maintenance bundled with the term license. In these instances, all revenue is recognized ratably over the period that the services are expected to be performed. In arrangements where the expected service periods of maintenance services and professional or training services differ, we recognize all revenue over the longer of the expected service periods, which is generally the maintenance period.We do not offer credits or refunds and therefore have not recorded any sales return allowance for any of the periods presented. Upon a periodic review of outstanding accounts receivable, amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our policy is to record revenues net of any applicable sales, use or excise taxes.We recognize revenues from the indirect sales channel upon sell-through by the partner or distributor. A sell-through is determined when we receive an order form from a reseller for a specific end-user sale. We do not offer right of return, product rotation or price protection to any of our channel partners. We also have licensing arrangements with OEM and MSP customers for which royalty fees are generally recognized as revenue upon receipt of reports of units shipped or usage levels, respectively.In our consolidated statements of operations, revenues are categorized as license or maintenance and services revenues. We allocate revenues from arrangements containing multiple elements to each of these categories based on the VSOE of fair value for elements in each revenue arrangement and the application of the residual method for arrangements in which we have established VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements. In arrangements where we are not able to establish VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, we first allocate revenues to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has been established, then allocate revenues to any undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value hasnot been established based upon management's best estimate of fair value of those undelivered elements and apply a residual method to determine the license fee. Management's best estimate of fair value of undelivered elements for which VSOE of fair value has not been established is based upon the VSOE of similar offerings and other objective criteria.We consider all highly liquid instruments with original or remaining maturities of 90 days or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. As of January 31, 2011 and 2012, $13.1 million and $19.5 million, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents were invested in money market funds.Pursuant to the office lease agreement entered into in March 2008, we were originally required to maintain a minimum of $1.3 million in a letter of credit to the landlord for the security of the lease agreement. This amount is scheduled to be reduced over the term of the lease in accordance with the terms of the office lease agreement. At January 31, 2011 and 2012, we had $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively, of restricted cash satisfying the required amounts, which is held in a money market account. At January 31, 2011 and 2012, the current portion was $0.2 million and $0.1 million and the noncurrent portion was $0.6 million and $0.5 million, which amounts were included on the consolidated balance sheet in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and Other assets, respectively.Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We maintain the majority of our cash balance at one financial institution that management believes is a high-credit, quality financial institution and invest our cash equivalents in highly rated money market funds.At January 31, 2011, there was one customer that represented approximately 11% of total accounts receivable. At January 31, 2012, there was one customer that represented approximately 17% of total accounts receivable.Our accounts receivable is subject to collection risks. Our gross accounts receivable is reduced for this risk by an allowance for doubtful accounts. This allowance is for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. It is an estimate and is regularly evaluated for adequacy by taking into consideration a combination of factors. We look at factors such as past collection experience, credit quality of the customer, age of the receivable balance, and current economic conditions. These factors are reviewed to determine whether an allowance for bad debts should be recorded to reduce the receivable balance to the amount believed to be collectible.The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Based on borrowing rates currently available to us for financing obligations with similar terms and considering our credit risks, the carrying value of the financing obligation approximates fair value.Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the financial statements are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Hierarchical levels which are directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to the valuation of these assets or liabilities are as follows:Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. Our convertible preferred stock warrant liability is classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.We evaluate the recoverability of our long-lived assets including amortizable intangible and tangible assets in accordance with authoritative guidance on accounting for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. Acquired intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives. We evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. We recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds their fair value. If the fair value of the long-lived assets exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned, then the assets are not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned exceeds the fair value of the assets, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value. No impairment of long-lived assets has occurred in the fiscal periods presented.Deferred offering costs, consisting of legal, accounting and other fees and costs relating to the initial public offering, are capitalized. The deferred offering costs will be offset against our planned initial public offering proceeds upon the closing of the offering. In the event the offering is terminated, all of the deferred offering costs will be expensed within income from operations. There were $0 and $2.0 million capitalized as of January 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively.Property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets ranging from generally three to five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the remaining lease term. When assets are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation areremoved from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Maintenance and repairs that do not improve or extend the lives of the respective assets are charged to expense in the period incurred.The following table presents the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment:Capitalization of software development costs for software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, which is generally the completion of a working prototype that has been certified as having no critical bugs and is a release candidate. Amortization begins once the software is ready for its intended use, generally based on the pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. We did not capitalize any internal software development costs for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 because the cost incurred and the time between technological feasibility and product release was insignificant. We capitalized purchased technology of $0.5 million in December 2010, which is included in Other Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and is being amortized to Cost of License Revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over an 18 month period. For fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, total amortization expense was $0, $48,000 and $334,000, respectively.Costs related to software acquired, developed or modified solely to meet our internal requirements, with no substantive plans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during post implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage of the project are capitalized. We define the design, configuration, and coding process as the application development stage. For fiscal 2012, we capitalized $1.6 million of costs related to computer software developed for internal use, which is included in Property and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At January 31, 2012, depreciation of the capitalized software has not commenced as it has not been made available for its intended use.Commissions are recorded as a component of sales and marketing expenses and consist of the variable compensation paid to our sales force. Sales commissions are earned and recorded at the time that a customer has entered into a binding purchase agreement. Commissions paid to sales personnel are recoverable only in the case that we cannot collect the invoiced amounts associated with a sales order. Commission expense was $5.5 million, $9.9 million and $22.3 million for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.We lease our facilities under operating leases. For leases that contain rent escalation or rent concession provisions, we record the total rent expense during the lease term on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. We record the difference between the rent paid and the straight-line rent expense as a current and non-current deferred rent liability in Accrued expenses and other liabilities and Other liabilities, non-current, respectively in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rent expense was $1.6 million, $1.6 million and $2.6 million during fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.We expense advertising costs as incurred. We incurred $1.3 million, $2.0 million and $3.7 million in advertising expenses for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Advertising costs are recorded in Sales and marketing expenses within the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.The fair value of stock options granted is recognized as compensation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the related vesting periods. The expense recorded is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and therefore is reduced by estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We calculate the fair value of options using the Black-Scholes method and expense using the straight-line attribution approach.We account for equity awards issued to non-employees, such as consultants, in accordance with the guidance relating to equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling, goods or services, using the Black-Scholes method to determine the fair value of such instruments. Awards granted to non-employees are remeasured over the vesting period, and the resulting value is recorded as an expense over the period the services are received.We operate our business as one operating segment: the development and marketing of a software platform that enables our customers to gain real-time operational intelligence by harnessing the value of their data. Our chief operating decision maker is our Chief Executive Officer, who reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Substantially all of our long-lived assets are located in the United States.Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with authoritative guidance for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying accounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect ondeferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.We adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10, , on February 1, 2009. There was no impact upon adoption of ASC 740-10 as our liability recognized under previous accounting guidance was consistent with that required under the new guidance. We have adopted the accounting policy that interest expense and penalties relating to income tax position are classified within the provision for income taxes.In May 2011, the FASB amended its guidance related to fair value measurements in order to achieve common fair value measurements between U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments in the updated guidance explain how to measure fair value. They do not require additional fair value measurements and are not intended to establish valuation standards or affect valuation practices outside of financial reporting. The amendments change the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements. For many of the requirements, the updated guidance should not result in a change in the application of previous fair value measurement guidance. The updated guidance is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance on February 1, 2012 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.In June 2011, the FASB updated its guidance related to the presentation of comprehensive income. Under the updated guidance, an entity has the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both choices, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income, and a total amount for comprehensive income. The updated guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders' equity. The updated guidance does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The updated guidance will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The updated guidance must be applied retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance on February 1, 2012 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Allowance for doubtful accounts activity and balances are presented below:Property and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. These assets are depreciated and amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. Property and equipment consisted of the following:Depreciation and amortization expense was $0.9 million, $1.0 million and $2.1 million for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.Our certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, authorizes us to issue 106,511,960 shares of $0.001 par value common stock. At January 31, 2012, 23,092,407 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. Common stock reserved for future issuance was as follows:Stock options granted under our stock option plan provide certain employee option holders the right to exercise unvested options in exchange for shares of restricted common stock. Unvested shares, in the amounts of 58,997, 191,741, and 411,318 at January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, were subject to a repurchase right held by us at the original issuance price in the event the optionees' employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily. For exercises of employee options, this repurchase right generally lapses as to 1/4th of the shares subject to the option on the first anniversary of the vesting start date and as to 1/48th of the shares monthly thereafter.These repurchase terms are considered to be a forfeiture provision and do not result in variable accounting. The restricted shares issued upon early exercise of stock options are legally issued and outstanding. However, these restricted shares are only deemed outstanding for basic earnings per share computation purposes upon the respective repurchase rights lapsing. We treat cash received fromemployees for the exercise of unvested options as a refundable deposit shown as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, we recorded cash received for early exercise of options of $104,000, $108,000 and $1,139,000, respectively, in Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Amounts from accrued expenses and other liabilities are transferred into Common Stock and Additional paid-in capital as the shares vest.We are authorized to issue 57,904,560 shares of convertible preferred stock. Shares issued and outstanding were as follows:The rights, preferences and privileges of the Series A, Series B and Series C are as follows:In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of the preferred stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid, prior and in preference to any payment or distribution (or any setting apart of any payment or distribution) of any available funds and assets on any share of common stock, $0.25, $0.4925 and $1.56 per share plus all declared and unpaid dividends thereon for Series A, Series B and Series C, respectively. If, upon the occurrence of such event, the available funds and assets to be distributed to the holders of the preferred stock shall be insufficient to permit the payment in full, then all of the available funds and assets shall be distributed among the holders of then outstanding preferred stock pro rata on an equal priority, pari passu basis, according to their respective liquidation preferences as set forth therein. The remaining assets, if any, shall be distributed to the common stockholders. These liquidity features cause our convertible preferred stock to be classified as mezzanine equity, rather than a component of stockholders' deficit.In each calendar year, the holders of the preferred stock shall be entitled to receive, when, as and if declared by the board of directors, noncumulative dividends at the rate of $0.02, $0.0394 and $0.125 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like) per annum, prior and in preference to the payment of any dividend on the common stock in such calendar year for Series A, Series B and Series C, respectively.Each share of preferred stock is convertible, at the right and option of the stockholder, at any time after the date of issuance of such shares, into such number of fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock as is determined by dividing $0.25, $0.4925 and $1.56 for Series A, Series B and Series C, respectively, by the conversion price per share, provided, in effect on the date the certificate is surrendered for conversion. The conversion price is equal to the original issue price, which is subject to adjustment for certain dilutive issuances, splits, and combinations. Each of our Series A, B and C convertible preferred stock currently converts on a 1:1 basis.Each share of preferred stock shall automatically convert into fully paid and non-assessable shares of common stock, on the earlier to occur of (i) immediately prior to the closing of a firm commitment underwritten public offering pursuant to an effective registration statement covering the offer and sale of our common stock for the account of the Company in which the aggregate public offering price equals or exceeds $50.0 million and the Public Offering price per share of which equals or exceeds $4.68 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like), and (ii) upon our receipt of the written consent of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of preferred stock (calculated on an as converted to common stock basis), voting together as a single class; provided, however, that the consent of holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Series C preferred stock, voting separately, shall be required in order to convert all shares of Series C preferred stock pursuant to clause (ii) above unless such conversion is effected in connection with, and contingent upon, the closing of a public offering in which the public offering price per share equals or exceeds $3.12 (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, recapitalizations and the like).Each stockholder of the preferred stock is entitled to the number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which the preferred stock can be converted. The holders of Series A preferred stock, voting as a separate class, may elect two members of the board of directors. The holders of Series B preferred stock, voting as a separate class, may elect one member to the board of directors. The holders of Series C preferred stock, voting as a separate class, may elect one member to the board of directors. Common stock holders, voting as a separate class can elect two members and the remaining board seats are elected by all holders of common or preferred stock voting as a single class.The convertible preferred stock is not redeemable by us or at the option of the preferred stockholders.In September 2008, in connection with a lease and financing agreement, we issued two fully-vested, detachable warrants to purchase an aggregate of 64,906 shares of Series C preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.56 per share. We calculated the fair value of these warrants using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The resulting fair value of $63,000 was recorded as a prepaid borrowing cost and included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets as we had not made any draws under the agreement at January 31, 2009. During fiscal 2010, we expensed these costs as the financing arrangement expiredunused. These warrants had not been exercised at January 31, 2012 and expire in 2015. These warrants become warrants to purchase common stock upon the effectiveness of a registration statement filed under the Securities Act.In July 2008, we also issued a fully-vested warrant to purchase 404,651 shares of Series C preferred stock at an exercise price of $1.56 per share to a then-current employee. We calculated the fair value of this warrant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The resulting fair value of $0.5 million was recorded as compensation expense during fiscal 2009. This warrant had not been exercised at January 31, 2012 and expires in 2018. This warrant becomes a warrant to purchase common stock upon the effectiveness of a registration statement filed under the Securities Act.In June 2004, we issued a fully-vested warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock at $0.25 per share to a then-current employee. We calculated the fair value of this warrant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The resulting fair value of $35,000 was recorded as compensation expense during 2004. On December 24, 2011, the warrant to purchase 200,000 shares of Series A preferred stock was exercised for proceeds of $50,000.The fair value of the outstanding warrants is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is classified within Non-current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. We determined the fair value of each warrant on the issuance date and subsequent reporting dates using the Black-Scholes pricing model utilizing the assumptions noted below. Any changes are reflected in Other income (expense), net. The expected term of the warrant is based on the remaining contractual expiration period. The expected stock price volatility for our stock was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of our industry peers as we did not have any trading history of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate was calculated using the average of the published interest rates for U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with maturities that approximate the expected term. The dividend yield assumption is zero as we did not have any history of, nor plans for, dividend payments.The following assumptions were used to estimate the value of the preferred stock warrants:The change in the fair value of the preferred stock warrant liability is summarized below:The 2003 Plan authorizes the granting of common stock options and restricted stock awards to employees, directors and consultants. The exercise price of all common stock options granted is the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant as determined by the board of directors. The common stock options vest generally over a four-year period and expire ten years from the grant date.Common stock option activity under the plan was as follows:Employee stock-based compensation expense was as follows:No income tax benefit has been recognized relating to stock-based compensation expense and no tax benefits realized from exercised stock options. At January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, there was a total unrecognized compensation cost of $2.9 million, $3.7 million and $14.9 million, respectively, related to these stock options, which is expected to be recognized over the next 2.62 years, 2.47 years and 3.32 years, respectively.The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 was $0.6 million, $1.2 million and $11.2 million, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted was $0.36, $0.54 and $1.72 for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.We estimated the fair values of each option awarded on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model utilizing the assumptions noted below. The expected term of the options is based on the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding calculated as the midpoint of the options vesting term and contractual expiration period, as we did not have sufficient historical information to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The expected stock price volatility for our stock was determined by examining the historical volatilities of a group of our industry peers as we did not have any trading history of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate was calculated using the average of the published interest rates U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with maturities that approximate the expected term. The dividend yield assumption is zero as we did not have any history of, nor plans to make, dividend payments.The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of options granted:Forfeitures were estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differed from those estimates. Forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience.In September 2008, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell equipment totaling $0.5 million and leaseback the same equipment over a period of 36 months. We have the option to purchase all, but not less than all, of the equipment for a mutually agreed upon market value plus taxes applicable at the end of the lease. Due to our continuing involvement in certain aspects of this equipment, the sale and leaseback of this equipment does not qualify as a sale-leaseback under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, but rather accounted for as a financing of the equipment. We recorded a financing obligation liability totaling $0.5 million in December 2008. Payments under the financing were mademonthly through December 31, 2011 at an interest rate of 8% per annum. At January 31, 2012, we had no payments remaining under the financing.We lease our office spaces under long-term non-cancelable operating leases that expire in 2014. Rent expense for fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012 was $1.6 million, $1.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. Future minimum rental payments required under the operating lease agreements as of January 31, 2012 are as follows:Future operating lease obligations increased during fiscal 2012 for costs related to additional leases. During fiscal 2012, we executed amendments increasing the square footage of our headquarters in San Francisco. In addition, we entered into new operating lease agreements for our Cupertino and certain international locations. Payments associated with lease agreements increased by $4.1 million, of which $1.7 million is due by January 31, 2013; $2.0 million is due between January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2015 and $0.4 million is due between January 31, 2015 and January 31, 2017.We are subject to certain routine legal proceedings, as well as demands and claims that arise in the normal course of our business. We believe that the ultimate amount of liability, if any, for any pending claims (either individually or in the aggregate) will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.During the ordinary course of business, we include indemnification provisions within certain of our contracts. Pursuant to these agreements, we will indemnify, hold harmless and agree to reimburse the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, generally parties with which we have commercial relations, in connection with certain intellectual property infringement claims by any third party with respect to our products and services. To date, there have not been any costs incurred in connection with such indemnification clauses; therefore, there is no accrual of such amounts at January 31, 2011 and 2012.Our products are subject to U.S. export controls that prohibit the shipment of certain products and services without the required export authorizations or export to countries, governments, and persons targeted by U.S. sanctions. We shipped our encryption products prior to obtaining the required export authorizations. Accordingly, we have not fully complied with applicable encryption controls in the ExportAdministration Regulations. Additionally, while we are taking precautions to prevent our products and services from being shipped to U.S. sanctions targets, we believe that certain of our products that are available at no cost have been downloaded by persons in countries that are the subject of these embargoes. In March 2012, we filed our Final Voluntary Self Disclosures with the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, or BIS, and the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, concerning these potential violations. At this time, these agencies have not completed their review of these matters. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, it could result in fines or penalties for us and for individuals, including civil penalties of up to $250,000 or twice the value of the transaction, whichever is greater, per violation, and in the event of conviction for a criminal violation, fines of up to $1 million and possible incarceration for responsible employees and managers for willful and knowing violations. We cannot predict when OFAC and BIS will complete their reviews or what enforcement action, if any, they will take. It is reasonably possible that our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be negatively affected by an unfavorable resolution to this matter and that imposed fines, if any, could be material to our financial statements. However, we cannot make any predictions of the outcome of these violations or estimate the potential liability, if any, that will be incurred.In May 2009, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which was most recently amended in February 2011. The agreement includes a revolving line of credit facility and a term loan facility described below. The agreement contains financial covenants and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As part of the agreement, we granted the lender a security interest in our personal property, excluding intellectual property and other intangible assets. The agreement also contains customary events of default provisions. We were in compliance with all covenants at January 31, 2012.The agreement provides for a revolving line of credit facility, which expires May 28, 2012, and a term loan facility, with each advance amortized over a period of 36 months with equal monthly payments of principal and interest. We may borrow up to $10.0 million under the revolving line of credit facility, subject to a borrowing base determined on eligible accounts receivable and subject to a total maximum outstanding of $10.0 million. As of January 31, 2011 and 2012, we had no balance outstanding on the revolving line of credit. Interest on any drawdown under the revolving line of credit accrues at the greater of prime rate plus 0.75% (4.00% at January 31, 2012) and 4.75%. In addition to the line of credit facility, a $3.0 million term loan facility was available for draw through June 30, 2011. At January 31, 2012, we had $2.3 million outstanding in term debt, consisting of $1.0 million due between January 31, 2012 and January 31, 2013 and $1.3 million due between January 31, 2013 and January 31, 2015. The interest rate for the term debt is fixed at 5.5%.Annual maturities of term loans as of January 31, 2012 were as follows (in thousands):Our chief executive officer is a member of the board of directors of a company who is also a customer of Splunk. We recorded revenue from sales to this customer of $0, $438,000 and $239,000 for the years ended January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. There were no accounts receivable due to Splunk from this customer as of January 31, 2011 and 2012. We also recorded $0, $10,000 and $18,000 in expenses related to purchases made from this company for the years ended January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. There were no accounts payable to this company as of January 31, 2011 and 2012.One member of our board of directors was also an executive of a publicly traded company, which is also a customer of Splunk. We recorded revenue from sales to this customer of $0, $0 and $841,000 for the years ended January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, and had $0 and $1,237,000 of accounts receivable due from this customer as of January 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Another member of our board of directors is also a chief financial officer of a publicly traded company, which is also a customer of Splunk. We recorded revenue from sales to this customer of $0, $0 and $226,000 for the years ended January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. There were no accounts receivable due to Splunk from this customer as of January 31, 2011 and 2012. We also recorded $0, $0 and $329,000 in expenses related to purchases made from this company for the years ended January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively and had $0 and $19,000 of accounts payable to this company as of January 31, 2011 and 2012, respectively. Another member of our board of directors is also a member of the board of a publicly traded company, which is also a customer of Splunk. We recorded revenue from sales to this customer of $0, $24,000, and $317,000 for the years ended January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively. There were no accounts receivable due to Splunk from this customer as of January 31, 2011 and 2012.Revenues by geography are based on the shipping address of the customer. The following tables present our revenues by geographic region for the periods presented (in thousands):No other individual country exceeded 10% of total revenues during any of the periods presented.Income (loss) before income tax expense consists of the following for the periods shown below (in thousands):Income tax expense consists of the following for the periods show below (in thousands):For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010, 2011 and 2012, our tax provision consisted principally of state and foreign income tax expense. The foreign tax expense recorded for fiscal 2010 and 2011 consistsentirely of an estimated, uncertain tax position for which we believe it is more-likely-than-not that we will incur a tax liability. This position is related to operating in foreign jurisdictions prior to establishing a legal presence. The foreign tax expense recorded for fiscal 2012 consists of continued estimated uncertain tax positions as well as foreign taxes from legal entities established in foreign jurisdictions during the fiscal year.The reconciliation of federal statutory income tax provision to our effective income tax provision is as follows (in thousands):Deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following (in thousands):Net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards as of January 31, 2012 are as follows (in thousands):ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, requires that the tax benefit of net operating losses, temporary differences and credit carryforwards be recorded as an asset to the extent that we assess that realization is more likely than not. Realization of the future tax benefits is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period. Due to our history of operating losses, we believe the recognition of the deferred tax assets arising from the above mentioned future tax benefits is currently not more likely than not to be realized and, accordingly, have provided a full valuation allowance. The valuation allowance totaled $16.7 million and $19.4 million for fiscal 2011 and 2012, respectively.The net change in the valuation allowance was an increase of $2.7 million between fiscal 2011 and 2012. At January 31, 2012, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $31.9 million and $31.1 million, respectively. The net operating losses for federal and state purposes begin to expire starting in 2025 and 2016, respectively.Additionally, we had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards as of January 31, 2012 of $1.4 million and $1.0 million, respectively. Our federal tax credits will start to expire in 2029 if not utilized.If certain factors change, we may determine that there is sufficient positive evidence to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation allowance. If we were to reverse all or some part of our valuation allowance our financial statements in the period of reversal would likely reflect an increase in assets on our balance sheet and a corresponding tax benefit to our statement of operations in the amount of the reversal.Because of certain prior period ownership changes, the utilization of a portion of our United States federal and state NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be limited. We have not finalized our analysis to determine the annual 382 limitation, but if we were to determine that certain amounts of the NOL or tax credits were limited, a portion of our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance could be adjusted.Effective February 1, 2009, we adopted the guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes as set forth under ASC 740 Income Taxes. This guidance clarified the accounting for uncertainty in incometaxes recognized in an entity's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. There was no impact upon adoption as our liability recognized under previous accounting guidance was consistent with that required under the new guidance. At January 31, 2012, our reserve for uncertain tax positions was $1.1 million.As of January 31, 2012, $0.2 million of the unrecognized tax benefit would, if recognized, impact our effective tax rate. The remainder will not, if recognized, affect the effective income tax rate due to the valuation allowance that currently offsets deferred tax assets.The adoption of this guidance required us to identify, evaluate and measure all uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns and to record liabilities for the amount of these positions that may not be sustained, or may only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments were reasonable, actual results may differ from these estimates. Some or all of these judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities.We are subject to income taxes in U.S. federal and various state and local jurisdictions. Generally, we are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local tax examinations for tax years ended before December 31, 2007. However, to the extent allowed by law, the tax authorities may have the right to examine prior periods where net operating losses or tax credits were generated and carried forward, and make adjustments up to the amount of the net operating loss or credit carryforward.We accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. As of January 31, 2011 and 2012, there was accrued interest and penalties of $66,000 and $81,000, respectively.We intend either to invest our non-United States earnings permanently in foreign operations or to remit these earnings to our United States entities in a tax-free manner. For this reason, we do not record federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less the weighted-average unvested common stock subjectto repurchase or forfeiture. Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including preferred stock, stock options, and warrants, to the extent dilutive.The following table sets forth the computation of historical basic and diluted net loss per share:Since we were in a loss position for all periods presented, basic net loss per share is the same as diluted net loss per share for all periods as the inclusion of all potential common shares outstanding would have been anti-dilutive. Potentially dilutive securities that were not included in the diluted per share calculations because they would be anti-dilutive were as follows:Unaudited pro forma net loss per share for fiscal 2012 has been computed to give effect to the automatic conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock, the conversion of the Series C preferred stock warrants into common stock warrants, and the exercise and conversion of the Series Apreferred stock warrant to common stock, as though the conversion or exercise had taken place on February 1, 2011.We have evaluated subsequent events through April 5, 2012, the date on which these consolidated financial statements were issued.PART II INFORMATION NOT REQUIRED IN THE PROSPECTUS Estimated expenses, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, payable by the Registrant in connection with the sale of the common stock being registered under this registration statement are as follows:On completion of this offering, the Registrant's amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain provisions that eliminate, to the maximum extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, the personal liability of the Registrant's directors and executive officers for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duties as directors or officers. The Registrant's amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws will provide that the Registrant must indemnify its directors and executive officers and may indemnify its employees and other agents to the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.Sections 145 and 102(b)(7) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware provide that a corporation may indemnify any person made a party to an action by reason of the fact that he or she was a director, executive officer, employee or agent of the corporation or is or was serving at the request of a corporation against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with such action if he or she acted in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the corporation and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, except that, in the case of an action by or in right of the corporation, no indemnification may generally be made in respect of any claim as to which such person is adjudged to be liable to the corporation.The Registrant has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers (other than Dr. Schroeder), in addition to the indemnification provided for in its amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and intends to enter into indemnification agreements with any new directors and executive officers (including Dr. Schroeder) in the future.The Registrant has purchased and intends to maintain insurance on behalf of each and any person who is or was a director or officer of the Registrant against any loss arising from any claim asserted against him or her and incurred by him or her in any such capacity, subject to certain exclusions.The Underwriting Agreement (Exhibit 1.1 hereto) provides for indemnification by the underwriters of the Registrant and its executive officers and directors, and by the Registrant of the underwriters, for certain liabilities, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.See also the undertakings set out in response to Item 17 herein.During the last three years, we sold the following unregistered securities:In December 2011, the Registrant sold 200,000 shares of its Series A preferred stock to an accredited investor on the exercise of an outstanding warrant at a purchase price per share of $0.25 for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000.From February 1, 2009 through January 31, 2012, the Registrant granted to its directors, employees, consultants and other service providers options to purchase an aggregate of 17,844,092 shares of common stock under the Registrant's 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2003 Plan, at exercise prices ranging from $0.62 to $4.82 per share, for an aggregate exercise price of $41.7 million.From February 1, 2009 through January 31, 2012, the Registrant issued and sold to its directors, employees, consultants and other service providers an aggregate of 9,962,504 shares of common stock upon the exercise of options under the 2003 Plan at exercise prices ranging from $0.025 to $2.94 per share, for an aggregate exercise price of $5.8 million.None of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public offering, and the Registrant believes that each transaction was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act in reliance on Rule 701 promulgated under the Securities Act as transactions pursuant to a compensatory benefit plan approved by the Registrant's board of directors, or Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering. Each recipient of the securities in these transactions represented his or her intention to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were affixed to the share certificates issued in each such transaction. In each case, the recipient represented that such recipient had received adequate information about the Registrant or had adequate access, through his or her relationship with the Registrant, to information about the Registrant.We have filed the exhibits listed on the accompanying Exhibit Index of this Registration Statement.All schedules have been omitted because the information required to be presented in them is not applicable or is shown in the consolidated financials statements or related notes.The Registrant hereby undertakes to provide to the underwriters at the closing as specified in the underwriting agreement certificates in such denominations and registered in such names as required by the underwriters to permit prompt delivery to each purchaser.Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the Registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the Registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the Registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officeror controlling person of the Registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the Registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.The Registrant hereby undertakes that:For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the information omitted from a form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in the form of prospectus filed by the Registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, each post-effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, the registrant has duly caused this amendment to registration statement to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized, in the City of San Francisco, State of California, on the 9th day of April, 2012.Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, this amendment to registration statement has been signed by the following persons in the capacities indicated below:'"

"'12-04-09,'0','MOSCOW — Early results from a fourth round of voting in South Ossetia on Sunday indicated that the former K.G.B. official Leonid Tibilov had been elected president, bringing an end to a long, tumultuous campaign season that proved an embarrassment to Moscow, the region’s source of military and financial support.The Kremlin had hoped to settle the question five months ago, when Russia’s president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, endorsed a local official to take over the presidency of South Ossetia, a breakaway region in Georgia that has become a de facto Russian protectorate.But that candidate was defeated by a former education minister, Alla Dzhioeva, who tapped into anger over the misuse of tens of millions of dollars earmarked for the reconstruction of South Ossetia, which was at the center of Russia’s war with Georgia in 2008. South Ossetia’s population is estimated at about 50,000.Ms. Dzhioeva said she was pro-Russia, but she criticized the Kremlin for supporting corrupt local strongmen, in particular outgoing President Eduard Kokoity. South Ossetia’s Supreme Court declared the election invalid, leading to a standoff that continued into February, when riot police officers raided Ms. Dzhioeva’s headquarters, sending her to the hospital — her allies said she was beaten — and leaving her organization in disarray. She was barred from participating in Sunday’s election.With 91.7 percent of ballots counted, the Central Election Committee announced that 54 percent of the vote went to Mr. Tibilov. Mr. Tibilov is a Soviet law enforcement veteran and, like Ms. Dzhioeva, was a critic of the departing leaders. Ms. Dzhioeva, who was recently released from the hospital, said in an interview that she did not recognize Sunday’s vote as legitimate because she did not take part in it, but would decide whether to throw her support behind the new president after watching his first steps.She said the protracted election cycle demonstrated that “the people of South Ossetia have overcome their fear.”The elections were not recognized by Georgia, the European Union or the United States, which consider South Ossetia to be Georgian territory. South Ossetia and Abkhazia, a second breakaway enclave in Georgia, are recognized as sovereign by only a smattering of nations, including Russia, Venezuela, Nicaragua and the tiny Pacific nations of Nauru and Tuvalu.'"

"'12-04-09,'0','In an article in the newspaper Bild am Sonntag, Mr. Westerwelle wrote that Germany had “a historic responsibility for the people of Israel” and underscored the similarities between the countries as democracies as well as the history between their peoples. Mr. Westerwelle also noted that he had traveled to Israel and criticized the country’s West Bank settlements at a news conference in Jerusalem.“Putting Israel and Iran on the same moral level is not ingenious but absurd,” Mr. Westerwelle wrote.The discussion in Germany over Mr. Grass’s poem has in large part revolved around the question of whether it is possible for Germans to criticize Israel, which Mr. Grass’s critics call a straw man and a cover for anti-Semitism. Mr. Grass in the poem described the “verdict ‘anti-Semitism’ ” as a reason for silence.In an interview in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr. Reich-Ranicki, who is 91, said that he did not consider Mr. Grass an anti-Semite but that the poem itself was “a disgrace.” Mr. Reich-Ranicki, who addressed the German Parliament in January on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, said that he feared consequences of the poem’s reception among others interested in criticizing Israel and Jews more harshly.Many who commented on the dozens, if not hundreds, of German newspaper articles on the topic have jumped to Mr. Grass’s defense. In the comments section of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung’s Web site, the most recommended comments on an article about the interview are supportive of Mr. Grass and critical of Mr. Reich-Ranicki. “Only in Germany after a valid critique of Israel’s policy of warmongering do you hear the old creak of the camp gates,” wrote one commenter. Another called Mr. Reich-Ranicki a “toady.”The debate in Germany has reopened old wounds about the country’s past and the question of what Germans can and cannot do and say in light of the Holocaust.Two days after his poem appeared, Mr. Grass said in an interview that he had meant to focus his attack not so much on Israel as on the policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“The man who damages Israel the most at the moment is in my opinion Netanyahu, and I should have included that in my poem,” Mr. Grass said. “What is now an imminent threat is a risk without parallel — a preventive strike, a first strike against Iran, which would have terrible consequences.”He said that he had often supported Israel, had visited a number of times and wanted “the country to exist and at last find peace with its neighbors.”Last week Mr. Netanyahu angrily condemned Mr. Grass for equating Israel and Iran and made reference to Mr. Grass’s time as a member of the Waffen-SS.On Sunday, in addition to Mr. Yishai’s barring of Mr. Grass from Israel, the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, weighed in. He called the poem “an expression of the cynicism of some of the West’s intellectuals who, for publicity purposes and the desire to sell a few more books, are willing to sacrifice the Jewish nation a second time on the altar of crazy anti-Semites.”He spoke during a meeting in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy.Tom Segev, an Israeli historian and columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, wrote an article criticizing the poem but opposed the decision to bar Mr. Grass from entering Israel. “It’s very unpleasant because it moves us in the direction of countries like Iran and Syria that apparently give out entry permits according to people’s political views,” Mr. Segev said.Mr. Grass’ best-known novel, published in 1959, is “The Tin Drum,” a stirring allegorical exploration of Nazism in Germany and Poland. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1999; the Nobel committee described “The Tin Drum” as a new beginning for German literature “after decades of linguistic and moral destruction.”Mr. Grass has also shown a willingness time and again to enter the arena of politics, where he campaigned for the left-leaning Social Democrats. He has also long sought to act as a national conscience for the Germans over their Nazi past. When he revealed in 2006 that he had been a Nazi soldier at the end of World War II, something he had kept hidden for decades, he was accused of hypocrisy.'"

Mr. Westerwelle also noted that he had traveled to Israel and criticized the country’s West Bank settlements at a news conference in Jerusalem.“Putting Israel and Iran on the same moral level is not ingenious but absurd,” Mr. Westerwelle wrote.The discussion in Germany over Mr. Grass’s poem has in large part revolved around the question of whether it is possible for Germans to criticize Israel, which Mr. Grass’s critics call a straw man and a cover for anti-Semitism. Mr. Grass in the poem described the “verdict ‘anti-Semitism’ ” as a reason for silence.In an interview in the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Mr. Reich-Ranicki, who is 91, said that he did not consider Mr. Grass an anti-Semite but that the poem itself was “a disgrace.” Mr. Reich-Ranicki, who addressed the German Parliament in January on International Holocaust Remembrance Day, said that he feared consequences of the poem’s reception among others interested in criticizing Israel and Jews more harshly.Many who commented on the dozens, if not hundreds, of German newspaper articles on the topic have jumped to Mr. Grass’s defense. In the comments section of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung’s Web site, the most recommended comments on an article about the interview are supportive of Mr. Grass and critical of Mr. Reich-Ranicki. “Only in Germany after a valid critique of Israel’s policy of warmongering do you hear the old creak of the camp gates,” wrote one commenter. Another called Mr. Reich-Ranicki a “toady.”The debate in Germany has reopened old wounds about the country’s past and the question of what Germans can and cannot do and say in light of the Holocaust.Two days after his poem appeared, Mr. Grass said in an interview that he had meant to focus his attack not so much on Israel as on the policies of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.“The man who damages Israel the most at the moment is in my opinion Netanyahu, and I should have included that in my poem,” Mr. Grass said. “What is now an imminent threat is a risk without parallel — a preventive strike, a first strike against Iran, which would have terrible consequences.”He said that he had often supported Israel, had visited a number of times and wanted “the country to exist and at last find peace with its neighbors.”Last week Mr. Netanyahu angrily condemned Mr. Grass for equating Israel and Iran and made reference to Mr. Grass’s time as a member of the Waffen-SS.On Sunday, in addition to Mr. Yishai’s barring of Mr. Grass from Israel, the foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman, weighed in. He called the poem “an expression of the cynicism of some of the West’s intellectuals who, for publicity purposes and the desire to sell a few more books, are willing to sacrifice the Jewish nation a second time on the altar of crazy anti-Semites.”He spoke during a meeting in Jerusalem with Prime Minister Mario Monti of Italy.Tom Segev, an Israeli historian and columnist for the newspaper Haaretz, wrote an article criticizing the poem but opposed the decision to bar Mr. Grass from entering Israel. “It’s very unpleasant because it moves us in the direction of countries like Iran and Syria that apparently give out entry permits according to people’s political views,” Mr. Segev said.Mr. Grass’ best-known novel, published in 1959, is “The Tin Drum,” a stirring allegorical exploration of Nazism in Germany and Poland. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1999; the Nobel committee described “The Tin Drum” as a new beginning for German literature “after decades of linguistic and moral destruction.”Mr. Grass has also shown a willingness time and again to enter the arena of politics, where he campaigned for the left-leaning Social Democrats. He has also long sought to act as a national conscience for the Germans over their Nazi past. When he revealed in 2006 that he had been a Nazi soldier at the end of World War II, something he had kept hidden for decades, he was accused of hypocrisy.'"

"'12-04-10,'0','EVEN as a child, I loved the thought of flying. I remember having a book detailing the logos of almost every airline in the world. Today, nothing breaks up the monotony of a long stay on a tarmac more than finding a new airline logo and trying to figure out its origin.I’ve been in the diamond business for 18 years, and with Eurostar for the last 11. The days are long gone when I traveled with diamonds. It was always harrowing, because you’re walking around with three-quarters of a million dollars’ worth strapped inside your pants. There were always issues with security or even using the bathroom on the plane. It was unnerving, and I’m glad I don’t do that anymore.Talking with seatmates is something I enjoy, and I’ll talk to anyone who wants to talk. When I tell people about my work, most of my seatmates think it’s glamorous. It’s funny, because we have a run-of-the-mill business, sending raw materials to our factories and then we ship polished stones to our sales offices. At the end, we hope to sell for more than what we paid. It’s a job like any other, and I don’t know anyone famous or hang out with anybody famous.When the movie “Blood Diamond” came out several years ago, I did have a few seatmates ask questions about “conflict” diamonds. But most people seem more interested in the blood and guts, rather than showing any concern about the fact that innocent people are being abused so someone can buy a ring for their significant other. I try to explain the issues, like the Kimberley Process, an effort among governments and companies to stop conflict diamonds from reaching the market. But I usually get a glazed look. I think most people don’t know the difference between Angola and Albania, so explaining our goals to maintain our objective of job creation and community-building is as easy as explaining the tax code.But I have met a lot of interesting people over my years of flying. I love getting a flying nerd like myself as a seatmate, who can talk about the best airlines, the best seats, the best aircraft and the best airports.On a flight from Los Angeles, I noticed my seatmate was carrying a bag with the St. Jude’s insignia. I asked him if he was a doctor, and he said yes, and then told me he practiced in New York City. He also worked at the hospital right up the block from my home.'"
"'12-04-10,'0','“Understanding the value of a dollar has rushed back to the forefront” of consumer considerations, said Lance Miceli, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Accor North America division of Accor, which owns Motel 6.As a result, he added, the brand’s promise of “a clean, comfortable room for the lowest price of any national chain” has become “as valued today as it was in 1962.”The commercial, created by the Richards Group in Dallas, shows a family in a car en route to a Motel 6. The passage of time is illustrated as the modish looks of the family, and the car, morph from 1962 to 2012.“Over the past 50 years, the way America travels has changed a lot,” says the announcer, Tom Bodett, who is known for the “We’ll leave the light on for you” radio spots he has delivered for Motel 6 since 1986.But “no matter how much the journey changes,” Mr. Bodett says, “you’ll know there’s a light on at the end of it.” The commercial ends with this declaration: “Motel 6. Fifty years and the light’s still on.”The campaign for Motel 6 will also include radio commercials, digital ads and social media like Facebook and YouTube.Social media enable brands to amplify advertising centered on authenticity because the details of their history and heritage give them a story to tell to an audience that prizes “status and reputation,” said Avi Savar, chief creative officer at Big Fuel, a social media agency that is majority-owned by the Publicis Groupe.“The big idea is what’s the existing social behavior a brand can tap into,” Mr. Savar said. “If I align with a brand, it needs to align with my values.”To that end, the Life Savers centennial campaign, which is featured on the Life Savers Web site at life-savers.com, includes a philanthropic component, called Connect for a Cause, to underline the campaign’s theme, “100 years of sharing.”The “share ring” fund-raiser for 100 charitable organizations, at lifesaverssharering.com, is meant to underline how “Life Savers is known for creating simple and meaningful connections among its consumers,” said Colleen DeVos, senior vice president for account management at the Chicago office of the Ryan Partnership, part of Hyper Marketing Inc., which handles promotions and retail marketing for the Life Savers parent, the Wm. Wrigley Jr. division of Mars.Tyler Simpson, director for mints at Wrigley, also in Chicago, said: “For 100 years, people have used Life Savers as a token of sharing. It’s time for us to share with causes that matter to them.”Other elements of the Life Savers campaign include print ads by the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group. Their layout and theme, “A hole lot of fun,” echo the brand’s ads from the 1940s through the 1960s in magazines like Life, Look and The Saturday Evening Post, which carried themes like “The candy with the hole.”There are also “anniversary edition” boxes of Life Savers in versions of the Sweet Storybook packages that were introduced in 1935. The candies inside come in vintage wrappers.Marketers celebrating brand anniversaries say they are careful not to become too enamored of what they see in the rearview mirror because campaigns that are perceived as too nostalgic may turn off consumers who want to be assured that products meet modern-day needs.At Motel 6, “we have adapted to the times while remaining true to our core values,” said Mr. Miceli of Accor North America. “We’ve contemporized the brand as we go along.”There have been updates of the brand’s logo and changes inside the motels that are highlighted on the Motel 6 Web site, motel6.com, with the headline “Bold new room designs.”Of course, the idea of a motel room for $6 a night is as old-fashioned as the promise in those magazine ads for Life Savers that each hard-candy roll is “still only 5 cents.” Rooms are now available at rates that average from $39.99 a night, Mr. Miceli said.'"
"'12-04-10,'0','“This is all stuff that companies want to — and are putting in smartphones,” said Kevin G. Rivette, a managing partner of 3LP.Microsoft has used its deep stockpile of computing patents to prod smartphone makers to pay it licensing fees. So, analysts say, adding more patents promises to strengthen its negotiating and legal position with rivals like Google and Apple — and handset makers using Google’s Android software including HTC, Samsung and LG.Prices for patents are rising as the big companies load up. Google last August agreed to pay $12.5 billion for Motorola Mobility, a mobile phone maker with a trove of 17,000 patents. That portfolio, analysts estimate, could represent more than half the value of the deal, or more than $400,000 a patent.Last year, Apple and Microsoft teamed up with four other companies to pay $4.5 billion for the 6,000 patents held by the bankrupt Canadian telecommunications maker Nortel Networks. That worked out to $750,000 a patent, or nearly four times the average for computer, software and telecommunications patents a few years earlier, experts say.Last month, Facebook said it had bought 750 patents from I.B.M. for an undisclosed sum, shortly after the social networking giant was hit with a patent lawsuit by Yahoo.Fierce patent battles have occurred throughout industrial history. The steam engine, automobile and airplane, as they opened big new markets, prompted patent wars, noted David J. Kappos, director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.“But those wars played themselves out in slow motion compared to what we’re seeing now,” Mr. Kappos said. “What’s different is the pace of technological change and market development. So the stakes are a lot higher, a lot faster.”In the past, patents were often bought by specialist patent firms from start-ups that had failed, and used in suits against major technology companies to reach lucrative settlements or win big paydays in court. These days, though, big companies are increasingly using patents as strategic tools, said Colleen Chien, an assistant professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law.The specialist patent holders, sometimes called trolls, are still around, but the main litigation and deal-making now are among big companies themselves, Professor Chien said. “These major companies are using patents to gain competitive advantage rather than just seeing patents as financial assets,” she said.AOL’s slow progress as it transforms into a media company supported by advertising has brought pressure from restive institutional shareholders. The patent sale — AOL will hold onto 300 others — is intended to help with both objectives.The deal “unlocks current dollar value for our shareholders and enables AOL to continue to aggressively execute on our strategy,” Tim Armstrong, AOL’s chief, said in a statement.While Microsoft is struggling in the smartphone market, it is doing a brisk business in licensing its intellectual property to smartphone makers using rival software, analysts say.The company has struck licensing deals with handset makers that account for 70 percent of sales of Android-powered phones in the United States, including HTC, Samsung and LG. Analysts estimate that Microsoft makes more on every Android phone sold than on each phone running its Windows Phone software.Microsoft has roughly 20,000 granted patents, not counting applications pending — about four times what Apple holds, estimates M-Cam, a patent advisory firm. A smartphone is essentially a combination of computer and telecommunications technology, and Microsoft has a deep store of patents in computing.Microsoft’s large intellectual property team tracks patent portfolios and has been scrutinizing AOL’s for years, said Brad Smith, Microsoft’s general counsel. Some of the patents in AOL’s portfolio would be quite familiar to Microsoft, since they came from its former rival in Internet browsing software, Netscape Communications, which AOL bought in 1998 for $4.2 billion.The $1.056 billion that Microsoft paid for the patents was higher than most patent research firms had estimated, ranging from about $300 million to $650 million. David E. Martin, chairman of M-Cam, suggested that Microsoft’s high bid at the AOL auction might have been with an eye toward improving its bargaining position in licensing and legal negotiations.“It sends the message that these giant patent estates have value, even if they don’t,” Mr. Martin said.Patents are supposed to be fuel for innovation — a temporary period of ownership for the holder as an incentive to invent and disclose the invention. But whether the system works as intended in a field like smartphones, with its myriad overlapping claims and various software programs, is in doubt.David C. Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer, estimated that a modern smartphone might be susceptible to as many as 250,000 potential patent claims, depending on how broadly those patents and claims were interpreted.In a study published in 2008, Mr. Bessen and a colleague, Michael J. Meurer, an economist and professor at the Boston University School of Law, concluded that patents were a net benefit in two industries, pharmaceuticals and chemicals. But in industries like software, the researchers said, the costs of litigation are more than twice the benefits in terms of gains to inventors.“In pharmaceutical and chemical industry, the boundaries of a chemical composition patent are well defined,” Mr. Bessen said. “But in fields like software and telecommunications, the claims are often so broad and vague that it is completely unpredictable what the patents cover and don’t.”Yet Professor Chien is less certain. “The patent system is making innovation more expensive, but I also think that there has been a lot more focus on the costs than the benefits,” she said.“In a case like AOL, this patent sale is keeping it alive and giving it a chance to innovate elsewhere,” she said.'"
"'12-04-10,'0','Even when you have an iPod, there are those moments in New York life when you find yourself witnessing uncomfortable private moments: a couple, bickering on a subway platform and going at each other with barely disguised fury — in the form of eye-rolling, crossed arms and furrowed brows. In “other stories,” Alexandra Beller has created and directed a work about these everyday occurrences, and while I’d like to be supportive about giving life experiences meaning through dance, it’s just painful.That multilayered work was performed at the Joyce SoHo on Saturday afternoon as part of the theater’s In Rep series, which features three companies overlapping in a three-week block.Some background is helpful: for each of Ms. Beller’s programs, a guest artist (on Saturday it was Karl Rogers), who has rehearsed minimally at best with the company, offers an improvisational performance. Those improvisations are copied and translated on the spot by Ms. Beller and her five dancers, who reteach the guest artist the movement material.Brian Ireland’s set, a small room on wheels, serves as an incubator of sorts; during much of the piece the dancers worked one on one with Mr. Rogers in the box, fleshing out the structure and nuances of the improvisations. These scenes, which were partially visible on two sides, were the most inventive part of “other stories.” Here you can grasp something of what Ms. Beller is getting at: What happens to spontaneous movement when it is decoded or passed around? How, in other words, does an argument become more or less momentous in a person’s memory? One part of Ms. Beller’s work is the notion of interpretation.The rest of the choreographic material, and this constitutes most of the show, is a less appealing strand of dance-theater, in which the cast speaks (sometimes just mouthing words) while making a multitude of gestures that become more finicky with each passing moment. “This is the burn from his seat belt,” Lea Fulton says, as she cups her fingers onto her palm and then draws them away.“This is my favorite way to see the world,” she adds, scissoring her fingers to make a walking motion.Later these actions are strung together and performed by the others. The cumulative effect does not, however, make for gripping dance-theater; it’s too self-conscious. A score for electric guitar (its composer, Robert Poss, plays it live in parts) does a better job at creating a dark, meditative mood, as do the films in the piece, by Martijn Hart, which capture couples in city settings: through an apartment window or on a bench in the rain. These dancers need distance to tell stories with their bodies.'"

"'12-04-11,'1','“Everything is much more difficult,” said Palma R. Yanni, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association who also handles artists’ visas. “I didn’t think it could get worse than it was after 9/11, but the last couple of years have been terrible. It just seems like you have to fight for everything across the board, even for artists of renown. The standards have not changed, but the agency just keeps narrowing the criteria, raising the bar without notice or comment, reinterpreting things and just making everything more restrictive. We call it the culture of no.”A foreign artist seeking authorization to perform in the United States must navigate a system that involves a pair of government departments. Homeland Security, created in 2003, evaluates the initial application and then, if approval is granted, the State Department, assuming it is satisfied with the results of an in-person interview with the performer, issues a visa at an embassy abroad.Congress requires the process to be financially self-sustaining, rather than depend on taxpayer support, which in practice means that fees are typically higher than those of other countries. Homeland Security even offers an expedited “premium processing fee” of $1,225 per application — over and above the standard $325 filing fee — that is supposed to guarantee a response within two weeks, but arts administrators complain that the agency sometimes fails to meet its own deadline.As part of the process the arts group sponsoring performances in the United States must also submit written proof of the artist’s qualifications, all duly translated into English. Even then there is no guarantee of timely approval of a visa request, since there are often additional “requests for evidence” of a performer’s artistic worth or personal background. The government advises performers and ensembles to submit paperwork at least 90 days before they hope to receive a visa, but arts administrators say that delays of up to six months are not unusual.“There’s no two matters that play out in the same way,” said Jonathan Ginsburg, a Washington-based immigration lawyer whose firm, Fettman, Tolchin & Majors, represents the North American Performing Arts Managers and Agents association and other arts groups. “You can’t for a moment let your guard down, or something nasty is going to happen.”Complicating matters even more are American rules for foreign performers that do not allow for applications before tour contracts are signed. “If you get stuck in a six-month security delay, that’s the end of the road, and you pretty much miss your show,” said Matthew Covey of Tamizdat, a company that last year filed more than 800 visa applications for foreign arts organizations.Government agencies say that the enhanced procedures they have adopted are needed to safeguard American citizens. “We want to facilitate legitimate travel to the U.S., but we need to keep security as our highest priority,” said a State Department spokesman, who invoked department rules that do not allow him to be identified by name.In many cases foreign troupes must also pay a “consultation” fee of up to $500 to an American union to certify that its performances will not adversely affect the interests of American artists. “It’s a revenue stream for the unions, with no cap in sight,” Mr. Ginsburg said.As a result, some large ensembles are now simply avoiding the United States. In 2006, for example, the Hallé orchestra of , , canceled an American tour that was to include a performance at after orchestra administrators calculated that complying with visa regulations for a group of more than 100 musicians and staff members was going to cost them more than $70,000.“This palaver of getting visas is mind blowing,” John Summers, the orchestra’s chief executive, said at the time.In many cases delays in obtaining visas, arts administrators and immigration lawyers say, are simply the result of a slow and cumbersome bureaucracy. But they point to other cases, especially those involving artists with recognizably Arab or Muslim names. European diplomats and arts administrators say that when they submit visa requests for their orchestras or theater and dance ensembles, any performer with such a name is almost automatically subjected to what is known as “additional administrative processing.”“It seems to be a question of the names, of anything that sounds like it could belong to a bad guy,” Mr. Ginsburg said. “Ostensibly it is not U.S. policy to profile. But they are looking for other words to describe the same thing.”Government agencies deny that any such discriminatory policy exists. Homeland Security “strictly adheres to a zero tolerance policy that prohibits profiling on the basis of religion, race or ethnicity,” said Chris Bentley, a spokesman for at the department. “Every case is decided individually based on the facts and the law.”Problems emerged last summer when the British theater director Tim Supple brought a pan-Arab ensemble to to perform the much-acclaimed new version of the “One Thousand and One Nights,” a version revised to reflect the events of the Arab . The company had no difficulty obtaining visas for and Britain, but an engagement at the Festival had to be canceled when 9 of the troupe’s 40 members were subjected to the additional scrutiny and time ran out.“One has to respect everyone’s right to protect their own security, but it’s a growing problem that needs to be addressed,” said Roy Luxford, the show’s producer, based in Britain. “Everyone got Canadian visas in two weeks and British visas in 8 to 10 days.“It has become overly onerous and a real barrier to undertaking any sort of normal tour” if you try to combine American dates with appearances in other countries, Mr. Luxford continued. “If all the rhetoric about open societies and cultural exchange is to be believed, then the agencies involved in that process need to own up to that.”'"
"'12-04-11,'1','“A defendant in this position, who is properly counseled by his attorney, normally will give serious consideration to plea offers made by the people and not reject them out of hand, as Itzler appears to have done,” wrote Eugene R. Hurley III, the assistant district attorney prosecuting the case.The letter said Mr. Itzler had a tentative deal with Polsky Films, a company whose credits include producing, along with and , a documentary called “His Way” about the producer Jerry Weintraub that was nominated for an Emmy last year. Mr. Itzler has been recorded saying he promised to pay Mr. Heller’s $420,000 retainer from the money he would receive if the film were made, according to the letter.If Mr. Hurley’s account of a deal to make a film about Mr. Itzler is accurate, then the defendant would seem to be following a well-worn path.A notable example was the prosecution in the 1980s of Sydney Biddle Barrows, known as the Mayflower Madam, one of a long line of pimps and madams who claimed their black books held the names of well-known men, and who became instantly famous, or at least profitably infamous. Ms. Barrows wrote an autobiography that became a movie starring .Kristin Davis, once known as the Manhattan Madam, unsuccessfully ran for governor in 2010.Most recently, Anna Gristina, called the Soccer Mom Madam by one city tabloid and the Hockey Mom Madam by another, has become a media spectacle since her arrest in late February., who has been tangentially connected to Ms. Gristina’s case, said he did not know whether she was seeking a book or movie deal but would not be surprised if she was trying.“She does seem to be the type of person who wants to parlay this dark cloud into the silver lining of celebrity,” Mr. Kuby said.Mr. Itzler emerged into public view in 2005, when one of his employees, Natalie McLennan, posed for the cover of New York magazine and revealed details of his NY Confidential escort service, based in TriBeCa. In 2006, he pleaded guilty to money-laundering and attempted promotion of prostitution.Mr. Itzler was indicted last year on charges that he provided a prostitute to a customer for three days in July at the Trump International Hotel at Columbus Circle. Mr. Itzler, prosecutors have said, visited the room twice and sold $4,700 worth of cocaine to the customer.After firing his court-appointed lawyer, Mr. Itzler hired Mr. Heller, whose clients have included the Son of Sam killer David Berkowitz and Ms. Davis.In December, Mr. Heller colorfully rejected a plea offer in court. “The King of All Pimps does not plan to abdicate his throne by taking a 5-to-10-year timeout in jail,” he said. “Hundreds of fun-seeking male clients are anxious to resume enjoying the girlfriend experience that Jason has famously provided in a law-abiding manner.”More recently, Mr. Itzler rejected an offer of three to six years. Mr. Heller said his client maintained that he was offering a legal “girlfriend experience or an escort arrangement.”“It would seem to me that the district attorney is almost pandering to the judge to try to facilitate a plea disposition,” Mr. Heller said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “I’ve never seen something like that, frankly.”Mr. Heller said he had left the decision on accepting a plea offer entirely up to Mr. Itzler. He said some details in the district attorney’s letter describing the film deal were inaccurate, perhaps because of Mr. Itzler’s “grandiose” manner of speaking. But he declined to discuss the arrangement further.“I am not by any shape or form in a situation where I would ever allow the best interests of a client to be substituted for my own best interests,” Mr. Heller said.The state’s Son of Sam law, which seeks to prevent criminals from profiting by selling tales of their crimes, would not prohibit Mr. Itzler’s deal at this point. The law allows victims to sue for money, but only after a conviction, said Janine Kava, a spokeswoman for the state’s Office of Victim Services.Polsky Films, which did not return a telephone call, was founded about six years ago by the brothers Alan and Gabe Polsky, according to Variety magazine. Asked by Variety for the secret to their early successes, the brothers responded, “One word: taste.”'"
"'12-04-11,'1','Edward Harbert II, who in the 1980s led an early venture into television by The New York Times as executive producer of NYT Productions, died on Sunday at his home in Westwood, Calif. He was 88.The death was confirmed by his son Michael.Mr. Harbert led NYT Productions from its inception in 1982 until it was discontinued in 1989. A forerunner of later Times ventures in television and digital video production, NYT Productions created television programs on the history of the Olympics and Hollywood stars, videos on the great battles of World War II, famous artists and the history of Broadway, and guides to cooking, wine and home improvement.Edward Wesley Harbert II was born in Oakland, Calif., on Oct. 2, 1923. He served in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II, then went to work in the publicity department of MGM. In the mid-1950s, he joined the production team of “The Tonight Show,” then starring Steve Allen. He later became an executive at the advertising agency Kenyon & Eckhardt.From advertising he moved into magazine publishing. In 1972, he started Lifestyle magazine, which was directed at what he called “superconsumers.” The magazine went out of business within a year. Mr. Harbert retired in 1989.Besides his son Michael, Mr. Harbert is survived by his wife of 67 years, the former Marna Reagor; two other sons, Ted and Christopher; a daughter, Sarah Harbert Mahoney; 12 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Ted Harbert is chairman of NBC Broadcasting, a division of NBCUniversal.'"
"'12-04-11,'1','“These people are addicted to credit, and banks are pushing it,” said Charles Juntikka, a bankruptcy lawyer in .The banks, for their part, are looking to make up the billions in fee income wiped out by regulations enacted after the financial crisis by focusing on two parts of their business — the high and the low ends — industry consultants say. Subprime borrowers typically pay high interest rates, up to 29 percent, and often rack up fees for late payments.Some former banking regulators said they worried that this kind of lending, even in its early stages, signaled a potentially dangerous return to the same risky lending that helped fuel the credit crisis.“It’s clear that we are returning to business as usual,” said Mark T. Williams, a former Federal Reserve bank examiner.The lenders argue that they have learned their lesson and are distinguishing between chronic deadbeats and what some in the industry call “fallen angels,” those who had good payment histories before falling behind as the economy foundered.A spokesman for Chase, Steve O’Halloran, said the bank “seeks to be a careful, responsible lender,” adding that it “is constantly evaluating the risks and costs of funding loans.”Regulators with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , which oversees the nation’s largest banks, said that as long as lenders adhered to strict underwriting standards and monitored risk, there was nothing inherently dangerous about extending credit to a wider swath of people.In fact, an increase in lending is a sign that the economy is improving, economists say. While unemployment remains high, consumers have been reducing their debts. Delinquencies on credit card accounts and auto loans are down sharply from their heights in the crisis. “This is a natural loosening of credit standards because the banks feel they can expand again,” said Michael Binz, a managing director at .And lenders miss many potential customers if they focus just on people with perfect credit.“You can’t simply ignore this segment anymore,” said Deron Weston, a principal in ’s banking practice.The definition of subprime borrowers varies, but is generally considered those with of 660 and below.The push for subprime borrowers has not extended to the market, which remains closed to all but the most creditworthy.Capital One is one lender that has been courting borrowers with damaged credit, even those who have just emerged from bankruptcy, with pitches like, “We want to win you back as a customer.”Pam Girardo, a spokeswoman for Capital One, said, “Our strategy is to provide reasonable access to credit with appropriate guardrails in place to ensure consumers stay on track as they rebuild their credit.”Ms. Alejandro, 46, was one of the borrowers fresh out of bankruptcy courted by Capital One. So far, she has turned it down.David W. Nelms, chief executive of , the sixth-largest credit card lender in the , told investors this month that the company planned to extend credit to a broader group of borrowers. But, he added, Discover is not “suddenly going to go into the subprime business.”Credit card lenders extended $12.5 billion in loans to subprime borrowers last year, up 54.7 percent from 2010, according to Equifax and , but still below the $41.6 billion in 2007.Lenders are ramping up their advertising, according to Synovate, a market research firm. Others are developing credit cards specifically aimed at borrowers with damaged credit. Capital One, for instance, introduced a credit card last year that allows these borrowers to lower their interest rate after making timely payments for a year.Auto loans are particularly attractive for lenders since they were largely untouched by many of the new regulations. The new said it had not yet decided whether it would oversee the largest nonbank auto lenders.At the same time, the market for securities made up of bundles of auto loans is heating up. Last year, investors scooped up $11.7 billion in auto loan securities, up from $2.17 billion in 2008. The pace of securitization in credit cards is slower, with lenders selling roughly 30 percent of their card portfolios to investors, down from 60 percent before the financial crisis, according to S&P.Steve Bowman, the chief credit and risk officer for GM Financial, an auto lender, said he expected subprime auto loans to continue to grow. Unlike mortgage lenders, Mr. Bowman argued, auto lenders understand how to manage risk while still making loans to borrowers with poor credit.But Moody’s was already sounding the alarm last year that some very risky borrowers were getting auto loans. The market, Moody’s wrote in a report in March 2011, could be growing “too much too fast.”Ms. Alejandro is not the only borrower with bad credit to question why anyone would offer a loan. The offer, of course, does not necessarily translate into the issuing of a card.Shauna Ames, 41, an office manager from St. Paul, said she got a credit card offer from Capital One even though the company had won a lawsuit against her for $5,485 in overdue credit card debt last September. Ms. Ames, who had filed for bankruptcy, said she was surprised at the offer. “I still can’t believe it,” she said.Ms. Girardo, the Capital One spokeswoman, said the bank doesn’t solicit customers that it has previously sued. “We believe we can establish long-term relationships with products that are predicated on consumer success,” she said.'"

"'12-04-11,'1','A 2011 PricewaterhouseCoopers study estimates that high rates of shale gas recovery could result in a million new manufacturing jobs by 2025. Robert McCutcheon, United States industrial products leader at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said in a statement that the revived natural gas industry “has the potential to spark a manufacturing renaissance in the U.S., including billions in cost savings, a significant number of new jobs and a greater investment in U.S. plants.”The growing commitment to natural gas faces some headwinds because of continuing concern over the safety of fracking, which involves forcing pressurized fluids into shale formations to fracture the rock and release the gas deposits.Some environmentalists say that fracking can cause drinking water to become contaminated with chemicals and released methane, which is a powerful naturally occurring greenhouse gas and the primary ingredient in natural gas. Other complaints tie the disposal of fracking wastewater to a series of small earthquakes. Some states and municipalities with questions about fracking have imposed temporary moratoriums on the extraction technique.Despite these issues, natural gas is expanding its reach in manufacturing. The Nucor Corporation, which makes direct-reduced iron in a process heavily reliant on natural gas, said in 2010 that it would build a $750 million facility in Louisiana. In 2004, the company dismantled a similar Louisiana plant and shipped it to Trinidad.According to Nucor, affordable domestic natural gas means its made-in-Louisiana direct-reduced iron, which is sold in pellet or briquette form as a raw material for steel mills, can be delivered at the same price as the product shipped from Trinidad. “Affordable American shale gas has completely changed the economics for us,” said Katherine Miller, a Nucor spokeswoman.Methanex, a Canadian company that makes methanol from natural gas is planning to move a plant from Chile to Louisiana, with production to begin in 2014. Gary Rowan, a Methanex vice president, said that his company had also shut down a Louisiana plant in the early 2000s. “Certainly, the outlook for low North American natural gas prices is one of the reasons we selected Louisiana as a new location for our methanol plant,” he said.Electric utilities see a significant natural gas price advantage over other fuels, but because of pending and potential environmental regulations they are also motivated by its status as the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon emissions. On March 27, the Obama administration proposed the first-ever rule to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants. Natural gas plants are expected to meet the standard, but coal burners will have a much harder time. “The electricity sector is the principal growth area for natural gas under carbon dioxide emission constraints,” said an M.I.T. study titled “The Future of Natural Gas.”Another advantage, according to Richard McMahon, a vice president of finance and energy supply at the Edison Electric Institute, is that natural gas plants are cheaper to build than coal plants.“Natural gas generally has a smaller footprint,” he said. “Coal plants need to store coal, but natural gas plants get their fuel from a pipeline and don’t need physical storage.” The Obama greenhouse rules would widen the price gap by requiring new coal plants to include carbon capture technology.The United States still has a big investment in coal plants, and a transition will be gradual. The federal Energy Information Administration estimates that electricity generation from natural gas will increase about 9 percent in 2012, at the same time that coal production declines almost 5 percent. If there is a constraint on utility commitment to natural gas, it is the fuel’s history of large price fluctuations.Thomas Farrell, chairman and chief executive of Dominion Resources, a utility that delivers electric power and natural gas to four states, describes natural gas as “very volatile in its pricing. We’re a utility whose customers rely on us to think through 60-year power plant investments, and we’ve found that the best approach is to have diverse sources and not depend on one predominant source of fuel.”But he added that the company was definitely benefiting from low natural gas prices now. Dominion Virginia Power’s 13 percent natural gas electricity production in 2010 jumped to 17 percent in 2011. The company recently completed a natural gas plant and is constructing another, but it also has large nuclear and coal investments.The share of natural gas as a transportation fuel has never been large, but it is growing rapidly. Refueling is an issue, because there are about 1,000 natural gas stations in the United States (compared with nearly 160,000 gasoline stations) and only half of those are open to the public. Only one automaker, Honda, sells a natural gas passenger car on the American market, and consumers are unlikely to buy them in large numbers any time soon. But the opportunities for truck fleets are quite different.Almost 40 percent of new garbage trucks and 25 percent of new transit buses can run on natural gas, said the trade organization Natural Gas Vehicles for America. Dan Ustian, chief executive of the truck maker Navistar, said that garbage truck number could grow to 50 percent by the end of next year. Navistar is also building long-range trucks.Although natural gas cars and small trucks usually run on compressed natural gas, known as C.N.G., to avoid frequent refueling, the larger trucks will mostly use the liquefied form, L.N.G., which has much greater energy density per volume (but must be kept at very cold “cryogenic” temperatures).Mr. Ustian estimates that, because of quick paybacks with a $1.50 a gallon equivalent price advantage, natural gas could capture 10 percent to 20 percent of the new tractor-trailer vehicle market within a year.Chrysler, Ford and General Motors have all recently introduced “bifuel” pickup trucks that can run on both natural gas and gasoline. To ensure that such trucks have a place to fill up, Navistar has joined with a natural gas provider, Clean Energy Fuels, and Pilot-Flying J Travel Centers to locate stations 250 miles apart along Interstates. By the end of the year, Clean Energy hopes to have 75 stations open in 33 states.Andrew Littlefair, president and chief executive of Clean Energy, said that the aim was to make natural gas refueling available on the major trucking corridors. “You don’t need 23,000 truck stops with natural gas,” he said. “You need hundreds in the right places and you can move a lot of fuel. These stations will be where the trucks go now, and the economics look very good.”In March, Chesapeake Energy, a major natural gas producer, and General Electric said they would collaborate on developing natural gas infrastructure for vehicles, including construction of more than 250 C.N.G. stations beginning this fall.The prospects exist for American producers to become significant natural gas exporters. In 2011, Dominion won approval from the Energy Department to export L.N.G. from its Cove Point terminal in the Chesapeake Bay to about 20 countries that have free trade agreements with the United States. It has applied for a permit to service the rest of the world. Dominion said that its terminal work force — initially intended to handle imports before the United States became a powerhouse producer — could nearly double with the added workload.“It’s definitely ironic,” Mr. Farrell said. “Ten years ago, even the futurists wouldn’t have predicted that we’d be exporting natural gas today.”'"
"'12-04-11,'1','HONG KONG — Ni Yulan, a rights advocate who was crippled by abuse in prison and was later left homeless on the streets of Beijing, was sentenced by a Chinese court on Tuesday to a new prison term of two years and eight months, an advocacy group said.The court, in the Xicheng district of Beijing, sentenced Ms. Ni and her husband, Dong Jiqin, on charges of creating a disturbance, and Ms. Ni alone on an additional fraud charge, according to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, a group based in Hong Kong. Mr. Dong’s sentence is for two years.The couple were arrested in April 2011. Prosecutors said that Ms. Ni, who holds a law degree from China University of Political Science and Law, accepted payment for giving legal advice despite having been disbarred, and that Ms. Ni and Mr. Dong failed to pay hotel bills of about $11,000, The Associated Press reported.Ms. Ni has been jailed twice before, both times on charges of obstructing official business. In 2002, she helped residents of Xicheng fight eviction from their homes as the government was remaking Beijing for the 2008 Olympics. During her detention, she said, she was kicked and beaten for 15 hours, leaving her unable to walk. She was released after 75 days.She was jailed again in 2008 and released in 2010, but was left homeless. Her family residence had been demolished while she was in prison, and she said the police made it difficult for her to rent an apartment or a hotel room. She and her husband camped in a donated tent at a park in Beijing, attracting much news media attention. The authorities then moved the couple to a hotel room.Ms. Ni has described a number of instances of abuse that she experienced in prison, including an officer’s urinating on her face and prison officials’ taking away her crutches, forcing her to crawl from her cell to the prison workshop.'"
"'12-04-11,'1','Whether Eric Dompierre will play again for Ishpeming will be determined by the state association’s 19-member representative council. A majority of the council would have to vote to pass the request on to all of the member schools, who would then vote on the measure. Two-thirds of the schools would need to vote in favor of the amendment for it to pass.John Roberts, the association’s executive director, said the council denied Ishpeming’s first request in December 2010 because it was “too narrow,” with language specifically requesting a waiver for students with Down syndrome. In December 2011, the council denied a second request, which suggested language specific for students with Down syndrome as well as language used by Ohio’s high school association for age-rule exceptions. Roberts said Ishpeming’s second request received “less and less support” as it was discussed during summer and fall meetings last year.A third request, which was submitted March 26, suggests language used in Ohio and seven other states that include similar age-rule exceptions for students with disabilities, with no specific reference to Down syndrome. It could be the Dompierres’ best — and last — chance to change the rule.Roberts said the “broadening definition” of disabilities led to a discussion of where the line would be drawn, and raised concerns about the potential number of waiver requests. Such an exception could open up the state association to allegations in court, he said, as the lack of an exception did in 1995 in an age-rule case that reached the United States Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The association was a defendant, and the court found, according to Roberts, “to decide which disabilities should and shouldn’t apply for waiver put an undue burden on the association.”Dean Dompierre first did the math regarding his son’s eligibility four years ago, after the varsity basketball coach saw Eric playing in the gym and said, “I’ve got him down as a four-year player.” Eric soon began attending off-season workouts and also joined the football team as a backup kicker. The basketball season ended in March, but Dean started preparing Eric for the possibility that his athletic career was ending when the second request was denied. He answered with more uncertainty when Eric would ask, “How are we doing with the law?”Dean posted a petition in support of his son on the high school’s Web site on March 23. A week later, more than 70,000 people had signed it.Dompierre has also sought help from Deborah Moore, the associate commissioner of the Ohio High School Athletic Association, who wrote her state’s age-rule exception.In Ohio, if a student is considered disabled as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act, the school’s principal, on behalf of the student, can submit an age-exception application, consisting of an outline of the disability and statements — to gather rivaling perspectives — from the principal and an administrator of a school that plays the student’s school in sports, outlining four main criteria: safety risk, physical advantage, competitive equity and redshirting.“This is basically a rule of compassion,” Moore said.Moore could not recall any cases in Ohio that had ended in court. Over nine years, statistics provided by Moore showed 24 disabled high school students had been approved and 16 had been denied, with one pending.Roberts said the Michigan association had not specifically investigated the success of Ohio’s rule.It is unlikely that a decision will be made regarding Eric Dompierre until May, when the association’s representative council is next scheduled to meet.“Ultimately, the rules for Michigan high school athletics are not to be established by online petitions and they’re not going to be established by what happens in other states,” Roberts said. “It’s going to be determined by what the schools of this state want for its operation.”'"

"'12-04-12,'1','NEW YORK (AP) — Google Inc. has announced plans to issue a new class of stock to existing shareholders, effectively splitting shares 2 to 1. It’s an unusual approach that reflects a desire by Google’s founders to preserve the company’s long-term interests.Here’s an explanation of the plan:Q. Why is Google doing this?A. Google’s current stock structure concentrates voting power with Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and with Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt. Google is afraid of diluting that power as it issues new shares to employees and to companies that it acquires through stock purchases. Google says there’s no immediate danger of that happening, but it sees no need to wait. “It’s important to bear in mind that this proposal will only have an effect on governance over the very long term,” Page and Brin wrote in a letter. “It’s just that since we know what we want to do, there’s no reason to delay the decision.”Q. What does this mean for existing shareholders?A. Investors typically have Class A stock now. They will be given an equal number of Class C shares, which won’t have any voting power. The value of the Class A stock will be split between the two, so if the stock is trading at $600 when it happens, a Class A share will be worth $300 and a Class C share will be worth $300. Investors will have twice the number of shares they held before, but the total voting power and stock value won’t change. So if Bob owns 100 shares worth $600 each, he will own 200 shares worth $300 each. Bob will still have 100 votes, and the value of all his shares will still be $60,000. Investors will be free to buy and sell shares in either class independently, and the new class will get its own ticker symbol. If Bob sells his 100 Class C shares, he will have 100 votes through the Class A stock, and the shares will be worth $30,000. But if Bob sells his 100 Class A shares, he will have no vote on the Class C stock worth $30,000.Q. Is this a new strategy for Google?A. No. Since it went public in 2004, Google’s founders have emphasized the need for long-term governance. They believe they need to retain the voting power to do that. The stock structure had been designed from the start to leave power with Page, Brin and Schmidt. Page and Brin argue that Google will be more successful if it concentrates on the long term, even if that means short-term stumbles in meeting Wall Street’s targets for earnings and revenue. The founders note that it took three years for the first phones based on Google’s Android operating system to come out and another three years for the system to reach critical mass. They don’t want investors voting with short-term interests in mind. “These kinds of investments are not for the faint-hearted,” the founders said.Q. So is this a split or a dividend?A. It’s neither in the traditional sense. The stock is effectively being split, as the value of each share will be cut in half. Stock splits allow smaller investors to buy shares, but in this case, the move is driven more by a desire to retain control and less by shareholder pressure. It can be considered a dividend, but instead of getting cash, investors will get stock.A. Existing shareholders must approve the plan at Google’s annual stockholder meeting on June 21. Because Page, Brin and Schmidt control the majority of votes, it’s expected to pass.'"

"'12-04-12,'1','Unlike other farm programs that have income or payment limits, crop insurance payments have no such restrictions, so farmers can get millions in subsidies regardless of their income. The G.A.O. said a cap last year would have affected about 4 percent of farmers in the program, who accounted for about a third of the premium subsidies and were mostly associated with large farms.“High premium subsidies have hurt small and beginning farmers because the subsidies themselves have distorted the market,” Mr. Coburn said.  “For instance, high subsidies have artificially increased the value of land and have created other barriers to entry and expansion.”Craig Cox, vice president for agriculture and natural resources at the Environmental Working Group, a research group in Washington, said the report’s findings were startling.“This has huge implications for the farm bill now under consideration,” Mr. Cox said about a major agriculture policy measure taking shape. He said the government had moved “from a system of direct payments to farmers where there are income restrictions and payment caps to a world without any restrictions on how much you can get in these insurance subsidies.”“This means more subsidies going to large farmers and more cost to the taxpayers,” he added.Agriculture interests say they oppose any changes to the crop insurance program.“We think it works just fine,” said Steve Wellman, president of the American Soybean Association. “We are certainly willing to do our fair share to help reduce spending, and we are doing that in other areas, like eliminating direct payments. But it doesn’t make sense to make changes to a program that has been successful and critical to farming operations.”Farm programs, including crop insurance, have come under scrutiny with increasing pressure to reduce the federal deficit and with farm income at record levels. The Agriculture Department estimates that net farm income was a record $101 billion last year, according to the G.A.O report. In addition, the report said, the department’s data shows that farmers’ top five years in income over the past three decades have occurred since 2004.President Obama and many Republicans, including Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican who leads the Budget Committee, have proposed changes in the crop insurance program, including limiting payments or lowering the amounts that the government covers in premiums.But lawmakers on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees are opposed to any adjustments in the crop insurance program. The chairwoman of the Senate committee, Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, whose panel is working on the 2012 farm bill, said she disagreed with proposals to change crop insurance. The House committee chairman, Frank D. Lucas, Republican of Oklahoma, was more direct in his opposition. Mr. Lucas said that any crop insurance cuts would “threaten the integrity of the program itself.”'"
"'12-04-12,'1','The moves underscored how complicated the issue has become for Ms. Quinn behind the scenes.

At the time, Ms. Wylde praised her for coming up with a compromise wage measure that she could support, while the leader of the retail workers’ union hailed her for passing a bill that labor leaders had long advocated.Ms. Quinn is widely expected to run for mayor next year; the fact that she had appeared to rally both business leaders and labor advocates behind such a contentious measure bolstered her case that she had the negotiating prowess for the job.Although the mayoral waiver has now been dropped, an exemption for companies involved in part of the Hudson Yards project, a 26-acre mixed-use development along the city’s Far West Side, appeared likely to stay in the bill. In a radio interview on Wednesday, Ms. Quinn said that the final version of the bill would “more than likely” include an exemption for Hudson Yards.She defended the exemption, telling her interviewer, the host Leonard Lopate, that the Hudson Yards project was too far along in development for it to be fair to change the rules at this stage.“Our intention was never to go backward, but to get future deals moving forward,” Ms. Quinn said. “Most of the leases, deals, whatever, on Hudson Yards are well along in the negotiation so it was really — although a bit was made of it in the papers — it’s really just grandparenting.”A spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Wednesday that the mayor still opposed the bill and planned to veto it, though the Council appears to have the votes to override a veto.Part of Hudson Yards is being developed by the Related Companies, one of the city’s most powerful real estate developers and a significant donor to Ms. Quinn’s mayoral campaign. A spokeswoman for Related declined to comment on Wednesday.The bill would require companies getting substantial city subsidies to pay workers at least $10 an hour with benefits, or $11.50 an hour without benefits. The minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.'"
"'12-04-12,'1','By choosing to charge George Zimmerman with second-degree murder in the killing of Trayvon Martin, Angela B. Corey, the special prosecutor appointed to the case in Florida, selected the toughest possible charge involving a killing short of first-degree murder, which requires a finding of premeditation and carries the death penalty as a possible punishment.Under second-degree murder, the jury must find that a death was caused by a criminal act “demonstrating a depraved mind without regard for human life,” said Eric Abrahamsen, a criminal defense lawyer in Tallahassee, reading from the state’s standard jury instructions. The maximum sentence for second-degree murder is life in prison; the minimum penalty under these charges is 25 years.Dan Markel, a law professor at Florida State University, said he was “very surprised” by the severity of the charges “in light of the evidence that seems to have been brought to the attention of the public so far.” Many legal experts had predicted that Mr. Zimmerman would be charged with manslaughter.The charge of second-degree murder also means that Mr. Zimmerman will not be entitled to be released on bail before his trial. Instead, his lawyer will be able to ask for what Florida calls an Arthur hearing, which can take place weeks after the arrest, to determine whether he should be allowed to post bond.Jeff Weiner, a former president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers who practices in Miami, said an Arthur hearing “is not a mini-trial, but it’s a very good preview of the evidence that the state has at this point.”Mr. Weiner suggested that the prosecutor might have “overcharged” to retain the option, should she feel a murder conviction is slipping away, of asking the judge to instruct the jury to consider lesser offenses, like manslaughter. It is also possible, he said, that she might be trying to coax Mr. Zimmerman to the negotiating table to plead guilty to such a lesser charge. But, he added, it is impossible to say whether it is overly tough, since evidence has not yet been produced.'"
"'12-04-12,'1','LOS ANGELES — Police officers at the University of California, Davis, should not have used pepper spray on protesters who had set up camp in the middle of campus as part of the Occupy movement last November, according to an investigation of the episode by a campus task force.In a 190-page report released Wednesday, the task force concluded that “the pepper spraying incident that took place on Nov. 18, 2011, should and could have been prevented.” The report details a pattern of miscommunication and describes campus leadership as inadequate.The episode last fall garnered worldwide attention, particularly on social media, as images showed Lt. John Pike of the campus police calmly releasing pepper spray on seemingly peaceful protesters sitting on the ground.Campus police had sued to prevent the report’s release, saying that it amounted to an internal investigation, and subsequent court hearings delayed the release of the report by more than a month. The university agreed to remove the names of most police officers from the report.According to the report, administrators repeatedly said they were particularly concerned that protesters who did not attend U.C. Davis would flood the campus and endanger students. The campus police chief, Annette Spicuzza, estimated that 80 percent of protesters camping in the campus quad were not students. But that was challenged by student affairs administrators, who had spent time talking with the protesters and said that the vast majority of campers were students. The investigation found that the counterargument was largely ignored and administrators reiterated their concern for students.'"
"'12-04-12,'1','Here and in Washington, officials assume that as soon as information is received that Iran has moved to build nuclear weapons, Israel will decide to attack its nuclear facilities. Therefore, any exchange of intelligence between Israel and the United States could have far-reaching consequences for the Middle East — and the world.In other words, the momentous decision will be driven to an extraordinary extent by intelligence reports. But even though intense focus on Iran’s nuclear program has presumably increased the volume of intelligence gathered about it, it remains true that intelligence officers tend to rely heavily on a few trusted sources. And it may be only human for a case officer to be excited by discovering something that appears to be a secret.Bits of data can be misread, however, and erroneous analysis has a habit of finding its way to those most eager to use it. So in watching Iran’s nuclear project, even a slight intelligence gaffe could have an outcome of historic proportions.In the late 1980s, the United States and Israel believed that they had good intelligence on Iraq, but they missed the extent of Saddam Hussein’s pursuit of unconventional weapons — until after he invaded Kuwait. Like the Syrian nuclear project, that stands as a warning of the dangers of overconfidence that a threat is absent. A parallel case in Iran might arise if the supreme leader were to convey his order to assemble a nuclear bomb via channels the C.I.A. and Mossad knew nothing about.A surprise could also come from the opposite direction — as a result of overestimating the other side’s capabilities and intentions; in Iran’s case, that could lead to a premature Israeli attack.Could that happen? It did — to America when it relied on faulty intelligence to justify its invasion of Iraq in 2003, claiming that it knew Saddam Hussein was hiding unconventional weapons.This year, an equally fateful decision may well rely on the quality of available intelligence. So, caution is in order: Relying on intelligence as the chief touchstone for decisions about whether and when to attack creates a wide opening for misunderstandings, divergent interpretations and vulnerabilities to parties with an interest in either attack or delay.Both Israel and America should acknowledge that scraps of information cannot serve as the basis for action against Iran, and they should find new criteria for such a decision.The direct talks that begin on Friday in Istanbul offer a chance to develop at least some new measures of Iran’s willingness to cooperate. This could work on two levels. Publicly, Iran can be judged on its willingness to meet the world’s demands. Under the surface, a continuing dialogue between Iran and the West — which will require much consultation and interaction among Iranians themselves — can reveal or clarify information about Iran and its decision making that would not have surfaced otherwise.Even without firm knowledge that the supreme leader had ordered his scientists to assemble a bomb, such information could help guide analysis and decision making, which nobody can afford to approach lightly. A miscalculation could be the worst possible outcome.'"

That’s like throwing out the baby with the bathwater.Nearly 50 years ago, city fathers decided that McKim, Mead & White’s Penn Station no longer fit with the growing modernism of Manhattan’s renewal, and it was demolished. We now regret this hasty action.Architecture is not like fashion; buildings are meant to last, and if necessary renovated to accommodate the changes that naturally occur over time.This has happened with Rudolph’s Art and Architecture Building at Yale, and the result is brilliant.The writer is the architect.'"
"'12-04-12,'1','The name Fairchild may be synonymous with publishing in New York, but James Fairchild, 55, chose fashion over the family business. Mr. Fairchild (the son of John Fairchild, of Fairchild Publications) spent two decades as a vice president for design at Ralph Lauren before moving to the Hamptons several years ago. And earlier this year, he opened a store there, in what used to be an ice cream shop.Merchandise in the 900-square-foot space includes home and fashion items and children’s goods, most vintage or antique, displayed in vignettes of various lifestyles, like “Americana” and “Left Bank.” (The antique ivory crab, $1,800, left, is part of the latter.)“I started with nothing, and bought everything by lifestyle, adding in other items I’ve collected,” Mr. Fairchild said. “You’re meant to park yourself on a bench, absorb the surroundings and have something to drink.”'"
"'12-04-12,'1','Unlike the administration of President , this official said, the Obama administration did not give the North Koreans anything before they violated the agreement by announcing plans to go ahead with the satellite launching. And, he added, the administration expects the North Koreans to abide by the other terms of the deal if it hopes, as it has said, for a fuller diplomatic dialogue.Still, for , who prided himself on not falling into the trap of previous presidents in dealing with North Korea, the diplomatic dead end has been a frustrating episode: proof that a change in leadership in Pyongyang has done nothing to change its penchant for flouting United Nations resolutions, paying no heed to its biggest patron, China, and reneging on deals with the .Moreover, administration officials said they feared that the missile launching could be the first in a series of provocations, which could include the test of a nuclear bomb possibly fueled by highly enriched uranium. A nuclear test would almost certainly force the administration to go to the Security Council, they said.“North Korea should stop engaging in these types of provocative and destabilizing actions,” said a spokesman for the , Tommy Vietor. “We’d like to see nations that have close relations with North Korea consider what else they could do to send a clear signal to this new leadership that it’s time for them to move in a different direction.”At a nuclear summit meeting in two weeks ago, Mr. Obama leaned on China’s president, , to use his leverage to stop the launching. While administration officials said the Chinese were angry with Pyongyang and conveyed that message, it appeared to have not been enough to deter North Korea from a launching it says is intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the birth of Kim Il-sung, the revered father of the country.On Wednesday, Kim’s grandson, , was named to the nation’s top political post in a meeting of the Workers’ Party, tightening his grip on power during a week of events marking the anniversary. North Korea has invited dozens of foreign journalists to cover the festivities, including the satellite launching.The White House has urged media organizations not to overdo their coverage, saying it would give Pyongyang a propaganda victory. The satellite, one official said, was a “dishwasher wrapped in tinfoil.” But that has not stopped news organizations from sending correspondents to Pyongyang, where they have filed frequent reports on preparations.For weeks, the administration has had to contend with whispers from Korea experts that somehow its diplomats were duped, or that the Americans did not issue a clear enough warning to the North Koreans that a launching would be unacceptable — a narrative that the North Koreans have helped to propagate.But according to Evans Revere, a former principal deputy assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific affairs at the State Department, the new State Department negotiator for North Korea, Glyn Davies, told the North Koreans that a satellite launching would be a violation of whatever agreement they made, when he sat opposite a veteran North Korean diplomat, Kim Kye-gwan, in late February.“Administration officials have told me that the D.P.R.K. side understood clearly and accepted the U.S. position that a satellite launch would be violation of the Feb. 29 agreement’s ban on long-range missile tests,” Mr. Revere said, using the acronym for the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.Mr. Revere said he had been told by North Korean contacts as early as December that the government planned to launch a satellite. The information was so alarming that he passed it to the administration before Mr. Davies traveled to to meet Mr. Kim, Mr. Revere said. The North Korean negotiator left Beijing knowing that if a satellite launching went ahead, the accord would not last, he said.Putting a best face on the North Korean disregard for the Feb. 29 agreement, an Asian diplomat with long experience in dealing with North Korea, who requested anonymity to preserve relations with officials in Pyongyang, said it was possible that Mr. Kim, a Foreign Ministry official, was not told of the North Korean’s military plans for a satellite missile launching.Some analysts question why the Obama administration did not insist on written assurances from North Korea that it would not launch a ballistic missile. Alternatively, the administration could have postponed the agreement to see if the North Koreans went ahead with the launching.“This seems to have been a strategic error that has left the administration with an unpalatable choice of denouncing or only partially enforcing an agreement it recently hailed,” said Douglas Paal, the director of the program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and once an official both in the administrations of President and his successor, President George Bush.Analysts expressed sympathy for the administration’s predicament. But some said they thought the political calendar — not just in the United States, but in China and South Korea, which are also facing political transitions — had led countries to relax pressure on North Korea.“Did the administration give a huge amount of aid and get sucker-punched? No,” said Michael Green, who served in the administration of President George W. Bush and is now at the . “But the strategic context matters. Since the beginning of 2011, we have visibly been less urgent about North Korea.”'"
"'12-04-12,'1','Just how broadly farmers use antibiotics simply to promote animal growth is unknown. About 80 percent of antibiotics used on farms are given through feed, and an additional 17 percent are given in water. Just 3 percent are given by injection.The F.D.A. believes that veterinarians will be far less likely to endorse indiscriminate drug uses. While doctors have the power to use drugs in ways not approved by the F.D.A., veterinarians are allowed to give a prescription for antibiotics in feed and water only if such uses are approved by the F.D.A.Dr. Christine Hoang of the American Veterinary Medical Association said that her organization supported the new rules, although she said that some remote or small farmers might have trouble abiding by the rules since there are fewer than 10,000 large-animal veterinarians in the United States.Antibiotics were the wonder drugs of the 20th century, and their initial uses in humans and animals were indiscriminate, experts say. Farmers were impressed that antibiotics led to rapid animal growth and began to add the drugs to feed and water, with no or sign of sickness in the animals.By the 1970s, public health officials had become worried that overuse was leading to the development of infections resistant to treatment in humans. In 1977, the F.D.A. announced that it would begin banning some agricultural uses. But the House and Senate appropriations committees — dominated by agricultural interests — passed resolutions against the ban, and the agency retreated. In the years since, the issue of antibiotic overuse in animals and drug resistance has become one of the leading public health concerns worldwide. Those concerns have over recent years even convinced some in the agricultural community that action was needed.The new rules generated mixed reactions from both public health advocates and agricultural trade associations. Laura Rogers of the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming called the new rules “the most sweeping action the agency has undertaken in this area,” while Caroline Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest criticized them as “tragically flawed” because they relied too much on voluntary industry efforts.The Animal Health Institute, an association of animal drug makers, welcomed the new rules. But R. C. Hunt, president of the National Pork Producers Council, said that small farmers and ranchers would have a hard time following the new rules, which “could eliminate antibiotics uses that are extremely important to the health of animals.”Initially, the F.D.A. is asking drug makers to voluntarily change their labels to require a prescription; federal officials said that drug makers had largely agreed to the change. If some fail to impose the restrictions, the agency will consider a more forceful ban, Mr. Taylor said.The reason for the reliance on voluntary efforts is that the F.D.A.’s process for revoking approved drug uses is lengthy and cumbersome, officials said. The last time the F.D.A. banned an agricultural use of a medically important antibiotic against the wishes of its maker, legal appeals took five years. In this case, hundreds of drugs are involved, each with myriad approved uses in various animals.“You and I and our children would be long dead before F.D.A. could restrict all of these uses on its own,” Ms. Rogers said.Last month, Judge Theodore H. Katz of the Southern District of New York ordered the F.D.A. to begin the process to ban indiscriminate agricultural uses of penicillin and tetracycline because of dangers to human health. The agency hopes that the rules it announced Wednesday achieve the same result.This year, the Obama administration announced restrictions on agricultural uses of cephalosporins, a critical class of antibiotics that includes drugs like Cefzil and Keflex, which are commonly used to treat and .For most drug makers, there are compelling reasons to cooperate. Many of the companies manufacture both animal and human drugs but earn the vast majority of their profits in the human sphere. Any company seen to undermine human health could earn doctors’ disapproval and potentially hurt their most important business.But Ms. DeWaal of the science center said that she believed the industry would not follow through on its promises but would instead await the next election in hopes of an administration friendlier to its interests. She condemned the F.D.A. for failing to restrict these drug uses outright. “The agency is afraid to use its authority,” she said.'"
"'12-04-12,'1','In a setback for efforts to end a tax dispute between the United States and Switzerland, a Swiss court announced on Wednesday that Credit Suisse could not turn over account data of its American clients to the United States tax authorities because doing so would violate the terms of a 1996 tax treaty between the two countries.In its decision, dated April 5 and published Wednesday, the Federal Administrative Court in Bern upheld the appeal of a bank client who had objected to having his account data given to the Internal Revenue Service.The United States is investigating Credit Suisse and 10 other Swiss banks on suspicions that they helped Americans evade taxes. The court decided that the I.R.S. cast too wide a net in a September 2011 request for confidential Credit Suisse client information. The criteria, the court found, were not narrow enough to enable the bank to identify clients suspected of fraudulent conduct “with a high degree of probability.”Rather, it appeared that the I.R.S. was pursuing people for “above all mere tax evasion, for which administrative assistance cannot be granted,” according to the 1996 treaty, “even if high amounts are at stake.” The court also said that “mere failure to declare a bank account may be qualified — at the utmost — as tax evasion, which is not subject to administrative assistance.”The law governing Swiss banking secrecy distinguishes between tax fraud, which is a crime in Switzerland, and tax evasion, which is not — a distinction that has never held sway in Washington.'"

I would have grabbed the maroon chinos as well, if they had had my size. They would have gone well with the understated Dr. Martens Alfie boot, secretly the most wearable style they make ($75), should you ever tire of oxblood.Alter also has eccentric flourishes, like a pair of psychedelic Parke & Ronen swim trunks ($105) that look like M.I.A. album art, or black driving gloves ($29, down from $54). Also, the pungent organic soaps by Juniper Ridge ($12.50). I opted for the Big Sur, which had the most fragrant air (“scent notes: wild ginger, burnt honey, salt, damp ground”). If you’re lucky, the company Web site displays a photo of the actual harvest that birthed your soap cake; the ID number is on the back of the box.Being the most comprehensive style outlet for a mile or so, it also has some downright strange items, like white canvas BE & D high-tops with the silhouette of a woman’s high heel painted on the side ($128), which suggests a local artisan gone mad; or the Zuriick black suede boots ($105, down from $195), which have a mature toe box but the body of an Alexandre Plokhov knockoff.NOT far away, the younger Raised by Wolves is more spacious, more generous. The dressing rooms are phenomenal, huge mirrors illuminated with bright bulbs. (By contrast, the changing rooms at Alter are barely better than a bed sheet tied to a pipe.) It has a more modest selection but, over all, a sharper one, even counting the macramé dog collars that look like Turk’s head-knot bracelets ($20).The most promising items are by Fischer, including, oddly, a basic white cotton oxford ($124, reduced from $155) made of a heavy fabric that felt sensual. Fischer, the salesclerk told me, is made by a clothier who lives a couple of blocks away. I probably could have knocked on her door in a neighborly fashion and asked her to whip up something for me. Maybe someday. Instead, I grabbed one of the company’s gorgeous pocket squares, in a hand-painted olive green and burnt sienna floral pattern ($20).A couple of storefronts down, I walked into another store  to find a woman meditatively running pairs of torn jeans through a Singer sewing machine while behind her, on the floor, a baby in a bouncer was rocking into a giddy stupor. This was Kill Devil Hill, a curiosity and ephemera shop and a sort of Colonial Williamsburg living exhibit for Greenpoint, which feels both 20 years in the future and 150 years in the past.There are things for sale here: Annie B’s caramels (three for $1); P & H sarsaparilla-flavored soda syrup ($10); Waikoloa Bob insect repellent ($7), made by the woman’s father, as it happens. And exponentially more-pricey items hung high on the walls, from a 1920s guitar ($250) to a Hopi rug ($4,500). But mostly this shop represents the neighborhood’s values, and its value. It was difficult not to walk out of there with a slightly altered view.Back on the street, a young man walked past carrying a terrarium-diorama that appeared to have toy dinosaurs in the middle. A block away, a cherry-red pickup truck, circa 1940, moaned its way around the corner. Seconds became minutes became hours.'"

"'12-04-13,'0','Ryan Callahan, Marian Gaborik, Brian Boyle and Brad Richards scored goals as the Rangers built a 4-0 lead. Henrik Lundqvist, shaking off high expectations and recent spotty performances, made 30 saves and held the fort when the Rangers faltered midway through the game. He was not beaten until halfway through the third period, and the other goal he gave up came with less than three minutes remaining.The Rangers played nearly flawless hockey for most of the first period, spearheaded by Callahan, their inspirational captain.Callahan was playing his first postseason game since 2009. He missed last season’s playoffs with a fractured ankle, and the Rangers fell to Washington in five games in the opening round. In 2010 the Rangers missed the playoffs on the season’s final day.But on Thursday, Callahan opened the scoring at 12 minutes 1 second. He fought off defenseman Filip Kuba twice, collected the rebound of Anton Stralman’s bouncing shot from the blue line, and curled a shot past Senators goalie Craig Anderson on the short side.Getting free from Kuba twice on one play is no slight feat; he was plus-26 on the season, 10th best in the N.H.L.Callahan was not through stamping his mark on the game. Later in the period he jumped into the defense when Ryan McDonagh got caught deep in the Ottawa zone as the Senators counterattacked. Callahan broke up the rush at the red line by stepping into  Jesse Winchester and delivering a perfect open-ice hip-and-shoulder check.His heroics did not go unnoticed. “Cally, Cally,” the fans chanted.“It was tough last year, not to be with the team in the playoffs after battling and just making it into the playoffs,” Callahan said of last season’s eighth-place Rangers. “And then you have to sit and watch. So it was good to get this first game under my belt.”Late in the first period and through the first half of the second, the Senators took control of the game. It was still 1-0 for the Rangers, but Ottawa had a 22-11 shooting advantage, and Lundqvist was the main factor keeping the Rangers ahead.Coach John Tortorella called timeout at 9:51 and told his players to stop dumping the puck to the Senators.“I told them to stop slapping the puck around,” Tortorella said. “It just looked like they were trying a little bit too hard — we kept giving the puck back to them.”The Rangers still were not out of trouble. McDonagh took a tripping penalty at 12:56. But Callahan took over again.He blocked a shot by Erik Karlsson, then stood in front of another attempt so effectively that Karlsson instead was forced to make an errant pass.The Rangers survived the penalty without surrendering a shot on goal.Less than two minutes later, Gaborik, the Rangers’ top scorer in the regular season, got free in the Ottawa end, deked Anderson, and made it 2-0 by slipping the puck between his legs at 16:24.Callahan almost added an exclamation point 30 seconds later when he bounced the puck off Artem Anisimov’s skate and against the goal post. Callahan was hooked by Kuba, and on the ensuing man advantage Boyle made it 3-0.“That’s why he’s the captain,” defenseman Dan Girardi said.Tortorella said, “He does everything for us.”By this time the Rangers were in total control. Richards, the Rangers’ second leading scorer during the regular season, made it 4-0 early in the third period as the fans roared their approval.“The home crowd helped, especially me,” said Anisimov, who had two assists and played with continued confidence.He added: “We played like we did all year long. Good hockey.”'"
"'12-04-13,'0','Infosys, a fast-growing global business that has carefully built a reputation for integrity, vigorously denies Mr. Palmer’s accusations and is fighting his lawsuit in federal court in Montgomery.“Any allegation or assertion that there is or was a corporate policy of evading the law in conjunction with the B-1 visa program is simply not accurate,” Ted Bockius, an Infosys spokesman, said Thursday. Infosys has been in discussions with the federal authorities, he said, and has complied with a subpoena they issued. He added that fewer than 2 percent of the company’s workers in the United States at any time are on B-1 visitor visas.Mr. Palmer, 44, a software project manager for Infosys since August 2008, said he decided to sue the company, claiming he was punished for reporting corporate misdeeds, after executives pressured him to drop his complaints. But even as the months have crawled by, Mr. Palmer has not quit his Infosys job, fearing he will not get another one now that he is known as the guy who went up against the Indian company.“The mental and physical challenge one takes on after blowing the whistle is excruciating,” Mr. Palmer, who is known as Jay, wrote in a recent e-mail. After what he has seen, he said, “It will be hard for me to advise anyone to blow the whistle.”In Senate testimony and court documents, Mr. Palmer charged that Infosys brought Indian workers on short-term visitor visas, known as B-1, instead of longer-term temporary visas, known as H-1B, which are more costly and time-consuming to obtain. Infosys and other Indian technology outsourcing companies are consistently among the top users of H-1B visas, but in recent years intensified scrutiny by the State Department has made those visas more difficult to get.The B-1 is for foreigners coming for conferences or to conduct training, consulting or contract negotiations who continue as employees of the company abroad. They are paid at the generally lower wage rates of the home country.“This was totally about profit and not hiring Americans for jobs in the U.S. due to higher salary requirements,” Mr. Palmer told the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on immigration in July. Besides Mr. Palmer, at least two other Infosys managers have provided information to investigators about alleged visa abuses.Mr. Palmer is still on the Infosys payroll, but with no work and little communication from the company, and his moods swing erratically, he said. He has struggled with drinking, gained and lost 20 pounds and taken medication for anger and depression.“You’re around people every day, and then all of a sudden you are staring at four walls,” Mr. Palmer wrote in an e-mail. “No one will hire me and I can’t quit, so they just torture me. I have become numb and cumbersome to this world.”Menacing calls to his home and his mother’s nearby prompted him to buy a handgun, which he straps to his ankle whenever he goes out. Always on edge, he drew the gun in February on a salesman who tried to approach his house to offer cleaning goods.His lawyer, Kenneth J. Mendelsohn of Montgomery, has been both counsel and counselor, taking Mr. Palmer to baseball games and often speaking with him several times a day to keep his spirits from plunging.Mr. Palmer said his troubles started soon after he filed his first report through an internal whistle-blower channel designated by Jeffrey Friedel, a senior Infosys lawyer. The company had asked Mr. Palmer to write “welcome letters” for B-1 visa workers from India. He refused.“Basically, these letters falsely claim the foreign employee is coming to visit rather than to work,” Mr. Palmer said. “Past events started to click in my mind.” Indian employees he had placed as full-time programmers on projects he managed told him they were struggling to survive in the United States on Indian wages. “The B-1 workers were fully employed in this country, and Infosys was charging its customers full-time wages,” he said.Within days of his report, Mr. Palmer said, it leaked within the company. One manager threatened to fire him, he said, and he received angry calls from co-workers. In November 2010, according to court documents, he found a death threat, neatly printed, on the chair in his office.At first undaunted, Mr. Palmer sent barrages of e-mails describing apparent visa violations. But in December, he said, he received only about $3,000 of a $45,000 bonus he believed he had earned. Since Infosys has assigned him no work at all since last April, he received no bonus for 2011, losing one-third of his income.A problem for Mr. Palmer is that the rules governing B-1 visas are so complex that skilled immigration lawyers can disagree on them. Infosys has argued that its practices were legal under a provision that sometimes allows foreign employees to come on B-1 instead of H-1B visas.Mr. Bockius, the Infosys spokesman, denied any harassment of Mr. Palmer: “We have not retaliated in any way.”But the judge in Alabama gave the first round of the whistle-blower lawsuit to Mr. Palmer, denying Infosys’s effort to force the matter into binding arbitration.Mr. Palmer said his friends at Infosys now shun him. “You start to feel like you are the one who has done everything wrong,” he said. He continues to receive explicit death threats.“It is people like you that make us Indians angry,” said one he received by e-mail. “Why must you drag us down into poverty. You fat lazy greddy American.”But Mr. Palmer said: “My only worry is that Infosys will be slapped on the wrist and will continue to thwart our laws. As much as I need my life back, I will not let this happen.”'"
"'12-04-13,'0','President Obama has signed many executive orders when Republicans in Congress persisted in blocking sound legislation. Yet he has inexcusably refused to issue an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation or gender identity.Such an order, which would have applied to gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people working for or seeking jobs with employers with federal contracts, had support from the Labor and Justice Departments, gay rights activists say. It should have been an easy call for Mr. Obama, who supports long-stalled legislation that would prohibit this type of discrimination by all employers.Many federal contractors already have antidiscrimination policies. With Congress gridlocked over the issue, Mr. Obama had the chance to immediately extend protections against anti-gay employment bias to the rest of the employees of federal contractors without imposing a significant new burden on business. Yet the White House said no such executive order “will be issued at this time.”It is unclear why Mr. Obama declined to do the right thing here. He has taken actions against discrimination, like repealing the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy against openly gay service members. And he has voiced opposition to proposed state constitutional amendments in North Carolina and Minnesota to bar same-sex marriage. His hesitation to ban gay bias by government contractors, like his continued failure to actually endorse the freedom to marry, feels like a cynical hedge. It’s hard to see the political sense in it, and it is certainly unhelpful to the cause of full gay equality under the law.'"
"'12-04-13,'0','Some, like Daniel LeFranc, whose play “The Troublemaker, or The Freakin’ Kick-A Adventures of Bradley Boatright” is slated for the stage this fall, will be working alongside already commissioned works alongside artists with projects in earlier stages of development. More than 200 proposals vied for spots in the program. And a group of 20 writers, including Danny Hoch and Lynn Nottage, will be on hand for a four-day intensive residency. “We’re envisioning the Ground Floor as the umbrella for all of our new work activity,” said Ms. Oldham. “The Summer Lab is the sexy, big cornerstone, but year round, there will still be workshops happening.”For audiences, who enjoy 9 to 10 plays every season on Berkeley Repertory’s two downtown stages, the change will not be radical. The company has built a national reputation by helping develop work like “Passing Strange” and “American Idiot” as well as presenting marquee performers like Mikhail Baryshnikov. He will appear in a play, “In Paris,” starting April 25.But for the artists who work with the company, the Ground Floor represents a sea change. Instead of Berkeley Rep staff members traveling to work with artists on commissioned works, Berkeley will become a self-contained hub of activity with housing, rehearsal spaces, even costuming on site. There will be more opportunities for both the staff and the public to see plays in progress, and Ms. Oldham plans to overhaul the new works program’s Web presence.“We didn’t like that so much of our development work has been happening other places,” Ms. Oldham said.Berkeley Rep certainly is not the only local organization throwing around tech-infused terms. San Francisco’s Intersection for the Arts now operates out of the Hub, a technology and art space in downtown San Francisco, and has loudly championed its work with entrepreneurs of all stripes. But Berkeley Rep’s new project is unusually large.“We haven’t been able to approach it that expansively before, to think of it as an incubator for risk-taking,” Ms. Oldham said.For many playwrights, the chance to collaborate with artists in the Berkeley Rep complex was extremely enticing.“You don’t always get the opportunity to have workshops on something that is not necessarily a commissioned project,” said Heidi Stillman, a Chicago playwright and artistic director of new work at the Lookingglass Theater Company. She arrives in July to work on a piece inspired by Marguerite Duras.“It’s exciting to see what happens with the cross-pollination, being there with the other artists,” Ms. Stillman said, adding that while other summer programs, like Sundance Institute’s theater lab, exist, Berkeley Rep is refreshingly “artist-focused.”Many details about the Ground Floor are yet to be worked out, particularly how technology will mix with Berkeley Rep. Ms. Oldham said she wanted to find new ways of using technology to represent the work they do and introduce audiences to new playwrights. That will mean using social media not just as a marketing device but as a way to communicate about how Berkeley does what it does so well — produce experimental new theater. But both Ms. Oldham and Ms. Pressman were surprised by many of the ideas they had seen so far by other theater companies — for instance, creating a section for people who want to send Twitter messages during a performance or just start filming performances for online audiences.“My goal for myself is to make the Web content as creative as the work that we do onstage,” Ms. Oldham said. “A lot of people put a camera on an artist and they just talk at it, and it’s not actually very interesting. I’m hopeful that we can create something that is reflective of what these people are doing.”'"
"'12-04-13,'0','The Bloomberg administration failed to warn homeowners about major changes in the way the city assessed the value of co-ops and condominiums, contributing to outrage over a sharp, unexpected spike in some people’s property taxes last year, according to a pair of audits released on Thursday by Comptroller John C. Liu.Mr. Liu also concluded that the agency in charge of those assessments, the Finance Department, had relied too much on a flawed new computer system that, in some cases, compared a building’s market value to the value of disparate properties, like a parking garage or a building on the other side of a borough.The audit findings added to a controversy that was especially pointed in Queens last year, when homeowners learned that the assessed values of their units had risen by as much as 147 percent, leading to an increase in their property taxes.At first, the Finance Department defended its figures, arguing that co-ops in Queens had been undervalued in past years. Later, however, the department acknowledged a problem, citing a computer error and saying that the wrong data had been given to assessors for use in calculating property values.“While real estate taxes are an important source of revenue for the city, homeowners should not have to endure the stress from wild swings in their property taxes year to year,” said Mr. Liu, who is to hold a press conference on Friday to discuss the audits.'"
"'12-04-13,'0','Google earns nearly all its money from advertising. As computing shifts from desktops to mobile devices, there are concerns that this revenue stream will become less lucrative. Cost-per-click fell in the fourth quarter, too, worrying analysts that this was becoming a trend.No worries, the executives said. The drops in cost-per-click “don’t reflect the fundamental health of our business,” said Patrick Pichette, the chief financial officer.Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners, was not convinced. “No matter what they say, advertisers are valuing Google’s inventory less,” he said.Google did not set a date for its new stock structure, which is technically a stock dividend. The new shares will trade alongside the current shares on the Nasdaq exchange, identical except for their lack of voting rights. While a purpose of the new shares will be to make acquisitions, Mr. Page said that did not mean any deals were being planned at this time.None of the executives on the call directly addressed the concerns about privacy that generated so much attention over the last three months. The company has said it would construct a unified user profile as they watched YouTube, wrote e-mail and searched for diversion or information. Google called it “a simpler, more intuitive Google experience.”Some users called it invasive and complained noisily. An archrival, Microsoft, ran mocking ads. Politicians took notice. A former Google employee, James Whittaker, now working for Microsoft, wrote on a Microsoft blog that the company had lost its soul.Senator Al Franken, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on privacy, technology and the law, gave a speech to the American Bar Association’s antitrust section that could not have thrilled company executives. Referring specifically to Google and Facebook, Mr. Franken wondered, “Shouldn’t we be concerned that, as these companies that trade in your personal information keep getting bigger and bigger, they become less and less accountable?”Many people who follow the privacy issue closely said the reaction to Google’s approach to data collection was overblown and misunderstood. But that was partly the company’s fault. “They can’t go back and look at this and say, ‘That was a great roll out.’ It was a nightmare,” said Danny Sullivan, who writes the Search Engine Land blog.But Mr. Page seemed to reflect an awareness of that sentiment when he posted an open letter on the Google site that said, “We have always wanted Google to be a company that is deserving of great love.”To earn that love, at least from investors, Mr. Page will have to surmount several challenges in the next year. Foremost is doing a better job of anticipating privacy issues while improving the experience for advertisers.Then there is Google’s need to swallow its $12.5 billion acquisition of the handset maker Motorola Mobility. The deal was met with puzzlement from analysts, who said marrying a troubled phone manufacturer with a tech company that creates software used by many phone makers was fraught with problems.Finally, an intangible: Google, almost from its birth in the dot-com bubble, defined cool. As Google enters middle age, it needs to show it can remain appealing as younger companies vie for the same engineering talent. (The new shares can be used to entice them.) Google drew favorable attention for its enhanced-reality glasses, still in the prototype stage. It needs to maintain the image of an energetic company.Mr. Page seemed to acknowledge as much on Thursday. “Google is a large company now,” he said. “We will achieve more and do it faster if we approach life with the passion and the soul of a start-up.”'"
"'12-04-13,'0','SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — In a case that affects thousands of businesses and millions of workers, the California Supreme Court ruled Thursday that employers are under no obligation to ensure that workers take legally mandated lunch and rest breaks.The unanimous opinion came after workers’ attorneys argued that abuses are routine and widespread when companies are not required to issue direct orders to take the breaks. They claimed employers take advantage of workers who do not want to leave colleagues during busy times.The case was filed nine years ago against Brinker International, the parent company of Chili’s and other restaurants, by workers complaining of missed breaks in violation of California labor law.But the Supreme Court sided with businesses when it ruled that requiring companies to order breaks is unmanageable and those decisions should be left to workers.The opinion, written by Associate Justice Kathryn Werdegar explained that state law does not compel an employer to ensure employees cease all work during meal periods; instead, it says that the employee is at liberty to use the time as he or she chooses.“The employer is not obligated to police meal breaks and ensure no work thereafter is performed,” Justice Werdegar wrote.'"
"'12-04-13,'0','But with copper prices now about $8,100 a ton, and because of rising demand from China and other emerging markets, another foreign company, Emed Mining, is looking to reopen the mine and return it to production next year.Emed, whose stock is listed in London and Toronto, projects tens of millions of euros in new tax revenue a year to Spanish and regional governments, once production ramps up.Spanish environmentalists, though, fear that the economic imperatives will trump safety concerns. They are demanding further testing of Riotinto’s water reservoirs and other facilities that were abandoned more than a decade ago.“We’re very worried about whether some of the infrastructure could still withstand the company’s production plans,” said Antonio Ramos, a representative of Ecologists in Action, an environmental group. “If a reservoir wall was to break, it would cause a real tragedy.”Many local residents seem more concerned about the prospect of jobs at a time when unemployment in the area around the mine has soared to 50 percent — more than double that of Spain as a whole and five times the European Union average. Residents have protested at the site, demanding that the government issue the permits necessary to let the mine reopen.Emed completed financing for the $250 million project in February with the backing of investors that include a Chinese copper smelting company and Goldman Sachs. But besides a lack of permits from the regional government, the company has also been frustrated in its efforts to buy adjacent land that includes some of the water dams and most of the waste dumps that would be used by the mine. The owners have rejected Emed’s bids as too low.More than a century ago, when Riotinto’s mining activity was at its peak, about 20,000 workers were employed there. The 19th-century British presence is still on display in the Bellavista neighborhood, where the mine’s owners built homes and a clubhouse for managers and engineers, and introduced Spain to sports like tennis and golf.Emed plans to start operations with 350 workers, raising that to 450 once its mine reaches full production capacity. Ms. Caballero estimated that the mining operation would create 1,200 jobs, including outside suppliers.The company is also planning to reuse the copper-processing plant and much of the infrastructure that was left behind when the mine closed. That would save about $500 million required to start a mine from scratch, said William Enrico, Emed’s managing director in Spain.“It’s ironic how such a project makes complete sense today when, only a decade ago, people around here concluded that mining was a thing of the past and abandoned some perfectly adequate equipment,” he said.Harry Anagnostaras-Adams, an Australian who is Emed’s chief executive, said he still hoped the regional government would approve the project before autumn. Customers — led by the Chinese smelter Yanggu Xiangguang Copper, one of the project’s backers — have already signed up to receive 40 percent of the mine’s projected production over its first five years.Based on the Riotinto mine’s estimated copper reserves and assuming an average price of $5,500 a ton, Emed expects to produce 36,000 tons of copper a year, equivalent to average annual revenue of 155 million euros, or $204 million, and break even in the first year of operations.Meanwhile, the Spanish national and regional authorities stand to collect 217 million euros ($288 million) in taxes over the first decade of mining activity, Emed said. By comparison, Andalusia had 31.7 billion euros ($42 billion) in revenue last year.“The world is desperately short of copper, and this project could have gone ahead much earlier if we had not run into so much red tape,” Mr. Anagnostaras-Adams said.María José Asensio Coto, an official from the Department of Economics, Innovation and Science of the Andalusian regional government, denied any foot-dragging on the part of the authorities. She said Emed had delayed complying with some of the conditions that had to be met before the project could be approved, particularly requirements for protecting the environment, and had presented a complete dossier for approval only last month.“Any reopening of a mine is a very complex procedure,” she said.With copper prices rising, the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula is again becoming “an ideal location” for mining, said José Antonio Grande Gil, director of the center for sustainable mining at Huelva University in Spain. While not wanting to discuss the specifics of Emed’s project, he said that “Spain has historically been very open to foreign investment in mining, and I don’t believe that has changed. But any investment nowadays fortunately has to respect much stricter norms than when the English first started digging here without even considering the environmental damage.”But for local residents like Juan Carlos Valle, 36, reopening the mine is “my only hope of finding work again.”Mr. Valle’s recent history has become a familiar one in Spain. He was employed by the mine until it closed in 2001, then switched to work in construction, which was booming at the time. But when the global financial crisis hit in 2008, the Spanish construction industry collapsed. Mr. Valle became unemployed again in 2010.Since mid-March, Mr. Valle has been among a dozen unemployed local people who have been staging a protest at the mine, sleeping in tents in one of its parking lots, hoping to pressure the government to grant Emed an operating permit. Four of Emed’s Spanish workers have staged a lock-in, setting up a makeshift encampment within the mine itself.“It’s unbelievable,” Mr. Valle said, “that some of our politicians can delay things and ignore how absolutely unsustainable the situation here has become.”'"
"'12-04-13,'0','In September, Mr. Lewis said that he had held discussions with American lawyers about the steps necessary to open proceedings against News Corporation in New York, and that he expected the process to begin soon. In an interview at the time, Mr. Lewis said that the legal action in the United States would focus on the “News Corporation’s liability for actions by its foreign subsidiaries,” including The News of the World.He said the lawsuits would focus on the revelations of widespread phone hacking in Britain and on accusations that the police were bribed to assist in the tabloid’s pursuit of scoops.Mr. Lewis’s clients in the hacking scandal include the family of Milly Dowler, an abducted teenager who was found murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002, and whose voice mail was said to have been hacked after she disappeared. Public outrage at the case helped propel the hacking scandal to new heights in July, leading to the closure of The News of the World.Reports last year said News International had offered a package of compensation worth some $4.8 million in that case, made up of $3.2 million to the Dowler family, with an additional payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity.News International has so far paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in other compensation settlements to dozens of hacking victims. But, the BBC said, more than 4,000 people have been identified by the police as possible victims of phone hacking.Accusations of illicit interception of voice mails are at the center of overlapping police, parliamentary and judicial inquiries, which are also investigating the payment of bribes to public officials at two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World.The scandal spread further earlier this month when a British satellite news broadcaster, Sky News, whose parent company is partly owned by News Corporation admitted that one of its reporters had hacked into e-mails on two occasions while pursuing news coverage, the first time that such accusations had spilled into television news.The acknowledgment came just two days after Mr. Murdoch’s son James resigned as chairman of Sky’s parent company, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, of which News Corporation owns around 39 percent. Company officials said there was no link between the resignation and the hacking revelations, which were made public only as a result of an inquiry by the newspaper The Guardian.“We stand by these actions as editorially justified and in the public interest,” the head of Sky News, John Ryley, said in a statement at the time. “We do not take such decisions lightly or frequently.”'"

News of the accusations was first reported by The Washington Post.In a statement, a Secret Service spokesman, Edwin M. Donovan, acknowledged that agents had been recalled because of accusations of misconduct and that they would be replaced by other Secret Service personnel, but he did not address the issue of prostitution.“The Secret Service takes all allegations of misconduct seriously,” he said, adding that the matter had been turned over to the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility.Prostitution is legal in designated areas of Colombia.President Obama’s security detail has been involved in other incidents in recent months.A federal agent with the State Department’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security was charged with second-degree murder last November after shooting a man in Honolulu, according to news reports at the time. The agent was off duty, but was on the island to provide advance security arrangements for Mr. Obama’s visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.'"
"'12-04-14,'0','Dora Saint, whose novels about the gentle rhythms of English village life, written under the crisp, pedagogical pseudonym Miss Read, drew a wide following on both sides of the Atlantic, died on April 7 at her home in Shefford Woodlands, in Berkshire, England. She was 98.Her death was confirmed by Jill Saint, her daughter and only immediate survivor.In more than 30 books published from the mid-1950s to the mid-1990s, Mrs. Saint chronicled the goings-on in two fictional villages, Fairacre and Thrush Green. The Fairacre series, comprising about 20 titles, began in 1955 with “Village School.” Written in the first person, the series was originally marketed as the memoirs of a “Miss Read,” a rural schoolteacher, as Mrs. Saint had been in life.Mrs. Saint’s second series, which she undertook to give herself a reprieve from the rigors of first-person narrative, opened with “Thrush Green,” published in 1959. Miss Read is the nominal author of these books, too, though she does not appear as a character. Several titles in each series remain in print in paperback.Both series, which have been likened to the work of Jane Austen, Thomas Hardy and Barbara Pym, center on the ebb and flow of rural life: schooldays and festivals; tea parties and flower shows; thatched cottages, herbaceous borders and evocative descriptions of creatures human and non-. (In the second Fairacre book, “Village Diary,” from 1957, Mrs. Saint writes of “a wood-pigeon, as soft and opal as a London twilight.”)The novels are peopled by characters emblematic of English pastoral life: nosy Mrs. Pringle, the school cleaner; Mrs. Curdle, who runs a traveling fair; and, of course, the vicar.There is ample humor, little real menace, no sex and not a jot of intemperate language.With their evocations of peaceable communities that seemed to defy the press of modernity, the books were balm to postwar readers. Reviewing “Village School” in The New York Times Book Review in 1956, Mary Ellen Chase, a novelist and Hardy scholar, wrote:“It is difficult to convey the charm and grace of this book. Seemingly slight in subject matter and disarmingly simple in its manner of writing, it yet lingers in one’s mind as something true, rare and lovely.”'"
"'12-04-14,'0','“We were wondering and hoping, and he relieved all doubt,” Valentine said of Beckett. “Threw great curveballs. Had terrific control. Threw all his fastballs over 90 miles an hour. That’s the performance we were looking for. Home opener and everything else combined, that was a terrific outing.”The only downer for the home team was a right-shoulder injury to their All-Star center fielder Jacoby Ellsbury. He had to leave the game in the fourth inning after Rays shortstop Reid Brignac fell on the shoulder during a double play. Ellsbury was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Red Sox said he would undergo further evaluation.While Beckett had been hammered in Detroit, history suggested he would be the polar opposite on Friday. And he was. Beckett has been nearly invincible in home openers since he came to the Red Sox in 2006, compiling a 4-0 record with a 2.41 earned run average in five home-opening starts. In those five starts, the Red Sox have scored 45 runs.Beckett allowed three hits to the first six Tampa Bay hitters, giving the Rays a 1-0 lead in the second inning. Tampa Bay had a runner on third with only one out. But Beckett got out of the inning without further damage and allowed only two more hits, both two-out singles, over the next six innings.He threw 94 pitches, the 90th being a curve ball to Carlos Pena, which led to his only strikeout of the game. That extended Beckett’s strikeout string to 281 games (since Sept. 4, 2001) — the longest active streak in the majors and the second longest to begin a career. Dwight Gooden had a strikeout streak of 349 games from 1984 to 1997.Beckett has also owned the Rays over the last two-plus seasons; he is 4-0 with a 0.84 earned run average against Tampa Bay in his last six starts dating to Sept. 12, 2009.But none of that mattered on a sun-splashed afternoon at Fenway Park, a week before the ballpark’s official centennial celebration. The last time the Red Sox played here, Sept. 21, 2011, Beckett was the losing pitcher and the team was booed off the field. Now, seven months later, the Red Sox were reeling, Beckett had a 13.50 earned run average after his Detroit outing and the Rays had their ace, David Price, on the mound.“It’s kinda tough,” Beckett said of the atmosphere as well as the expectations. “You haven’t been home in six weeks. Going to Detroit, obviously, the fans and that team are very, very excited with what they’ve done in the off-season. Those guys were extra locked in. It’s tough to start in a place like that.”The Rays can relate. They are 2-10 in visiting home openers, and they could do nothing against Beckett. The Red Sox, meanwhile, got production from everyone, with ex-Rays catcher Kelly Shoppach reaching base four times, driving in two runs and collecting his first stolen base in 464 career games. Adrian Gonzalez had 3 of the team’s 16 hits and Kevin Youklis, who came into the game with 2 hits in 20 at-bats, matched that hit total in 4 at-bats.'"
"'12-04-14,'0','The coup in Guinea-Bissau comes shortly after junior officers seized power in Mali last month, also right before presidential elections were scheduled to take place. But unlike Mali, a longstanding exemplar of democracy in the region, Guinea-Bissau, in its recurrent upheavals, has consistently been at the extreme edge of instability among its neighbors.In Guinea-Bissau, the interludes of democracy have been more fleeting than elsewhere, and seemingly built on shakier bases. Coups and coup attempts are so common that experts are stumped when asked how many have taken place in the country’s 38 years of independence. In the last three years alone, there have been at least six political assassinations, including of the president and the army chief of staff in 2009, and three attempted coups, including this week’s. No president has ever completed a full term.Regional African organizations strongly denounced the coup on Friday, with the African Union saying it served to “tarnish the image” of Africa. In Guinea-Bissau, the military is both the country’s most intractable problem and, because of its role in ousting the Portuguese in a fierce guerrilla campaign 40 years ago, the holder of a popular legitimacy that is not found among its counterparts elsewhere in the region or in Bissau’s own weak institutions. Politicians who did not take part in the independence fight, like Mr. Gomes, are held in suspicion and contempt by the military.On Friday, a self-proclaimed “military command” announced on the radio that it had deposed the prime minister because of what it said was a “secret” agreement between him and military forces from Angola aimed at suppressing Guinea-Bissau’s army. It offered no evidence of the agreement, and diplomats and analysts said it seemed likely that the army was simply trying to eliminate Mr. Gomes before his probable victory in the second round of the presidential election. The vote was intended to replace President Malam Bacai Sanhá, who died in January.As many as 200 Angolan troops have been present in the country since March 2011, the latest attempt in what other nations have called the “reform” of the Guinea-Bissau military, after an unsuccessful initiative by the European Union. Mr. Gomes has backed these plans — principally attempts to downsize the armed forces — which have been resisted by the military. In the past, former senior members of the military have been implicated, by the United States and others, in drug trafficking. The speckle of islands off the coast are ideal for the undisturbed landing of small planes carrying drugs.As Western aid donors, frustrated with the lack of progress in the country, have taken a back seat, Angola — with its ambition to become a major foreign-policy player on the African continent — has stepped in, canceling Guinea-Bissau’s $39 million debt to the country.During a December coup attempt, Mr. Gomes took refuge in the Angolan Embassy in Bissau, and Angolan-trained police officers took the lead in protecting him. The head of the Bissau military, Gen. Antonío Indjai, recently accused the Angolan military of arming itself with ever-heavier weapons. Late Friday, coup leaders said in a statement that General Indjai had also been removed.“We knew there was a malaise between the military and the Angolans,” said Henrique Pereira Rosa, a former president and unsuccessful candidate in the first round of voting last month. “We knew there would be problems.”The Angolans had also recently announced their departure, suggesting that the real objective of the apparent coup attempt was not them, but Mr. Gomes, who seemed set to take up the country’s top position, the presidency. “In a certain sense, it was now or never” to depose Mr. Gomes, said Vincent Foucher, a Bissau expert at the International Crisis Group in Dakar.The opposition had called for a boycott of the second round of elections, alleging fraud, a position most lately advanced by the second-place finisher, Kumba Yala, at a news conference on Thursday. Not long after, the soldiers moved in, taking over state radio and the governing party’s headquarters.By Friday afternoon, citizens had resigned themselves to a situation that has become all too familiar: soldiers patrolling the streets of Bissau. “There is nobody out, nobody,” said a longtime diplomat in the capital. “It’s so quiet, it’s unbelievable. It’s a very uneasy silence.”Mr. Rosa, the former president, said he was staying home until the situation became clearer. “We are waiting for the communiqués,” he said. “We are waiting.”'"

"'12-04-14,'0','Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian human rights lawyer and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, has no affinity for the authorities in Iran, who she fears would have her arrested or worse if she returned home. But she has found herself standing with them in opposition to the onerous nuclear sanctions imposed on her country.As representatives of Iran and six world powers prepared to resume negotiations on Iran’s uranium enrichment activities this weekend in Istanbul, Ms. Ebadi said that the sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union were misdirected.Although meant to pressure the Iranian government to compromise on its nuclear program, “the very stringent sanctions have really been a tremendous blow to people,” Ms. Ebadi said in a telephone interview. “The people need these sanctions to be removed for a sustainable life.”The sanctions have contributed to acute shortages of foreign goods there, rising inflation and unemployment and a sharply devalued currency. Further deprivations loom, especially if a European Union ban on Iranian oil sales goes ahead as planned in less than three months.In response to the sanctions, Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has been defiant, asserting that Iran will never stop enriching uranium in response to foreign demands. At the same time, he insists that Iran will never use its uranium stockpile to develop nuclear weapons, despite Western suspicions to the contrary. As for the economic pain in Iran caused by the sanctions, the ayatollah has said Iranians should take it as an opportunity to become more self-reliant and wean themselves off foreign goods.Ms. Ebadi, 64, who was attending a conference in Minneapolis on Thursday and Friday, asserted that the Iranian government was not correct in saying that its nuclear energy program was popular among Iranians. While Iranians across the political spectrum say Iran has the legal right to develop nuclear energy, Ms. Ebadi said, many people are privately worried about the environmental risks of nuclear reactors, particularly in Iran’s earthquake zones. She said there was no public discussion about this issue because the government had banned newspapers from reporting anything but the official position in recent years.'"
"'12-04-14,'0','The N.B.A. resolved one franchise headache Friday when it announced the sale of the New Orleans Hornets, a ward of the league since 2010, to Tom Benson, the owner of the Saints, for $338 million.But the league also faced the collapse of a tentative deal to build an arena for the Sacramento Kings, and the very real possibility that the franchise would move, as has been threatened before.“I think that there’s nothing further to be done,” N.B.A. Commissioner David Stern said during a news conference in Manhattan after a meeting of the league’s board of governors. “I think we have done as much as we can do.”Now, Stern said, he can ensure that the Kings will play in Sacramento only through 2014.The tentative deal between the city and the Maloof family, which owns the Kings, was reached in February in Orlando, Fla. George Maloof said in a telephone interview that his family had agreed to the financial terms of a new arena but that numerous issues had not been resolved.“We had a basic financial framework, but from the moment we received the term sheet on Feb. 19, we had questions,” he said. Those concerns included the length of the lease, approval of the proposed arena’s design, game-day expenses at the new facility and naming rights.'"
"'12-04-14,'0','“In his first term,” Mr. Romney said, “we’ve seen the president try to browbeat the Supreme Court. In a second term, he would remake it. Our freedoms would be in the hands of an Obama court, not just for four years, but for the next 40. That must not happen.”Before his speech, an N.R.A. spokesman said that was exactly the kind of statement the group was looking for.The spokesman, Andrew Arulanandam, said the N.R.A. feared that an altered Supreme Court could reverse a pair of landmark 5-to-4 decisions that affirmed an individual’s right to bear arms and narrowed the ability of states and cities to enact gun control laws.But the issue may be something of a red herring since there is no indication that even the oldest conservative and swing-vote justices are suffering health problems that could result in retirement.Mr. Obama has hardly been an enemy of gun rights. He signed legislation allowing visitors to national parks to carry concealed guns, and his overall record has so disappointed the gun control lobby that the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave him an “F” grade in 2010.Another goal for Mr. Romney here was to close a bit of the cultural gap with gun owners. He was lampooned during his 2008 presidential campaign for exaggerating his hunting experience, explaining that he was a hunter of “small varmints,” rabbits and rodents.This year, he revealed in a debate that he had been on a hunting trip to Montana for elk.His guide on that outing, Rob Keck, is a well-known figure in hunting, and it was no coincidence that he accompanied Mr. Romney to the N.R.A. convention, where hunting and firearms exhibitions filled a large hall.Mr. Keck described in an interview taking Mr. Romney into rugged country in November 2010 for two days of hunting elk and one for shooting pheasants on a private ranch. “He admittedly didn’t grow up hunting,” Mr. Keck said, “but let me tell you, he accounted for a number of birds on that day.”It remains to be seen whether Second Amendment advocates will enthusiastically come out for Mr. Romney in November.David Ross, a longtime N.R.A. member from Reading, Pa., who has been a grass-roots organizer for conservative candidates in his battleground state, was skeptical.“I think that’s going to be heavy lifting,” said Mr. Ross, who was attending the convention with his son, Clinton, an Army reservist. “He was for an assault weapons ban when he was Massachusetts governor. What changed? And how do we know he’s not going to change back? This is the chameleonlike thinking that is my biggest fear.”Although Mr. Romney said in 2007 that he didn’t “line up with” the N.R.A. on an assault weapons ban, more recently he indicated that the national ban, which expired, did not need renewal.He has also backed away from his support, while governor, for a Brady bill requiring a five-day waiting period to buy a firearm. He has said in recent years that a waiting period is no longer needed because the Internet allows for instant background checks.Rick Santorum, who withdrew from the Republican primary race this week, also addressed the gun rights group, and he seemed to edge toward an endorsement of Mr. Romney. “I will be all-in between now and November,” he said. “I will do everything I can to elect conservatives up and down the ticket.”Mr. Romney, who was introduced by his wife, Ann, received a standing ovation after his speech, though in the cavernous downtown dome where audience members filled only the floor, not the stands, the sound was subdued.Tom Hanna, 75, a 40-year member of the gun group, said he had some concerns about Mr. Romney’s politics. But any of that doubt was gone after Mr. Romney spoke.“He showed a commitment to the Constitution that I had not seen in television blurbs from his campaign,” he said, adding, “I’m willing to take him at face value for what he said.”'"
"'12-04-14,'0','As part of the measures approved at a cabinet meeting Friday, corporate cash transactions will be limited to 2,500 euros ($3,300), with fines as high as 25 percent of the transaction’s value levied upon any transfers above the limit. Individuals and companies will also face sanctions beginning next year for failing to declare all assets held overseas.“Every day the government is taking measures and launching reforms with the conviction that this situation will change,” Cristóbal Montoro, the budget minister, said at a press briefing.The Spanish tax agency said that in its search for fraud, it had been more closely inspecting the circulation of high-denomination notes since 2007 amid concerns that the use in Spain of 500 euro notes was “much higher than expected and much higher than what should correspond to the economic size of our country.” Since its inspections began, the agency said, it has unearthed 1.39 billion euros ($1.8 billion) of cash transactions made using high-denomination euro notes.Use of 500 euro notes, worth about $657, is thought to have expanded considerably during Spain’s construction boom as a way of paying for large — and sometimes undeclared — property transactions or building materials. Spaniards came to call the 500 euro notes “bin Ladens”: everywhere and yet never seen.Some economists have estimated that Spain accounted for about a quarter of the 500 euro notes circulating in the euro zone, though the European Central Bank does not provide a breakdown of issuance by country. The central bank also warns against drawing conclusions about cash circulation in a free-trade area.Cayo Lara Moya, leader of the United Left party in Spain, argued during a parliamentary session this week that the government should push for the complete removal from the euro zone of 500 euro notes, one of the largest denominations used in Western economies.Niels Bunemann, a spokesman for the central bank, said, “It is not likely that an abolition of the 500 euro note would do anything to curb fraud or the black economy, as it would be easy for criminals to switch to the 200 euro bank notes for their activities.”Juan Carlos Martínez Lázaro, a professor at the IE Business School in Madrid who has studied the underground economy, said the government’s decision to restrict cash transactions “isn’t the magic solution but does make it harder to go ahead with a lot of undeclared transactions that now take place in cash.”“We are in the painful context of rising taxes and spending cuts,” he added, “so it’s a very favorable moment to implement any measure that can be explained to people as part of efforts to create a fairer system where all are made to contribute.”The crackdown on fraud also coincides with a controversial decision to have a partial amnesty for violators of tax laws, which the government hopes will raise 2.5 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in additional revenue.Before it came to power, Mr. Rajoy’s Popular Party had opposed the idea of such an amnesty, labeling it as unfair. But Luis de Guindos, the economy minister, defended it recently as “an exceptional measure for exceptional times.”Mr. Martínez Lázaro, the professor, said, “A lot of people are angered by this fiscal amnesty on ethical grounds, but my view is that whatever doesn’t get collected now will then have to be raised through more tax hikes or spending cuts.”'"
"'12-04-14,'0','“He kept the ball down and mixed his pitches when he needed to when he got in trouble,” Pujols said, “which was not many times. He was keeping us off balance and he threw a great game.”Kuroda set down 10 batters in a row from the end of the fifth until Bobby Abreu’s infield single leading off the ninth. It was a hit in name only. A charging Derek Jeter fielded the slow bouncer but could not get it out of his glove in time. It came on Kuroda’s 109th pitch and was enough to bring Girardi out of the dugout to summon Robertson as Kuroda walked off the field to a standing ovation from his newest fans.“It was the greatest feeling in the world,” he said through his interpreter, “and I’d like to continue it as much as I can.”Before Kuroda even had a chance to process his emotions, Robertson induced a sharp double play ball from Pujols, and then struck out Kendrys Morales to end the game.The Yankees, losers of their first three games, improved to 4-3.“Hopefully there’s a lot more of that to come,” Rodriguez said.The afternoon began with Posada, who retired after last season, lobbing the first pitch to his father, Jorge Sr. as the fans showered Posada with applause.Kuroda took the mound and allowed a ground ball single up the middle from Aybar. But he got the next three batters, and then returned to the dugout to watch his offense go to work.Angels starter Ervin Santana struck out Jeter and Granderson, but Rodriguez, batting third in the Yankees newest lineup configuration against right-handed starters, ripped a single to left. Robinson Cano, now batting fourth, walked, as did Mark Teixeira, bringing up Swisher.In his previous at-bat on Wednesday, Swisher hit a two-run homer in the 10th inning to lead the Yankees to a win in Baltimore. This time he drilled a pitch that hit the wall in right-center on a bounce. All three runners scored as Swisher pounded his hands together and gave his customary salute as the fans roared.“It was electric,” Swisher said. “I didn’t know what to do.”In the new lineup, designed by Girardi to alternate right and left-handed hitters, Rodriguez pounded a first-pitch home run to dead center in the third. In the fifth Granderson sent a ball over the right-field wall.Kuroda acknowledged feeling some nerves, but said it was reassuring to have Russell Martin, his catcher with the Los Angeles Dodgers from 2008-9, behind the plate. Kuroda proved he can pitch at Yankee Stadium. He then showed he knows how to act like a Yankee teammate, too.“That is a great lineup,” he said. “Russell knows the hitters. He did a great job and all the credit goes to him.”'"
"'12-04-14,'0','So as the consumer protection bureau enters a comment period for its plans, which are set to go into effect in January, I want to make some suggestions of my own, from personal experience but also from stories I have related in previous columns.POOR DEFINITION The Dodd-Frank financial reform law requires the consumer protection bureau to act on force-placed insurance. But the wording seems to contain a glaring loophole. It states that the mortgage servicer “shall not obtain force-placed hazard insurance unless there is a reasonable basis to believe the borrower has failed to comply with the loan contract’s requirement to maintain property insurance.”While that sounds straightforward, it may not be. In insurance parlance, “hazard” means coverage for damage to the structure caused by fire, smoke or vandalism. Coverage for flood and hurricanes is separate and is not explicitly mentioned in the law.I called the Insurance Information Institute, and a spokesman, Michael Barry, confirmed my suspicion. The typical force-placed policy covers fire and maybe wind or hail. But in many cases, wind coverage has to be purchased separately, and flood insurance is never included in a typical hazard policy.A spokeswoman for the consumer protection bureau, Jennifer Howard, said: “The force-placed insurance provisions would protect borrowers who are required by their mortgages to maintain insurance against hazards to the property, including special hazards such as wind, hurricane and flood damage.” But the bureau has also made clear that these plans are preliminary.Regardless, the somewhat vague wording could give mortgage servicers the opening to continue the frustrating practice of telling people their homes are in an area that has been reclassified as a flood zone. This happened to James W. Hart Jr., whom I spoke to last year. He had lived in the same house in Longwood, Fla., for 20 years when he received a letter in 2010 saying he needed flood insurance.“They started out the letter with buying me flood insurance,” he told me. “I said if anyone is going to be buying flood insurance, it’s me because I’m not going to buy it at your exorbitant rates.”Still, it cost him $150 for a surveyor, not to mention six weeks of calling, to prove that his home was not in a flood plain.CONSISTENCY COUNTS The consumer protection bureau proposed that the letters notifying homeowners about force-placed insurance be standardized and mailed twice, at 45 and 15 days, before any insurance is put in place.Mortgage servicers like Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup have long argued that this is exactly what they do. And this is true. They send many letters. Correspondence is not the problem; getting the insurance removed is.I checked in with James Yates, a professor of education at the University of Texas, Austin, whom I spoke with in January. Mr. Yates, who has lived in his house in Lake Travis for 21 years, has disputed the flood insurance that CitiMortgage had bought for him for the last three years. While he has paid his mortgage on time, the bank first applies the payment to the force-placed insurance and then puts what is left toward the mortgage. Because of this, Citi considers Mr. Yates delinquent on his payments, and he has had to hire a lawyer.CitiMortgage has “continued every month to send the same computer-generated, certified letter announcing that my loan ‘is in foreclosure,’ ” Mr. Yates said in an e-mail this week.To prevent similar situations, the consumer protection bureau wants letters notifying consumers about force-placed insurance to state how much that insurance will cost.MAKE PENALTIES REAL The consumer protection bureau takes a carrot-and-stick approach toward the issue of getting force-placed insurance removed in a timely manner.The bureau’s preliminary plans say that when a consumer presents proof of insurance, the mortgage servicer needs to terminate the policy and refund within 15 days any premiums that were paid.But that doesn’t deal with the issue of how servicers respond to consumers, since long delays in talking to someone to get the issue resolved are a big problem. Not only do the delays add to consumer frustration but they also increase the chances that people will give up and pay the bill.Rick Pullen, for instance, opted to pay the $1,500 annual premium for force-placed flood insurance on his seventh-floor condo in Fort Myers, Fla. Mr. Pullen said in January that the amount was enough to sting but not enough to make him go through hours of phone calls to have the charge removed.The stick is the penalties in the Dodd-Frank law. When consumers provide proof of insurance but servicers fail to refund their money, the fines start at $5,000 a day for negligence and go up to $1 million a day for what the law calls “knowing violations.”Also, the proposals do not seem to take into account the costs that borrowers must incur to prove that they have the insurance they are supposed to have. Mr. Hart is out the $150 he spent for a surveyor, and if Mr. Yates prevails in his case he will have to cover the legal costs of far more than that.ACCOUNT FOR ABSURDITY The bureau’s preliminary plans do not address the most confounding element of force-placed insurance — dealing with how arbitrary and, at times, ridiculous it is.Uyen Tieu spent two years fighting to have a force-placed flood insurance policy removed from the mortgage on the condo she owns in Manhattan with her husband. She tried to explain to her bank, Chase, that while her apartment building was in a flood plain, her condo was on the fourth floor. (Flood policies cover damage when water rises from the ground; a wind policy would cover the damage if her windows were blown in and rain filled her apartment.)When logic failed to persuade Chase, she produced the building’s flood insurance policy. But the bank did not deem the amount sufficient. After several months, she gave up and paid the $2,250 a year Chase charged her.In February, however, Chase refunded her money — after I called to ask the bank for an explanation. That call was noted in the letter the bank sent with her refund.Of course, most people do not have a journalist calling on their behalf. So they have to hope that whatever rules the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau passes will be enforced and go far enough.'"
"'12-04-14,'0','Mammoth Lakes, a town of about 8,200 residents and a budget of $17 million, has become the second municipality after Stockton to use a new state law that requires local governments to hire a third-party mediator to negotiate with creditors before declaring Chapter 9. The union-backed law made it harder for local governments to file for bankruptcy and was intended to protect public employees in cities with large work forces, like Stockton, which entered the mediation process in February.In Mammoth Lakes’s case, its problems are rooted in the 1997 deal with Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition. The town gave the developer the rights to build a hotel, residential and retail project near the local airport in exchange for making airport improvements. But the town backed out of the deal after the Federal Aviation Administration, which provided Mammoth Lakes with grants to improve the airport, objected to development nearby.The developer sued in 2006 for breach of contract and was eventually awarded a $30 million judgment. The town exhausted its legal appeals last year, and the amount has grown to $43 million.Meanwhile, in the past decade, other development projects here have met with mixed success. Many “condo-hotels,” in which a company manages a hotel with individually owned units, were left unsold or uncompleted. With growth plans unrealized, the town’s work force was cut to 70 from a peak of 130 about five years ago.Like all ski resort towns, Mammoth also remained dependent on the weather: two winters of good snowfall — the ski season lasted until the Fourth of July last year — were followed by scant snow this winter.Town officials declined to discuss details of the lawsuit. But residents blamed past officials and legal advisers, saying they failed to properly negotiate in 1997 in the first place.John Walter, a leader of Advocates for Mammoth, a private organization focusing on planning, said the town did not “read the fine print” in signing a deal with the developer and mistakenly believed it was insured against the kind of problems that arose with the airport.“A lot of people are bitter,” Mr. Walter said.John Lemay, a Los Angeles resident who has owned a home here for 10 years, said, “It sounds like they didn’t cross their t’s and dot their i’s. They made a stupid mistake that’s now become a tragic mistake.”“Someone is taking advantage of them who has the right to take advantage of them,” Mr. Lemay said of the developer. “It may be seen as greedy, but it’s turned into an incredible windfall for the developer.”Most residents believe that given the fate of other projects here in the past decade, Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition could end up making more money through this lawsuit than if it had been able to go through with the original project.In a March 23 letter to the town from the developer’s lawyers, the company declined to negotiate as part of the new mediation procedure.Mark Rosenthal, a manager at Mammoth Lakes Land Acquisition, said the company believed that the town had no alternative to filing for bankruptcy. “We just think that mediation will delay the inevitable,” he said in an interview.The letter also reiterated the developer’s last offer to the town: an initial payment of $2 million, followed by annual payments of $2 million over 30 years. The developer, which released the letter to the local news media, said it was making it public to “open the process to all the constituents in the town.”Matthew Lehman, a councilman, said that all negotiations had been behind closed doors until the letter’s publication. “My guess is they’re trying to use the press as a tool to create animosity and frustration within the community,” he said.Mr. Rosenthal denied the accusation, saying that the letter did not violate any confidentiality agreement.With the apparent deadlock in the mediation, residents are bracing themselves for cutbacks in services.“I have a couple of young kids, and I’m worried about the schools,” said Dave Leonard, 44, the owner of a bookstore, the Booky Joint.Dave Wilbrecht, the town manager, said big projects would most likely be delayed, including improvements to a new ice rink.“The town would love to put a roof on that ice rink, and I think it will take some time before I think we can afford those kinds of things,” he said, adding that the town would try to avoid cuts to tourism-related services.Still, a possible bankruptcy worried longtime visitors, including Alex Sexton, 20, who has been coming here from San Diego since he was 5 years old.“It’s sad to hear it may go bankrupt,” he said in the middle of a break from skiing. “My dad’s had a time share here for 30 years, and one day I was hoping to inherit it.”'"
"'12-04-14,'0','Investigators are also examining the payment of bribes to public officials at two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World.Hacking into people’s e-mails is a potentially more serious crime than listening to their voice mail messages, and last summer the police opened Operation Tuleta, an investigation into computer hacking that is being held in tandem with one on phone hacking (Operation Weeting) and another on bribing the police (Operation Elveden).The scandal may be poised to go beyond Britain.On Thursday, Mr. Lewis, the lawyer, said that he planned for the first time to sue on behalf of alleged victims in the United States, the center of Mr. Murdoch’s global media empire.In a telephone interview, he said that he would take legal action on behalf of three people — a well-known sports person, a sports person not in the public eye and an American citizen, none of whom he would further identify.“The News of the World had thousands of people they hacked,” Mr. Lewis said, when announcing the suits in an interview with the BBC, referring to the Sunday tabloid that Mr. Murdoch closed down last year as the hacking scandal engulfed it. “Some of them were in America at the time, either traveling or resident there.”It was not immediately clear how or whether the action would affect the News Corporation. News International declined immediate comment on the cases.Mr. Lewis’s clients in the hacking scandal include the family of Milly Dowler, an abducted teenager who was found murdered in an outer London suburb in 2002, and whose voice mail was said to have been hacked after she disappeared. Public outrage at the case helped propel the hacking scandal to new heights in July, leading to the closure of The News of the World.Reports last year said News International had offered a package of compensation worth some $4.8 million in that case, made up of $3.2 million to the Dowler family, with an additional payment of about $1.6 million to go to charity.News International has so far paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars in other compensation settlements to dozens of hacking victims. But, the BBC said, more than 4,000 people have been identified by the police as possible victims of phone hacking.The scandal spread further earlier this month when a British satellite news broadcaster, Sky News, whose parent company is partly owned by News Corporation admitted that one of its reporters had hacked into e-mails on two occasions while pursuing news coverage, the first time that such accusations had spilled into television news.The acknowledgment came just two days after Mr. Murdoch’s son James resigned as chairman of Sky’s parent company, British Sky Broadcasting, or BSkyB, of which News Corporation owns around 39 percent. Company officials said there was no link between the resignation and the hacking revelations, which were made public only as a result of an inquiry by the newspaper The Guardian.'"

"'12-04-15,'0','The four interrelated tales of “Oki’s Movie,” Hong Sang-soo’s beguiling new film, are preceded by “Pomp and Circumstance,” played over handwritten credits. Elgar’s stately march becomes an ironic refrain to the misadventures and regrets of the three recurring characters, two men and a woman, who navigate different stages in their lives at a film school. The unsubtle musical theme is also a sharp contrast to Mr. Hong’s casually brilliant feat of storytelling, akin to an ingeniously wrought suite of literary short fiction.The cycle, both comedic and poignant, begins with Jingu (Lee Sun-kyun), a disgruntled film teacher in his 30s, as he bickers with his wife over social plans. Jingu belongs to the hapless brotherhood that Mr. Hong has assembled and refined over a 12-movie oeuvre that includes “Woman Is the Future of Man”: young souls blundering through romantic and professional exchanges, not yet really where they want to be, and, through a mix of cluelessness, libido and misapplied principles, staying there.These guys often bear artistic aspirations and their hearts on their sleeves but range across a spectrum of likability. The scarf-wrapped Jingu — who browbeats a student (“Your sincerity needs a form”) and proclaims unbidden to a cute photographer in a park that he is a filmmaker — at first comes across as comically pompous and a little pathetic. But when he drunkenly embarrasses a professor at an outing with colleagues, and at a screening of his own movie is grilled over past personal indiscretions, it’s hard not to feel a little for his face plants.So fizzles the tale of Jingu the teacher, but what Mr. Hong does with the subsequent segments reconfirms him as one of contemporary cinema’s freshest innovators in narrative form, restlessly (and meaningfully) exploring point of view and how life does and doesn’t add up.That means not just switching vantages among characters but also within individual experience. The next portion of “Oki’s Movie” unceremoniously clicks back to Jingu as a film student (Mr. Lee again). Not yet overcompensating for career disappointments, Jingu spends his free time relentlessly pursuing a schoolmate, Oki (Jung Yu-mi), and plays down an echo chamber of rumors about a filmmaking prize that he might receive as the favored student of the respected Professor Song.'"

Mr. Crecelius said some residents took refuge in City Hall, which was the only building in town that still had power.In southeast Nebraska, barns were destroyed and trees uprooted in what appeared to be a tornado on Saturday afternoon.“I’m on a two-mile stretch that this thing is on the ground, and I haven’t even gotten to the end of it yet,” Clint Strayhorn, the emergency director in Johnson County, Neb., said as he walked a path of destruction. He said he had no reports that anyone was injured.In Boone County, in northeast Nebraska, the sheriff, David Spiegel, said baseball-sized hail damaged vehicles, shattered windows and tore siding from houses in and around Petersburg, about 140 miles north of Omaha.Two possible tornadoes were reported father south in Nebraska near the Kansas border, and as many as 10 others were reported in largely rural parts of western and central Kansas, including one north of Dodge City that was said to be on the ground for half an hour, officials said.In central Oklahoma, what was believed to be a tornado hit near the small town of Piedmont, following the path of a tornado that killed several people last May, Mayor Valerie Thomerson said.Strong storms in Iowa knocked out power in Des Moines, Council Bluffs and Sioux City, and high winds knocked over at least five tractor-trailers on Interstate 29.In Creston, Iowa, officials confirmed that a hospital, the Greater Regional Medical Center, was damaged in a storm. Mayor Warren Woods said the storm swept through the town of about 7,800 people between 6:30 and 7 p.m.Mr. Woods said he was not aware of any injuries.

"'12-04-15,'0','More broadly, the review showed that those who donated the most to Mr. Obama and the since he started running for president were far more likely to visit the White House than others. Among donors who gave $30,000 or less, about 20 percent visited the White House, according to a analysis that matched names in the visitor logs with donor records. But among those who donated $100,000 or more, the figure rises to about 75 percent. Approximately two-thirds of the president’s top fund-raisers in the 2008 campaign visited the White House at least once, some of them numerous times.The reasons someone might have gained access to the White House and made a donation are wide-ranging, and it is clear that in some cases the administration came down against the policies being sought by the visitors. But the regular appearance of big donors inside the White House underscores how political contributions continue to lubricate many of the interactions between officials and their guests, if for no other reason than that donors view the money as useful for getting a foot in the door.Some of the donors had no previous record of giving to the president or his party, or of making donations of such magnitude, so their gifts, sometimes given in close proximity to meetings, raise questions about whether they came with expectations of access or were expressions of gratitude.Dr. William C. Mohlenbrock, chairman of a health care data analysis firm, Verras Ltd., gave occasionally to political candidates over the years, mostly small amounts to Republicans. But last May he contributed the maximum allowable gift, $35,800, to the Obama Victory Fund, which benefits the president’s campaign and the Democratic Party. Later in the year, with help from a Democratic consultant, he landed a meeting with a top White House aide involved in the , but failed to persuade officials to require more health data collection as part of the new regulations.Joe E. Kiani, who heads a medical device company, , stepped up his giving to Democrats last year as medical device makers campaigned unsuccessfully for the repeal of an excise imposed on the industry. Mr. Kiani had several meetings with White House officials last year, including two with lobbyists from his company and another with representatives from his industry’s trade association. In the midst of these gatherings, he donated $35,800 to the victory fund.Administration officials insisted that donations do not factor into White House visits, and they cited steps taken to curb the influence of money in politics, including a ban on executive branch employees’ accepting gifts from lobbyists and on appointees’ lobbying the White House after they leave. Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman, pointed out that Mr. Obama was the first president to release the visitor logs regularly, and added that “being a supporter of the president does not secure you a visit to the White House, nor does it preclude you from one.”“The people selected for this article are contributors to the president,” Mr. Schultz said, “but this article excludes the thousands of people who visit the White House every week for meetings and events who did not contribute to the president, many of whom may not have even supported the president.”Most donors, including Dr. Mohlenbrock and Mr. Kiani, declined to talk about their motivations for giving. But , the former representative from , who donated $35,800 to an Obama re-election fund last fall while seeking administration support for a nonprofit venture, said contributions were simply a part of “how this business works.”“If you want to call it ‘quid pro quo,’ fine,” he said. “At the end of the day, I want to make sure I do my part.”Mr. Kennedy visited the White House several times to win support for One Mind for Research, his initiative to help develop new treatments for brain disorders. While his family name and connections are clearly influential, he said, he knows White House officials are busy. And as a former chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, he said he was keenly aware of the political realities they face.“I know that they look at the reports,” he said, referring to records of campaign donations. “They’re my friends anyway, but it won’t hurt when I ask them for a favor if they don’t see me as a slouch.”Others, like Ms. Bush, rejected the notion that their donations were tied to access. Her husband said it was a coincidence that his contribution last May — made at a Democratic fund-raiser — came on the same day his wife was at the White House. And Ms. Bush noted that most of her meetings occurred before she made her donation in June. She added that as a longtime lawyer with the firm Skadden Arps, it should not be surprising that her work would occasionally take her to the White House.“Communications law is what I do for a living,” Ms. Bush said. “Yes, I’m an Obama supporter, but in the end I’m a communications law expert. I had the same clients in the Bush administration as well as the Obama administration.”Although those in office invariably deny it, the notion that access is available at a price is a well-founded reality of Washington. Memorably, was caught on tape remarking that $250,000 should be the minimum donation for an ambassadorship. The Clinton White House offered major donors coffees with the president or sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom. More recently, Republicans in Congress have raised questions about whether Democratic donors who invested in the company and other troubled firms influenced the administration’s support of those businesses, pointing to White House visits and other official contacts. The administration denies there was any wrongdoing.At a minimum, it is standard for administrations to recognize generous supporters with sought-after invitations to special events. The Obama White House logs are filled with the names of donors welcomed for receptions, parties and concerts. Last year, several major Democratic donors rounded out the guest list for a film screening with the first lady.But in addition to social events, business is also carried out in the White House and its executive offices. The logs suggest some Obama fund-raisers and donors have been trafficking in ties they forged to the administration, helping clients get a seat at the table.When officials wanted White House backing for a program that would speed up local transit projects, they turned last spring to a political operative, Kerman Maddox, a top Obama fund-raiser and party donor. “We thought he could help our outreach in Washington,” said Richard Leahy, chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.In an internal memo justifying Mr. Maddox’s hiring, the authority wrote that he had “direct access to the Executive Oval Office” and cited his position on the Obama campaign’s National Finance Committee. Mr. Maddox’s company Web site prominently features photographs of him with the Obamas.One day after the authority signed off on his contract, Mr. Maddox made a $10,000 donation to the Obama re-election effort; he donated an additional $6,000 in June. In August, Mr. Maddox landed a meeting for himself and the authority officials with , then director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, one of several meetings the officials were able to get.The administration had previously been supportive of Los Angeles County’s efforts to accelerate its transit projects, but the following month, Mr. Obama also announced, as part of his jobs package, a proposal to significantly expand a Transportation Department program. The plan, which has drawn bipartisan support, is something Mr. Maddox’s clients had sought. Mr. Maddox, soon donated an additional $11,250 to the victory fund. He said in an e-mail that his donations were tied to fund-raising events and had nothing to do with visiting the White House.Noah Mamet, another veteran Democratic fund-raiser and consultant, emphasizes on his firm’s Web site that he and his partners “are not lobbyists.” Instead, they help their clients “strategically navigate the worlds of politics, philanthropy and business.” Mr. Mamet, who donated $35,800 last year, and his partners have visited the Obama White House more than a dozen times, including at least four occasions on which they accompanied clients to meetings with administration officials. Mr. Mamet declined to comment.Lamell McMorris, a native and longtime Obama supporter who appears in White House visitor logs 20 times, runs a Washington consulting firm that, as recently as last year, was registered to lobby. He also operates a sports management company, and has taken clients like the football player Cam Newton and the guard Anthony Morrow to the White House for private tours. Mr. McMorris did not reply to requests for comment.With many of these meetings, it is often difficult to discern what exactly was being discussed. Clues can sometimes be gleaned by looking at the positions and interests of other attendees — who often include lobbyists.David Beier, who oversees government affairs at the pharmaceutical company , has had nearly a dozen meetings at the White House, according to the visitor logs. On a single day in February last year, Mr. Beier, Amgen’s chief executive, Kevin W. Sharer, and lobbyists from the Podesta Group, the firm led by the Democratic fund-raiser , had four meetings with top White House officials, including Ms. Jarrett, Pete Rouse and . Mr. Beier — who was registered to lobby for Amgen for 10 years until last year — donated $35,800 in January, his largest such contribution. The donation came two weeks after he and Mr. Podesta visited the White House for another meeting with an economic official.Amgen declined to comment, but lobbying disclosure reports show that the company hired the Podesta Group to press the White House and Congress on Medicare coverage and reimbursement for drugs for end-stage renal disease, among other issues.As for Ms. Bush, a former Senate staff member whose stepfather is the Democratic power broker , she declined to comment on the nature of her visits. But the purpose of some of them can be inferred from the more detailed records of meetings she had around the same time with officials at the . Those agency meetings — some of which included the same Sony and Viacom lobbyists whom she accompanied to the White House — were mostly about shaping regulations to discourage piracy of digital media.She also helped Viacom fight an F.C.C. complaint that one of its Nickelodeon shows, Zevo-3, was little more than a vehicle for the show’s marketing partner, . Writing to the agency for Viacom, Ms. Bush argued that the cartoon show, which features characters with special powers who previously appeared in Skechers commercials, intentionally distances itself from the footwear Skechers sells.“In particular,” she wrote, “the characters in Zevo-3 do not derive any powers from their shoes, do not go out of their way to refer to their shoes and do not indicate that their shoes bear any relation to their roles on the program.”'"

"'12-04-15,'0','I had the good fortune of having an economics professor who opened up this whole world of health care for me. She said a couple of things to me: one, that it’s an industry with no women in leadership, and 20 years from now it’s going to be 20 percent of the gross national product. And she said, “It’s going to open doors that a lot of other industries won’t open for women, so I think that’s where you should go.” Then, once I started working in a hospital, I just knew health care was where I needed to be.Q. Why did you decide to go into business for yourself?A. I worked my way up to a chief operating officer job at a hospital by the age of 30. I figured I could be the C.E.O., but the C.E.O. wasn’t going anywhere. So I started looking elsewhere for opportunities, and I kept getting interviewed for the C.E.O. job but never got hired. In that era, it was still a male-dominated industry. I saw an opportunity to create an alternative employer health insurance plan. And now, nearly 20 years later, we have almost 1,000 people who work for me.Q. What do you consider the most important leadership lessons you’ve learned?A. Early on, it was clear to me that if I was going to build a successful business, it was going to be about building relationships. I figured out that relationships were built in business on the golf course, and that’s when golf started becoming such an important part of my culture, even though I had never golfed before. I had never been an athlete.I never played anything, not even miniature golf. But I started with lessons at a local driving range with a golf pro. Then I started to play in these golf outings and saw the kind of relationship-building that it allowed me to do. I started to get competitive, and I took more lessons. I was introduced to an L.P.G.A. pro, and she started giving me lessons and I got better. The next thing I knew, I said: “You know what? I need to bring her in to teach my management team because I can’t be the only one out playing golf with people. First of all, I’ve got a lot to do, and I need other people to build that skill set.” So it became part of our culture that my management team took up golf.Q. How good a golfer are you now?Q. And were the people on your management team golfers?A. When the company was still relatively small, I had four or five key managers I needed to help me build relationships. But a few of them weren’t even golfers, didn’t even have clubs. So I said: “We’re going to give you lessons. I’ll help you get golf clubs. If I’ve got to buy you golf clubs, whatever I’ve got to do, you need to have the full package so that I can send you out with a customer.”As I started adding people to the team, it became a part of my interview process. “Do you golf? Do you like to golf? Do you want to like to golf? Well, you’re going to have to like to golf because that’s part of what we do here.” Today, we participate in golf outings throughout the tristate area for charitable events probably every Monday from April 1 through the end of October.I’m very competitive, and when I play golf with mostly men, I don’t play from the forward tees. I play from the white tees because I don’t want to miss the action. I don’t want to miss the dialogue. I don’t want to miss the competitiveness that’s going on at the tee. I don’t care if I’m a little shorter than they are. That’s O.K. I’ll make it up. I want to be there with them. I want them to see that I can keep up with them.Q. How many times do you play a week?A. In the season, I play three to four times a week. I play every Monday, I play Saturday and Sunday and then I’ll usually play one other day during the week with a customer or someone.Q. Tell me a little bit more about the culture of your company.A. I’m a very family-oriented person. So your family’s very important to me, and what you do with your family is very important to make sure that you have balance. I want your family to know how we work together. I will do things with my management team, like invite them over to my home to help them learn how to make raviolis. They come over with their kids and they come over with their significant other, and we’re in the kitchen and we’re all learning how to cook as a team. I call it QualCare Cooking School.So we’ll have 20 people over. My kitchen will be a mess, but when we’re done, everyone’s family will know how important working with these other people is. I want their family to see that, because we do spend a lot of time with each other and the kids are always saying, “Dad, why do you have to work late tonight?” So doing things like cooking school helps them understand that.We also do a lot of things with our employees to help them relieve their stress. We are in the health care business, but we’re on the side of the business when people only call us when somebody’s sick, or there’s some problem or some issue.For the people on the phone handling that customer who’s under stress, we want to relieve their stress. So we do things like we have pajama day, where everybody comes to work in their pajamas. It’s like a casual day, and they have fun. We do Disco Friday, too — on some Fridays during the busiest times of the year, we’ll put music on in the hallways and people just dance.Halloween, from our first year, has been a big part of the company. People get dressed up. They put on entire plays in the office and they compete against each other. It’s all about teamwork, building camaraderie and having fun. We close down the night before Halloween day, and I walk in the next morning and the entire 100,000 square feet of space is decorated, and people do skits all day long.Q. Anything unusual about how you run meetings?A. I have a rule. I don’t think a meeting should run longer than an hour. And if I don’t have an agenda in front of me, I walk out. Give me an agenda or else I’m not going to sit there, because if I don’t know why we’re in the meeting, and you don’t know why we’re there, then there’s no reason for a meeting. It’s very important to me to focus people and to keep them focused, and not just get in the room and talk about who won the Knicks game last night. That’s not what it’s about.Q. What if the meeting runs longer than an hour?A. After an hour, I will get up and walk out of a meeting. I know that things should not take that long.Q. How do you hire? What questions do you ask?A. When I’m considering somebody for an executive-level position, I usually do three interviews. The first interview is all about you as a person. I want to know about who you are — not what you are — and what made you what you are. What’s your family like? How did you grow up? Where did you go to school? What are the kinds of things that influenced you?Q. And what are you listening for?A. I want to know what kind of values you have. I’m listening for things that are important to you. I’m listening for things that you have fun doing, because I think people should work hard and play hard. I want you to tell me a little bit about what excites you outside of work.The second interview is about your technical competence. How smart are you? What have you done? What experience do you have? What are your success stories? What have been your failures? Because I’m a big believer that you learn as much from failure as you do from success. So I want to know the things that you did wrong or the things that didn’t work well in your career that might have helped build your character.And the third time we get together, it’s really about, “All right, now you know a little bit about me. Hopefully, you’ve done your research. Do you think we could work together?” It’s really about trying to make sure that there’s a fit between the two of us.'"
"'12-04-15,'0','On Friday, the Devils’ owner, Jeff Vanderbeek, said, “We’ve been consistent that Zach is our No. 1 priority to get re-signed, and we’re going to do everything we can to get that done.”Parise said last week that he was concerned only with helping the Devils eliminate the Panthers. Advancing past the second round would be a first for Parise, who has played for the Devils for seven years. He has a big emotional investment in trying to make it work here.He stands to make millions of dollars — even if he stays in New Jersey — and has proved his value, especially this season. The Devils would still have Kovalchuk and probably Brodeur as part of their nucleus, but they would be much better off with Parise, too.“He’s someone on the ice who works hard every shift, a guy who never gives up,” forward David Clarkson, who scored 30 goals this season, said of Parise. “When he’s on the ice and you’re the next to go, you want to work as hard as he did because he’s your captain.”The previous Devils captain, Jamie Langenbrunner, now with the St. Louis Blues, used to skate on Parise’s line, providing a benchmark for a captain’s deportment. Essentially, a captain should be an inspiration, and Parise is.“He’s got great skills and he’s got a great work ethic, so that’s a pretty good mix,” Kovalchuk said. “I’m very excited to play next to him.”Bright, handsome, engaging, self-deprecating, sincere and always available for interviews after games, Parise is a good representative for the Devils. He has also been a liaison between his teammates and their first-year coach, Peter DeBoer.“I talk to him quite a bit,” DeBoer said. “We talk on a regular basis. Zach’s not a small-talk guy. When we talk, it’s because he wants to get a message to me or a point across, and vice versa. That’s our relationship.”When asked how Parise had done in his first season as the captain, DeBoer said: “Anybody who knows Zach knows he’s not going to be giving long speeches. He leads by example. He lets his play do the talking.”DeBoer added: “At the same time, I’ve found him very invested in the team, the dressing room, creating a tight group. He was very successful at it. If you ask anyone, they all talk about how they enjoy coming to the rink together. Zach has played a big part in that.”That Parise has rebounded so thoroughly from right knee surgery 17 months ago has given the Devils a lift. A restricted free agent last July, he signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the idea that he could work out a longer deal later.Besides being able to track down loose pucks, especially those near the opponent’s goal, Parise was loyal to the Devils. He and Kovalchuk have worked well on a line that included the rookie Adam Henrique and now is centered by Parise’s longtime teammate Travis Zajac.“When he does say something, guys listen to him because everyone respects him,” Zajac said of Parise. “I don’t think much has changed with him. He’s not going to be a rah-rah guy in the dressing room. His biggest asset is his leadership on the ice. When he goes, this team goes. I think that’s the biggest compliment a player can get.”Parise, chuckling, said: “I’m trying, at least, to do what I’ve always done. You have more meetings with the coach, and they ask you a few things. You definitely have more responsibility. I think you’re looked at a little differently from the outside. But I think it’s gone pretty well.”So far, anyway. The Devils (48-28-6) won 10 more regular-season games than they did last season and made the playoffs with relative ease. But players and coaches like to say a team’s success is determined in the playoffs, so Parise says he has a lot more to do.Of Parise’s contract status, Zajac said: “We haven’t talked about it much. That’s a decision I’m sure he’ll make later on. But he’s a big part of this organization. Everyone wants him to be a part of this organization, and I think he wants that too. I think his focus right now is having a good playoffs and leading this team to some success in the playoffs.”'"
"'12-04-15,'0','While prostitution is legal in designated areas in Colombia, such behavior would violate agency rules of conduct, in part because it could expose the agents to blackmail or facilitate espionage, help an enemy get inside a security perimeter and otherwise distract agents when they are supposed to be focused on protecting the president, he said.The violation came to light, Mr. King said, because under the hotel’s policy, guests of people staying there must leave their identification at the front desk and leave by 7 a.m. On Thursday morning, he said, a hotel manager realized that one of the women had not left and went to the agent’s room to ask her to leave.The agent is said to have not let the manager in, whereupon a Colombian police officer went to the room. Inside, the woman complained that the agent had not paid her. Eventually the agent did pay her, and she is said to have left without further incident, Mr. King said.While no law was broken, the Colombian police sent a report to the American embassy recounting the incident.The embassy and the Secret Service field office in Miami, which supervised the unit in Colombia, began to hear reports of the episode at the same time on Thursday, Mr. King said. They began to investigate and discovered that other Secret Service employees had taken women to their rooms as well. Then the entire team was ordered out of the country, and replacements were flown in from Miami and San Juan, Puerto Rico.Mr. King said that it appeared that the Secret Service had “responded appropriately,” but he was directing his staff to begin an investigation to determine a precise timeline of what happened, whether it was an aberration, and what procedures were put in place to prevent a recurrence. He said he would decide whether to hold a hearing on the matter based on whether his staff uncovered details that differed from the agency’s public account.Investigators who interviewed the agents and officers on Saturday were sorting through accounts. In another version of the events, several officials said, the police attention was initially attracted by some kind of argument or altercation — compounded by the language barrier — involving the woman who demanded money from the agent.A senior United States official who had been briefed on the matter said that it was unclear whether some or all of the other women brought to the hotel were also prostitutes, and, if so, whether the agents and officers knew that ahead of time. At least two of the agents were supervisors, the official added.“There are people who willingly went to prostitutes and other people who ended up with prostitutes,” the official said. “Either way, it’s just unacceptable.”The agents and officers were flown out of Colombia on Friday, the same day Mr. Obama arrived for the Summit of the Americas, a meeting of more than 30 leaders.“The president is obviously aware of the incident, but beyond that, this is a matter that the Secret Service is looking into,” the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, told reporters in Cartagena. The controversy was the subject of the first question to Mr. Carney at a late afternoon briefing on Saturday. He said the matter had not been a distraction for the Obama delegation and added, “I think it has been much more of a distraction for the press.” Mr. Carney said that the White House learned of the matter on Thursday night and that Mr. Obama was told on Friday.In a statement the assistant director of the Secret Service, Paul S. Morrissey, acknowledged that 11 agency personnel, including both special agents and uniformed division officers, had been recalled from Colombia over allegations of personal misconduct. He said they were interviewed by the agency’s Office of Professional Responsibility on Saturday and have been placed on leave as the investigation continues. The United States Southern Command, which oversees American military matters in Latin America, said the five military service members who were working with the Secret Service had been restricted to their rooms and were “under orders not to have contact with other individuals.” They would return to the United States at the end of the summit, it said, and are facing a military investigation.Daniel Bongino, a former Secret Service agent with the presidential protection division who left the agency in May, said that while agent misconduct occasionally occurs, in his experience most agents who are on assignment but off duty lead a “monkish” existence focused on working out, eating and sleeping.'"
"'12-04-15,'0','For me, the whole point of reading restaurant reviews is to find new places to eat. But the problem is that there’s no easy way to set reviews aside for that moment when you are standing on a corner, trying to remember the place you wanted to try that was right nearby.This is not to say that there are no ways. Oh, there are ways! I have an elaborate network of notes that I keep on my phone. I e-mail myself things. I scribble on business cards and put them in my wallet. I set an alarm to remind myself three weeks from now about something I’ve read. The need for a good way to store and organize the information we collect online has led to the recent popularity of services like Evernote and Pinterest.One way to make this easier would be a more direct connection between the publications we read and the physical world. An app recently released by Metrofocus, an online magazine published by WNET Channel 13, the local public television station, takes a step in that direction.The app, which went live late last month, tries to do a lot. It gives you local weather, transit updates and an aggregation service from other local publications. All these things work just fine.The novel thing about the app, though, is the way it integrates with Foursquare, the location-based social networking app. Go to the Metrofocus article about the city’s best carousels, and choose to save the locations of those carousels on a to-do list in Foursquare. When at some point you end up close to one of those spots, your phone will remind you that you wanted to visit.It is a nice little feature that makes Metrofocus a bit more useful. But its significance is the potential it has to make Foursquare much more useful.'"
"'12-04-15,'0','Appropriately for someone so grounded in the material world, Ms. Cappellazzo has on her desk a hunk of terra firma itself: an attractive fist-size formation of quartz crystal. It is, as she will frankly admit, nothing special.The crystal was given to her as a casual gift by an acquaintance; it has no sentimental value. She holds no beliefs that it channels new-age energy from the universe to her chakras. Clear quartz is a very common crystal, and her specimen has no marked trait to make it special: it’s not huge, or strikingly shaped, or colored, or perfectly clear. It does not have any facet that imbues quartz with value.“It’s pretty modest,” she said. “In a way, it is a dumb rock. But that is sweet. I kind of like that. So the thing is, it is totally phenomenological. Like, it is something if I think so: this dumb rock could actually be imbued with tremendous power if I wanted it to be.”Not that it doesn’t have its assets.“It’s a good nervous fetish toy,” she said. “Sometimes I hold it when I am on the phone doing a deal or I have to really think about something long and hard. You kind of rub it. You wear it down a bit. It is also a little sharp, so it stings back at you, puts you in your place. And it never disappoints in terms of the way it looks. It is weighty and has presence, and it never gets dusty or fingerprinty. It requires nothing from me.”So, mundane or not, the crystal is literally a touchstone for Ms. Cappellazzo’s brand of materialism: the belief that, simply put, only matter matters. Still, she went so far as to liken it to a rosary or mezuza, insofar as she is drawn to things that represent bigger ideas.“I am just interested in the artifacts of a religion or culture, the remains of it, rather than it itself,” she said. “What are the visuals they left behind? That’s  usually more my question. You know, is there any good food associated with it?”“It’s funny,” she added. “I am a hard-core materialist more than a spiritualist, if you are putting me on the continuum. But if this is what I picked to talk about, I am clearly not that materialistic because it is not very interesting or special.”In the end, something is worth only what you invest in it, whether the currency is one the world agrees on or a personal one that is valueless to others. Money isn’t everything. Meaning is.'"
"'12-04-15,'0','Mr. Kushner began inviting Mr. Barley to dinner or to the movies, “like it was a normal thing for a boss and an employee to do this kind of thing,” Mr. Kushner said.“He just has such an exuberance and joy about him, and that’s not common for architects,” he added. “They’re usually cynical and wear black.”Each learned how different their lives had been up to that point. Mr. Barley, now 30, remembers a childhood of “picnics, cakes, pies,” herding cattle and raising tobacco and sweet corn on his grandfather’s farm. Bible study was a form of recreation. Dating and dancing were not allowed, but Mr. Barley didn’t mind. “I was a great little Mennonite,” he said.“He grew up in, like, butter-land, I’m from margarine-ville,” said Mr. Kushner, now 34. “My family is all hyperactive ‘Oh, my God, we’re late, we have to achieve and right now!’ ”Mr. Kushner’s boyhood leisures involved “indoorsy” pursuits, like watching television on his family’s many television sets. (Mr. Barley’s family’s set broke in the 1980s and still has not been replaced.)The Kushners have long been prominent in real estate development and philanthropy in New Jersey and New York. (Jared Kushner, the owner of The New York Observer, is a first cousin.) Marc Kushner’s elementary school, the Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy, was named for his paternal grandfather, a Holocaust survivor from what is now Belarus who founded the family business. He said that he and his brothers and sister were expected to work hard and to prove themselves.Mr. Kushner was in high school when he came to realize that he was gay, but did not tell his parents until he was a senior at the University of Pennsylvania.“When he came home from college totally buff with bleach blond hair and tortoiseshell glasses, they were like: something’s up,” said his sister, Melissa Kushner. “Then he said he was gay, and it was like, well, should we be upset about him being gay or about his bleached hair?”Mr. Kushner said that “in the end, their attitude was that just because I was gay didn’t mean that the rules weren’t the same,” he said. That meant keeping a kosher home and marrying someone Jewish.“To me, that was the ultimate sign of acceptance, that the ideas of the family and what family believes in still apply,” he said.Mr. Barley had not told his family that he was gay and said he had not had a romantic relationship until he and Mr. Kushner began dating.He quit the firm when he became involved with Mr. Kushner and described those first months as blissful. “It was a huge deal for me to be walking down the street holding someone’s hand,” he said.He came out to his family by introducing them to Mr. Kushner. He said that they took it in stride. “His happiness is primary,” said his mother, Susan Barley.Yet Mr. Kushner began having nagging doubts. “I just assumed that this really cute, outgoing guy had a history, just like everyone else in New York,” he said. “It was his first relationship, and I thought ‘I need to be really careful.’ ”Also, Mr. Kushner added, there was “the Jewish issue.”“I wanted marriage,” he said. “It seemed unfair to take marriage off the table.”Toward the end of the year, Mr. Kushner ended things. “It was definitely unexpected,” Mr. Barley said. Mr. Kushner resolved to find a Jewish mate. “I got on JDate.com,” he said. “But it was horrific. As a whole, Jewish gay guys might be marvelous people, but the ones I met were insane.”By summer 2008, Mr. Barley was interning again, this time with Rem Koolhaas’s firm in Rotterdam. Mr. Kushner flew there to visit him. “I realized he was what I wanted,” Mr. Kushner said. “He’s the one. We’d work it out.”When Mr. Barley returned three months later, they signed up for a class at the 92nd Street Y for people interested in converting to Judaism, and Mr. Barley eventually did convert. Their careers moved forward. Mr. Barley graduated from Columbia and became a partner in a design and curatorial firm in New York. Mr. Kushner helped start a social networking site for architects called Architizer.Mr. Kushner proposed at the Setai hotel in Miami during a Passover vacation with the Kushner family last year. He gave Mr. Barley a Rolex, which he returned because he wanted a Jaeger-LeCoultre.“Even though we are both gay and nonstandard in that way, we were both raised feeling that marriage was something important and exciting,” Mr. Barley said. “I’d always liked the idea of marriage, but it wasn’t something I really pictured for myself. But then, it became a possibility, and that was kind of amazing.”Mr. Kushner wanted the relationship his parents had. “There are two versions of my parents,” he said. “Growing up, me marrying a man would’ve been outside of the realm of possibilities. But by the time I proposed to Chris, they’d come around.”During the December holidays, Mr. Barley and Mr. Kushner went to the home of Mr. Barley’s parents and took their own menorah to light.“His parents are incredibly warm and welcoming,” Mr. Kushner said. “We just all sit and talk. And sometimes we sit and not talk! It’s amazing.”Though both said the disparities in their families’ financial situations were not a concern, they did have a prenuptial agreement. “We’re not in denial that there are differences in our backgrounds, and a prenup was something that helped to neutralize that,” Mr. Kushner said. “The wedding was about a lot of things, but money wasn’t one of them.”They were married on March 31 at the Four Seasons restaurant in New York. And it was Mr. Barley, the recent convert, who broke the glass at the end of the ceremony, which was led by Rabbi Samuel H. Weintraub.The vows were recited under a wedding canopy designed by an architect friend of the couple. They plan to turn the fabric into a quilt. “Which is cool because quilts are a super Mennonite thing,” Mr. Barley said.Added Mr. Kushner, “It’s always nice to have another blanket.”'"
"'12-04-15,'0','In Beinart’s world, anti-Semitism seems little more than a form of Jewish self-deception. The Anti-Defamation League fights “alleged” anti-Semitism against Israel, he tells us. To worry about existential threats to a country the size of New Jersey, with fewer than eight million people living in a suicide-bombing nuclear age, is to surrender to “Jewish victimhood.” Surely it is possible for a country to be both powerful and precarious? Surely “vulnerability” would be a better word than “victimhood”? But Beinart’s feints toward nuance repeatedly give way to stark dualisms: “Liberalism was out, tribalism was in.”Though allowing that “there is some truth” to the argument that Palestinians have turned their back on past offers of a two-state solution, Beinart’s formula — “were Israel to permit the creation of a Palestinian state” — waves that away, establishing, through purely rhetorical means, that peace is Israel’s to bestow, and incidentally robbing Palestinians of any role in their own destiny. But then Beinart has little to say about Palestinians in any case. While there is a chapter called “The Crisis in Israel” and a chapter called “The Crisis in America,” there is no chapter called “The Crisis in Palestinian Society” or “The Crisis in Islam,” though Islam has played an enormous role in Palestinian nationalism. Beinart may of course believe there is no crisis in these quarters, but he is essentially silent on the matter, just as he pays scant attention to the larger Arab world, finding it easier to recast a Mideast struggle as an American-Israeli drama.Like the Widow Douglas trying to civilize Huck Finn before he lights out for the occupied territory, Beinart has a missionary impulse toward Israel. His faith resides in “liberal ­ideals,” which he often makes synonymous with Judaism itself, or what Judaism ought to be. Thus we are told that Benjamin Netanyahu doesn’t trust Barack Obama because “Obama reminds Netanyahu of what Netanyahu doesn’t like about Jews,” by which he means a sense of moral obligation. In a neat trick of replacement theology, Obama, referred to as “the Jewish president,” becomes the real Jew on whom election has fallen figuratively as well as ­literally.Netanyahu, meanwhile, languishes in an old and brutal dispensation, indulging in “the glorification of the ferocious Jews of antiquity.” This Old Testament fury causes Obama to retreat from mentioning the division of Jerusalem: “The response from Netanyahu, the Republicans and the American Jewish organizations would be too ferocious to bear.” What this unbearable ferocity would consist of Beinart does not say. But it must be awful if it can cow the most powerful man in the free world.This is of a piece with the sins of American Jews, who “rarely talk about what Joseph did to the Egyptians when Pharaoh put him in charge of the nation’s grain.” Turning away from such ugliness, Beinart declares that we need “a new American Jewish story.”The wish for a new testament is old in Judaism, though some would say that Beinart’s attempt to separate Judaism’s sinful body from its liberal soul — the better to save it — is an antiquated act. Others might say that Israel is itself a new testament, or to borrow Theodor Herzl’s phrase, an old-new testament. Herzl, a hero of Beinart’s, didn’t think Israel would need an army. In 1902, this fantasy was still possible.Beinart cites approvingly Israel’s declaration of statehood, read aloud by David Ben-Gurion in 1948. It promised “complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants irrespective of religion, race or sex.” Yet Ben-Gurion also decided to eliminate from that document any reference to Israel’s borders, because the Arabs were preparing to attack and he wasn’t fighting to defend rejected borders but to save his state. The written as well as the unwritten words form a kind of text and commentary that Israel still struggles to balance amid all the brute realities of an unforgiving region. Sometimes it does this well and sometimes badly, but the struggle itself is the hallmark of a civilization far beyond Peter Beinart’s Manichaean ­simplicities.'"
"'12-04-15,'0','Just as the silence that followed our tiff was starting to become uncomfortable, we heard an engine accelerating loudly behind us. The line turned in unison to see a large 1970s-era car jump the curb partway up the block. Small, round, widely spaced headlights raced toward us.I bolted for the wall of the adjacent building, scrambling on top of other clubgoers. I stopped hearing things. I felt the car fly by, fully on the sidewalk, inches from my leg. Five seconds later I got up and looked around. No Bob.As anyone who has been in a life-threatening situation knows, time seems to slow down, perhaps giving you a chance to save yourself and others. But this elongation can make it very difficult to piece the experience back together afterward.“Where’s Bob?” I thought. “Is Bob dead? Who is that man sitting in the middle of Sunset Boulevard in a blue shirt and no pants? Wasn’t Bob wearing a blue shirt?”I moved closer, past two others who were hurt, and into the street. The man with no pants was Bob, already feeling around for his health insurance card in what was left of his trousers. Bob might have been annoyingly contrarian about car ownership, but at least he had his priorities straight in terms of where to allocate scarce resources.Bob and others at the scene confirmed what had happened. As the car barreled down the sidewalk, Bob determined he could not make it to the wall in time and ran forward instead, until the car hit him from behind.It carried him on its hood, dumped him into the gutter, snagged his pants and dragged him into the middle of Sunset Boulevard, where it deposited him, sans pants, near a manhole.Help arrived after what seemed like a ridiculously long time. Bob went off in the ambulance while the valet at the club brought my car around. We spent the rest of our date in the emergency room.None of this was in question. What was in question, however, and much debated during my visit to see him during his week in the hospital, was whether Bob had pushed me out of the way and saved my life.I had saved myself, I insisted. I am a competent, capable woman who does not need a man to save her. In reality I wasn’t sure. But I was afraid to concede that Bob had saved my life, even if he had, because I worried that would somehow mean I should continue to date him. I did want someone to save me. I just didn’t want it to be Bob.I got my comeuppance a few months later, dating a man named Marc with whom I had quickly fallen in love. Marc was a classic commitment-phobe, so much so that, unlike Bob, he could not even save my life when called upon to do so. He actually backed away from me with a look of horror on his face as I choked on a piece of meat at a barbecue a few months into our relationship, and a friend had to rush over to administer the Heimlich maneuver.He had already been retreating from me more generally before that episode, and perhaps choosing not to save my life was easier than simply breaking up with me. In any case, I decided to take a break from Marc, and indeed a break from dating in general.IN the meantime, I pulled my life together in other ways. I went to graduate school a second time. I started teaching. I cavalierly fell into a long-term relationship with a good friend from school that lasted much longer than necessary. I re-emerged into the dating world at 37 relieved not to be married to the wrong person and therefore already divorced from the wrong person.And I was happy to be beyond the pale in terms of what society and my family viewed to be the ideal. I would be free to date and define my own path to life and love. And date I did.All this dating was fun and reliably hilarious. I was able to add numerous locations to my “Bad Date Map of Los Angeles,” a pet project I started when Bob was run over. I learned all the best places to make out.There were no more near-death dating experiences, but the dating project, as it came to be called, also took me no closer to life or love. These were not genuine connections but rather associations too quickly formed and even more quickly discarded, the gap between expectation and reality being too wide.Then last summer Bob contacted me out of the blue to see if I wanted to get together. I had not heard from him in nearly 10 years. A road accident involving some cyclists in Los Angeles had Bob thinking about his own brush with death, which evidently made him think of me.Sure, I thought. It would be interesting to see what he had done with the last decade of his life. I was fairly sure he was not dating anyone. And I couldn’t help but wonder about the possible significance of us reconnecting after all these years.Was it unreasonable to expect that he and I had both changed and matured in ways that might allow for a second chance at genuine attraction? For all my efforts to put thoughts of fate and signs behind, I had to admit I still wanted to believe in a world in which a shared near-death experience could cement a lasting future connection.But if I hadn’t changed much, neither had Bob. True to form, his continuing lack of a car, whether out of conviction or necessity, was again problematic. This time he rode his bike to the bar in my neighborhood but forgot his lock. So before we could go in and have a drink, we had to put his bike in my car (now a Subaru).Finally inside, alcohol in hand, I learned that Bob was in the exact same place he had been in years before: still riding his bike and occasionally teaching; still “all but dissertation” on his Ph.D.; still traveling the world and variously house-sitting or couch-surfing. Seemingly very happy.Bob and I falling in love would have made such a nice ending to this story. But I didn’t want to date Bob the first time around, and the sad truth is that 10 years later, I still didn’t want to date him.I’m now dating a police officer, one who, by some extraordinary coincidence, was working at the station that received the call the night Bob was run over. He wasn’t among those who responded and doesn’t even remember the incident, so I am not taking this as a storybook sign that we’re meant to be together.With him I’m not even wondering about signs. Which might be the best sign of all.'"

But “we think it gives important information about the acts he carried out.”Ibrahim Abdille, 17, who survived the massacre by hiding under a pile of bodies as the gunman fired from above, said on Monday: “Most of the families don’t want to listen or to follow this case. But at the same time, it will be very difficult for them to avoid it.”Mr. Breivik has admitted on several occasions that he carried out the rampage, in which 8 people died in the bombing and 69 were shot and killed on the island, where the youth wing of the governing was holding a summer camp.A lawyer for the youth wing, Frode Elgesen, said that at the time of the killings, “most people felt that they had some kind of relationship to what happened — they knew someone who died, or who lost someone.” He continued: “That has lessened over time. People are still quite shocked, but I don’t think we have changed. It has been a very traumatic experience for Norway, but the main thing to say is that we have coped.”Mr. Breivik remained mostly impassive as the evidence was presented, and at one point seemed to stifle a yawn. Only when the court viewed a video that Mr. Breivik had made before the attacks did he shed tears and dab at his face.Asked by a judge on Monday whether he wished to plead guilty, Mr. Breivik said, “I acknowledge the acts, but I don’t plead guilty, as I claim I was doing it in self-defense.” He had previously disclaimed criminal responsibility on the ground that he was protecting Norway from Islamic .At another point in the hearing, he said: “I do not recognize the Norwegian courts. You have received your mandate from political parties which support multiculturalism. I do not acknowledge the authority of the court.”The second time he called the police offering to surrender, Mr. Breivik could be heard claiming to be “a commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement” and asking, “Could you give me the head of Delta?” apparently referring to an elite police unit. He claimed to have successfully carried out an “operation” and said, “since it has been completed, it is time to give myself up to Delta,” and then hung up. Prosecutors said least 11 more people were killed after the call.As he entered the courtroom dressed in a dark suit, Mr. Breivik offered a display of defiance, delivering a clenched-fist salute with his right arm thrust rigidly from his body, but then shook hands with court officers.In a manifesto posted online shortly before the attacks last year, Mr. Breivik described the gesture as the salute of the Knights Templar, which he claimed to have founded a decade ago. Prosecutors said in court on Monday that there was no such group, apparently contradicting Mr. Breivik’s initial assertions that he acted as part of a broader conspiracy.When Mr. Breivik gives evidence in court for the first time on Tuesday, he wants to read a 30-minute statement that will be “the most important piece of evidence presented to the court on whether he will be found to be sane or not,” his lawyer, Geir Lippestad, said on Monday.“We understand the bereaved don’t want this court to be turned into a pulpit; we understand it would be hard for the families,” Mr. Lippestad said. “But he has a right as a defendant in Norwegian law to give a statement, and a human right as well.”The five judges will rule on Tuesday whether to allow Mr. Breivik to make the statement.Mr. Breivik’s trial is set to last 10 weeks. Many Norwegian analysts worry that he will use it as an opportunity to broadcast his views in a land that prides itself on a social model that discourages radicalism. The central issue facing the court is to determine his .If Mr. Breivik is found to have been sane when he carried out the killings, the presiding judges can sentence him to up to 21 years in prison, with a provision to keep him behind bars longer if he is still considered dangerous. If found insane, Mr. Breivik can be kept in forced psychiatric care for as long as his illness persists.Two court-ordered psychiatric reports have reached contradictory conclusions. The first, in November, determined that Mr. Breivik was a paranoid schizophrenic before, during and after the attacks. The second, on April 10, said he was sane, albeit with a .A saturation of news media coverage since the attacks has left many Norwegians wanting to see less of Mr. Breivik. Dagbladet, the country’s second-largest daily newspaper, has even introduced a Breivik-free version of its Web site for the duration of the trial.'"

Liu, who is to announce the agreement on Monday. The public pension funds, whose assets exceed $118 billion, have large stakes in Goldman and MetLife.“Studies have shown the benefits of a diverse work force on company performance and long-term shareowner value, and many companies say they are making serious efforts to recruit, retain and promote women and minorities,” said Mr. Liu, who is a trustee of the pension funds. “But without quantitative disclosure, shareholders have no way to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts.”New York City has the highest concentration of high-paying jobs in finance and advertising of any city in the country and maybe in the world. But those industries have been slower than others to move minorities and women into their management ranks, studies have shown.Big employers are required to report data to the federal government on their efforts to provide equal employment opportunities, but many do not make those numbers available to the public.'"

"'12-04-16,'1','CAIRO — Candidates in Egypt’s presidential race scrambled Sunday to find their footing in an increasingly slippery field as new questions emerged about whether Hosni Mubarak’s former spy chief would be allowed to compete.A day after the presidential election commission knocked out of the race three of the five front-runners on various technical grounds — with just over a month until the voting begins — on Sunday it clarified that it had disqualified the former intelligence chief, Omar Suleiman, because he had fallen just 31 short of the 30,000 notarized statements of endorsements required to enter the race. It was unclear whether his campaign would be allowed to make up the difference.The suspense about Mr. Suleiman’s eligibility added a combustible new element to the doubts about the credibility of the electoral process that were sown by the electoral commission’s sweeping decision on Saturday night to strike him from the race along with two leading Islamists, Khairat el-Shater, the leading strategist of the Muslim Brotherhood, and Hazem Salah Abu Ismail, the standard-bearer for ultraconservative Islamists.In a race dominated by Islamists on one side and the more secular former officials of the Mubarak government on the other, Saturday’s announcement had appeared at least evenhanded by tossing out the most polarizing contenders in both camps. But the potential return of Mr. Suleiman, 75, upends that balance. Instead, it returns the Islamist movements to the state of high anxiety set off by his last-minute entry into the race just one week ago. He was virtually Mr. Mubarak’s alter ego, frank about his view that Egypt was not ready for democracy, and outspokenly hostile to the Islamists now dominating Parliament and competing for the presidency.Mr. Suleiman stands more clearly for a restoration of the old order than any other former Mubarak government official now re-entering politics. And he has deep ties to the intelligence services — his campaign manager is his former chief of staff in the spy service and has begun running the campaign from its headquarters — raising fears that its officials might revive Mubarak-era practices like bugging candidates’ offices and rigging elections.'"
"'12-04-16,'1','The Angels won the World Series in 2002, and since then they have won five division titles without another pennant. If Pujols brings a second championship to a franchise now 51 years old, his contract will be worth it. At least for the first half of the deal, the Angels seem poised to do it.“I’ll worry about the second half if we win a championship,” said Jerry Dipoto, the Angels’ general manager. “We’re here every day to find the right combination of players to give us the best chance to do just that. And we’re a better team with Albert Pujols on our club. We’re a better team this year; we’re a better team next year. Baseball is such that we’ll measure Years 5, 6 and 8 when those years come.”Dipoto pitched eight seasons in the majors without reaching the playoffs. He came up with Cleveland but was traded in 1994, a year before the Indians reached the World Series. They got back in 1997, but never won.Just one ring would have validated the Indians’ core of overwhelming talent — Albert Belle, Kenny Lofton, Jim Thome, Manny Ramirez — and meant so much to Cleveland. But it never came, so the legacy is incomplete.The Yankees of the Rodriguez era should always be considered a success. Even one championship is that important. Yes, the early Derek Jeter years brought four World Series victories from 1996 through 2000. But the further we get from those years, the more we should appreciate how special — how unusual — that was.In the 11 years since then, nine teams have taken turns as champions. That is the nature of the postseason, which will expand this season from 8 to 10 participants. Winning becomes harder and harder.“It’s rare, man,” said Torii Hunter, the veteran Angels outfielder. “My whole career, I’ve been in the playoffs six or seven times — I don’t know for sure — and I’ve fallen short every time. For me, I just want to jump up and down on that field. I’m tired of sitting at home and watching these other guys doing it, and I got kicked out.”Pujols’s Cardinals made three World Series, winning two, since the Angels’ last appearance. The Angels imported him largely for business reasons, but also because he can help them do better in October.Yet the length of his deal — which was recently matched by the Cincinnati Reds’ commitment to first baseman Joey Votto — was the subject of the first question to Pujols when he met with reporters on Friday. How will these contracts look, he was asked, when the players inevitably decline?“I wish I could tell you,” Pujols said. “I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future.”The Angels think they do. They believe Pujols will continue to produce at an extraordinary level, because of his extraordinary skill.“Albert Pujols does things a little bit different, even than the most accomplished hitters,” Dipoto said. “He has the strike-zone control of a hit-for-average, contact guy, and he has the power of an elite power hitter of all time. To combine those two, I don’t know why he wouldn’t age better than most. It’s something we’re looking at as an advantage that he’s here for 10 years, and it’s something that we want.”Hunter said it made sense to sign Pujols for a decade, because he can shift to designated hitter halfway through the contract. As a first baseman, Hunter said, Pujols does not ask as much of his body as a third baseman like Rodriguez, who was also a base-stealing threat when he signed.“A-Rod’s a better athlete,” Hunter said, comparing Rodriguez with first basemen. “That’s probably why he’s more scrutinized, because he got a 10-year deal as an athlete, and then you’re going to see his athletic ability go down. When you’re at first base, all you’ve got to do is hit. But when you’re an athlete, you know he’s going to decline.”When that decline accelerates, it might be hard for the Yankees to write those lavish paychecks to Rodriguez. But could you imagine the anxiety around this team if it had not won the 2009 championship?'"
"'12-04-16,'1','At the behest of New York City’s public pension funds, two of the biggest financial companies with headquarters in the city, Goldman Sachs and MetLife, have agreed to publicly disclose information about the racial and gender breakdowns of their staffs.The disclosures could lead to changes that would benefit shareholders of those companies, as well as their current and future employees, said the city’s comptroller, John C. Liu, who is to announce the agreement on Monday. The public pension funds, whose assets exceed $118 billion, have large stakes in Goldman and MetLife.“Studies have shown the benefits of a diverse work force on company performance and long-term shareowner value, and many companies say they are making serious efforts to recruit, retain and promote women and minorities,” said Mr. Liu, who is a trustee of the pension funds. “But without quantitative disclosure, shareholders have no way to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts.”New York City has the highest concentration of high-paying jobs in finance and advertising of any city in the country and maybe in the world. But those industries have been slower than others to move minorities and women into their management ranks, studies have shown.Big employers are required to report data to the federal government on their efforts to provide equal employment opportunities, but many do not make those numbers available to the public.'"
"'12-04-16,'1','“There’s been a major acceleration the last few years,” said Rod Risley, executive director of Phi Theta Kappa, the honor society.It’s partly the economic collapse. The Community College of Philadelphia costs $4,400 a year for city residents; the most expensive private colleges are $60,000. Getting an associate degree first can save $100,000.“These students are choosing community colleges with the intention that this is their path to selective institutions,” Mr. Risley said.He had no trouble providing names. Casey Maliszewski went from Raritan Valley Community College in to Mount Holyoke, and she is now a graduate student at Columbia. Tamer Shabani also went to Raritan and is at Stanford. Mark Svensson transferred from Rockland Community College to Georgetown.Indeed, one of my own sons graduated from our local community college and in January entered New York University as a junior.For elite schools, community colleges offer racial and economic diversity; the college here is 55 percent black. “Colleges are looking for high completion levels, and the best community college students complete,” Mr. Risley said.Since 2005, the Jack Kent Cooke Foundation has given 400 scholarships of up to $30,000 a year to outstanding community college students to continue their studies. Those students have gone on to average a 3.5 G.P.A. and a 90 percent completion rate, according to Emily Froimson, a spokeswoman.The foundation also gives up to $1 million to four-year institutions to recruit community college graduates. Among the colleges and universities that have been chosen are the ; ; ; the ; the University of North Carolina; and Bryn Mawr.Most of the nine here who have been accepted by Bryn Mawr have had their struggles. Taj Meyer had an and did not make it through high school. Neither did Adrienne Baugher, who battled addiction. Remi Demarest left home as a girl and was raised by an aunt and uncle. Meg Booth is a single mother.They range in age from Mary Chessen, 21, who transferred from the , to Kimberly Stuart, who is 38 and was working as a film grip when she started here in 2007.Lija Geller flunked out of Temple and was embarrassed to be going here. “I’d get off the subway at Garden,” she said. “The Temple kids stay on to the Cecil B. Moore stop. It felt like they knew I went to community college.”Ms. Booth and Ms. Baugher have supported themselves by working as waitresses; Ms. Geller spent a year and a half as a dog walker; Ms. Demarest was a receptionist at a nail salon. “I wanted a second chance,” she said, “which is what a community college gives you.”Bryn Mawr had not occurred to them. “Not even in my realm of thought,” said Ms. Baugher, who will major in biology.In the two decades after graduating from Central High School in Philadelphia, Mr. Thomas worked a series of clerical and administrative jobs.Starting college at 36, he was hungry for knowledge. He was always a big reader — Shakespeare, , Richard N. Wright, Ralph W. Ellison. But not until he took an African-American studies course did he understand how little he knew of , Booker T. Washington, James Weldon Johnson. “I was ashamed when I realized,” he said.People have told him that majoring in education would be a waste of an degree, but his goal is to return to Central High and teach American history.It was his developmental professor, Vince Castronuovo, who first put the idea of the University of Pennsylvania in his head. “He told me it’s the place for a guy like you.”Mr. Thomas was in one of the college’s computer centers on March 27 when he got the e-mail saying he had been accepted.He has been chosen to deliver a speech at his graduation next month, and he recently finished a first draft. A lot of it will be about what determination and the right support can do for a person.For weeks he has been looking for a part-time job, even for minimum wage. Last week he interviewed at an shop, but he has not heard anything yet.He still doesn’t own a computer, but he thinks he’ll be getting one for graduation. It’s supposed to be a surprise, but his aunt let it slip that she didn’t know how anyone could make it through college without one.'"
"'12-04-16,'1','Prosecutors will most likely ask Mr. Zazi and Mr. Ahmedzay to describe in an open courtroom the full narrative of their plot, including their recruitment to terror training camps abroad, the weapons training they received, and their instructions from senior members of Al Qaeda, judging from questions that prosecutors asked others in pretrial evidentiary hearings.“Compared to other cases, the Zazi plot had more indicators of serious terrorism than almost any case we’ve seen since 9/11, and before that since the first attack on the World Trade Center,” said Karen J. Greenberg, a terrorism expert at Fordham University School of Law.“The Zazi case is qualitatively different in terms of the nature of the indictment and the details.”In this case, the details are filled with classified information — Mr. Medunjanin was under surveillance, according to court documents — and the prosecution has withheld much of its evidence from public view. The charging papers, which in most cases provide a basic narrative for the alleged crime, list the counts against the defendant but little additional information about the plot.Prosecutors said Mr. Medunjanin was arrested on the Whitestone Bridge in January 2010 after deliberately crashing his car into another vehicle, in a failed suicide attack. Moments earlier, he had called 911 and spoken what prosecutors called a common jihadist motto: “We love death more than you love your life,” court documents say.Many of the pretrial motions, in which the prosecution and the defense argued over what evidence could be admitted at trial, remain under seal.But an evidentiary hearing last year yielded clues about what testimony to expect. A federal judge ruled that the government could admit statements that Mr. Medunjanin made after his arrest, over objections from his lawyer, Robert C. Gottlieb, who argued that Mr. Medunjanin had waived his Miranda rights only because the government had denied him access to a lawyer.In the statements, Mr. Medunjanin told members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force that he saw himself as a prisoner of war who had been caught on the battlefield. He asked if he could be exchanged for a United States soldier captured by the Taliban, law enforcement officials said in the hearing.Mr. Medunjanin, a naturalized American citizen who was born in Bosnia, also lectured the officials on religion and tried to convert them to Islam, the officials said. They said he admitted to receiving daily religious training in Pakistan and learning how to fire handguns, shoulder-fired weapons and hand grenades in a Qaeda training camp.Mr. Medunjanin was evasive when it came to talking about the attacks in New York, officials said. He told the officials that he had declined the request of senior members of Al Qaeda to carry out the attack because he did not want to commit suicide.Mr. Gottlieb said Mr. Medunjanin was not guilty.During the hearing, an official also mentioned a confidential informer who was with the three men in Pakistan and helped them gain entry to the training camp. It is not clear whether that confidential informant will testify.Bryant Neal Vinas, a New Yorker who converted to Islam and who has pleaded guilty to receiving training from Al Qaeda after traveling to Pakistan in 2008, is cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and could also testify in the case, according to prosecutors.Federal agents were conducting covert surveillance of the mastermind in the plot, Mr. Zazi, before the attacks were to be carried out. But federal officials did not know the full scope of the conspiracy when Mr. Zazi was arrested in September 2009; a Police Department informer had tipped off Mr. Zazi that he was under investigation.There were divisions between the F.B.I. and the Police Department in the early days of the investigation as a result; federal agents were concerned that the police had exposed the investigation.Investigators later pieced together the case after a series of raids and arrests.In August 2008, Mr. Medunjanin traveled with Mr. Zazi and Mr. Ahmedzay from Newark to Peshawar, Pakistan, with the goal of joining the Taliban and fighting against American soldiers in Afghanistan, according to court documents. Unable to reach the fight, the men were instead recruited by two senior Qaeda members.“We told these two individuals that we wanted to wage jihad in Afghanistan, but they said that we would be more useful to them and to the jihad if we returned to New York and conducted operations there,” Mr. Ahmedzay said later in court, when he pleaded guilty in April 2010.Mr. Medunjanin and Mr. Ahmedzay returned to New York from Pakistan. Mr. Zazi moved to Colorado.Prosecutors say that in August 2009, Mr. Zazi told the group’s Qaeda contact that the suicide plot was operational. Officials said he had spent the summer visiting beauty supply stores in the Denver area and buying gallons of hydrogen peroxide and acetone, which the group planned to use in making bombs. In September, Mr. Zazi drove from Denver to New York with a detonator and his supplies.Then a police informer, Ahmad Wais Afzali, a Queens imam, told Mr. Zazi that he was being watched by law enforcement, so Mr. Zazi abandoned the plan and returned to Colorado. (Mr. Afzali later pleaded guilty to lying to federal authorities about his role in the incident, and was deported.)Mr. Zazi’s visit to New York set off government raids on several homes in Queens and Colorado connected to Mr. Zazi, including the homes where Mr. Medunjanin and Mr. Ahmedzay were living with relatives.Mr. Zazi was arrested in Colorado in September, but months passed before the arrests of Mr. Medunjanin and Mr. Ahmedzay in January 2010. In February 2010, Mr. Zazi pleaded guilty to several terrorism charges, and admitted in court that he had been a part of a “martyrdom operation.” Mr. Ahmedzay pleaded guilty two months later. The men have not yet been sentenced.Mr. Medunjanin is charged with conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction and commit murder abroad, providing material support to Al Qaeda, and receiving military training from Al Qaeda, among other counts. He faces life in prison if convicted.'"
"'12-04-16,'1','AMONG the most popular tools for attracting foreign investment to the United States is the EB-5 program. It seems like the perfect win-win: any foreigner who invests between $500,000 and $1 million here, and creates at least 10 domestic jobs from that investment within two years, gets a green card.Given how many high-worth investors are clamoring to enter the United States, the program could have a significant effect on American unemployment. Indeed, it has brought in some $1 billion over the last fiscal year, and the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness has called for the program to be “radically” expanded over the next few years.Unfortunately, the program is so rife with fraud and corruption that it could actually have the opposite impact and deter investment. To regain its credibility, the program must make a number of changes to enable more transparency and demand more competence from its operators.The most egregious problems with the EB-5 program can be found in its 218 regional centers, which work with private-sector brokers to identify local investments and direct foreign participants to them. Examples abound of centers and brokers playing down risky investments and misrepresenting how the program works, including a promise that EB-5 investments are guaranteed by the federal government — when the government in fact does nothing of the sort. Many investments have failed to create the required 10 jobs and even gone bankrupt, leaving the investor without his money or his green card.While many EB-5 regional centers have solid records, a disturbing number have directed investor money to risky projects and companies that pay little to no return, overseen by brokers who get a commission regardless of how the investment plays out.Aside from accusations of outright fraud, there is also a clear lack of understanding among government administrators about how to manage an investment program. As a result, they often approve businesses that are simple to understand, like a condo development or a grocery store, but whose business models don’t generate enough profit to hire workers, while rejecting more sophisticated businesses that stand a greater potential of generating profits and jobs.'"
"'12-04-16,'1','PHILADELPHIA — The Mets entered Citizens Bank Park on Friday with a two-game losing streak, David Wright injured and the heart of their lineup struggling. They faced a three-game series against the Phillies, who have won five consecutive National League East crowns and were sending Cliff Lee and Cole Hamels to the mound during the weekend.So even after the Mets’ 8-2 loss on Sunday, there was not widespread gloom lingering throughout the visitors’ clubhouse. They had hoped for their first sweep in Philadelphia since 2006, but after winning the first two games and carrying a lead into the seventh inning on Sunday, the Mets accepted reality. They are now 6-3 and have Wright in the lineup and Ike Davis finally hitting.“If you had come to me Thursday or Friday before the game and said, ‘Hey, you guys will take two out of three,’ I think we’d be happy with it,” Mets starter Mike Pelfrey said. “Obviously, we came and won the first two, and it changed to ‘Let’s win all three.’ That didn’t work out and obviously we’re disappointed, but you got to keep it in perspective.”The Mets came within three innings of completing the sweep. In each game of the series, they were aided by a first-inning home run. Sunday’s came from Davis, the promising first baseman who entered the game with an .071 batting average and without a run batted in.Davis turned on Hamels’s first-pitch cutter and sent it into the right-field stands. His home run drove in Wright, who had two hits and now has five hits in nine at-bats since returning Saturday from a fractured right pinkie that sidelined him for three games.'"
"'12-04-16,'1','For the Hungarian conductor Ivan Fischer the unexpected is the norm. Among other experiments, Mr. Fischer likes to test unusual seating plans with the Budapest Festival Orchestra, which he helped to found and directs, and other orchestras, to alter balances and bring out intriguing details, especially those involving woodwinds.So it was something of a surprise, when he conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke’s in Mozart’s Symphony No. 34 in C at Carnegie Hall on Thursday evening, that the seating was mostly conventional. The only real eccentricity I could make out from my vantage point was a forward placement of one bassoonist.But Mr. Fischer made up for that in the second half of the program, consisting of Mozart’s Requiem. Here many of the female members of the chorus, Musica Sacra, were strewn among the orchestra, and the vocal soloists took places surrounded by choristers.The purpose seemed not so much to rebalance the sound directly as to involve all the performers in one another’s business. In particular, Mr. Fischer had explained in a note to the orchestra, he wanted to involve everyone in the work’s texts.“My main purpose,” he wrote, “is that instead of mechanical instructions, like play this note long and the other one short, instrumentalists should also experience the text, playing, and in a creative and organized way, declaiming with the singers.” Players in Mozart’s day, he noted, would have been familiar with the words; not necessarily so today.But there was also a significant rebalancing within the orchestra. The two basset horns (essentially lowish clarinets) and two bassoons, the only woodwinds in the work, were placed front and center, right before Mr. Fischer, giving the basset horns, especially, enhanced prominence.'"

"'12-04-16,'1','“The Syrian government was forced to accept those observers,” said Abu Abdu, a 30-year-old Syrian interviewed in downtown Damascus. “I think this mission will be the last opportunity for a peaceful and political solution to the Syrian crisis.”Another man, Mohamed, a 25-year-old student, said an embattled province like Dara’a, where the uprising started in March 2011, would probably need 50 observers alone to follow all the violence in the various hamlets. “The Annan plan has six points, and we want to see the implementation of the six, not a partial cease-fire,” he said.Reports from around Syria suggested that the cease-fire that went into effect on Thursday was holding in places, with notable exceptions.A video posted online said to have been shot Sunday in the central Khaldiya neighborhood of Homs showed a building going up in flames soon after a shell exploded on it. The whizzing of shells roaring overhead could be heard every few minutes.In the north, government forces were shelling the village of Khirbet Jouz, aiming at a group of fighters from the Free Syrian Army there, said a statement for the Local Coordination Committees, an activist group.At least 10 Syrian civilians were killed, according to activist organizations. Those reports could not be independently confirmed.The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, a force within the Syrian National Council, the main umbrella group for the opposition, issued a statement saying that the Annan plan should not be open-ended, requiring a timetable for the political transition it envisions. “We stress that continuing to carry out Annan’s plan without a time limit while the other side maintains its killing and violations will be a means of mocking the lives of the Syrian people,” it said.As with every day since the cease-fire went into effect last Thursday, demonstrators in modest numbers took to the streets in towns and cities across Syria to demand the end of Mr. Assad’s rule.On Saturday, the United Nations Security Council voted unanimously to send an advance team of up to 30 military observers to begin monitoring the tenuous cease-fire. It was the first time since the Syrian uprising began 13 months ago that the Security Council was united in demanding a halt to the violence. Russia and China had either vetoed or sought to dilute previous such efforts.The resolution required Syria to withdraw its security forces from population centers and to begin a dialogue with the opposition, both key parts of the six-point plan designed to end more than a year of violence that has left at least 9,000 people dead, by the United Nations’ count.'"

"'12-04-17,'1','Years before “Everybody Loves Raymond” propelled Brad Garrett to stardom, he was a stand-up comedian opening for Frank Sinatra in Las Vegas. He capped his warm-up act on one particularly unresponsive night by deadpanning: “You’re a great audience. Stick around for Frank.”The Acting Company’s forceful, fine-boned revival of “Julius Caesar,” a co-production with the Guthrie Theater playing at the Baruch Performing Arts Center, evokes this memory as its Brutus (William Sturdivant) concludes his logically airtight but dry funeral oration with, “I do entreat you, not a man depart,/Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.”As played by the barrel-chested Zachary Fine, this Mark Antony is “a plain blunt man” who shares with Sinatra a plebeian knack for channeling and giving lucid voice to his listeners’ discontent. Mr. Garrett’s impolitic suggestion earned him a menacing dressing room visit from Sinatra’s right-hand man, Jilly Rizzo. After Antony’s fiery tribute, Brutus won’t be as lucky.The contrast between Brutus and Mark Antony — one in a professorial bow tie, one who can’t wait to shed his suit coat — isn’t particularly subtle, and neither is the rest of Rob Melrose’s staging. This modern-dress version features a smattering of “Occupy Rome” placards, as well as somber black suits by the yard. (At this point the most daring way to stage “Julius Caesar” would be in togas.)But while the packaging may be familiar, with its slow-motion fight scenes and its bank of talking-head television screens, the contents are consistently rewarding. For one thing, this is one of the most crisply spoken Shakespeares in recent memory; even the individual utterances of the fickle Roman mob come through loud and clear. (Andrew Wade, a Royal Shakespeare Company veteran, is the voice and speech consultant.) Mr. Melrose has pruned shrewdly from the text and added a nifty, unsentimental final image. He even keeps the use of letter openers in the assassination scene from being silly (or at least too silly).On its tours, the Acting Company frequently plays 2,000-seat theaters, and some performers haven’t sufficiently recalibrated for the relatively small Baruch space. But Mr. Sturdivant and Mr. Fine are well-matched opponents, and Sid Solomon (as an incongruously baby-faced Cassius) and Kevin Orton (as an unctuous Casca) are also fine.'"

"'12-04-17,'1','Jacob Smith, a senior at Kenyon College, says the College Board calculator used by Kenyon estimated his need-based aid within $200.Jaimie Ngyuen, a junior at Wesleyan University, which uses the Student Aid Services template, in real life received about $1,500 more in aid than the calculator indicated.Sophie Riedel, a freshman at Carnegie Mellon, encountered a bit of a stumbling block with the federal template on Carnegie Mellon’s Web site. It underestimated her grant money by about $1,500, but she still pays about $2,000 more than the calculator indicated. The reason: the “cost of attendance” delivered on the calculator under the header “Academic Year: 2009-10” was $4,000 short of her true cost of attendance.Though most colleges are sure to include a caveat alongside their calculators — that figures are merely estimates, not guarantees or formal agreements — experts say some tools may be misleading.Mr. Kantrowitz notes that a college may look deceptively affordable if it “front-loads” its grants, awarding a greater proportion to first-year students than to returning students. In this situation, net price will be lower for freshmen than in subsequent years.And as Ms. Riedel encountered, colleges that use the federal template may suffer from stale data, because the Department of Education does not update its data set immediately when institutions report their information. “Because of the nature of the federal aid program, you have to wait until the year is over,” says David Bergeron, a department official. “The institution can take snapshots of its own data while the year is still active” — so colleges that choose an alternative to the federal option are likely to be more up to date.Then there is the signature tension between accuracy and ease. Jeff Whorley, president of Student Aid Services, whose calculator can cost a college up to $20,000 annually, says the federal template is simply too bare-bones to be effective. “It’s free and it’s short,” he says. “Those are its attributes.” A Student Aid Services study of the federal template’s methodology, using actual student financial profiles, found that family contribution estimates were off by an average of $5,335.Whichever calculator they choose, administrators at expensive colleges hope the tools will attract students who might have disregarded them because of their listed tuition.“We’re hoping that ‘aha’ moment can happen earlier in the process,” says Daniel Lugo, dean of admission and financial aid at Franklin and Marshall College, whose total cost is estimated at $58,880 on the College Board calculator.“Sticker price has a real chilling effect on people even looking further.”He expects the tools to spark “inter-institutional competition” as administrators figure out how to present their costs most attractively through the calculators. A college, for instance, can tweak its costs — of textbooks, transportation, personal expenses and even room and board.Nancy Coolidge, a policy and legislative analyst at the University of California campuses, says a rival decided to include only two meals a day in its estimate of room-and-board costs, reasoning that most students did not wake up in time for breakfast. Administrators at the University of California, meanwhile, weathered a “very big controversy,” she says, over whether to include snacks — or any food purchases made outside of school dining facilities — in its room-and-board estimate. (They did.)Inconsistencies have left some families skeptical. “Be wary,” one commenter posted this winter on the Web site College Confidential, under the account name “perilous.”One university, though, may have oversold its munificence. In a post dated Oct. 30, the day after calculators were required to appear under the law, a parent posted the results of one calculator’s findings. Estimated total price: $18,500. Estimated total grant aid: $77,700. Estimated net price: negative $59,200.“Although I like the numbers,” she wrote, “somehow I don’t think it’s quite accurate.”'"

Given the continuing corruption investigation that could implicate him, he is unlikely to return to China anytime soon.“I think the options for him look pretty bad,” said Roderick MacFarquhar, a China expert at Harvard who has written about the purges that dot contemporary Chinese history.The details of Mr. Bo’s life were remarkably public. He appeared on a Chinese talk show to discuss his family and allowed himself to be photographed partying bare-chested and with young women.A short-lived relationship with Chen Xiaodan, the granddaughter of another Communist Party pioneer, became fodder for the public after the pair was photographed vacationing in , trailed by a sizable police escort.His celebrity stood in marked contrast to the lives of other descendants of revolutionaries. Xi Mingze — the daughter of , presumed to be China’s next top leader — also attends Harvard, but under an assumed name, and she does not have a account.Last month, a few days before he lost his job as party chief of Chongqing, Bo Xilai was forced to respond to questions about how his modest government salary could support his son’s tuition and expensive tastes. He called the accusations “sheer rubbish,” and insisted that Mr. Bo had won full scholarships, although he did not address the allegations in detail. “A few people have been pouring filth on Chongqing and me and my family,” he told reporters. “They even say my son studies abroad and drives a red Ferrari.”But Mr. Bo does study abroad, and American officials say he arrived in a red Ferrari last year to pick up the American ambassador to China’s daughter for a date. Classmates at Harvard say they have seen him driving around in a .Mr. Bo has lately been staying out of public view, having changed his Facebook account to make it much more private, and he declined to answer questions last week as he left his apartment in , Mass. Those who know him say he has been studying for final exams while coping with his parents’ troubles.In interviews, many of his friends rejected the notion that he was a playboy or a poor student, and they described him as exceedingly generous. He is quick to pick up a bar tab, they said, and he liberally handed out tickets for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. “His concern for China and its people is deep-rooted and real,” said one friend in China who spends time with him during his frequent visits home. “He’s a big thinker. When he gets drunk, he talks about important things.”Mr. Bo was largely shaped by his years in . When he arrived, at age 12, he failed to get into Harrow, a boarding school with $45,000 annual tuition at the time. Although he told a Chinese magazine in 2009 that he spent a year studying for the Harrow entrance exam, Mr. Heywood, an old Harrovian, told friends he used his influence to land Mr. Bo a place at the school.Mr. Bo became the first Chinese citizen at the 500-year-old institution, and by most accounts, he flourished. He took up fencing, became president of the equestrian club and developed proper English manners.In 2006, he arrived at Oxford’s Balliol College, known for its lumbering lawn tortoises and its illustrious alumni, including Aldous Huxley, Adam Smith and Herbert Asquith, a British prime minister who once described Balliol men as having “the tranquil consciousness of an effortless superiority.”Oxford administrators dismissed the idea that Bo Xilai’s stature as a rising political star played any role in his son’s admission. “That kind of stuff just doesn’t happen,” said Ruth Collier, Oxford’s head of information. “If this young man won a place at Balliol, he got in on his merits.”Mr. Bo pursued a degree in politics, philosophy and economics, and embraced a more public profile, appearing in the Chinese version of Esquire and earning the Big Ben Award as one of the top 10 young Chinese in Britain.According to a friend from his Oxford days, Mr. Bo became known for his “professional socializing,” which included organizing a Silk Road ball for the Oxford Union, the university’s premier debating society. Mr. Bo tapped into his extensive connections by arranging an appearance by the actor and financial sponsorship from a minibus manufacturer in Liaoning Province, where his father had served as governor.He also demonstrated some of his father’s political drive when, in his second year, he ran for union librarian, a post equivalent to vice president. It was an all-consuming effort, friends say, and Mr. Bo broke with the tradition of low-key politicking by actively canvassing for votes on Cornmarket Street, a pedestrian boulevard in an area surrounded by Oxford colleges. He also ruffled some feathers, according to several Oxford students, by asking Chinese students to join the union so they could vote for him. The campaign was unsuccessful.While adept at throwing memorable parties, Mr. Bo was struggling with his coursework. After the union campaign, his professors forced him to take a set of exams known as “penal collections.” He failed, several students said, and was suspended for a year. Barred from using campus facilities, he moved into the Randolph, a Victorian Gothic hotel where he continued to hold parties, though a friend said they were more subdued.His family was not pleased. Using their connections, they reportedly sent a group of emissaries, including the Chinese ambassador, to plead Mr. Bo’s case to the master of Balliol, one faculty member said. Expulsion, it was explained, would cause his family grave embarrassment.Although the request was denied, Mr. Bo was allowed to take his final exams a year later and passed with respectable marks, “much to people’s surprise,” one professor said. Mr. Bo’s tutors remained unimpressed and refused to write him recommendations for his application to Harvard.But Mr. Bo was admitted to the John F. Kennedy School of Government, where tuition and living expenses can cost $90,000 a year. Administrators do not disclose information on scholarships and would not comment on whether Mr. Bo’s family connections played a role in his admission. But a spokesman said the school considers a “holistic” approach to applicants, weighing factors like leadership potential and a commitment to public service.Although one classmate described Mr. Bo as academically lackadaisical, others suggested that he had become more serious about his studies. Last year, he helped organize a China trip for Kennedy School students that included a visit to Chongqing. “From my interactions with him, leaving aside all the gossip, he is a smart lad,” one professor said. “He seems to be a typical British public school product: smart, headstrong and self-confident.”Despite the flashes of bravado, friends say that Mr. Bo is acutely aware that in China, the benefits of an illustrious family name can also be a detriment. His grandfather Bo Yibo was a revolutionary hero, but that did not shield him from the purges that sent him and much of his family to jail. “I have never met my grandmother because she was persecuted to death during the Cultural Revolution,” he said in a speech at Peking University in 2009.In a interview that year with Youth Weekend, a state-run Chinese newspaper, he reflected on the other challenges of his pedigree. “When I do well, it is naturally through my own efforts. When I do wrong, I should bear the consequences and do not want the blame to fall on my parents,” he said. “Although I am fully aware that my father is a good man, I do not wish to live under his shadow.”'"

Verlander ended up throwing 131 pitches while improving to 14-2 in his career against the Royals.NATIONALS 6, ASTROS 3 Stephen Strasburg pitched six innings to earn his second win for host Washington. Strasburg looked nearly unhittable for five innings, allowing only three singles, before the Astros got to him in the sixth for two runs and three hits.CLEMENS IN COURT As the group of 90 prospective jurors filed into the courtroom of United States District Court in Washington, Roger Clemens swiveled his chair so he could see them. He watched them push open the heavy wooden doors to enter the cavernous room, then stared as they took their seats on long wooden benches. The only sign that he was even the least bit nervous was that he repeatedly clicked a ballpoint pen with his right hand.Mostly, though, Clemens looked as cool as he did nine months ago at the start of his first trial on charges of lying to Congress about his use of steroids and human growth hormone.Most potential jurors were just as unemotional when questioned about the case, which involves charges of perjury, making false statements and obstruction of Congress. One said: “I don’t follow professional sports. I don’t know any professional sports figures.”Another was asked how she felt about steroid use in sports. “I don’t really care,” she said.Some jurors, though, knew so much about the case that the judge, Reggie Walton, dismissed them. Only seven, fewer than half of the jurors personally questioned, were chosen to be among the 36 jurors the court needs to proceed to final jury selection.At least two potential jurors said they had heard that Walton had declared a mistrial last year because prosecutors showed the jury inadmissible evidence.The government has dedicated even more resources to the case this time. Three more lawyers from the United States Attorney’s office in Washington were added to the prosecution team, which includes the two lawyers who were involved in the mistrial.“I think it reaffirms that the government is concerned about winning given the stakes and given the amount of money that has been spent on this case,” Michael McCann, a professor at Vermont Law School.

"'12-04-17,'1','Nearly one in five filers now receive the credit — about 28 million returns in the 2010 tax year, the most recent year figures are available — representing the highest percentage since the program began in the 1970s, according to the Brookings Institution.The effect has been significant. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group based in Washington, estimates the credit lifted about six million Americans out of poverty last year.“We find clear evidence that the E.I.T.C. has significantly reduced poverty rates and income inequality,” said Raj Chetty, an economist at Harvard who has studied the subsidy’s effect across cities. “The program is pulling up the lower end of the income distribution.”The credit also seems to have an important psychological side effect: It makes people feel middle class.“You get this feeling of, ‘Hey, I’m like them now,’ “ said Wesley Rouse, 27, a property manager in Durham.But the boost is often temporary. Many people who receive the credit fall back into poverty over the course of the year, caught in the same cycle of low-wage work and reliance on credit that put them there in the first place.One problem is the form the credit takes. The refund can pay as much as 40 percent of a family’s annual income at once, a windfall that many experts are now arguing should be changed by paying the refund in installments over the year.“It’s feast or famine,” said Mae Watson Grote, director of the Financial Clinic, a New York-based group that teaches financial planning to low-income New Yorkers. “It’s very hard to manage when it’s a windfall.”That cycle has the natural force of a tide at National Pawn, a shop in a working-class area of north Raleigh.“We’re all cleaned out,” said Sundeep Joshi, the store’s manager, waving his hand toward empty shelves, reflecting a whirlwind of recent purchases. But people will start to bring things back to sell as their budgets get squeezed, he said. By July, the back room is usually packed with pawned items. “That’s the story every year,” he said.Kathryn Edin, a professor of public policy at Harvard whose coming book, “It’s Not Like I’m Poor: How Working Families Make Ends Meet in a Post-Welfare World,” finds that recipients spent the subsidy overwhelmingly on bills and current expenses. Less than 10 percent of the money paid out was saved, she found. “The E.I.T.C. is one of the best social policies we’ve ever devised, but it does not solve the fundamental problem that you still can’t live on your wages,” she said.For Ms. Spain, the subsidy was a lifeline. Together with other tax credits, it pushed her family income up to about $27,000, above the federal poverty threshold of $22,800 for a family of four in 2011. (Her husband, an unemployed cook, did not earn much income.)But the money went fast. Rent ate up a third. Then came brakes and a new bumper for her 1998 Honda Civic. She paid the overdue electricity bill, reactivated her car insurance and bought some new clothes for her two girls, ages 8 and 9.“You get these large sums, but you have to repair things, and pay back rent, and you owe on all your bills,” Ms. Spain said. “I’m not at the point where I can put $500 aside and just let it sit there and grow.”That economic vulnerability has spawned an industry of lenders who hawk short-term loans at exorbitant rates to tide people over until tax time, said Peter Skillern, executive director of Reinvestment Partners, a nonprofit organization in Durham that helps low-income families file their taxes. The practice, known as “refund anticipation lending,” was effectively banned by federal regulators this month, but low-income filers still face an abundance of rip-off schemes and high tax preparation fees, he said.“It’s ‘What can I get today versus what’s coming tomorrow,’ “ said Brenda Dozier, a payroll specialist who said her sister has relied on refund anticipation loans. “I tell people, ‘You made it this far, just hold on.’ “Ms. Spain said she paid a company $550 to do her taxes last year so she could get them — and the refund — back fast, an expenditure she now regrets.The credit may not permanently change people’s circumstances, but researchers are finding evidence that many who receive it do not do so for very long. One recent study found that 60 percent of those who got the benefit stopped claiming it after two years. That is because people’s finances tend to be fluid, moving them in and out of the program, said John Horowitz, an economist at Ball State University in Indiana, one of the authors of the study, which examined tax records from 1989 to 2006. One in two American families with children received the credit at least once during that period, he said.Ms. Spain yearns for a time when she will no longer be eligible for the credit because she is earning more money. She remembers wistfully her former job at Nortel that paid $85,000 a year and the feeling of going to a restaurant or a movie without worrying about her budget.“Someday we’ll wait and file in April,” she said. “And if we need money before then, we’ll just go to the bank.”'"
"'12-04-17,'1','Still, he told me, “airlines like Spirit are surprising a lot of people, showing that you can be profitable doing things differently and with really low fares and a range of fees” along with minimal customer service.“Spirit shows you can be profitable even if people don’t like you,” I suggested.A few weeks ago, at the annual Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport International Aviation Symposium, Ben Baldanza, the scrappy chief executive of Spirit, was beaming with optimism.“The people who fly us get it,” Mr. Baldanza said. Consolidation and capacity reduction by the major airlines open new niches and “create an opportunity for full-service airlines to distinguish themselves better in markets they service, and for more commodity-pricing-based airlines like Spirit to come in and provide an alternative,” he said.It seems to me that Mr. Baldanza has put his finger on a new reality in our rapidly changing commercial air travel system: You get what you pay for.Whether new low-cost, low-fare airlines emerge (and no one I know thinks this is likely), the major airlines have been changing fundamental strategies that they put in place a decade ago, when domestic air travel became basically a commodity.Now the major airlines are engaged in efforts to “distinguish themselves better,” as Mr. Baldanza put it.Major airlines now “are putting money back into the customer experience, spending money on more comfortable seats,” said Jonathan Kletzel, a transportation logistics expert at PricewaterhouseCoopers. “They’re refitting existing cabins and making a ton of new aircraft purchases.”As the industry reshapes itself amid declining competitive pressures, some airlines have the opportunity to rebrand parts of themselves in a higher-premium niche, said Paul D’Alessandro, the customer service expert at Pricewaterhouse. Major airlines have been adding higher-price premium seating in domestic coach sections while inventing customer services aimed at the business travel coach consumer who is willing to pay a little more for a better flying experience.Mr. D’Alessando and Mr. Kletzel are co-authors of an interesting PwC report, “Experience Radar 2012: Customer Insights for the U.S. Airline Industry.” In it, they present what they call “a clear pathway to stability and growth for those airlines willing to set a new course.”Eventually, “a cluster of airlines will be able to focus more on human service,” Mr. D’Alessandro said. “I believe that two or three years out, the pendulum will swing” toward better service, even at a higher price than basic coach service.I will explore their findings more in a future column. But we will also explore whether corporate travel managers are willing to change course, too, and start reimbursing business travelers who opt for more service, even if it costs $50 or $75 more.“I’m seeing airlines studying this,” Mr. D’Alessandro said of the various options being offered, at a price, to make travel slightly more comfortable. Airlines, he said, realize that “some of these amenities are now being paid for out of pocket” by business travelers who need the extra room and added convenience.'"
"'12-04-17,'1','Researchers have found further experimental evidence that inadequate sleep can increase the risk of obesity and diabetes. A five-week study showed that sleep disruption decreases insulin secretion, increases blood glucose levels and slows metabolism enough to lead to significant weight gain.Scientists kept 24 male and female volunteers in a sleep laboratory for 39 days. After an initial period of normal sleep, the volunteers were put on a schedule by which they slept for 5.6 hours and were kept awake for 21.5 hours, for three weeks. Then the participants had nine days to re-establish normal sleep patterns.Disturbed sleep resulted in a 27 percent average decrease in insulin secretion after eating, and higher glucose levels over a longer period of time, sometimes high enough to make the subject prediabetic. In addition, there was an average 8 percent decrease in resting metabolism rate, a measure of how much energy the body consumes at rest, that translates into a theoretical weight gain of more than 12 pounds a year.Orfeu M. Buxton, the lead author and an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard, said the key for people who must work nights, or rapidly change time zones, is to “get better sleep during the day by sleeping in a dark, silent, cool room.”The study appeared last week in Science Translational Medicine.'"

Our intent was to give “Carrie” a second chance as a serious work and to introduce new young talent. It was a risk that we are proud to have taken. It was not a commercial venture.MCC will continue to take risks. We’re delighted when those risks produce great box office (or a future life), but we’re even more delighted when we spark a love of theater in new audiences and serious conversations after the curtain falls.

"'12-04-17,'1','“I think there’s this hook-up culture at Harvard where people assume that everyone’s having sex all the time, and that’s not necessarily true,” said Suzanna Bobadilla, a 21-year-old junior.Students here seemed less interested in debating the Republicans’ social agenda than in talking about how sexual mores related to their own lives. One event, “Hooking Up on Campus,” got participants talking about perceptions that have been built up about casual sex — for instance, the idea that all women are so liberated that they are happy to have sex without commitment (a theme that is examined in depth in the new HBO series “Girls“).The event had helped dispel that rumor, Ms. Bobadilla said, by presenting statistics showing that college students were having less sex than their predecessors and by “letting people come out with their own perspectives.”Such plain-spoken sex education is particularly important at a school like Harvard, she said, because “Harvard kids don’t want to admit they don’t know something that they feel like they should know.”As Sex Week has spread to more campuses, it has maintained a balancing act between matters of sexual health and pleasure. Unlike typical student-run college programs in the decades following the discovery of H.I.V./AIDS, the campus events go beyond instruction on safe sex, rape prevention and sexually transmitted diseases to giving advice on how to feel more comfortable and fulfilled sexually, all, at least in theory, in a judgment-free atmosphere that embraces all lifestyles. The idea is to give the sex education that schools cannot — or choose not to.“I think that what our generation is doing is really trying to address these issues in a way that respects individual experiences and beliefs and identities,” said Ms. Meier, 23, one of the two student organizers of Sex Week at Harvard. “And I see Sex Week as a part of that.”Sex Week began life at Yale as Kosher Sex Week, an idea that the Yale Hillel had for generating interest in the group. But as more clubs and the faculty got involved, “one faculty member threw out the idea, why does this have to be a Jewish event?” said Eric Rubenstein, one of the founders. The decision was made to drop the kosher angle, giving birth in 2002 to what was then called Campus-Wide Sex Week.”Everyone who was involved in it wanted it to be something relatable and real and challenging, and something that people have to consider,” said Mr. Rubenstein, 29, who now works as an oil strategist and trader for Citigroup. “It’s not just talking about your regular topics.”Sex education has always been a part of college, one way or another. And every generation of students has tried to fill perceived gaps in the formal curricula with their own initiatives, whether through the condom giveaways of the 1990s or the explosion of student sex columns — and even pornography magazines — in the last decade. Students call it education; parents and administrators may call it acting out.At Harvard’s first Sex Week, which ended March 31, there were panels on talking to your doctor about sex and on careers in sexual health, but also events about the ethics of pornography; sex and religion; kinky practices like bondage; and gay and lesbian sex. After every event, organizers raffled off vibrators.While some professors, chaplains and health care providers took part, the university itself was not a sponsor. At Yale, the name was changed this year from Sex Week at Yale to simply Sex Week because of administration pushback.Sex weeks have faced some opposition from colleges, alumni and students nearly everywhere they’ve been staged. Some people don’t like the idea of university resources being used to promote sexual activity. Others think the events promote an irresponsible, pleasure-first approach to sex.This year, a new group called Undergraduates for a Better Yale College began offering an alternative to Sex Week called True Love Week. In 2007, Chelsea Thompson, a Northwestern student who described herself as a Christian, formed a group called Women of Worth that hosted a spa night to give female students an alternative to Sex Week. According to the group’s blog, more than 100 women attended, including the entire softball team.“Education does not mean giving everybody every choice they could make,” said Isabel Marin, a member of Undergraduates for a Better Yale College. “It’s giving people the right information on how they should be pursuing relationships and sexual choices. It’s not a buffet.”But campus organizers say they are simply trying to acknowledge reality: that a lot of students have sex for the first time while they are in college, and this can muster many strong feelings and reactions.“College classes about sexuality are always fairly academic, they don’t necessarily reflect peoples’ personal experience,” said Aida Manduley, a chairwoman of Sex Week at Brown. “We try to balance out the situation.”In an era when explicit sexual materials are readily available by keystroke or remote control, some students found the week’s proceedings at Harvard surprisingly tame. Brenda Serpas, a freshman, attended a seminar called “Dirty Talk” and found it to be, well, not that dirty.“A lot of people just thought it was going to be tips on how to talk dirty,” she said, “but really it wasn’t. It was just like, being consensual and comfortable in expressing yourself with your partner.”Shana Kim, a sophomore, added: “That you have to have no shame. Be comfortable with yourself.”“And I think that’s what the whole week was about, basically,” Ms. Kim added. “Knowing what you want, knowing how to consent to what you want and allowing other people to do the same.”'"
"'12-04-17,'1','While these agents tend to have a bit of everything in their inventory a nice barn here, a classroom over there — their Web sites are filled mostly with houses and lofts, apartments and brownstones, all of them owned by people willing to let strangers stomp through the hallways and move around the furniture. In exchange, the owners receive a fee, which can range from $1,000 to $20,000 per day, depending on the project. The agent’s share varies, but a common arrangement is 25 percent of the homeowner’s fee. Most of the business comes directly from a shoot’s production team, and they are paid only when a deal is done.“I do it mostly because it’s free money, and because I have two kids who go to Saint Ann’s School,” said Ms. Williams-Adkins, referring to the costly private school in Brooklyn Heights. Her husband, she said, is a fine arts professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and she is a real estate broker at the Corcoran Group.“Selling houses, you never know what’s going to happen,” she said. “So you’ve got to think outside of the box.”Outside of that box, their brownstone appears to be a hit. It has garnered four shoots in just about a year and is under consideration for another job right now.Scouts and agents say this kind of repeat hosting is frequent, especially for print work, which tends to supply most of a location agent’s business. And the clients, they say, don’t seem to care whether a home has been shot before.“It’s not a question I get that often,” said Dena Zemsky, the owner of On the Mark Locations. “One person goes in and shoots it one way. Somebody else shoots it another way. Often my homeowners say, ‘I didn’t even see my house, it was so close up.’ ”One immaculate Brooklyn Heights brownstone that Ms. Raisfeld represents drips with both chandeliers and bookings. It has recently played host to shoots for Eileen Fisher, Oil of Olay, More Magazine, Lucky Magazine, Cetaphil, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale’s, Bali Bras, Kmart, Chico’s and Huggies.On Classon Avenue, meanwhile, a beat-up old loft with exposed I-beams and chipping paint served as the location for a College Humor video earlier this month, and was the location for a short film last week.The film will introduce a new line of New Balance sports bras. The spandex in the apartment was abundant.For the shoot, the production company, Homestead Films, called a location agent and scout named Debbie Regan and asked for an urban space that could be used to simulate several different apartments. That way, one actress could bound around in the bathroom and another in the kitchen, and the production company wouldn’t have to build multiple sets.Corinna Falusi, executive creative director at StrawberryFrog, the advertising agency behind the film, said using an actual, lived-in apartment was not only cheaper than building sets, but it also looked better.“It feels real,” Ms. Falusi said. “Otherwise you need to have a really good set designer going around putting little pieces of dust everywhere.”In this loft there was dust aplenty, along with a treacherous-looking staircase leading down to the street and floors that appeared to have been attacked by angry woodpeckers. It was fabulously raw, wide open and airy, but also sort of a mess, in the way that many true lofts, recently used as commercial or industrial spaces, often are.Nonetheless, certain strict, though vague, house rules were put in place for the crews: don’t go in the off-limits rooms; don’t open anything; try not to touch anything.But at least no people were forced to take off their shoes. Agents said home shoots requiring everyone to wear little protective booties or go about in stocking feet were not uncommon.“Don’t sit on the sofa, don’t look at the dog,” Ms. Falusi said, recounting other shoots. “You can have people with white leather sofas and, quote-unquote, ‘real art’ on the walls, and they don’t care. And then you have people who live in a garage and they’re picky about everything.”A payment of several thousand dollars in exchange for, essentially, staying out of the way, can generally calm the nerves of even the most anxious homeowner — or at least suppress their fears long enough that they manage to say yes.“It’s like ‘The Cat in the Hat,’ and you are the fish in the fishbowl,” a location scout, Ernie Liberati, said of the home-shoot process. “When Mommy leaves, the house turns upside down, things are flying and breaking. But by the time Mommy comes, everything is just where you left it.”'"

O’Mara, Mr. Zimmerman’s lawyer, to keep documents related to the case private. State Attorney Angela B. Corey did not object to Mr. O’Mara’s request during the hearing.In an eight-page motion, the lawyers for the media companies, which included The New York Times Company, argued that the records were improperly sealed because Mr. O’Mara did not submit evidence showing that closing them was necessary to prevent a “serious and imminent” threat to the administration of justice.George Freeman, assistant general counsel and vice president of the Times Company, said that the judge, Jessica J. Recksiedler, did not go through the procedural steps required before a file can be sealed. “Just because a case gets a lot of publicity does not mean that papers should be sealed,” Mr. Freeman said.Mr. O’Mara had no comment on the motion because he was still reviewing it, said Jimmy Woods, a spokesman.'"
"'12-04-17,'1','As a murder and corruption scandal enveloping a former member of China’s elite leadership continued to snowball, Prime Minister Wen Jiabao issued a new call on Monday for the government to end a culture of graft lest it lead to the end of Communist rule.In an article in the conservative Communist Party journal Qiushi, or Seeking Truth, Mr. Wen said the government must hold officials more strongly accountable for corruption that occurs on their watch and make the results of corruption investigations open to public inspection.The article, titled “Let power be exercised in the sunshine,” is the latest in a string of anticorruption broadsides aired since the former Politburo member Bo Xilai was ensnared in February in a murder investigation involving his wife.Mr. Bo was removed from the Politburo after party officials issued a report accusing him of “serious disciplinary violations” and accusing his wife, Gu Kailai, of arranging the killing of Neil Heywood, a British businessman and onetime friend of the Bo family, after a financial dispute.China’s official news media have maintained a high-level drumbeat of warnings against corruption since the scandal became public, including a speech by President Hu Jintao that urged the military to rid itself of graft, and a prominent commentary last week on Xinhua, the state-run news service, that bemoaned efforts by the spouses and children of high officials to seek personal gain through official power.'"

"'12-04-18,'0','The victory was just the Knicks’ third this season over one of the East’s elite teams.“It’s huge,” said Tyson Chandler, “because we know Boston has been rolling. Boston’s playing incredible of late.”The Knicks opened a 21-point lead in the first half, held a double-digit edge for most of the second half and repelled the Celtics down the stretch after Boston cut the deficit to 6.Anthony finished with 35 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, for the second triple-double of his career. Novak set career highs with 25 points and eight 3-pointers, which fell one shy of the franchise record. Smith had a season-high 25 points and hit seven 3-pointers, all in the first half, which tied a franchise record.The Knicks finished with 19 3-pointers, the second most in franchise history. They hit 14 in the first half, tying an N.B.A. record.“We talked about maybe overreacting to Carmelo,” said Paul Pierce, who led Boston with a season-high 43 points. “We started trapping him and it allowed them to swing the ball to open shooters, and it ignited the other guys and gave them a lot of confidence.""The victory pushed the Knicks one game ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers (31-30), who lost earlier to Indiana. The Knicks effectively have a two-game lead because they hold the head-to-head tiebreaker.As an added bonus, Stoudemire should be back in the lineup within days. He hinted strongly that he will play Friday night in Cleveland, after taking four weeks to recover from a bulging disk in his back.“I’ll be back soon,” Stoudemire said coyly before the game. “I definitely have to get some games under my belt before the playoffs. So there’s a little hint.”Coach Mike Woodson called Friday a “possibility,” with Sunday (in Atlanta) the fallback option if Stoudemire needs more time. Stoudemire will miss his 13th straight game Wednesday night, when the Knicks make their final trip to New Jersey to play the Nets.The Knicks could certainly use another All-Star in the lineup when the playoffs arrive later this month. But they hardly seemed to need any help Tuesday, with Anthony alternating between scorer and playmaker.“He’s playing like we all thought he could play,” Woodson said, “and it’s beautiful to watch him play because he’s doing a lot of things on both ends of the floor. He’s making guys around him better and we’re winning. That’s what the good players do.”Ray Allen was a late scratch for the Celtics and missed his fifth straight game because of a sprained ankle. Boston took another blow in the third quarter, when Rajon Rondo took a hard fall in the paint, apparently injuring his lower back. He stayed down for several minutes, but finished the game.The Knicks’ next challenge is reincorporating Stoudemire after a one-month absence, during which Anthony took over the power forward role and played his best games of the season. Despite Anthony’s surge and the Knicks’ success, Woodson reiterated that Stoudemire will reclaim his starting job, pushing Anthony back to small forward.Although Anthony and Stoudemire have often played awkwardly as a tandem, Woodson said he wants them on the court together.“As the head coach, guys, I’ve got to see if this thing is going to work,” he said, adding: “I got to make it work. And I’m going to bring Amar’e back, when he decides to come back, and he’s going to start and we’re going to make it work.”Carmelo Anthony’s only other triple-double came on Feb. 5, 2007, with the Denver Nuggets, when he had 31 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a loss to Phoenix. ... Baron Davis aggravated his strained left hamstring in the third quarter and played just 18 minutes. He also was battling an illness that left him nauseous all day and required intravenous fluids before the game. Davis said he would play Wednesday night. ... Deron Williams, the Nets’ star point guard, will miss Wednesday’s game against the Knicks because of a calf strain, according to Coach Avery Johnson. ... Amar’e Stoudemire shaved his scruffy beard and put his hair in corn rows — a style he has not worn since he was 17. Stoudemire said there was nothing symbolic in the makeover. “I’m just growing my hair out,” he explained. “And its just the fastest way to grow, when it’s in a cornrow setting.” As for the clean shave, he said, the beard “would be a little bit much with the cornrows. It was offsetting. My swag wasn’t impeccable.”'"
"'12-04-18,'0','Pfizer is nearing a deal to sell its infant nutrition business, with a winning buyer that could be picked as soon as next week, people briefed on the matter said Tuesday.Nestlé appears to be in the leading bidder for the business, these people said, cautioning that the sales process was ongoing and still could fall apart.Should a deal be reached, it would be the latest move by Pfizer to reshuffle its business mix and focus on its core business of developing new medicines. Last spring, the company sold a division that makes capsule coatings for drugs to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for about $2.4 billion.Pfizer announced last summer that it would explore a sale of the infant nutrition business, kicking off an auction that has drawn interest from a number of corporate buyers and private equity firms.The unit, which reported about $2.1 billion in revenue last year, manufactures infant formula products around the world and is considered to be among Pfizer’s faster-growing businesses.While it trails Nestlé in market share, the nutrition unit is big enough that a deal may still present some antitrust hurdles for the Swiss company. That may mean that Nestlé may need to make some divestitures to win regulatory approval.'"
"'12-04-18,'0','WASHINGTON — With his re-election prospects influenced by the price of gasoline, President Obama on Tuesday demanded more “cops on the beat” to crack down on oil market manipulation, calling on Congress to bolster federal supervision of oil markets and to increase penalties for subverting markets.In remarks in the Rose Garden, Mr. Obama, flanked by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, chided Republicans who have been calling for increased American production to tamp down prices.“There are politicians who say if we just drill more, gas prices will come down,” Mr. Obama said. “What they don’t say is that we have been drilling more.” He said no amount of drilling would solve the fundamental imbalance “that we use more than 20 percent of the world’s oil and we only have 2 percent of the world’s oil reserves.”But it is doubtful that Mr. Obama’s proposal will go anywhere; it would increase spending on enforcement by about $52 million at the same time that Republicans in Congress are trying to rein in federal regulations. The president wants Congress to increase the surveillance and enforcement staff at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.The nationwide average for gas prices is hovering near $4 per gallon — not far from the $5 per gallon that Mr. Obama’s political advisers believe could cripple his re-election chances. Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, and other critics have tried to link the president to the prices at the pump.'"
"'12-04-18,'0','The three were speaking at a forum at New York University, where a group critical of Mr. Bloomberg’s policies released a report showing that the 23 schools targeted for closing this year had higher proportions of special-education students, students who were over age for their grade and students who qualified for free or reduced-price lunches, as well as lower proportions of students proficient in math and language arts, than the city’s school system as a whole.One expected candidate, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and a frequent ally of Mr. Bloomberg’s, did not attend the forum. In a phone interview on Tuesday afternoon, she said she had decided not to attend because she opposed one of the recommendations in the report, which called for the city to select a group of struggling schools that would receive additional support. She described that as a throwback to a 1990s initiative whose success has been questioned.By this fall, the Bloomberg administration will have closed, or will have begun phasing out, 140 schools since 2002 and will have opened 589 new ones — many of them small schools that share space in old school buildings. Teachers at closed schools cannot be fired, but they are often not hired by the new schools, and can wind up as substitute teachers for years before finding permanent positions.The new schools generally have higher graduation rates than the schools they replace, and their students score better on exams. But critics, including the teachers’ union, argue that the reason the new schools appear to be superior is that their students have fewer challenges, like poverty and special needs.However, the mayor and the schools chancellor, Dennis M. Walcott, pushed back sharply against that argument on Tuesday.“The student bodies of these new schools mirror those of the schools they replace,” the mayor said, “with similar percentages of black and Latino students, English-language learners and students with disabilities.”According to Education Department data, in 2011 the percentage of students with disabilities at new schools opened by the Bloomberg administration was 15.2, compared with 10.7 percent at schools citywide. The percentage of English-language learners at the new schools was roughly equivalent to the percentage citywide; the percentage of black and Latino students was significantly higher at the new schools.The president of the United Federation of Teachers, Michael Mulgrew, noted in a statement that 9 out of the 23 schools targeted for closing this year had been created by the Bloomberg administration since 2002.“We intend to fight to make sure these new schools get the supports they need,” Mr. Mulgrew said. “Nearly 40 percent of the schools on the current closing list were created by Bloomberg, and we’d hate to see him try to close these at the same rate before he leaves office.”Of the 54 schools being opened in the fall, 24 will be charter schools and 30 will be regular public schools. Most of the new schools will fill space either being vacated by closing schools or in currently underused school buildings. Only 10 of them will be new school spaces.'"
"'12-04-18,'0','“Discussing details of any integration plan is premature while the regulatory approval processes are ongoing,” a spokeswoman for Sony said in a statement on Tuesday.But regulators on both continents are paying close attention to the companies’ growth and how much leverage they would gain over competitors and digital music services, which rely on licenses from labels and publishers. (Music publishers control the copyrights for songwriting, while labels deal with recordings.)That concern has been voiced loudly by independent labels, consumer advocates and Impala, a European organization representing small music companies.“We believe these deals would give Sony and Universal excessive control over the markets for publishing and recordings, over collecting societies, how artists are signed, and how their careers are able to develop,” Helen Smith, the executive director of Impala, said in an interview on Tuesday.The prospectus states unequivocally that the combined publishing assets of EMI and Sony “will represent the world’s largest publishing catalog with a No. 1 market share on a combined basis.”Sony’s bid for EMI is complex. The company already has a publishing division, Sony/ATV, which is a joint venture with the estate of Michael Jackson; because of its agreement with the estate, it must maintain EMI as a separate company. Sony/ATV controls about 750,000 songs, including the Beatles catalog, while EMI, perhaps the most highly regarded company in publishing, has some 1.3 million songs, including lucrative classics like “Over the Rainbow” and current hits by Alicia Keys and Kanye West.Sony/ATV will administer EMI’s business, which involves processing royalties and making licensing deals. In exchange for eliminating about $120 million in overhead expenses, Sony/ATV would get 15 percent of net publisher’s share — its revenue minus royalty payments to songwriters — as an administration fee. Based on EMI’s accounting from last year, that would net Sony/ATV $50 million, saving EMI’s operations $70 million.A large portion of those savings appear to be in layoffs. According to the document, 152 people would be laid off in the first year, and 174 would be “used on a temporary, transitional basis.” The elimination of those 326 positions represents about 63 percent of EMI publishing’s current work force of 515.Those numbers may have changed since the document was prepared in January, but as a pitch to investors it makes an aggressive case for savings and profitability. Few in the music industry think that could be accomplished without many layoffs.Sony and the Jackson estate would have a 38 percent stake in EMI, with the rest owned by four investors: the sovereign wealth fund Mubadala of Abu Dhabi, Jynwel Capital of Hong Kong, Blackstone’s GSO Capital Partners and the Hollywood mogul David Geffen.Regulators in Europe and the United States may demand divestments from both companies, as Europe did before approving Universal’s $2.1 billion takeover of BMG Music Publishing in 2007.The companies have already begun to sell assets. Universal has put $200 million in publishing catalogs up for sale to pay for its bid, and it may be required to sell recorded music assets. Last month Sony offered to shed some publishing assets as well.Sony has not identified those assets, but according to documents circulated to prospective buyers, they include the European rights to both EMI’s Virgin catalog — with songs by Tears for Fears, Human League and Culture Club — and Sony/ATV’s Famous Music catalog, which includes movie music like “The Godfather” and songs by Bjork, Duke Ellington and Shakira.The European rights to these catalogs generated about $20 million in revenue last year, according to the solicitation.'"
"'12-04-18,'0','The African Union suspended Guinea-Bissau on Tuesday over last week’s coup, adding to pressure on military chiefs who said they were ready to restore power to civilians after talks with regional mediators. Foreign governments and international organizations have condemned the military for cutting short a presidential election and detaining the front-runner, former Prime Minister Carlos Gomes Jr., as well as the interim president, Raimundo Pereira. A delegation from the West African regional group Ecowas met with the military overnight, and the Ecowas Commission president, Desiré Kadré Ouedraogo, said Tuesday that there had been an agreement “on the return to constitutional order.” Lt. Col. Daha Bana na Walna, a military spokesman, said Ecowas would send a technical team to help restore civilian rule. But he rejected the Ecowas demand that Mr. Gomes and Mr. Pereira be returned to power, calling it “out of the question,” and saying that the aim of the April 12 coup had been to end their mandates.'"

"'12-04-18,'0','For most Americans, the word praline conjures up the sugary pecan-studded candy from Louisiana. But in francophone Europe, pralines are filled chocolates. And it was exactly 100 years ago that the praline, a hard chocolate shell with a creamy flavored interior, made its debut at the Neuhaus chocolatier in Brussels.Though Neuhaus, founded in 1857 and now a global brand, has had stores in New York for years, it just opened a large American flagship in New York last week. The chocolates are traditional, mostly molded and filled, in the Belgian style. But some innovation is showing up: seasonal varieties filled with raspberry-, strawberry- and cherry-flavored ganache atop fruit preserves; a dark chocolate piece called Madison, filled with a mix of hazelnuts, almonds and caramelized sugar; and a 16-piece assortment designed for New York.The company has also introduced assortments to accompany wine or coffee and tea, and one created by female chefs. The new store has a display of antique chocolate-making equipment, including a contraption for liqueur fillings that looks like an old-fashioned diver’s helmet. From time to time, a chocolate maker will demonstrate the craft.Neuhaus, 500 Madison Avenue (52nd Street); (212) 644-4490; neuhauschocolate.com.

"'12-04-18,'0','Sales of the Coca-Cola Company’s myriad beverages grew around the world in the first quarter, led by consumption in India, where volume soared 20 percent.The growth pushed the company’s earnings above analysts’ expectations to $2.05 billion, or 89 cents a share, in the quarter that ended March 31, compared with 82 cents a share in the same quarter last year.Revenue grew 6 percent to $11.14 billion, compared with $10.5 billion in the first quarter last year, propelled by a 5 percent increase in sales volume driven by even larger increases in emerging markets. After India, China experienced the greatest growth, 9 percent, followed by a more modest 4 percent in Brazil.“That says more than anything that we’ve been able to crack the calculus in this challenging environment,” said Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive of Coca-Cola, whose brands include Fanta, Vitaminwater and Minute Maid juices.Mr. Kent attributed the company’s success to investments it continued to make during the economic downturn that are now paying off as the American economy shows signs of stabilizing and emerging markets gain even more steam.He said Americans have begun traveling and eating out more, which increases sales of the company’s products.But sales in Europe remain weak and show little sign of improvement, Mr. Kent said.Higher pricing also contributed to better earnings, a strategy that so far has helped all of the beverage companies weather last year’s surge in commodity prices and lackluster demand for their core products.'"
"'12-04-18,'0','SAN FRANCISCO — As PC makers regroup after the floods in Thailand last autumn, Intel is preparing to regain dominance of the computer chip market.Although Intel reported Tuesday that sales of its chips for personal computers and servers were flat in the company’s first quarter compared with the first quarter a year ago, industry analysts have predicted renewed demand for PCs. Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, said in a statement issued after the company announced its earnings that chips for smartphones and servers in the second quarter would provide “a tremendous foundation for growth in 2012 and beyond.”Intel’s net income for the first quarter was $2.7 billion, or 53 cents a share, down 13.4 percent from $3.2 billion, or 56 cents a share, a year ago. Revenue of $12.9 billion was up slightly from $12.8 billion a year ago.“The first quarter was a solid start to what’s expected to be another growth year for Intel,” Mr. Otellini said.A primary issue for Intel remains just how well it sells chips for mobile devices, particularly smartphones and tablets, as well as ultrabooks, a kind of lightweight laptop that can include touch screens in some models. Demand for smartphones, tablets and ultralight laptops like the Apple MacBook Air have been strong, while traditional types of PCs have been weak. Intel is also counting on strong demand for a new chip in computer servers that is meant for the booming market in cloud computing data centers.Several factors over the coming months could support Intel’s projections of higher growth. Hewlett-Packard, Dell and other PC makers are coming out with a range of ultrabooks. Intel has been making advances in chips for smartphones, and the Intel phone chips are expected to appear in more devices using Google’s Android operating system. Microsoft is expected by late summer to introduce its Windows 8 operating system, a decidedly different product receiving favorable advance notice, on several devices, including PCs and tablets. Devices using that software could also employ Intel chips.'"
"'12-04-18,'0','Prostitution is legal in Colombia in “tolerance zones.” A number of brothels in Cartagena are in these zones.On Monday, an colonel and a military lawyer arrived in Colombia to conduct an investigation on behalf of the Defense Department, said Col. Scott Malcom, the chief spokesman for the Southern Command in .The enlisted personnel under scrutiny include two Marine dog handlers; at least one member of the Green Berets from the Seventh Special Forces Group, which focuses on ; and Air Force and Navy personnel who specialize in the disposal of explosives.The dual investigations have cast a light on Cartagena’s freewheeling nightlife, where prostitutes walk the street, the bars and an array of private clubs, where they sometimes live and in some cases charge $300 or more to go out with customers. Exactly where the American security personnel met the women they reportedly took back to their rooms was still under investigation, the American officials said, with more than one establishment under review.“The 11 agents are having different recollections about what happened, or are not telling the truth,” Mr. King said.The 11 individuals were part of a much larger Secret Service contingent of dozens supporting Mr. Obama’s visit. The agents arrived in Colombia on Tuesday or Wednesday and, according to Mr. King and a senior United States official, had not yet been briefed on their specific assignments or started their official duties when they went out on Wednesday night and met the women.The president arrived in Cartagena on Friday afternoon for the , which drew leaders from throughout Latin America.The number of military personnel under scrutiny in the case, which the Pentagon initially numbered at 5, is between 10 and 12, the officials said. At least one member of the military has been questioned and cleared of wrongdoing, the officials said. It was not believed that the Secret Service agents and the military personnel had gone out in one large party, officials said, indicating that there may have been two or more groups of Americans who went out that night.At the Ligueros Club, when new customers arrive, a bell rings on a back patio where women go to relax, prompting them to jump to their high-heeled feet and go back to work. At Pleyclub, another bordello popular among Americans and rumored to have hosted a group of American security personnel on a recent night, a bottle of Old Parr whisky costs $160, and the women, who pole-dance naked on a stage to the rapid-fire beat of reggaetón, can charge double that.“A lot of Americans come here,” said Carlos Ramírez, a manager at Pleyclub.Then there is Rocio’s House, a brothel that caters to men from the nearby port. Prostitutes in tight dresses sit almost demurely in plastic chairs there, lined up against a wall like shy students at a junior high dance.The city’s prostitutes, many using English-friendly names like Lady, Daisy and Paola, say all the international attention might be good for business. They shrug their shoulders at all the fuss.“Now we are world-class, with the president’s bodyguards coming to try out Colombian girls,” said one freelance prostitute who walks the streets of the walled city and came to Cartagena from her hometown, Cali, because she preferred well-heeled foreign clients.While a Tracy Chapman video played on a flat-screen television next to the bar at Angeles, another club, another prostitute explained how she and her co-workers were required to be tested for as often as once a week. The brothels insist that all clients use , she said, describing how she paid the brothel owner about $6 a day to rent a tiny room and preferred to call herself an escort or a companion rather than a prostitute.The behavior of the security personnel came to light because one of them got into an early morning altercation over payment with one of the women, the American security officials said.“There are different versions of what happened, but the latest version is that one of the women complained at 6 in the morning that she hadn’t been paid,” Mr. King said. “The Secret Service wouldn’t let the hotel manager into the room, and the police came.”A taxi driver on Tuesday provided a slightly different version of events than the one that has emerged so far from the American investigation.The driver, José Peña, 43, said in an interview that he drove two women home from the hotel at about 9:30 a.m. Thursday.They told him they had met a group of five Americans the previous night at a club, Tu Candela. They said the Americans invited them back to their hotel at 4 a.m.In the morning, one of the men refused to pay the $250 he was asked for in exchange for the previous night’s sex with one of the women and instead handed over the equivalent of about $30 in local currency and shut her out of the room, the driver recounted. The woman and her friend banged on the door, they told the driver, until other Americans came out of their rooms and gave the women $100, and the women left.Carlos Figueroa, a spokesman for the Cartagena mayor’s office, said that the local police were assisting their American counterparts, but not conducting their own investigation. Ms. Collins said she pressed the Secret Service to find out who the women were and whether they had ties to groups hostile to the United States.Ms. Collins said she had asked of the Secret Service, “Could they have planted bugs, disabled weapons,” or in other ways “jeopardized security of the president or our country? Is there any evidence of previous misconduct by these or any other agents on other missions?”'"

"'12-04-19,'0','If you found “Benji the Hunted” unbearably intense or “Marley & Me” a bit too hard-edged, then “Darling Companion” may be the dog movie for you. On the other hand, if you like to watch cute pooches doing cute stuff on screen, you may be a little disappointed. Not that Freeway, the rescued mutt in the middle of Lawrence Kasdan’s mild, creaky new film, isn’t adorable. It’s just that he’s not around all that much. Fairly early on, he bounds off into the woods, and for the next hour or so impressive noncanine cast members search for him, acting out various minor relationship dramas as they go.Why did Freeway split? The ostensible reason is that he spotted a deer, but more plausible explanations might be tact or embarrassment. Let the members of the human pack settle their issues on their own. Dogs have no problem with clichés — why else would mine bark at the mailman every day? — but I suspect that even a patient and loyal hound would tire pretty quickly of the type of shopworn playwriting conventions that litter the “Darling Companion” screenplay, by Mr. Kasdan and his wife, Meg.Or maybe I’m just projecting my own impatience onto a more forthright and simple species. How much more fulfilling it would have been to spend those hundred-odd minutes chasing a squirrel, taking a nap or disemboweling a stuffed animal on the living room rug.But perhaps this is too harsh. Though it is not very good, “Darling Companion” is not actually unpleasant. Set mostly in and around a lovely Rocky Mountain resort town in the warmer months of the year, it is as resplendent with mountain vistas and golden sunlight as a tourist board Web site. This gorgeousness is augmented by the presence of exquisitely selected actors, who make reasonably congenial company.The senior generation is represented by Diane Keaton, Kevin Kline, Dianne Wiest, Richard Jenkins and — in a couple of scenes as a crusty old sheriff — Sam Shepard. How can these people fail to be interesting? The answer is that they can’t, but their collective artistry has the unfortunate effect of exposing the wobbly, threadbare platform that Mr. Kasdan has built for them.Ms. Keaton and Mr. Kline are Beth and Joseph, a long-married Denver couple who have just married off the second of their two daughters.

The Commerce Department says that mortgage interest payments, in dollars, are lower than at any time since 2005.Getting those debt levels down was not a simple matter of making payments, of course. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that about two-thirds of the reduction came from the cancellation of debt, through write-offs and foreclosures.But the benefit is appearing. This week’s report of surprisingly strong retail sales in March may in part be because of warm weather. However, it also owes something to the fact that money that once went to mortgage payments may now be available for other things.To get some idea of what needs to be done now — and what the result will be — the McKinsey institute points to two incidents in the early 1990s that got little attention at the time in the United States. Those were the bursting of real estate bubbles in Sweden and Finland. Details differ, but in each country there were two distinct phases of deleveraging.“In the first,” the McKinsey institute said in an analysis published early this year, “households, corporations and financial institutions reduce debt significantly over several years, while economic growth is negative or minimal and government debt rises.” That is certainly what has happened in the United States.The second phase is the good part, the institute said. “Growth rebounds and government debt is reduced gradually over several years.”In this country, the deleveraging process has some way to go, with many foreclosures still pending, but it is at least possible that economic growth is beginning to accelerate. It is clear that the United States has made a lot more progress in cutting consumer debt than has been made in either Britain or Spain, two other countries that suffered from falling real estate prices.To get the deleveraging process under way, it is important for lenders to face reality, admit losses and deal with them. For banks, and their regulators, there is a great temptation to obscure losses, hoping that the market will recover. That was a little harder to do in the recent cycle, thanks to new mark-to-market accounting rules. Those rules were weakened after they were denounced by banks, supported by their regulators, but they still had some effect.Perhaps more significantly, many of the worst — and the ones that most needed to be dealt with — were generally not on bank balance sheets. The vast majority of home mortgage loans had been sold to investors in mortgage securitizations, many of them guaranteed by and and others privately issued. Securitizations must regularly report on how many loans are not performing. As a result, the losses could not be hidden — and the recovery process delayed — as happened in during the decade after its bubble burst in 1990.The McKinsey report identifies six markers of success that are useful in assessing a nation’s deleveraging process. A stable banking system must emerge. After the inevitable surge in government debt, there needs to be a credible plan for long-term fiscal sustainability. Structural reforms may be needed to make economies more competitive. Exports need to rise, as does private investment. Finally, the housing market needs to stabilize.Susan Lund, the director of research for the McKinsey institute, says the two areas where the United States is weakest are in coming up with a credible fiscal plan and in stabilizing the real estate market. Home prices continue to fall in some of the hardest hit areas, where debts continue to be high relative to income. I’d add in private investment. Corporations are generating a lot more cash than they are willing to invest. To some extent, that may simply reflect the trauma of the crisis, when cash was king, and it may take time to solve it.There are plenty of reasons to doubt that the current economic recovery will become self-sustaining, starting with ’s problems and including the threat that American fiscal policy will shut off growth by imposing too much austerity too soon.Ms. Lund points out that from 2003 to 2007, American homeowners took out $2.2 trillion from and mortgage refinancings, a source of economic stimulus that will not return anytime soon. “Compared to the much-debated government fiscal stimulus, this was more than twice the size,” she noted. She thinks the household deleveraging process will continue for two more years.But who would have forecast that the burden of household debt — at least in much of the country — would by now have been reduced so far that consumers are again a source of growth? That fact is a reminder that the outlook is seldom as bleak as it seems in the immediate aftermath of a calamity.'"

"'12-04-19,'0','ATLANTA — The “urban coyote” problem has come to Atlanta at last.In recent years, wildlife experts here say, the traditionally Western animals have migrated to the South at a record pace, with more than 3,000 coyote sightings now reported in the Atlanta area annually. They have been venturing toward the East Coast since the 1950s, seeking prey and moving into territory once controlled by a predator, wolves.“We’re seeing them all over,” said Don McGowan, a senior wildlife biologist at the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. “Urban, suburban, rural. Everywhere.” And not just in the South. In New York, the police chased a stray coyote through TriBeCa two years ago. In Los Angeles, coyotes have been spotted roaming golf courses.Here, coyotes are clearly showing a predatory side. In one case, Joe Feinberg’s 4-year-old Australian shepherd mix, Abby, was attacked last weekend in Roswell, an Atlanta suburb. Abby was mauled in the backyard and suffered deep gashes under her rib cage and on her hip. Now Mr. Feinberg is afraid to let the dog outside at night.“We can hear the coyotes howling every night, a pack of them,” he said.The city’s sprawling, woodsy landscape provides ample cover and sources of food. In Canton, another Atlanta suburb, a petting zoo enlisted guard dogs after coyotes took off with its baby lambs. In Buckhead, a wealthy neighborhood, residents have reported that coyotes have taken their pet swans and peacocks.No people have been attacked by coyotes in Georgia, but the state has certified more than 200 trappers to remove or exterminate the animals. And coyotes can be hunted year round in the state.But, Mr. McGowan said, as soon as one coyote is removed, another will usually take its place. “Unfortunately,” he said, “this looks like something that Atlanta will have to learn to live with.”'"
"'12-04-19,'0','Sony has won the approval of European regulators for its $2.2 billion takeover of EMI Music Publishing, a critical step in the company’s bid to create the largest catalog of songs in the world, according to a person briefed on the process.The European Commission is expected to announce on Thursday that it has approved the deal, with as much as $35 million in concessions by Sony, said that person, who requested anonymity because the information had not been made public.The commission’s approval was first reported on Wednesday on the Web site of The Financial Times.As a result of the deal, Sony will control 31 percent of the lucrative music-publishing market, which deals with the copyrights for songwriting. EMI has 1.3 million songs, including classics like “Over the Rainbow” and the Motown songbook. Sony’s existing publishing enterprise, Sony/ATV, a joint venture with the estate of Michael Jackson, has about 750,000 songs, including the publishing rights to the Beatles catalog.Last year, Citigroup reached a pair of deals to split EMI — a British company with roots dating to 1887 — between Sony and the Universal Music Group, with Universal offering $1.9 billion for EMI’s record labels (which includes the Beatles’ recordings).Those deals are also under antitrust review in the United States by the Federal Trade Commission, but Europe has taken the lead in the reviews. This was the first round of its investigation of Sony, and its approval saves the company from a second, more rigorous phase, which could have lasted months. Universal has drawn closer scrutiny by European regulators and has entered that second phase already.The American and European agencies are known to communicate with each other about pending cases, but they can still differ in their judgments.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','When it was decided that Nazareth High School in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, would close in June, the players on the school’s nationally ranked girls basketball team thought they were leaving their school with a final championship send-off. But on Wednesday the Lady Kingsmen found out they will be back to defend their title in 2013.To survive, the small Roman Catholic school had six weeks to raise $700,000, bring in 81 freshmen and present a four-year financial plan. Sharon Patrick, a former McKinsey & Company consultant whose nephew teaches at Nazareth, donated $500,000, and $200,000 more was raised through school events and a local McDonald’s. Patrick also covered the enrollment fees of 81 incoming freshmen and worked with the school to develop a secure financial plan.The Lady Kingsmen’s dramatic season coincided with the school’s struggle to stay open. Coach Apache Paschall died, apparently of a heart attack, during the season. The team lost in the city semifinals, won the state Catholic school title and lost in the New York state Tournament of Champions.Jim Kennelly of the board of trustees said the school was now in position to possibly last another 50 years.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','For 20 years, researchers have reported a link between gum disease and heart attacks or stroke, but a new analysis finds that claim seriously flawed — so much so that the American Heart Association issued a rare scientific statement on Wednesday concluding that gum disease has not been shown to raise the risk of cardiovascular illness, let alone cause it. The statement added that treating gum disease either professionally or by regular brushing and flossing has not been proved to reduce the risk of heart disease or stroke. The statement reflects a three-year analysis of about 600 studies by an expert committee, led by a dentist and a cardiologist. It was endorsed by the American Dental Association Council on Scientific Affairs.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','As masterful as Barcelona can be with its mesmerizing passing, it has on occasion this season struggled to finish its chances. Instead of returning home with three or four goals, Barcelona could not find the net Wednesday despite controlling 72 percent of the possession, holding a 24-5 advantage in total shot attempts and a 6-1 edge on shots on goal.Frustration began in the ninth minute when forward Alexis Sánchez hit the crossbar above an empty net and continued beyond 90 minutes when his replacement, Pedro Rodriguez, ricocheted a shot off the right post.“If you count possession of the ball, we’re going to win every game,” said Pep Guardiola, Barcelona’s manager. But, he added, the object of the game “is to put the ball into the goal; that is the most difficult thing.”Late in the first half, the steadfast Chelsea midfielder Frank Lampard stole the ball from Lionel Messi, who has now not scored in seven games against the Blues. Quickly, Lampard spotted Ramires, who found acres of space to gallop down the left flank with Barcelona’s defense caught out of position. Ramires crossed to Drogba, whose shot had enough power and direction to elude goalkeeper Víctor Valdés and find the net.Drogba is 34, and he and many of his teammates were thought to be too old and creaky as Chelsea played erratically in the English Premier League this season. But the Blues have now won 10 of their 13 games since Di Matteo became manager. Drogba delivered a stunning goal to begin a 5-1 rout of Tottenham in an F.A. Cup semifinal on Sunday. So Di Matteo stuck with his power over Fernando Torres’s speed against Barcelona.“I thought I had to be fair, looking back on the game on Sunday, looking at the way we wanted to play,” Di Matteo said of Drogba. “I thought he was the right man. In the past, a lot of the public opinion was that these boys were over the line, too old, to play two games and to play at this level. I think they gave the answer tonight.”Until he scored, Drogba had spent considerable time on the turf, complaining about fouls. But he is a player of embellishment as well as great skill, and his grievances found no sympathy from the referee, Felix Brych. Instead of pouting, Drogba remained aggressive and delivered the winning goal.In doing so, he created a celebrative moment and found himself in the headlines for reasons of achievement rather than villainy. When these teams met in the 2009 Champions League semifinals, Drogba lost his temper after Barcelona prevailed on away goals here at Stamford Bridge, cursed into the television cameras and called the Norwegian referee, Tom Henning Ovrebo, a disgrace. He later received a four-match ban for his outburst.Wednesday, Drogba’s response was jubilance, not petulance. And his teammates, particularly goalkeeper Petr Cech, the back four and an unwavering midfield, remained serene and organized, never panicking under Barcelona’s relentless attack.“They do it against Real Madrid, they do it against A.C. Milan,” Di Matteo said. “The team was prepared to be patient and not get frustrated. The boys were really determined not to let them through.”'"
"'12-04-19,'0','She said the new rule would reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds by 190,000 to 290,000 tons per year and toxic air pollutants by 12,000 to 20,000 tons a year.The agency said that the industry could meet the standards by deploying existing technology, and that nearly half the wells drilled using hydraulic fracturing already had the gas capture equipment, known as “green completions.”The agency said that once the rule was fully effective, in January 2015, the industry would save $11 million to $19 million a year because drillers would be able to capture and sell the methane that is now burned off, or flared.Methane is a potent heat-trapping gas, 20 times more powerful in its effect on the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. The E.P.A. estimates that capturing methane from thousands of new wells will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by the equivalent of 28 million to 44 million tons a year, making the rule one of the federal government’s largest measures to mitigate climate change.The American Petroleum Institute, which had lobbied to weaken the proposed rule, said the revised standards issued Wednesday were an improvement over the original proposal. Howard Feldman, the institute’s director of regulatory and scientific affairs, said the industry had already adopted many of the requirements of the new rule and welcomed the delay in its effective date.“The industry has led efforts to reduce emissions by developing new technologies that were adopted in the rule,” Mr. Feldman said. “E.P.A. has made some improvement in the rules that allow our companies to continue reducing emissions while producing the oil and natural gas our country needs.”Other industry groups were less generous. The Western Energy Alliance, a group of independent oil and gas companies, said the new rule’s costs far outweighed its benefits and accused the E.P.A. of using the Clean Air Act illegally to deal with global warming.Kathleen Sgamma, the group’s vice president for government affairs, also asserted that the rules were not flexible enough “to account for new exploratory areas where infrastructure does not yet exist.”“Small businesses disproportionately operate in such conditions, and this rule could make exploring in new areas cost-prohibitive,” she said.Environmental advocacy groups said the new rule was a step forward for clean air. The American Lung Association said that the reduction of a variety of emissions, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds, would improve the health of people living downwind from oil and gas operations.Ann Brewster Weeks, senior counsel for the Clean Air Task Force, said reductions in emissions that contribute to smog and global warming were good news but objected to the E.P.A.’s concessions on the timetable.“Over the past few months, lobbyists for the gas industry have pushed to carve large exemptions out of the rule with arguments about the cost of the rules and asserted difficulty of complying,” she said. “These arguments are false, as we’ve made clear.”“Regrettably, E.P.A. gave in to these claims in a few crucial ways,” she added. “Most significantly, they delayed the most important requirement — to clean up air pollution from fracked wells — for two and a half years.”'"
"'12-04-19,'0','LAST week I stood before a military judge at Guantánamo Bay to argue that the press and public had a constitutional right to observe the proceedings of military commissions. It is an argument I’ve made scores of times on behalf of news organizations objecting to closed proceedings in criminal and civil trials, but this was the first time that a military commission — part of a system of tribunals created in 2006 to try terrorism suspects — agreed to hear such arguments from the press.Whether this marks a new openness, or is another in a long line of false starts, remains to be seen. But the government has a real opportunity to show its commitment to the rule of law by acknowledging that the public’s First Amendment rights apply at Guantánamo. The values served by open criminal proceedings — public acceptance of the verdict, accountability for lawyers and judges, and democratic oversight of our government institutions — apply there with particular urgency.The controversy over public access to the Guantánamo trials has come to a head in the prosecution of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused of masterminding the 2000 attack on the Navy destroyer Cole. Mr. Nashiri’s lawyers want to meet with him unshackled, asserting that shackling brings back memories of torture and interferes with his ability to assist in preparing his defense. They proposed to call both Mr. Nashiri and a psychologist to testify in support of their request.The government still considers its interrogation techniques “classified information.” Under this logic, Mr. Nashiri’s own testimony about his own treatment must be kept secret.But so much is already known about Mr. Nashiri’s interrogation that a secret proceeding on its psychological impact is unwarranted. A report, prepared in 2004 by the inspector general for the Central Intelligence Agency and partly released in 2009, disclosed that Mr. Nashiri had been waterboarded twice, threatened with use of a handgun and a power drill, and held in stress positions that could have dislocated his arms from his shoulders. What real threat would justify preventing the public from hearing his first-person account of this interrogation?'"

Says” (news article, April 12) implies that the Food and Drug Administration has imposed new enforceable rules on the livestock industry that will curb rampant overuse of antibiotics on healthy farm animals. That’s sadly not the case.Only far down in your article do you acknowledge that the F.D.A. offered up only suggestions to industry. This voluntary approach maintains the status quo that has contributed to the rise of antibiotic-resistant superbugs in humans over the last few decades.The F.D.A. first recognized the human health threat of feeding antibiotics to cows, pigs and chickens in 1977. But ever since, it has skirted its responsibility to protect these lifesaving medicines for human use.A recent Natural Resources Defense Council legal victory will finally compel the F.D.A. to confront and curb the overuse of penicillin and tetracyclines. This would be the most significant (albeit court-ordered) step the F.D.A. has taken.As a 2003 report co-edited by the current commissioner of the F.D.A. pointed out, if we don’t address the drivers of antibiotic resistance, including the overuse of antibiotics in livestock, the “specter of untreatable infections — a regression to the pre-antibiotic era — is looming just around the corner.”'"

"'12-04-19,'0','As many voters thought they would do better under Mr. Romney as under Mr. Obama, but slightly more said they would do worse if the president was re-elected.With less than seven months before Election Day, a furious scramble is under way by Democrats to define their opponent. Mr. Romney’s bruises from the Republican primary fight are evident — only 29 percent of voters have a favorable view of him — but more than one-third say they have yet to form an opinion, creating a chance for him to introduce himself as a fix-it man who can improve the economic circumstances of Americans.“We need a president who has a business background, and Mitt Romney’s business background is tremendous,” Michael Larson, 55, a salesman and independent voter from , said Wednesday in a follow-up interview. “He has a vision that will bring the country back to economic strength.”While the poll shows that Mr. Romney has a significant entree with voters who are frustrated at the direction of the country, Mr. Obama may have the upper hand when it comes to economic policy debates. A majority of voters say upper-income Americans pay less than their fair share of , while half say capital gains and dividends should be taxed at the same rate as income from work — a disparity highlighted by Mr. Romney’s own effective tax rate of about 15 percent.A week after dispatching his chief Republican rival, , Mr. Romney has solidified support within his party. A majority of Republican primary voters, 54 percent, say they want to see Mr. Romney become the nominee, including a plurality of evangelical Christians, a group that formed Mr. Santorum’s base of support.The poll highlighted a lack of strong excitement among some Republican voters for Mr. Romney’s candidacy, with just one in three saying they would enthusiastically support him in November. While that is hardly a resounding endorsement, it may be a temporary shortcoming that can be overcome by the fierce resistance among conservative Republicans to Mr. Obama.Mr. Romney also faces considerable hurdles as he begins presenting his views to a wider audience. The poll found that more than 6 in 10 voters think Mr. Romney says what people want to hear, rather than what he believes. The opinion of Mr. Obama is more closely divided, with 46 percent saying he says what he believes and 51 percent saying he says what people want to hear.Mr. Romney’s wealth also creates an uneasy relationship with many voters. Only about one in seven voters say he cares a lot about the needs and problems of people like them, compared with one-third of voters who think Mr. Obama cares a lot about their needs and problems. Only one-third of voters say they can relate to Mr. Romney, while nearly half say they can relate to Mr. Obama.The nationwide poll was conducted from last Friday through Tuesday on land-line telephones and cellphones with 957 adults, including 852 registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus three percentage points for all adults and voters.Nearly 4 in 10 Americans say they have been falling behind financially, an 11-point increase from four years ago. About one-quarter of people say the future of the next generation will be better, while nearly half say it will be worse. Nearly the same percentage of Americans expressed a bleak outlook in early 1992, when the first President George Bush faced re-election and ultimately lost to .Mr. Obama has an approval rating of 48 percent, the poll found, and 6 in 10 respondents say the country is on the wrong track. Those and other findings in the poll offer a clear warning for a president seeking re-election and trying to cast the race as a choice between him and Mr. Romney, rather than a referendum on his first term in office.“I want to give the business guy a chance,” said Craig Lemoine, 47, a Republican from who drives a truck. “No one wants to put the C.E.O. in there. Everyone thinks he’ll just make the rich people richer and the poor people poorer. “But how do you know if you don’t give him a chance?”The first week of the head-to-head campaign between Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney has been dominated by a debate about the role of women and working mothers, after primary fights over coverage for and other women’s health issues. The survey found that voters do not place a priority on some of these issues when choosing a candidate, focusing instead on jobs and the economy.Over all, the poll found that Mr. Obama led Mr. Romney 49 percent to 43 percent among women, and that they are more likely than men to express confidence in the president’s ability to deal with economic issues. Among men, Mr. Romney held a similar advantage over Mr. Obama.For now, the economy is the central focus of the campaign, with and economic populism strong themes of the president’s re-election pitch.Americans are showing gradual signs of optimism: 33 percent say the economy is getting better now, compared with 14 percent who said the same last October. But only 27 percent of voters said Mr. Obama had changed the country for the better, compared with 20 percent who said he had changed it for the worse and 47 percent who said he had not changed it at all.The survey offers a snapshot of the landscape as the race takes shape. Democrats have put a particular focus on Mr. Romney’s wealth, and this could already be influencing some voters.“I’m fairly confident that should he get into office he would push to ensure that the upper class continues to get even more benefits while the lower class gets fewer,” said Gillian Gallentine, 57, an independent voter and retiree from . She added, “I think Romney would try to reverse a lot of what Obama did and try to give things back to the rich.”'"
"'12-04-19,'0','“The plan makes sense,” said Freddie George, an analyst at Seymour Pierce in London. “Over the last couple of years they’ve taken their eyes off the ball in the U.K.”But some investors were not convinced and Tesco’s shares fell 2.1 percent Wednesday in London. The retail environment in Europe remains difficult because of the continuing economic crisis and households are reluctant to spend, said Richard Hunter, head of equities at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers.Following in Amazon’s footsteps, Tesco has started to allow other retailers to sell their products through Tesco’s Web site. Tesco has started out by allowing two retailers — Crocus, which sells plants and gardening supplies and equipment, and Maplin, which sells batteries, electronics and electrical goods — to sell their wares through Tesco.com. The strategy is intended to drive more customer traffic to the site, and Tesco gets a cut from every sale. Tesco said it planned to add more retailers.The company said it planned to expand the products it sold online to 200,000 by the end of the year from 80,000 now. It also plans to increase the number of “click and collect points” — locations where customers can collect purchases they have ordered online, rather than waiting for delivery — to 1,600 by the end of this year from 770 now.Although Tesco plans to slow its overseas expansion, Mr. Clarke said, the company is not giving up on its Fresh & Easy stores in the United States.Tesco now expects the business to break even about a year later than initially expected, but the company projects that Fresh & Easy will have some profitable months in 2013.“The U.S. is moving in the right direction but I’d like it to move faster,” Mr. Clarke said. “I need to demonstrate to shareholders, who have been very patient with us, that we can do it.”When Tesco started its Fresh & Easy brand, it saw a chance to fill what it saw as a need for convenient grocery stores in certain areas of the Western United States. But about five years later, only 30 of the 186 stores are making a profit.Mr. Clarke said losses at Fresh & Easy narrowed for the first time in fiscal 2012 but that Tesco would slow down the opening of new stores in the chain and be more cautious about how to expand the business. Instead, Tesco is remodeling the stores it has and will try to attract more customers with fresh flowers, wooden floors, closed refrigerator doors and in-store bakeries.“There’s undoubtedly frustration about what is happening in the U.S.,” said Clive Black, an analyst at Shore Capital. “Not pressing on as aggressively with store openings is positive but patience is being tested.”Tesco also plans to slow the pace of its expansion in China, where it said it is not immune to the impact of rising wages. It is also halting the expansion of Tesco Bank, which offers financial products like credit cards and insurance. The company has already announced it will close Tesco Cars, which sells second-hand automobiles and began just a year ago.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','Sitting in her living room wearing a short jean skirt, high-heeled espadrilles and a spandex top with a plunging neckline, the prostitute described how she and another woman were approached by a group of American men at a discotheque. In an account consistent with the official version of events coming out of Washington, but could not be independently confirmed, she said the men bought a bottle of Absolut vodka for the table and when that was finished bought a second one.“They never told me they were with Obama,” she said, addressing published reports that some agents may have openly boasted to prostitutes that they were there protecting the president. “They were very discreet.”A taxi driver who picked up the woman at the Hotel Caribe the morning of the encounter said he heard her and another woman recount the dispute over payment. When approached by a reporter for , the woman was initially reluctant to speak about what had occurred. As she nervously told her story, a friend gave details that seemed to corroborate her account.There was a language gap between the woman, 24, who declined to give her full name, and the American man who sat beside her at the bar and eventually invited her to his room. She agreed, stopped on the way to buy but told him he would have to give her a gift. He asked how much. Not knowing he worked for Mr. Obama but figuring he was a well-heeled foreigner, she said, she told him $800.The price alone, she said, indicates she is an escort, not a prostitute. “You have higher rank,” she said. “An escort is someone who a man can take out to dinner. She can dress nicely, wear nice makeup, speak and act like a lady. That’s me.”By 6:30 the next morning, after being awoken by a telephone call from the hotel front desk reminding her that, under the hotel’s rules for prostitutes, she had to leave, whatever deal the two had agreed on had broken down. She recalled that the man told her he had been drunk when they discussed the price. He countered with an offer of 50,000 pesos, the equivalent of about $30.Disgusted with such a low amount, she pressed the matter. He became angry, ordered her out of the room and called her an expletive, she said.She said she was crying and went across the hall, where another escort had spent the night with an American man from the same group. Both women began trying to get the money.They knocked on the door but got no response. She threatened to call the police, but the man’s friend, who appeared on the scene, begged her not to, saying they did not want trouble. Finally, she said, she left to go home but came across a police officer stationed in the hallway, who called in an English-speaking colleague.He accompanied her back to the room and the dispute escalated. Two other Americans from the club emerged from their rooms and stood guard in front of their friend’s locked door. The two Colombian officers tried to argue the woman’s case.A hotel security officer arrived. Eventually, she lowered her demand to $250, which she said was the amount she has to pay the man who helps find her customers. Eager to resolve the matter fast, the American men eventually gave her a combination of dollars and pesos worth about $225, and she left.It was only days later, once a friend she had shared her story with called to say that the dispute had made the television news, that she learned that the man was a Secret Service agent.She is dismayed, she said, that the news reports described her as a prostitute, as if she walks the streets picking up just anyone.“It’s the same, but it’s different,” she said, indicating that she is much more selective about her clients and charges much more than a streetwalker. “It’s like when you buy a fine rum or a BlackBerry or an . They have a different price.”The woman veered between anger and fear as she told of her misadventure. “I’m scared,” she said, indicating that she did not want the man she spent the night with to get into any trouble but feared that he might retaliate.“This is something really big,” she said. “This is the government of the . I have nervous attacks. I cry all the time.”The Secret Service declined to comment on the woman’s account, but a United States official who has been briefed on the inquiry said the details were generally consistent with what agents have said. “On the whole, it’s pretty accurate,” the official said, indicating that the woman at the center of the dispute at the hotel had not yet been interviewed.The Secret Service has expanded its investigation to look at its employees’ conduct on previous presidential trips, the person briefed on the investigation said. So far, investigators have not uncovered anything similar to what apparently happened in Colombia last week, the person said.Besides the 11 Secret Service personnel, 10 military personnel, including explosives experts and dog handlers, are under scrutiny in a separate Pentagon investigation, officials said.“There was no evidence that these women were seeking these guys out — that they were waiting for Secret Service agents — but all of that is being looked into,” said Representative , the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.Mr. King, a New York Republican, who was briefed on the matter this week by Mr. Sullivan, said the Secret Service agents at the hotel had provided conflicting reports about the night’s events. “Some of them were saying they didn’t know they were prostitutes,” he said. “Some are saying they were women at the bar. I understand that there was quite a bit of drinking.”“I fully support what Mark is doing,” Mr. King said of Mr. Sullivan. “I know that he wanted to take strong action once he had a legal basis.”Senator of , the senior Republican on the Homeland Security Committee, said the woman’s account generally comported with what Secret Service officials said occurred. But she noted differences in some details, including the specifics of the amount of money in dispute. “It helps the Secret Service if in fact the guy did not identify himself,” said Ms. Collins, who has raised concerns about a potential security breach.In a letter to Mr. Sullivan, Representative , Republican of , the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the committee’s ranking member, Elijah Cummings, Democrat of , said the Secret Service personnel in Colombia had brought “foreign nationals into contact with sensitive security information” and were potentially exposed to “blackmail and other forms of potential compromise.”Mr. Issa and Mr. Cummings listed 10 requests for information that they want answered by May 1. “Your swift and decisive action in response to this scandal has given us confidence that the agency will complete a thorough investigation and take steps to ensure that similar lapses in judgment will never again jeopardize the important work of the U.S. Secret Service,” the representatives said.As for cooperating with the investigators for the Secret Service who are seeking to interview the prostitutes as well as witnesses from the bar and outside the hotel room, the woman who was involved in the payment dispute said she was not interested in that. She said she was planning to leave Cartagena soon.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','AS in fashion, there are only so many themes for a party. So when the Art Production Fund, a nonprofit public art organization, gave an urban hoedown on Monday, guests had their outfits ready. While the setting sun blazed over New Jersey, art-loving supporters sauntered up to a warehouse on the West Side Highway near Houston Street. They were as excited as children going to a school square dance.“Wide open spaces and new frontiers, that’s what we’re all about,” said Yvonne Force Villareal, a founder of the art fund. She wore a black bandanna, black Dolce & Gabbana swing skirt and cowboy boots by Marc Jacobs, a chairman of the evening.Just as at a rodeo or county fair (but without the children to justify all the silliness), there were booths for being tattooed and photographed. And a mechanical bull reminded guests brave enough to ride it that a bull market can always throw you.Rachel Feinstein, the artist, wore a school-marm dress. “It’s by Louis Vuitton, but it’s very ‘Little House on the Prairie,’ ” she said. Aby Rosen, another chairman, wore a red western shirt, and Samantha Boardman, his wife, wore a gingham dress. Tobias Meyer, the handsome, lean Sotheby’s auctioneer, looked like a Marlboro Man via “Brokeback Mountain” as he hugged his spouse, Mark Fletcher, the art dealer. The couple, big guns in the world of art, not horse trading, were two of the honorees.“Mark’s from Tulsa and part Cherokee,” Mr. Meyer said. “So he’s perfect for me because in Germany, where I grew up, we really romanticize the American West.”'"
"'12-04-19,'0','Q. Who leaves investment banking to work at a struggling family nut company?A. Only someone nuts, right? My dad and my uncle both thought I was crazy. I was making more than they were at the time.A. Have you ever read the book “Monkey Business”? It’s a fairly accurate profile of what it’s like to be in investment banking, at least at a junior level. You know, there’s this economic concept called deadweight loss, and I think a lot of investment banking is like that: it doesn’t really add anything to the world, to the economy. I just wanted to do more.Q. I assume your father and uncle made you take a pay cut.A. The one thing I did was, I didn’t want to take anything away from them. I structured it so that my compensation was 100 percent based on incremental profit improvement. So from their perspective, there wasn’t very much risk. I also got a small piece of the business. But at the time the business was worth nothing, book value. No one would have bought it.Q. Did you have any experience in Internet sales?A. In 1999, I was a freshman in college and I started our Web site, Nutsonline.com. I spent my second semester of freshman year working on that thing four or five hours a day. It kind of just trickled along. In 1999, very few people were buying from Amazon, so they certainly weren’t going to buy from Nutsonline. In 2000, I remember I set a goal: I wanted to do 10 orders a day.Q. Did your father and uncle like your ideas?A. I started to do things with the business that they couldn’t do and that they didn’t understand. Around July 2003, I told them it’s all about the Web. We’re going to sell online and do a much better job. We got very aggressive with advertising online. My budget for advertising per day had been $3 and I raised it to like $100. That’s nothing now, but then it was huge.We flipped the switch on the site, with the new marketing campaign, and let’s just say we suddenly started doing five times the orders in one day. My dad’s response was, “Shut it off, we can’t handle it!”I also realized that while we were working Saturdays, we were in Newark and we weren’t doing much business on Saturdays. And I said, “Guys, what are we making? One hundred dollars for our entire family?”So I told them we’re going to close on Saturday. And they said, “No, no, no. Let’s do half-days. We can’t close. Poppy would never let us do this.” My uncle told me he was so nervous he couldn’t sleep the entire week. But we ended up doing it. They came in Monday, and they both said, “This is the best decision we ever made.”Q. What other changes did you make?A. Investment banking taught me how not to run a business. People are only driven by one thing, money. People don’t talk the right way, and they’re not respectful. One of the first things I did was read all sorts of books on customer service, books like “How to Win Friends and Influence People” that dealt with how people want to be treated.It’s interesting, when you think from a business perspective what a core competency is, you think, it’s cost, it’s first-mover advantage, it’s trademarks, it’s brands. Often people will say, “Customer service? Anybody can do it.” But the truth of the matter is, not everybody can. We decided early on that we were going to try to be really great. The concept was underpromise and overdeliver. We ship into the evenings, we ship on the weekends, various things to get packages to people ahead of expectations.A. When I started, annual revenue was about $1.25 million and Internet sales were next to nothing. After that, the growth compounded at about 42 percent for four years, to over $5 million in 2006.Q. And then it really took off in 2007 and 2008. What happened?A. It was one of these very serendipitous things. We had gotten a few suspicious-looking orders — one-pound bags of nuts going to CBS. There was a postapocalyptic show on CBS called “Jericho” and the network said it was canceled. During the show, this town Jericho was being attacked by a neighboring town and the leader of the neighboring town said, “Surrender.” And the leader of Jericho said, “Nuts.” So fans took this as their battle cry. They said, “Let’s go send nuts to CBS.” This thing went crazy. At first we shipped U.P.S.Then we did a few stunts. One day, I showed up with my uncle in our delivery van and dropped off 1,000 pounds. Then we hired a trucker, and I went and we dropped off 10,000 pounds. We ended up sending 40,000 pounds to CBS.A. Forty thousand pounds of peanuts in 50-pound bags, floor to ceiling, is a whole 48-foot tractor-trailer.Q. What happened to the show?A. We got a lot of coverage and CBS brought back the show. They flew me out to go to the fall lineup party. I met the actors, went to the set. But then it was on for another seven episodes or so and then they canceled it.Q. Sounds like it was better for you than for the show.A. Yeah. We ended up getting a ton of Internet traffic. When we were on KROC Los Angeles, we got like over a million visitors from that. We sold a lot of nuts to the “Jericho” fans too, but the majority didn’t come back. But with The New York Times and CNN, and the funny press, like The National Enquirer, you get all these visible, authoritative sources online, and they’re linking to you. It does a lot for your credibility in Google’s eyes.Q. How big do you think your business would be if the “Jericho” thing hadn’t happened?A. I would like to think we would have gotten to the same place by now. But I have no idea.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','BEIJING — A growing threat of landslides on ground surrounding the massive Three Gorges Dam reservoir could force the government to relocate 100,000 more residents of the area, from which 46,000 were moved earlier, an expert with China’s land and resources ministry said this week.The official, Liu Yuan, told China National Radio that rising water levels in the reservoir had made adjacent land increasingly unstable. Since the reservoir reached its high-water mark in 2010, landslides and other accidents have risen 70 percent.“Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the problems, the pattern of geological disaster cannot be accurately predicted,” he said. “It’s difficult to know what’s going on.”The dam, the world’s largest hydroelectric project, has been a target of criticism by environmentalists and some geologists since before the reservoir began to inundate a long stretch of the Yangtze River, long regarded as one of the world’s scenic wonders, in 2003. A massive landslide occurred that year, followed by others, but only in 2007 did the government admit that the rising waters were causing instability and that a catastrophe could occur unless preventive steps were taken.Officials have recorded 430 landslides and nearly 2,900 smaller geological incidents along the lakeshore, and 5,386 other potentially dangerous sites are being monitored, Mr. Liu said.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','WASHINGTON (AP) — The International Monetary Fund warned Wednesday that European banks are under pressure to preserve capital and could slash lending in the next two years, slowing growth in the region.The predicted credit squeeze is a big reason Europe is expected to have a mild economic recession this year and barely grow in 2013, the I.M.F, said in a report on the global financial system.The economies of the 17 nations that use the euro will shrink by 0.3 percent this year, and expand by only 0.9 percent in 2013, the fund has forecast.But the slowdown could be worse if European governments break pledges to cut deficits and build their bailout fund, said the I.M.F., a lending organization.Large banks based in the European Union may reduce their balance sheets, which include outstanding loans and securities, by $2.6 trillion through 2013, the fund said. That is about 7 percent of their total assets.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','JERUSALEM — The Israeli military announced on Wednesday that a senior officer caught on videotape striking a Danish pro-Palestinian activist in the face with an M-16 rifle during a standoff in the West Bank was to be dismissed from his post “on moral grounds.”In addition, the officer, Lt. Col. Shalom Eisner, will not receive a planned promotion to serve as the deputy commander of the military’s prestigious officer school, and will not be eligible to serve in a commanding position for the next two years, the military said in a statement.The military had moved quickly to suspend Colonel Eisner from his post as deputy commander of the Jordan Valley Brigade hours after the video was broadcast on a popular Israeli television news program on Sunday night. Israeli leaders issued swift condemnations.The episode took place on Saturday when Israeli soldiers blocked the path of 200 Palestinians and their foreign supporters who were participating in a bicycle tour of the Israeli-occupied Jordan Valley area of the West Bank. The foreign activists said they had wanted to draw attention to the restrictions placed on Palestinians living in the area.The altercation occurred when the cyclists tried to leave the Palestinian village of Ouja and join Route 90, a major north-south artery. Access to the road was blocked by a line of 10 to 20 soldiers. The activists said that after waiting for half an hour, singing and chanting, they then decided to walk peacefully toward the soldiers in an effort to reach Route 90. That, they said, is when Colonel Eisner became violent.The Dane, Andreas Ias, 20, had his lips sutured after he was struck. A Dutch volunteer said that Colonel Eisner had also hit her and a Palestinian woman in the face, and a Palestinian man in the back, with his rifle.Colonel Eisner is not allowed to give interviews to the news media under army regulations. But he has defended his actions through associates, arguing that the activists acted violently and broke his hand in scenes that were not shown in the video. Colonel Eisner has said that he used the rifle as a club and did not kill anyone, and that he was acting in order to carry out his mission and prevent harm to his soldiers.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','A statement from the prosecution service listed the offenses covered by the police files as including misconduct in public office and breaches of the Data Protection Act, involving one journalist and one police officer; perverting the course of justice, involving one journalist and “six other members of the public”; and witness intimidation and harassment, involving one journalist. The Telegraph newspaper reported that Ms. Brooks was the journalist in at least one of the cases, but did not cite any sources for its information.The statement’s list of offenses under review also included breaches of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, a broad statute that regulates the powers of public bodies to carry out surveillance and investigation, and to intercept communications, including telephone calls and e-mails. That charge involved one of the journalists.No new criminal prosecutions have taken place since the phone hacking scandal broke into public view nearly six years ago with the arrest and subsequent conviction of two men for hacking into the cellphone messages of members of the royal family and their aides. Those two men — Clive Goodman, a former royal reporter for The News of the World, a defunct tabloid, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator working for the paper — served brief jail terms.But the cases under review for possible prosecution cover a far wider range of offenses, with a potential for much stiffer jail terms upon conviction, according to legal experts. The 43 people who have been arrested and released on bail since Scotland Yard reopened its investigations last year, most of them with links to two Murdoch-owned tabloids, The News of the World and The Sun, have faced police questioning on suspected wrongdoing that has included systematic hacking of the cellphone messages of politicians, celebrities, sports figures and crime victims; computer hacking; bribery of police officers for disclosing confidential information; and giving false or misleading information to the police.Those waiting to be told whether charges would be filed against them include some of the best-known figures of recent years in the world of mass-market journalism in Britain, among them Ms. Brooks and Andy Coulson, a former News of the World editor who quit after the original hacking scandal and eventually became communications chief at 10 Downing Street after Mr. Cameron became prime minister in 2010. Mr. Coulson resigned last year, saying the pressures of the hacking scandal were distracting him from his work.As the transfer of the police files to the prosecutors was announced, Mr. Starmer issued a new set of “interim” guidelines for lawyers with the Prosecution Service to follow when assessing cases involving the news media. These included the issue that lawyers have suggested might form the legal defense for some of those arrested in the current scandal: the public interest in the information that reporters, editors and investigators were seeking in using the techniques that are now under investigation.Mr. Starmer told the BBC that one of his purposes in issuing the guidelines was to make clear that a public interest defense was possible. He said that it had been many years in Britain since cases involving such a wide number of journalists had come before prosecutors, and that the guidelines made clear that “prosecutors must decide if journalists have acted in the public interest before charging them.”He gave as examples cases where journalists were working on “disclosing a criminal offense” with their inquiries, and whether their work could be “considered capable of contributing to an important matter of public debate.” Legal experts said the second guideline appeared to open a broad line of defense in at least some of the cases under review in the current scandal.But Mr. Starmer noted the difficult balancing act prosecutors would face in assessing individual cases. “Freedom of information and the public right to know about important matters of public debate are an essential foundation of our society, but there are limits for those who cross the line into criminality,” he said.Asked how long the prosecution service would take to decide on whether to charge those named in the police files now under review, he hedged. “The decisions we are going to make are going to be extremely difficult and extremely sensitive,” he said.He added, “It isn’t sensible for me to say, ‘Well, it’ll be x weeks or months,’ ” since there were many possible reasons for delay, including the need of prosecutors to seek more information from the police in individual cases.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','After re-entering the courtroom with a clenched-fist salute as he did on the first two days of his trial, Mr. Breivik squirmed and flared his nostrils as Ms. Engh read out a section from his 1,500-page manifesto, in which he claimed that militants had sought him out for his particular gifts.“If I may ask, what is the purpose of this?” he said of the prosecutor’s approach. “What are you doing now? What do you want to arrive at? What is the purpose? Your intention is to try to sow doubt into whether this network exists.”As Mr. Breivik fidgeted, one survivor of the Utoya rampage turned to her family and smiled as the defendant was forced to concede that the tract, which he mailed to contacts around Europe just before he set off the bomb in Oslo, was pompous and badly written.Mr. Breivik compared the Knights Templar to Osama bin Laden’s terrorist network, saying: “If you look at Al Qaeda before 9/11, it was becoming established. After 9/11, it became established.”He said that a claim in his manifesto that the organization had 15 to 80 members “was just an estimate,” but that there were two other cells that could attack at any time.The defendant sulked at times and showed signs of anxiety and irritation when he was pressed, but he rallied when speaking of his opposition to Islam and to Norwegian multiculturalism.“It’s anybody’s guess” how he will hold up under the strain of a 10-week process, said David Canter, a professor of psychology at the University of Huddersfield in England.“But I think he has built such an heroic narrative for himself,” Professor Canter said, “that he has convinced himself he is on a mission that will carry him through.”As prosecutors chipped away at the question of what happened on his travels, Mr. Breivik seemed to sense that they were seeking to portray him as a fantasist and a loser.“Is it not remarkable that I have been to Liberia if this is a psychotic fantasy?” Mr. Breivik asked.Prosecutors later suggested that Mr. Breivik had gone to Africa for diamonds. The evidence, they said, was that he took instruments for evaluating the stones when he went in May 2002, and that after returning he communicated with diamond wholesalers in the United States and Britain. Mr. Breivik replied that the dealings had been meant to provide “a credible cover.”Lawyers for the prosecution and the defense have said that the central issue at the trial will be whether Mr. Breivik is sane — as he wishes to be judged, because, he has said, a finding of insanity would undermine his cause of stopping the Islamic “colonization” of Norway.If he is found to have been sane when he carried out the killings, the presiding judges can sentence him to up to 21 years in prison, with a provision to keep him jailed longer if he is still considered dangerous. The alternative would be indefinite detention in a psychiatric hospital.'"
"'12-04-19,'0','Her British husband, Michael Aris, died of cancer in Britain in 1999, while she was leading her campaign in Myanmar, and her children spent their teenage years in Britain without their mother.U Aung Thein, a senior member of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, said the opposition’s landslide victory in a by-election this month had given Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won a seat in Parliament, confidence that she would be able to return if she left the country.“She will be able to come back; she’s confident about that,” Mr. Aung Thein said by telephone. “She is no longer an ordinary person. She is one of the members of Parliament.”During a visit to Myanmar last week, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain invited Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi “to see your beloved Oxford in June.”Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is a graduate of Oxford University, and her husband taught there. Her ties to Britain have been politically delicate in the past. During military rule, state-run newspapers called her Mrs. Michael Aris and the puppet of foreign powers. That public criticism has evaporated under the new government, which took power a year ago.Before visiting Britain, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi will travel to Norway, her party spokesman said.Svein Michelsen, a spokesman at the Norwegian Foreign Ministry, confirmed that the Norwegian government was “planning her visit in June.”She has long said that she would like to visit Norway to show her gratitude for being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991. The prize, awarded in her absence, was handed over to her family in a ceremony in Oslo. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest at the time, heard on the radio that she had won.The award emboldened the democracy movement at a time of crackdowns by the military, which ruled the country, formerly known as Burma, for close to five decades.While Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi decided to stay through the crackdowns, thousands of democracy activists left the country, taking refuge in Thailand, Europe and the United States.In recent months, as the government of President Thein Sein has pushed ahead with a raft of reforms, many of those exiles have been returning for emotional reunions with family members they had not seen in decades.One of the most significant changes has been the reconciliation between the government and Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. The April 1 election was a milestone for long-stalled reconciliation efforts, with the National League for Democracy winning 43 of the 45 seats in contention.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is scheduled to begin her career in Parliament on Monday, but uncertainty hangs over her admission and that of the other members from the National League for Democracy because of a dispute relating to the oath of office.Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi expressed objections to the government over a part of the oath that commands lawmakers to protect and safeguard the country’s Constitution. She has repeatedly said that some articles in the Constitution are undemocratic, including a provision that one-quarter of the seats in Parliament are reserved for the military. Her party wants to amend the Constitution.Mr. Nyan Win, the party spokesman, said on Wednesday that he had not heard back from the government on the issue.'"

Formerly a teacher, Jean looks professorial in his dress shirt and tie as he looks for accounting work. But with no money, no wife and no prospects, all he finds is despair.That’s the starting point of “Jean Gentil,” written, directed, produced and shot by the wife-and-husband team of Laura Amelia Guzmán and Israel Cárdenas. The filmmakers do a better job of showing the Dominican Republic in transition than they do of telling Jean’s story. First we see the unwelcoming city, with its new skyscrapers, construction sites and busy traffic. And when Jean’s unhappiness drives him into the country, we see how the lush, tropical landscape — itself dotted with construction projects — can be lonely and inhospitable.Some scenes have power, but there are gaps that leave you wondering. Was Jean fired from his job with a tractor crew? And when was he hired? The filmmakers have no patience for details, either basic or telling. Their elliptical method starts to seem lazy, and Jean’s plight, a journey from bad to bad, starts to seem a stacked deck. Through it all Mr. Genty holds your attention with his sober dignity. Too bad the filmmakers frequently let that slip into pathos.'"

"'12-04-20,'1','For the Knicks, every jolt to the lineup sets off the Richter scale. Stoudemire’s return — expected Friday in Cleveland — could trigger another seismic shift, and at a critical time: with four regular-season games left, the playoffs just a week away and the Knicks (33-29) — who clinched a postseason berth when Milwaukee lost Thursday — still jockeying for position in the standings.“I’ve got to fit him back in the mix,” Coach Mike Woodson said, adding, “It’s my job to push him to help us stay where we are.”It sounds simple. Stoudemire is the Knicks’ second-leading scorer and rebounder. He is an asset, one who played a huge role during winning streaks in February and March. But the team Stoudemire left four weeks ago, when he bowed out with a back injury, is not the team he will return to.The Knicks’ personality has changed in Stoudemire and Lin’s absence. They are more methodical on offense and more diligent on defense. Mike D’Antoni’s up-tempo, spread-the-wealth system has been almost entirely abandoned, in favor of halfcourt sets and isolation plays. And Anthony has become the undisputed center of their universe, averaging 30.6 points over the last 13 games.When Stoudemire returns, it may be — necessarily — as a supporting player, not as the featured star he was once. The Knicks have established a winning formula, and this is not the best time to recalibrate. Anthony said as much Wednesday, after scoring 33 in a rout of the Nets.“I just want to continue playing the way I’m playing,” Anthony said. “As far as anything with Amar’e, he’ll be fine. He’ll come in and fit right in. We just go from there. This is crunch time now. Everybody has to be on the same page when we make our run.”The Knicks’ evolution over the last four weeks has been profound, both visually and statistically — a product of both Woodson’s playbook and the personnel he has available.In Woodson’s first seven games, the Knicks still resembled a D’Antoni team, with Lin pushing the pace, dominating the ball and creating scoring chances via the pick-and-roll. The Knicks still ran D’Antoni’s offense about 80 percent of the time. Once Lin and Stoudemire went down March 24, everything changed.Baron Davis, older and slower than Lin, took over point guard duties. Anthony and J. R. Smith, who both thrive in isolation and love to shoot, began to dominate the offense. The trends are evident in a statistical analysis provided by Synergy Sports Technology, at the request of The New York Times.According to Synergy, the Knicks have devoted 23.7 percent of their possessions to isolation plays over the last 13 games — compared with only 17 percent in Woodson’s first seven games, when Lin and Stoudemire were still playing. Under D’Antoni, the Knicks ran isolation plays only 15.9 percent of the time.The changes are evident across the board. Under D’Antoni, 20.9 possessions per game ended with a pick-and-roll play — a rate that ebbed only slightly in Woodson’s first seven games but has since dropped to 16.9 without Lin and Stoudemire. The Knicks’ transition offense, which accounted for 13.3 possessions per game under D’Antoni, initially rose under Woodson but has since dropped, to 11.2 without Lin and Stoudemire.Then consider Anthony, who has thrived in recent weeks after struggling all season. In D’Antoni’s share-the-ball offense, Anthony was averaging 21.3 points and shooting 40 percent from the field, while taking 18.3 shots per game. His production declined in Woodson’s first seven games. But without Lin and Stoudemire, Anthony is taking 21.9 shots per game, shooting 50.5 percent and averaging 30.6 points.“Obviously, the freedom he enjoys without Amar’e has been a spark,” Matt Kamalsky of Synergy Sports said.Anthony has also benefited by playing at power forward (Stoudemire’s position), where his quickness and athleticism make him virtually unguardable.What does this all mean for Stoudemire, and more importantly for the Knicks’ newfound chemistry? That might not be immediately clear.Stoudemire will bolster the offense, but he may weaken the defense, which improved markedly in his absence. Woodson has said Stoudemire will return to the starting lineup, which means that Anthony will return to small forward, and the Knicks’ two most potent scorers will have to figure out how to divide the shots — a challenge they have struggled with in the past.“I don’t think it’s going to be any chemistry issues when he comes back,” Anthony said. “The flow of the game will still be the same. The flow of the basketball will still be the same. Guys will get their shots. We’re not worried about having to adjust anything.”But the Knicks will most certainly have to adjust. How quickly they do may determine their fate.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','Investigators from the Police Department and the F.B.I. spent much of Thursday dismantling shelving in the basement, in a seven-story building less than a block from where Etan lived with his parents, Stanley and Julie Patz (rhymes with plates). The walls were to be checked for traces of blood, and the concrete floor was to be excavated.“I think that there is guarded optimism that they’re going to find something,” an official said.The search signaled a revival of a case that changed the rhythms and routines of a generation, and that , the district attorney, said in 2010 he would reopen. In the wake of headlines and a widespread search, many parents stopped letting children go to the school bus stop by themselves. Etan, a first grader who was wearing sneakers and an Eastern Airlines pilot’s cap, had pleaded with his parents that he was old enough to make the trip alone. He disappeared on the first day he was allowed to do so.The basement being searched — at 127B Prince Street, at the corner of Wooster Street — had also been used by the SoHo Playgroup, a parent-led space for preschool children. A woman who had participated in the group as a child said she believed Etan was a member of the playgroup.The basement is along the route Etan was to have followed that morning in May 1979. Somewhere between his parents’ loft at 113 Prince Street and the bus stop, on West Broadway, he disappeared.Since then, the timeline of the case has been filled with despair. In the days after he vanished, parents tacked up posters in SoHo, and later his photograph was printed on milk cartons in hopes of jarring memories and generating leads.On Thursday, officials cordoned off the corner, stretching a blue tarpaulin between the basement entrance and the back of one of the police vans. Onlookers took pictures as investigators milled beneath signs for boutiques like Lucky Brand, WiNK and Fred Perry, which now occupy the corner.The stores and tourists threw into dramatic relief just how different SoHo is today than at the time of the boy’s disappearance, when it was gritty and largely empty, with many of the former light-manufacturing buildings now occupied by artists. It was almost as though those taking pictures were witnessing a dig into a distant epoch, one that felt far further in the past than 33 years.In fact, the corner at the time had been home to the cooperative restaurant Food, one of the only places to eat in a neighborhood now jammed with expensive dining options.The current search is largely being conducted by an F.B.I. evidence recovery team as part of a joint investigation by agents from the bureau and the Police Department’s missing persons and cold case squads. Archaeologists from the medical examiner’s office were also on hand.Three law enforcement officials said that investigators had brought a cadaver-sniffing dog to the basement within the last few weeks and that the dog had indicated the possibility of remains.F.B.I. agents were seen escorting Mr. Miller to his apartment in on Thursday afternoon; a law enforcement official said investigators had tried to elicit information from him.A grandson of Mr. Miller’s, Tony Miller, on Friday dismissed any suggestion that his grandfather might be a suspect in Etan’s death.“I don’t think he could have done anything like this,” Mr. Miller, 33, said in an interview outside his grandfather’s house. “That’s not in his character. Ever since I’ve known him, he’s always been a good, hard-working man. He helped to straighten me out and guide me when I was a kid.”Mr. Miller, a trucker who lives in Bedford-Stuyvesant, said that the first time he heard about the Patz case was from watching television news on Thursday.“He never told me about it,” Mr. Miller said of his grandfather.Asked how his grandfather was responding to the renewed police attention and to the extensive news media presence outside his home, Mr. Miller said: “He’s taking this real hard. He had a stroke, he’s diabetic, he’s not in good condition. This is really hard for him.”The night before he disappeared, Mr. Miller had given Etan “his dollar wage” for doing chores, wrote Lisa R. Cohen, in “After Etan: The Missing Child Case That Held America Captive.”More than a decade ago, Mr. Miller invited the police to come in and examine the basement, suggesting that they could tear up the floor if they wanted, but that they would have to pay to replace it, a person involved in the inquiry at the time said. Because Mr. Miller was not a suspect, they did not take him up on his offer, the person said.Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the police, said investigators would tear apart the 13-by-62-foot space, removing drywall and searching the cinder-block walls underneath. He also said they would break through the concrete floor.No criminal charges have ever been filed in Etan’s death or disappearance.When Etan vanished, the police assigned 30 officers and 5 detectives to the case and began what a deputy inspector called a “floor-by-floor, wall-by-wall, rooftop-by-rooftop, backyard-by-backyard search.” They also called in helicopters and bloodhounds.Within a week, the police contingent had grown to 300 officers and detectives. They were handling 500 calls a day from people who said they had seen Etan or had ideas about how to crack the case. But nothing panned out, and two months after he disappeared, the missing persons squad said it had been the longest search for a missing child in New York in decades.In 1983, President declared May 25 — the day on which Etan had vanished four years before — National Missing Children’s Day.In 2001, Etan was declared legally dead. His family filed a wrongful-death suit against Mr. Ramos, the man convicted of abuse in Pennsylvania; in 2004, a Manhattan judge ruled that Mr. Ramos had been responsible for Etan’s death. But the authorities said they never had enough evidence to file criminal charges against him in Etan’s case.Mr. Ramos has been in prison in Pennsylvania since 1987 and is scheduled to be released on Nov. 7. He has been denied parole nine times in the last 13 years. Leo Dunn, a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole, said Mr. Ramos’s last parole review, in July 2009, referred to a “negative recommendation” from the Department of Corrections and said he would pose “a risk to the community.”In 2000, the police searched the basement of the building at 234 East Fourth Street on the Lower East Side where Mr. Ramos was living when Etan disappeared. Investigators carted out an old -fired furnace along with barrels of ash and dirt from the basement floor.Mr. Ramos was said to have admitted that he was with Etan the day he vanished, but denied abducting and killing him.Etan’s father, Stanley Patz, did not return a call for comment on Thursday.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','In Washington, Representative Peter T. King, Republican of New York and chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said people at the Secret Service had told him that “more agents are expected to be leaving.”Meanwhile, in Colombia, a lawyer retained by the woman who got into a dispute with a Secret Service agent over how much he owed her for sex said Thursday that she would cooperate with any official inquiries. The lawyer, Marlon Betancourt, said in an interview in Cartagena, where the suspected misconduct took place, that he had not been contacted by the United States or the Colombian authorities.The woman, who has left Cartagena, was also looking into taking legal action against Secret Service personnel and the American government because, she said, the agent acted aggressively toward her, yelling and using an expletive to describe her, according to Mr. Betancourt.“I believe that laws were broken here,” he said. “You cannot mistreat people.”The woman, a single mother, has described herself as a high-class escort who charges as much as $800 to have sex with men, and Mr. Betancourt said she was seeking to sell her story.“It’s not about making money,” he said. “It’s about seeking some kind of compensation for what has happened.”He added, “Her life is not going to be the same as it was before.”At least one of the 11 Secret Service employees under scrutiny has told investigators that he had not known that the woman he had spent the night with was a prostitute, according to another senior government official briefed on the investigation.The employee, whom the official did not identify, has offered to take a lie-detector test.That account appeared to be bolstered by one of the women involved in the scandal who said that while she had spent the night with one of the Secret Service employees in his room at the Hotel Caribe, they had not had sex and she had not been paid.“I didn’t talk with him about money,“ said the woman, who asked that her name not be used.“My guy never touched me,” she said. “He never gave me a kiss or anything.”Breaking down in tears, the woman, 22, said she was not a prostitute and described how a night on the town had blown up into an international scandal.She said she had gone to the hotel with one of the agents only to accompany a friend who she said was a prostitute. She described the man she had been with as very “timid” and said they both had fallen asleep with their clothes on shortly after they had gone to his room at the Hotel Caribe.She also questioned news accounts that said a large number of Secret Service agents had taken women to their rooms, saying that when the dispute over money broke out the next morning, the other Americans were surprised that an agent had taken a prostitute to the hotel.“They didn’t know,” she said. “That’s why I think this is unfair.”Her account was largely corroborated by versions of the story told by her friend, the prostitute; by a taxi driver who drove the women home from the hotel; and by American officials briefed on the investigation.But the woman contradicted a key part of her friend’s story, saying the friend had asked to be paid only $250 to $300 for sex, not the $800 she asserted in an interview with The New York Times.While the Secret Service employee may be able to prove that he did not knowingly get involved with a prostitute, that would probably not save his job.Defense lawyers and current and former government officials said the men under scrutiny may well lose their jobs because their behavior would cost them the security clearance needed to work for the Secret Service.“It is the classic way and easiest way to fire someone,” said Stephen M. Kohn, the head of the National Whistleblowers Center in Washington, which often represents government employees who face disciplinary action. “For security clearance you have to have a high level of trust and not have associations or relationships that could compromise you. For the government, if you don’t pay your loans or have an affair, you are susceptible to blackmail” and can lose your security clearance.“If you don’t have security clearance,” Mr. Kohn added, “you are usually on the street in 90 days without a job.”The military is moving forward with its own investigation. Col. Scott Malcom, the chief spokesman for United States Southern Command in Miami, said 10 enlisted members of the military were being scrutinized: 5 Army Special Forces soldiers, 2 members of the Navy, 2 Marines and 1 member of the Air Force.It is not yet clear whether any of the military members hired prostitutes, Colonel Malcom said.If they did, they would have violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice, which prohibits service members from soliciting prostitutes. Penalties for such an infraction can include a dishonorable discharge and time in military prison.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','The Obama administration’s new rules aimed at cutting harmful emissions from natural gas wells are a win for the environment, for the public and for industry. And despite what Republican politicians claim, the rules will not impose major new costs or slow what has been a remarkable boom in natural gas production.The rules, announced on Wednesday by the Environmental Protection Agency, are the first federal effort to address air pollution problems associated with hydraulic fracturing. They will require drillers to capture toxic and smog-forming pollutants, along with methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, before they escape into the air.James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, immediately denounced the rules as one more administration effort to regulate gas production “out of existence.” This followed Mitt Romney’s absurd charge that President Obama was determined to use environmental regulations to “slow down the development of our own resources.” The new rules would do nothing of the sort; even the American Petroleum Institute said it could live with them.Roughly 13,000 wells are “fractured” each year. The rules would require drillers to undertake so-called green completions, in which gases emerging at the wellhead are captured and stored in trailer-mounted tanks and routed back into pipelines. Colorado and Wyoming already require green completions. And several major producers are making money by recapturing gas and reselling it, which more than offsets the costs of the new equipment.Mr. Obama has repeatedly said that he favors robust exploration for natural gas, in part because it is plentiful and cheap and in part because it produces only about half the greenhouse gas emissions that coal does. Coal produces nearly half the country’s electricity. But natural gas’s share, now a little over one-fifth, is rising as more supplies are found and prices drop.There are still legitimate concerns about hydrofracturing’s potential impact on water supplies — an E.P.A. study is due next year. But the rules should ease concerns about the process’s effect on air pollution and global warming. Far from presenting new obstacles to drilling, the rules could win supporters for hydrofracturing.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','“The debate is really between the military, which needs a lot of imagery but doesn’t need the highly classified imagery, and the intelligence community, which wants to keep the capability to produce its own imagery,” said Bill Wilt, a senior official with GeoEye, one of the private satellite companies.In the midst of what observers in and out of government describe as an increasingly bitter turf war, the director of the National Reconnaissance Office, the secret agency that manages the nation’s spy satellites, resigned Wednesday. Bruce Carlson, the director, issued a statement saying that he is leaving the reconnaissance office, which is part of the Department of Defense and the intelligence community, a spokeswoman for the office said.Administration officials said his resignation was not related to the satellite fight. But Mr. Carlson was said to be an advocate for cutting the budget for the commercial satellite companies, and his departure occurred as the satellite industry and its supporters on the Congressional intelligence committees were gearing up to oppose the budget cuts.Spy satellites are among the most expensive tools used by the intelligence community, dwarfing most other elements of the classified intelligence budget.When the commercial satellite industry developed in the 1990s, it could not compete with the highly sophisticated sensing equipment flown by the government’s spy satellites. But gradually, the gap between commercial satellites and the intelligence community’s has narrowed.American commercial satellite companies now produce images of higher resolution than they are permitted to sell publicly, and their only customers are United States government agencies or foreign governments, with American approval. Commercial satellites can show, for example, an image of a specific vehicle type or spare tire on a truck, while the more sensitive government-owned satellites can detect gun mounts or vehicle identification numbers.The intelligence community uses even higher resolution imagery for tasks like monitoring the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, but the commercial satellites are adequate for almost all of the needs of the military. Military commanders, who need access to large volumes of satellite imagery for mapping and other daily uses in combat zones, have become big advocates of the expanded use of commercial satellite imagery.“The technology of the current satellite architecture is pretty much at its limit, and the commercial satellites are producing just about the same thing at a much lower cost,” said retired Gen. James E. Cartwright of the Marines, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The government’s satellites are better, but the question is, What do you need? Most studies show that about 90 percent of what the military needs can be solved with commercial.”The military also favors commercial satellites because imagery from the intelligence community cannot be easily shared with allies. “The beauty of commercial imagery is that it is unclassified,” said Walter Scott, chief technical officer of DigitalGlobe, a satellite company based in Longmont, Colo.GeoEye and DigitalGlobe, the two satellite companies with the largest contracts to provide imagery to the government, now have a combined total of five satellites orbiting Earth, and plans to launch more with financial support from Washington. The number of government-owned spy satellites now in orbit is classified, although the N.R.O. has announced that it is launching four satellites this year.Industry officials say that General Cartwright, who retired as vice chairman last year after losing out on a bid to become chairman of the joint chiefs, was one of the biggest advocates inside the government of the increased use of commercial satellites. His departure gave more room to maneuver for his chief opponent on the issue, James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence.The intelligence community has proposed to increase spending on research and development for new government-owned satellites to meet the growing demands for imagery. But the N.R.O.’s efforts over the past decade to develop a new generation of satellites have been plagued with problems.In the late 1990s and early 2000s, it focused on a program called the Future Imagery Architecture, which was criticized by the Congressional intelligence oversight committees for bloated budgets, and which eventually collapsed.That was followed by efforts to build midsize spy satellites that would compete more directly with commercial satellites than the reconnaissance office’s current fleet of large satellites do. But that program withered away after a panel created in 2009 by Dennis C. Blair, then the national intelligence director, recommended a greater focus on the use of commercial satellites.Now, industry officials claim the decision to reverse course and slash the commercial satellite budget could leave military commanders in the lurch. Intelligence officials said the cuts would not have any impact on their ability to meet the demands for imagery from the military and the rest of the government.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','IN the face of growing anger over the New York Police Department’s stop-and-frisk policy, the commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, has faulted his critics for failing to offer an alternative for fighting crime in minority neighborhoods. “What I haven’t heard is any solution to the violence problems in these communities,” he told the City Council last month.Mr. Kelly is correct that high levels of violence are intolerable and that those who would challenge stop-and-frisk — in which police officers use thin pretexts for streetside searches — must present credible alternatives. At the Yale Law School Innovations in Policing Clinic, we have been visiting police departments around the country in search of such strategies. One increasingly popular approach, “focused deterrence,” is among the most promising.Developed by the criminologist David M. Kennedy, focused deterrence is in many ways the opposite of stopping and frisking large sections of the population. Beginning with the recognition that a small cohort of young men are responsible for most of the violent crime in minority neighborhoods, it targets the worst culprits for intensive investigation and criminal prosecution.Focused deterrence also builds up community trust in the police, who are now going after the real bad guys instead of harassing innocent bystanders in an effort to score easy arrests.This strategy was responsible for the dramatic decline in Boston’s homicide rate during the 1990s. In 2004, Mr. Kennedy and his colleagues successfully adapted it to combat violent open-air drug markets in the West End neighborhood of High Point, N.C.'"

"'12-04-20,'1','In light of the slowdown in subscription growth, Verizon will most likely be introducing new methods to continue to expand its revenue from mobile data, said Chetan Sharma, an independent telecom analyst.He said it was inevitable that Verizon would soon introduce shared family plans for mobile data, which would be similar to sharing voice minutes and text messages among multiple cellphones.Mr. McAdam has previously said the company would introduce shared data plans this year.Mr. Sharma added that Verizon still can potentially make plenty of money from data from existing customers who have yet to get smartphones. Currently 47 percent of Verizon’s wireless customers use smartphones, according to the company.Verizon is leading the industry’s race to build out fourth-generation LTE networks, which are designed to efficiently carry more traffic and, by delivering data faster, tempt customers to use their data allotments faster. Verizon says its LTE network now covers 230 markets, or two-thirds of the United States population.It plans further expansion this year. AT&T, its biggest rival, has L.T.E. deployed in 35 markets.To meet the rising demand for data, all the carriers say that they need more spectrum, the government-rationed radio waves that carry phone calls and wireless data.To get more radio waves, Verizon in December made a deal to buy spectrum licenses from a consortium of cable companies including Time Warner, Comcast and Cox Communications, for $3.6 billion. T-Mobile USA and Metro PCS, smaller wireless carriers, have urged the Federal Communications Commission to block the deal, claiming it would put too much spectrum in the hands of the nation’s largest carrier.Verizon on Wednesday said it would sell some of its current spectrum if the F.C.C. does not block the deal. Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said he believes this is a sign that Verizon is close to reaching an agreement with the F.C.C.He said it was likely that the agency was requiring Verizon to unload some of its spectrum before it could obtain the licenses from the cable companies just to ensure it did not have too much.Robin Nicol, a Verizon spokeswoman, said that if the company fails to get the spectrum from the cable companies, it will have to repurpose some of its existing spectrum to work with 4G L.T.E. and buy additional spectrum in order to have enough capacity.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','As an organization devoted to a free exchange of literature and ideas around the world, PEN was pleased to receive assurances from the State Department last year that the administration, too, believes in the importance of “promoting the global marketplace of ideas.”When considering visas for foreign writers and artists, we were told, the United States would give “significant and sympathetic weight” to those seeking to come to this country for speaking engagements, conferences, teaching positions “or for similar expressive or educational activities.”As your report makes clear, these lofty intentions don’t match the experiences of a growing number of international artists who have had visas denied or delayed to the point that they missed planned tours and engagements.The damage goes beyond canceled bookings: more and more artists are finding the visa process so discouraging that they are abandoning the idea of visiting what one of our prominent international colleagues called “fortress America.”As the State Department itself acknowledges, artistic exchanges enrich the lives of Americans and ensure that the United States retains an influential place in the marketplace of culture and ideas.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','Re “Sin of Omission” (editorial, April 13): I share your chagrin that President Obama will not issue an executive order banning discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation or gender identity.While it is the hope that many federal contractors already follow self-imposed nondiscriminatory employment policies, the presidential imprimatur could only have strengthened such a laudatory approach.Color me cynical, as I suspect that this counterintuitive decision was occasioned by election-year calculus and arrived at only after speculation by campaign advisers that such an order would cost more votes than it would gain.This is profoundly disappointing to those who rallied to the Obama banner in 2008 when he pledged to end politics as usual. Yes, it takes two to tango, but here our president has chosen to be a wallflower.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','But Rabie A. Atti, a Sudanese government spokesman, said Thursday that his nation was “fed up” with South Sudan’s leaders and would “make them learn a lesson” for seizing Heglig.The two sides fought one of Africa’s longest civil wars before signing a landmark peace agreement in 2005 that ultimately led to the South’s independence. But Mr. Atti said the two nations were now back at war.“We are not initiating this war,” Mr. Atti said. “The only way for us to teach them is to drive them and chase them out of Heglig and tell the people of the South to get rid of those people.”The comments echo recent statements by Sudan’s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who said that Sudan would “liberate” South Sudan from its governing party, and that the “boundaries of the old Sudan can no longer fit us together,” according to news reports.The Sudanese government and South Sudan’s army have stepped back from the brink many times before. The two sides have clashed over the disputed area of Abyei and fought each other in Malakal, another oil-producing area.Mr. Bashir is notorious for his fiery tongue, once saying that under no conditions would the United Nations be allowed into the vast, troubled region of Darfur and that Darfur would become a “graveyard” for foreign peacekeepers. That region is now home to one of the largest peacekeeping missions in the world. And several United Nations officials said they work closely with their Sudanese government colleagues.The fighting that is now spreading along the north-south border is by far the most serious confrontation in years.Ambassador Princeton N. Lyman, the American special envoy who has been talking with both sides in recent days, said the South’s seizure of Heglig was “a dangerous act that had to be reversed.”“This was an extremely dangerous step by South Sudan, and it threatened a much wider conflict,” he said in a call with journalists.Despite the “very emotional, very powerful rhetoric coming out here from Khartoum, raising the stakes in many ways,” he said it was still possible to head off outright war.Other analysts agreed that a wider war could still be avoided. “Neither side gains from a wider war,” said E. J. Hogendoorn, an analyst for the International Crisis Group, “but both leaders are daring the other to blink first.”'"
"'12-04-20,'1','The story that Nicholas D. Kristof relates, about a veteran’s suicide, is an American tragedy. The Department of Veterans Affairs has made great strides in identifying and meeting the medical, psychological, educational and family needs of this latest generation of veterans. But the need is so great that even great strides are inadequate.It is this nation’s obligation to provide nothing short of an all-out, apolitical, fully funded effort at reaching every veteran with whatever services he or she requires.We effectively abandoned those veterans who fought during the Vietnam era, and they are still paying the price of that abandonment. It is too late to make that right. But we can and must make sure that it is not repeated.The writer served in the Marines during the Vietnam War.Nicholas D. Kristof details how our society has left it to the Department of Veterans Affairs to treat the serious psychological disorders of our veterans. But the “nation’s shame” did not start with our response to veterans. It ends there.Our society has constructed a model in which a small group of men and women take on the painful tasks of war for all of us and unfairly bear its costs.The issue is not just adequate treatment for veterans but adequate treatment for all soldiers and their families. We all know that repeated tours of duty increase the likelihood of developing post-traumatic stress disorder or experiencing a traumatic brain injury.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','The title of a new exhibition, “Dürer and Beyond: Central European Drawings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1400-1700,” presents a bit of a conundrum. How do we get beyond Albrecht Dürer (1471-1528), the ne plus ultra draftsman and all-around Northern Renaissance master, an artist so secure in his greatness that he painted himself as Jesus?We don’t, at least not often in this show, which surveys the Met’s holdings of drawings made before 1700 by artists working in the Holy Roman Empire (an area that today encompasses Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic and parts of other countries). But the offerings should nevertheless entice viewers to look more closely at the art of Central Europe, which absorbed diverse religious and stylistic influences from Italian, Dutch and Flemish art.The Met’s curators are certainly giving the region more attention. Most of the drawings on view were acquired fairly recently, over the last two decades. Just outside the exhibition, in the Robert Wood Johnson Jr. Gallery, is a spillover show of related drawings, prints and manuscripts that entered the collection too late to make it into the catalog.“Dürer and Beyond” was organized by Stijn Alsteens and Freyda Spira, curators in the Met’s drawings and prints department. It includes about 100 drawings, supplemented by prints, illustrated books and decorative objects.The show sets the stage for Dürer with a drawing by an artist he admired, Martin Schongauer, of a man whose upturned gaze is accentuated by the wide brim of his hat. It’s thought to be a character study, but the features are distinct and specific enough to give it the presence of a portrait.Strong as this image is, it can’t compete with what is probably the Met’s most outstanding drawing by Dürer: his “Self-Portrait and Studies of the Artist’s Hand and a Pillow” (1493). On this sheet of sketches the young artist furrows his brow and purses his lips in a look of withering intensity; he wears the same expression in a famous early self-portrait painting in the Louvre, for which this drawing is probably a study.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','“It was nothing to get superexcited about, but relative to what we were experiencing, it’s better than a poke in the eye,” Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Nomura Securities, said of the Windows sales.Another indication of that strength was a 14 percent increase in sales in Microsoft’s server and tools business, which includes databases and other software products for businesses.“We are very pleased with the way businesses are investing in technology,” Peter Klein, Microsoft’s chief financial officer, said in an interview.Microsoft reported a decline in net income to $5.11 billion, or 60 cents a share, compared with $5.23 billion, or 61 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. That decline was mainly due to a tax benefit of $461 million that Microsoft received last year, without which net income would have increased year over year.While its core franchises, Windows and Office, continue to generate profits for the company, Microsoft is struggling to adapt to some of the deeper changes in the technology industry in recent years, especially the shift to mobile devices.Apple, Microsoft’s longtime rival, has been the biggest beneficiary of that transition and, indeed, has led it, with products like the iPhone and iPad. As a result, Apple now has a market value more than twice that of Microsoft.Microsoft is preparing to respond to the iPad with Windows 8, a new version of its operating system that has been overhauled to take better advantage of touch-screen devices. That product is not expected to be released to PC manufacturers until late this year, at the earliest.An earlier Microsoft effort to counter the iPhone has not yet borne fruit. For more than a year, the company has been offering its Windows Phone operating system for smartphones, with little success. More recently, phones from the Finnish cellphone giant Nokia with Windows Phone software, including the Lumia 900, have hit the market to generally positive reviews.Microsoft does not reveal sales figures from its mobile phone software business. In a sign of the difficulties Microsoft still faces in the mobile market, its most important partner in the mobile business, Nokia, said Thursday that sales of its new Lumia phones had been “mixed,” with better results in the United States than in other markets like Britain.While Microsoft has been able to point to its video game business in recent years as proof of its grasp of consumer technologies, that division’s sales dropped 16 percent, to $1.62 billion, in the quarter because of a “soft gaming-console market,” Microsoft said in a statement.The company had been on a roll, with strong sales of the Kinect, a sensor device that allows people to play Xbox games without holding a traditional controller.But the traditional games business this year has not shown as much innovation as in the recent past, said Mr. Sherlund, the analyst, who speculated that the Xbox could be experiencing more competition from games on Facebook and mobile devices like the iPad.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','But the House debate over taxes neatly encapsulated the stakes of the November election. Democrats labeled the House business tax cut as a multibillion-dollar giveaway to the rich just as Republicans are moving ahead with deep cuts to programs for the poor. Republicans accused Democrats of waging class warfare and of supporting economic policies that would mire the nation in economic decline.“We are for fairness, but in a different way,” said Representative Pete Sessions, Republican of Texas. “Fairness comes from getting a job.”The House measure is drawn broadly, allowing any company with fewer than 500 employees to shield 20 percent of domestic business income from taxation. That would apply to more than 99 percent of businesses, including most law firms and sports franchises, as well as partnerships like lobbying firms and hedge funds. Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, said the socialite Paris Hilton would qualify, because she lists five employees in her Beverly Hills company. He also asserted that Larry Flynt’s pornography empire would benefit.“This isn’t about Paris Hilton or Larry Flynt,” countered Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas. “It’s not about celebrities. It’s about small businessmen.”The debate between the business tax cut and the Buffett Rule, which would set a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for households earning at least $1 million a year, had little to do with economic growth. The bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation said the tax cut’s impact on the economy would be “so small as to be incalculable.” Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, commissioned Gary Robbins, who created Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan, to analyze the business tax cut, which Mr. Cantor drafted. The conclusion was that in the year it would exist, it would create 39,000 jobs, at a cost in tax revenue of $1.2 million per job.Much of the debate was on Democratic grounds: Who benefits? The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimated that 49 percent of the $46 billion in tax breaks would go to households earning more than $1 million.But in a sluggish economy, Republicans said that was the price to pay for bringing relief to struggling small businesses.“To say you can’t help the middle class because somehow there will be beneficiaries above the middle class doesn’t make sense to me,” Mr. Cantor said.The gulf between the two parties darkened the push for overhauling the tax code, which Republicans and Democrats say must be done soon. Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, began planning sessions with the Republican rank-and-file this week on a tax overhaul, amid a growing clamor from freshman conservatives demanding progress on tax simplification.And Republicans are in talks about pushing a bill to extend the Bush-era tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 before the November election, and ahead of their expiration in January, said Representative Pat Tiberi of Ohio, the chairman of the Ways and Means subcommittee on taxes.In that sense, the fight between the Buffett Rule and the business tax cut was a sidelight, informed more by the election than by the coming tax effort, Mr. Tiberi conceded.“We’re in a transition period between now and the election,” he said. “Both of these issues are not permanent issues.”'"
"'12-04-20,'1','State tax collections, which during the recession experienced their steepest and longest drop since at least the Great Depression, have been climbing back for the last two years and finally surpassed their previous peaks as 2011 drew to a close, according to a report issued on Thursday.The total amount of tax revenue collected by the states was 3 percent higher than it was during the last quarter of 2007, when the recession hit, according to the report, by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, in Albany. But the recovery has been uneven: 17 states collected less in taxes in the last quarter of 2011 than they did four years earlier.Surpassing the 2007 peak in collections was an important milestone for the states, which have struggled mightily to balance their budgets in recent years. But huge challenges remain, as their populations and the cost of providing services have continued to rise, and the growth in tax collections has begun to soften.“You could say that the glass is half-full, but we have to be aware that the glass is still half-empty, and states still have a long way to go before full recovery,” said Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst at the institute, who wrote the report.The outlook varied by region. The Plains region had the biggest gains, with states there collecting 12.5 percent more in taxes in the last quarter of 2011 than they did during the same period a year earlier, followed by the Great Lakes region, which had an increase of 8.9 percent.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','There is little mystery in how that happened. First, debt levels have fallen. Over all, households owe about $13.2 trillion, nearly $600 billion less than in late 2008. Second, low interest rates mean that servicing that debt costs less. The Commerce Department says that mortgage interest payments, in dollars, are lower than at any time since 2005.Getting those debt levels down was not a simple matter of making payments, of course. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that about two-thirds of the reduction came from the cancellation of debt, through write-offs and foreclosures.But the benefit is appearing. This week’s report of surprisingly strong retail sales in March may in part be because of warm weather. However, it also owes something to the fact that money that once went to mortgage payments may now be available for other things.To get some idea of what needs to be done now — and what the result will be — the McKinsey institute points to two incidents in the early 1990s that got little attention at the time in the United States. Those were the bursting of real estate bubbles in Sweden and Finland. Details differ, but in each country there were two distinct phases of deleveraging.“In the first,” the McKinsey institute said in an analysis published early this year, “households, corporations and financial institutions reduce debt significantly over several years, while economic growth is negative or minimal and government debt rises.” That is certainly what has happened in the United States.The second phase is the good part, the institute said. “Growth rebounds and government debt is reduced gradually over several years.”In this country, the deleveraging process has some way to go, with many foreclosures still pending, but it is at least possible that economic growth is beginning to accelerate. It is clear that the United States has made a lot more progress in cutting consumer debt than has been made in either Britain or Spain, two other countries that suffered from falling real estate prices.To get the deleveraging process under way, it is important for lenders to face reality, admit losses and deal with them. For banks, and their regulators, there is a great temptation to obscure losses, hoping that the market will recover. That was a little harder to do in the recent cycle, thanks to new mark-to-market accounting rules. Those rules were weakened after they were denounced by banks, supported by their regulators, but they still had some effect.Perhaps more significantly, many of the worst — and the ones that most needed to be dealt with — were generally not on bank balance sheets. The vast majority of home mortgage loans had been sold to investors in mortgage securitizations, many of them guaranteed by and and others privately issued. Securitizations must regularly report on how many loans are not performing. As a result, the losses could not be hidden — and the recovery process delayed — as happened in during the decade after its bubble burst in 1990.The McKinsey report identifies six markers of success that are useful in assessing a nation’s deleveraging process. A stable banking system must emerge. After the inevitable surge in government debt, there needs to be a credible plan for long-term fiscal sustainability. Structural reforms may be needed to make economies more competitive. Exports need to rise, as does private investment. Finally, the housing market needs to stabilize.Susan Lund, the director of research for the McKinsey institute, says the two areas where the United States is weakest are in coming up with a credible fiscal plan and in stabilizing the real estate market. Home prices continue to fall in some of the hardest hit areas, where debts continue to be high relative to income. I’d add in private investment. Corporations are generating a lot more cash than they are willing to invest. To some extent, that may simply reflect the trauma of the crisis, when cash was king, and it may take time to solve it.There are plenty of reasons to doubt that the current economic recovery will become self-sustaining, starting with ’s problems and including the threat that American fiscal policy will shut off growth by imposing too much austerity too soon.Ms. Lund points out that from 2003 to 2007, American homeowners took out $2.2 trillion from and mortgage refinancings, a source of economic stimulus that will not return anytime soon. “Compared to the much-debated government fiscal stimulus, this was more than twice the size,” she noted. She thinks the household deleveraging process will continue for two more years.But who would have forecast that the burden of household debt — at least in much of the country — would by now have been reduced so far that consumers are again a source of growth? That fact is a reminder that the outlook is seldom as bleak as it seems in the immediate aftermath of a calamity.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea said Thursday that it had developed and deployed a new cruise missile capable of a precision strike anywhere in North Korea.Although it had been widely reported that South Korea had developed its Hyunmoo series of cruise missiles with a range of up to 930 miles, it was the first time that the government had publicly confirmed the deployment of such a missile and released video of it hitting a target during a test launching.The disclosure came just days after North Korea launched a long-range rocket to put a satellite into orbit. Although the rocket failed, the United States and its allies condemned the launching as a cover for developing intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of eventually carrying nuclear weapons.The North followed that test with the display on Sunday of what looked like a powerful new missile during a military parade. Weapons experts who have pored over photographs of what appeared to be a launcher for the missile have said that it might have come from China, and that if true, China might have violated United Nations sanctions to keep the North from developing its missile program.On Thursday, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said in a Congressional hearing that “I’m sure there’s been some help coming from China,” though he declined to elaborate because of the “sensitivity of that information.”Also on Thursday, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Liu Weimin, said in a news conference in Beijing that China was “firmly against the spread of weapons of mass destruction and carriers of such weapons.” He added that China follows all related laws issued by the United Nations Security Council.'"
"'12-04-20,'1','Still, many Asian nations, spooked by aggressive Chinese claims on maritime rights and other issues, have welcomed a vigorous American presence in the region.The Philippines and the United States began joint military exercises on Monday, including mock beach invasions along coastlines facing China, as part of a strengthening military alliance between the two countries. A contingent of American arrived in northern two weeks ago, the first of 2,500 troops to be deployed there under an agreement signed last year.Thursday, the day of India's test, the longtime American ally South Korea publicly confirmed the deployment of cruise missiles with a range of up to 930 miles, able to reach any location in North Korea. American and Bangladeshi officials met the dame day in Dhaka on security issues. Closer to home for China, in January, the United States sold $6 billion in weapons to Taiwan, and has made overtures to Myanmar, China's longtime authoritarian ally, as it begins to thaw.Perhaps no Asian nation has been more unnerved by rising Chinese power than India.The two countries share a growing trading relationship and are often aligned on global issues like trade and . Yet many Indian strategic planners now regard China, rather than Pakistan, as the country’s gravest military threat. In recent months, India’s military has been wracked with internal scandals and personality clashes, yet defense officials have pushed ahead with a major arms-buying spree that has made India the world’s biggest weapons importer.India and China share a 2,100-mile border, which both countries have beefed up militarily in recent years. But the Agni 5 missile tested Thursday — Agni means fire in Hindi — would enable the Indian military, for the first time, to reach China’s most important cities, Beijing and Shanghai, with a nuclear attack.“All of this, from the Chinese perspective, looks like a movement from balancing China to containing China,” said Graeme P. Herd, a security expert at the Center for Security Policy. He said the timing of the missile launching, as the Chinese government is reeling from a scandal involving a top leader, would heighten Chinese suspicions and also “increases the perception of an arms race, and the reality of an arms race, in Asia, particularly between China and India.”Prime Minister of India praised the scientists who developed the missile and called the launching “another milestone in our quest to add to the credibility of our security and preparedness and to continuously explore the frontiers of science.”The United States, which led the criticism of North Korea’s missile launching last Friday, appeared to warily endorse the Indian missile test. “We urge all nuclear-capable states to exercise restraint regarding nuclear capabilities,” said Mark C. Toner, a State Department spokesman. “That said, India has a solid nonproliferation record,” he added, and noted that India had a “no first use” policy on .In Beijing, Liu Weimin, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, played down the test and described India and China as “not competitors but partners,” adding that the two countries should “work hard to uphold friendly strategic cooperation,” according to news agencies. CCTV, China’s state-run television network, questioned the accuracy of the Agni 5’s guidance systems and said the missile’s 50-ton weight would force it to be launched from a fixed location, making it an easy target.India said the missile could be launched from a mobile platform, a claim that raised immediate concerns with India’s traditional rival, Pakistan, which is also a nuclear power.Mansoor Ahmed, a defense analyst based in Islamabad, said that the missile added to India’s growing second-strike capabilities, particularly if India can construct a naval version of the Agni 5 to deploy on its nuclear-powered submarines. A sub-based missile “can be deployed beyond the reach of a Pakistani first strike, thus ensuring survivability of its nuclear force,” he said.Although that advance would alter the strategic balance in South Asia, Mr. Ahmed called Thursday’s test “China-centric” and said it was unlikely to have an immediate effect on Pakistan-India relations.Pakistani Foreign Ministry officials said they had been notified in advance of the test by India, and made no further comments.India’s military abilities, strategic and conventional, still lag far behind China’s, whose missiles can hit targets 6,200 miles away.The 51-foot-long Agni 5 reached an altitude of about 430 miles in the test, the Indian government said, and has a range of 3,100 miles. By United States measures, that distance technically makes it an intermediate missile, short of the 3,400-mile minimum that defines intercontinental ballistic missiles, though such quibbling means little if China is the aim.“Agni 5 will give India complete coverage of targets in China,” Poornima Subramaniam, an Asia-Pacific armed forces analyst at IHS Jane’s Defense, said in an e-mail. “Agni 5 technologically narrows the missile gap between India and China, while the strategic balance between the two rivals is still tipped in China’s favor.”India fired its first satellite into orbit in 1980, and began its missile development program in 1983.  It tested the Agni 4, with a range of 2,200 miles, in November. The Agni 5 simply added a third stage, the new engine giving the missile greater kick.Analysts say that given India’s skills in launching heavy satellites and planetary probes, it could easily field a missile powerful enough to send warheads over intercontinental ranges.Despite India’s insistence that the missile exists for deterrence only, its range raises questions about the country’s aims and risks escalating the regional arms race.“Everyone forgets about Resolution 1172, which calls upon India and Pakistan to cease development of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons,” Paul K. Kerr, a nonproliferation expert with the Congressional Research Service, said in an interview.He said that when China, India and Pakistan fire missiles, it “has potential ripple effects, and there’s no arms control among the three.”There was also opposition in India, where some questioned the wisdom of an expensive missile program while hundreds of millions of the country’s citizens live in dire poverty.“It is ridiculous,” said Praful Bidwai, a researcher and columnist associated with the Coalition of Nuclear Disarmament and Peace. “We are getting into a useless arms race at the expense of fulfilling the need of poor people.”But the criticism was muted compared with the near-universal condemnation of North Korea after it launched a satellite rocket last week. The West suspects that the rocket, which fell apart moments after takeoff, was a cover for nuclear development, for which North Korea has been condemned by the United Nations Security council. “India’s record stands in stark contrast to that of North Korea,” the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said.That contrast served India well on Thursday.“We have achieved exactly what we wanted to achieve in this mission,” Avinash Chandra, mission director for the test, told Now news channel.'"

"'12-04-21,'0','Gov. of , a Republican who created a stir a couple of years ago with his suggestion for a “truce” on social issues, said in an interview that such issues are best handled at the state and local levels. They become more polarizing, he said, when people try to settle them nationally.“If we don’t address soon what I believe are the lethal threats of our debts, our unaffordable commitments, our slow-growth economy, and so forth, every other problem will seem small,” said Mr. Daniels, whose state did see union protests this year when it enacted a so-called right-to-work law. He noted that ’s campaign was already emphasizing the economy at every opportunity.“The genuine risk to our party comes if we allow it to appear that these are our first preoccupations,” he said.But John Weaver, a Republican strategist who worked on the presidential campaigns of Senator and , said that the attention Republicans were paying to social issues at the state level could cost the party support from several important blocs of voters, including independents, women and young people voting for the first or second time.“I think it’s problematic,” he said, “not just for this national election we’re facing, but for the long-term health of the party.”The risks of focusing on social issues were highlighted this week when the , a business-backed group that pushes conservative laws at the state level, announced that it would be refocusing its efforts on economic issues. Several sponsors had recently withheld their support after the group came under public pressure for advocating voting restrictions and self-defense legislation modeled on ’s Stand Your Ground law, which became an issue after the fatal shooting of 17-year-old .It is not only Republican-led states that have turned to social issues as some of the immediate pressures of the fiscal crisis have begun to ease: and , which are controlled by Democrats, both enacted laws legalizing this year, and voted this month to repeal its death penalty.But Republicans have more states: recent election victories have left them in control of both the executive and legislative branches of 21, while Democrats control both branches in only 11, and power is divided in the others.Many Republican governors are focusing on fiscal issues as well: in states including , and Tennessee, Republican governors have been pressing for cuts. But debates over social issues have drawn much of the attention in some states.After Tennessee’s Republican-led Legislature passed a bill to protect school teachers who review “the scientific strengths and weaknesses of existing scientific theories” in areas including “biological evolution, the chemical origins of life, and human cloning,” it drew denunciations from a number of scientists and civil libertarians. Gov. Bill Haslam, a Republican, decided this month to let the bill become law without his signature.Mr. Haslam said in an interview that the law had passed by a wide margin, so the Legislature could have easily overridden a veto. And he said that while he feared that the law would muddy state policy for teachers rather than clarify it, he had been assured by state education officials that it would not actually change the way science is taught in Tennessee.But he said he also worried that the law could damage the reputation of a state that was home to another famous legal battle over the teaching of evolution, the Scopes “monkey trial” of 1925.“One of the things as governor, you’re always out — I’m out selling Tennessee all the time to businesses and other folks,” Mr. Haslam said during a recent visit to New York, adding that the state had heavily focused on the teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics in recent years. “So you worry about misperceptions, sure. I wouldn’t be honest if I said I didn’t do that. But if I thought it was actually going to harm the scientific standards, I would have vetoed it.”When Gov. of , the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, appeared on the MSNBC program “Morning Joe” last week to talk about his state’s successful efforts to lower its unemployment rate, he found himself facing a number of questions about something else: the law he signed requiring women to undergo an before getting an abortion, which received a great deal of attention this year.“We had 860 bills this session; one of them reached my desk on abortion,” Mr. McDonnell said. “So to say that it was some broader trend is not the case.”So far this year, 75 bills placing restrictions on abortion have passed at least one legislative chamber, which is more than normally pass in an election year, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization. But it is below the pace established last year, when Republicans first won control of many statehouses and a record 127 restrictions were passed by at least one house of the legislatures during the first quarter.Bills expanding gun rights have passed in a number of states. recently joined several others that passed a bill prohibiting restrictions on the right to carry or sell firearms during a declared state of emergency. Arizona enacted a law requiring law enforcement agencies to sell forfeited guns within a year, rather than destroying them, as many local agencies do. Oklahoma enacted a law that will limit the liability that gun ranges face for accidents.Now, as legislative sessions continue in many states, social issues continue to be debated and, sometimes, passed. On Tuesday, a Tennessee legislative committee advanced a measure that some have dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill because it “prohibits the teaching of or furnishing of materials on human sexuality other than heterosexuality” in elementary school.Speaking before that move, Governor Haslam of Tennessee noted that people elected to office have varying priorities.“I think as governor, I was elected to run this, you know, $30 billion, 40,000-employee entity called the State of Tennessee that provides services from managing prisons to educating Ph.D.’s to helping families with issues, and my job is getting the very best service for the very lowest price,” he said. “People run for office for different reasons. And we have some members of our Legislature that that’s the motivating factor, certain social issues. My response is, that’s how democracy works.”'"
"'12-04-21,'0','“One kid called me, and there were quite a few e-mails,” Mr. Pinkwater said.“Some kids took me to task; the phrase sellout appeared on my screen,” he said, adding that he had been paid for the right to his excerpt and never looked back to see what had been done with it. “Others were gentler about it.”While the furor over the test passage seems to have achieved phenomenal proportions in New York — one boy has already posted a picture on his Facebook page of a T-shirt with the motto “Pineapples Don’t Have Sleeves” — it has caused similar ripples across the country.It turns out the same passage and questions, perhaps with variations, have been used at least as far back as 2007 in states like Illinois, Arkansas, Delaware and Alabama, and every time, elicited roughly the same spectrum of incredulity, bafflement, hilarity and outrage.“I’m still confused about the WHOLE thing,” a student from Alabama posted on a blog in March 2010.“Our whole school was talking about that story all day long,” posted Adam from Arkansas, a month later.“Given all the negative feedback they got in other states, they should have pulled this story,” Diane Ravitch, an education historian and critic of the growth of standardized testing, said Friday.“When the kids ridicule it when they first read it, you know that something’s wrong here. That’s the scary part.”The test publisher, Pearson, did not respond to requests for comment about the most recent confusion caused by the passage, which was reported Friday by The Daily News.In a statement Friday afternoon, John B. King Jr., the state education commissioner, said that “due to the ambiguous nature of the test questions the department has decided it will not be counted against students in their scores.”Mr. King also said that a committee of teachers had reviewed all testing material, including the passage in question, and that it had been reused by Pearson as a way to compare New York students to counterparts in other states. Mr. King also said that in the context of the full passage the questions “make more sense.”But more than a dozen eighth graders interviewed Friday unanimously disputed Mr. King’s assessment, saying that two of the six questions were barely rational. (All six are being thrown out.)The crux of the passage is that the pineapple challenges the hare to a race, and the other animals are convinced the pineapple must have a trick up its sleeve and will win. When the pineapple stands still, the animals eat it. The moral of the story: “Pineapples don’t have sleeves.”One of the disputed questions asked, essentially, which was the wisest animal. Some students said that none of the animals seemed very bright, but that a likely answer was the owl, because it was the one that uttered the moral.Others worried that the owl was a distraction, because owls are supposed to be wise, so it would be the wrong answer.The other tough question was why the animals ate the pineapple. Students were torn between two of the four choices: they were annoyed or they were hungry; either one seemed to work.“It was kind of weird,” Octavio Solis, 13, an eighth grader at Intermediate School 136 in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, said Friday morning, bursting out laughing at the memory of the passage. “I didn’t really understand it, why they ate the pineapple.”A sidewalk sampling of students in the Delta program, a gifted program at Middle School 54 on the Upper West Side, reached a consensus that the owl was the wisest. (Correct.) Most thought the animals ate the pineapple because they were annoyed that it had tricked them (Also correct.), and said that there was no evidence that the animals were hungry.But Kate Scheuer, another Delta student, said the jokiness of the story made her nervous. “I thought I was getting it wrong,” she said. “I was second-guessing myself because it’s so ridiculous.”Deborah Meier, founder of the progressive Central Park East schools in New York City, who has lectured and written widely about testing, said the pineapple passage was “an outrageous example of what’s true of most of the items on any test, it’s just blown up larger.”In the world of testing, she said, it does not really matter whether an answer is right or wrong; the “right” answer is the one that field testing has shown to be the consensus answer of the “smart” kids. “It’s a psychometric concept,” she said.Even very intelligent children, she said, can sometimes overthink an answer and get it wrong.A more legitimate question for a nonsense fable, she said, would have been something like, “Is this a spoof? Is it intended to make sense?”Mr. Pinkwater’s original twist on the fable is in his novel, “Borgel,” part of his book, “4 Fantastic Novels,” published in paperback 12 years ago. It is told by a 111-year-old man to a boy who might or might not be his relative, while they are riding a bus. “He tells them these fables from the old country, and this is one of them,” Mr. Pinkwater said. “Sometimes everybody on the bus would get involved.”In the original version a rabbit races an eggplant, and children speculated Friday that the eggplant had been changed to a pineapple because some kids might not know what an eggplant was. Why the rabbit was changed to a hare was harder to explain. There is no mention of sleeves.Mr. Pinkwater (whose wife, Jill, is a former college remedial reading teacher) said he considered himself a nonsense writer, and the test-makers had taken his story far too seriously. “Well give me a break,” he said. “It’s a nonsense story and there isn’t an option for a nonsense answer.”'"
"'12-04-21,'0','Anxieties about Europe dominated this week’s meetings in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Fund officials warned that the euro-zone crisis poses a grave danger to a weak global economy. Europe’s leaders, masters of denial, are still insisting on destructive austerity.The danger was underscored by the latest Brookings Institution-Financial Times index of global economic recovery. The index, which measures economic and financial activity as well as confidence, shows that the world economy has deteriorated since last fall.Europe has been hard hit by its leaders’ continued insistence on austerity for all. The United States is doing better, though it is still vulnerable to rising oil prices or deep recession in Europe. Growth slowed in China and the major emerging economies largely because of the lack of robust recovery elsewhere.Perhaps even more telling, the global index would have fallen further but for upticks in financial conditions and confidence after the European Central Bank injected liquidity into the euro-zone banks. But investors have already figured out those interventions are too small, especially when combined with policies that only cripple growth. Most recently, they have turned against Spain.At the meetings this week, several of the Group of 20 economies pledged $430 billion to nearly double the I.M.F.’s ability to make loans. That could bolster the European bailout fund, but not all of that will be for Europe. And more would be needed if large European economies, like Spain, have to be rescued.At the same time, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and other European politicians continue to resist the advice of I.M.F. officials, including the sensible call for euro-zone members to issue bonds backed by all members. That would ease borrowing for Spain and others. But Ms. Merkel and her voters are still insisting their neighbors must pay for their sins with even deeper budget cuts.'"
"'12-04-21,'0','Asked where a shopper could get milk on a day when that, too, was out of stock, a manager said with sarcasm, “At Chávez’s house.”At the heart of the debate is President Hugo Chávez’s socialist-inspired government, which imposes strict price controls that are intended to make a range of foods and other goods more affordable for the poor. They are often the very products that are the hardest to find.“Venezuela is too rich a country to have this,” Nery Reyes, 55, a restaurant worker, said outside a government-subsidized store in the working-class Santa Rosalía neighborhood. “I’m wasting my day here standing in line to buy one chicken and some rice.”Venezuela was long one of the most prosperous countries in the region, with sophisticated manufacturing, vibrant agriculture and strong businesses, making it hard for many residents to accept such widespread scarcities. But amid the prosperity, the gap between rich and poor was extreme, a problem that Mr. Chávez and his ministers say they are trying to eliminate.They blame unfettered capitalism for the country’s economic ills and argue that controls are needed to keep prices in check in a country where inflation rose to 27.6 percent last year, one of the highest rates in the world. They say companies cause shortages on purpose, holding products off the market to push up prices. This month, the government required price cuts on fruit juice, toothpaste, disposable diapers and more than a dozen other products.“We are not asking them to lose money, just that they make money in a rational way, that they don’t rob the people,” Mr. Chávez said recently.But many economists call it a classic case of a government causing a problem rather than solving it. Prices are set so low, they say, that companies and producers cannot make a profit. So farmers grow less food, manufacturers cut back production and retailers stock less inventory. Moreover, some of the shortages are in industries, like dairy and coffee, where the government has seized private companies and is now running them, saying it is in the national interest.In January, according to a scarcity index compiled by the Central Bank of Venezuela, the difficulty of finding basic goods on store shelves was at its worst level since 2008. While that measure has eased considerably, many products can still be hard to come by.Datanálisis, a polling firm that regularly tracks scarcities, said that powdered milk, a staple here, could not be found in 42 percent of the stores its researchers visited in early March. Liquid milk can be even harder to find.Other products in short supply last month, according to Datanálisis, included beef, chicken, vegetable oil and sugar. The polling firm also says that the problem is most extreme in the government-subsidized stores that were created to provide affordable food to the poor.But with inflation so crippling, many shoppers at those stores said the inconvenience was worth it.“It’s an enormous help,” said Ana Lozano, 62, a retiree who takes in ironing to supplement her pension, who was waiting outside the Santa Rosalía grocery. “That’s why there’s such a long line.”The government appears keenly aware of the twin threats of shortages and inflation as it prepares for the October election in which Mr. Chávez is seeking a new six-year term. The price controls have been defended in government advertisements and accompanied by repeated threats from Mr. Chávez to nationalize any company that cannot keep its products on the market.Vice President Elías Jaua has warned of a media campaign to frighten Venezuelans into hoarding, which would provoke artificial shortages. Government advertisements urge consumers not to succumb to panic buying, using a proverbial admonition: Bread for today is hunger for tomorrow.Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch who studies the Venezuelan economy, said the government might score some political points with the new round of price controls. But over time, he argued, they will spell trouble for the economy.“In the medium to long term, this is going to be a disaster,” Mr. Rodriguez said.The price controls also mean that products missing from store shelves usually show up on the black market at much higher prices, a source of outrage for many. For government supporters, that is proof of speculation. Others say it is the consequence of a misguided policy.Emilio Ortiz, 52, a shop owner, said he could buy sugar and powdered milk from his distributors only once last year. He gets cooking oil once a month, but only about half of what he requests. He also said that profits were so low on controlled products that he must raise other prices to compensate.One of his customers asked if the store had Harina Pan, which is considered the quintessential local brand of flour to use in making arepas, the signature corn cakes that are a staple of the Venezuelan diet.“There isn’t any,” Mr. Ortiz said. It would be like an American store not having any Coca-Cola.The customer asked if other stores nearby carried it.If there is one product that Venezuela should be able to produce in abundance it is coffee, a major crop here for centuries. Until 2009, Venezuela was a coffee exporter, but it began importing large amounts of it three years ago to make up for a decline in production.Farmers and coffee roasters say the problem is simple: retail price controls keep profits close to or below what it costs farmers to grow and harvest the coffee. As a result, many do not invest in new plantings or fertilizer, or they cut back on the amount of land used to grow coffee. Making matters worse, the recent harvest was poor in many areas.A group representing small- to medium-size roasters said last month that there was no domestic coffee left on the wholesale market — the earliest time of year that industry leaders could remember such supplies running out. The group announced a deal with the government to buy imported beans to keep coffee on store shelves.Similar problems have played out with other agricultural products under price controls, like lags in production and rising imports for beef, milk and corn.Waiting in line to buy chicken and other staples, Jenny Montero, 30, recalled how she could not find cooking oil last fall and had to switch from the fried food she prefers to soups and stews.“It was good for me,” she said drily, pushing her 14-month-old daughter in a stroller. “I lost several pounds.”'"
"'12-04-21,'0','Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, has introduced a bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $9.80 from its present level of $7.25. Legislators in a number of states — including Connecticut, New Jersey and New York — are also considering increases.An election-year promise of higher wages and less poverty makes a compelling campaign platform. Unfortunately, it’s an empty pledge: Research indicates that, on the whole, a minimum wage increase simply doesn’t help the poor — in fact, it hurts them.A 2010 study by two economists of the 28 states that raised their minimum wages between 2003 and 2007 found no associated decline in state poverty rates. There are three well-established explanations for this disappointing record: First, a majority of working-age individuals who live in poverty don’t work, and thus cannot benefit from the raise. Second, a clear majority of those who do earn the minimum wage live in households that aren’t in poverty. Third, less skilled and less experienced employees lose employment opportunities when the cost to hire and train them rises as a result of a minimum-wage increase.Advocates for a higher minimum wage are expert at using the plight of low-income families to marshal public support. But the poor performance and unintended consequences of their preferred policy are a matter of public record. In an era of 15 percent poverty rates and soaring unemployment for vulnerable groups, that record should stand as a cautionary tale for policy makers everywhere.The writer is a research fellow at Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed nonprofit research group.'"

"'12-04-21,'0','“It gives us another big-time player in the lineup,” Woodson said. “We’re solid now. When you have an Amar’e, a T. C. and a Melo on the front line, that’s as good as it gets, as far as I’m concerned. I just have to make it work. And I think I can do that.”Woodson quickly brushed off any concern that Stoudemire’s return would harm the recent hot streak Anthony has enjoyed. He is averaging more than 30 points, posting recent single-game totals of 43, 42 and 39 with Stoudemire and Jeremy Lin out.“Don’t change anything — Melo’s just got to continue to do what he do,” Woodson said when asked if there would be an adjustment. He also pointed to the Knicks’ 6-1 record under him with Anthony and Stoudemire starting.But without Stoudemire for the 13 games going into the Cleveland matchup, the Knicks had gone 9-4, with each of the four losses coming against playoff-bound Eastern Conference teams. Watching the most recent loss — by 8 points last Sunday to the Miami Heat, whose big three outscored Anthony, 73-42 — Stoudemire felt needed.“Carmelo’s a phenomenal player, but he can’t do it by himself,” Stoudemire said Friday. “I know the rest of the team is playing well, but for me to get back out there and be the dynamic scorer I am, alongside of him, that’d be a great 1-2 option.”Perhaps deferring to Anthony’s hot streak, Stoudemire added: “Once teams double-team him, that’s when it’s time for me to step in and really give him a second option out there on the court offensively.”But one of the best stretches of Anthony’s Knicks career, combined with stingy team defense, gave Stoudemire the luxury to take the time “to get in top shape” before he returned.When Stoudemire injured his back in last spring’s playoff series against the Boston Celtics, the team described it as a muscle injury. According to the Knicks, the magnetic resonance imaging scan that showed that injury also detected a minimal bulging of a disk, which was not symptomatic, and therefore was not announced at the time. The disk did not pose a problem until the bulge became more severe last month and began causing pain.Stoudemire credited the Knicks’ training staff, which he could not take advantage of during the lockout, and an epidural injection for propelling his rehab this time.“This one is much easier,” he said, comparing the injury with what he felt against the Celtics.The symptoms, Stoudemire said, did not flare up until March 24 against Detroit, the last game that he went into healthy. Now, nearly a month later, Stoudemire is back, alongside Anthony, with Landry Fields relegated to the bench.Woodson cautioned against piling minutes on Stoudemire too soon, saying he would play about 20 minutes Friday night. It raised the question: Will four games be enough for Stoudemire to blend in and then stand out?“I don’t know, but that’s all we got,” Woodson said. “And we’re going to have to make the best of it to get him back, absolutely.”'"
"'12-04-21,'0','Retail sales figures are compiled by the type of retailer, not by the product. At the moment, with Internet retailing continuing to take market share from brick-and-mortar competitors, there is a risk that individual categories may appear to be weaker than they would be if the statistics reflected products.The category the government calls “electronic shopping and mail order retailers” — labeled Internet retailers in the accompanying charts — suffered only a mild decline during the recession, and soon resumed its growth. That figure is reported on a delayed basis, so March figures are not available. But in the 12 months through February, it accounted for $308 billion in sales. Sales were up more than 30 percent since the overall sales peak in 2008, and its share of the market had grown to 7.3 percent from 5.7 percent.Of the 10 categories shown, sales are now higher than predownturn peaks in six areas. The worst performer is furniture and home furnishings retailers, whose sales are still more than 13 percent below the peak. Those products are most often bought by consumers who have recently bought a home. The category that includes appliance stores is off more than 10 percent.But the category that includes hardware stores and building material retailers appears to be recovering. At the bottom of the cycle, 12-month sales were down more than 15 percent from the 2008 level. They have made up most of that loss.At the bottom of the cycle, total retail sales were down 11 percent from the peak level. In the more than 40 years for which comparable data is available, there had never been even a 1 percent decline in nominal sales before this cycle.Of course, in some previous recessions, high inflation rates meant that consumers could continue to spend more money while getting less. This time, there were periods when weak demand meant there was overall deflation. Adjusted for inflation, and using 12-month periods, the maximum decline was 11.4 percent, just a bit more severe than the 11.3 percent fall recorded in the double-dip recessions of the early 1980s.'"

"'12-04-22,'0','The documents — hundreds of pages of minutes of private meetings, member e-mail alerts and correspondence — were obtained by the watchdog group and shared with . Common Cause, which said it got some of the documents from a whistle-blower and others from public record requests in state legislatures, is using the files to support an complaint asserting that ALEC has abused its tax-exempt status, something ALEC denies.“We know its mission is to bring together corporations and state legislators to draft profit-driven, anti-public-interest legislation, and then help those elected officials pass the bills in statehouses from coast to coast,” said the president of Common Cause, Bob Edgar. “If that’s not lobbying, what is?”ALEC argues that it provides a forum for lawmakers to network and to hear from constituencies that share an interest in promoting free-market, limited-government policies. Lobbying laws differ by state, and ALEC maintains that if any of its members’ interactions with one another happen to qualify as lobbying in a particular state, that does not mean ALEC, as an organization, lobbies.Mr. Seitz, who sits on ALEC’s governing board, said he believed that liberal groups like Common Cause are attacking the organization out of frustration that “they don’t have a comparable group that is as effective as ALEC in enacting policies into law.” He said that ALEC was not much different from other professional associations that represent state legislators, and that members were free to ignore or disagree with the group’s policy positions.“This concept that private companies are writing the bills and handing them to gullible legislators to trundle off and pass is false,” Mr. Seitz said. “There is nothing new, surprising or sinister about private-sector organizations coming together with legislators to share ideas and learn from each other.”Even so, the effectiveness of ALEC’s bill-production system is a major part of the group’s appeal to businesses. A membership brochure last year boasted that ALEC lawmakers typically introduced more than 1,000 bills based on model legislation each year and passed about 17 percent of them. A members-only newsletter from 1995, found in an online archive of tobacco company documents, bluntly characterized that success ratio as “a good investment.”“Nowhere else can you get a return that high,” it said.ALEC, which is registered as a public charity under section 501(c)(3) of the tax code, traces its roots to 1973, when the conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich and several other Republicans sought to create a state-level clearinghouse for conservative ideas. Although its board is made up of legislators, who pay $50 a year to belong, ALEC is primarily financed by more than 200 private-sector members, whose annual dues of $7,000 to $25,000 accounted for most of its $7 million budget in 2010.Some companies give much more, all of it tax deductible: , and each contributed $130,000 to $398,000, according to a copy of ALEC’s 2010 tax returns, obtained by The Times, that included donors’ names, which are normally withheld from public inspection. The returns show that corporate members pay stipends — it calls them “scholarships” — for lawmakers to travel to annual conferences, including a four-day retreat where ALEC spends as much as $250,000 on child care for members’ families.At the conferences, internal records show, representatives of corporations sit with legislators on eight task forces dealing with issues like telecommunications, health care and product liability. (ALEC announced last week that it was disbanding a ninth task force on public safety and elections, which was the focus of much of the recent scrutiny of the group.) Each task force is led by a legislator and someone from the private sector. Corporate members in recent years have included , , , and Connections Education, an online learning company.The task forces develop model bills that legislators then introduce in their home states. The provenance of those bills is not always apparent to those being asked to vote on them. But minutes of task force meetings, not available to the public, show how some of the bills were produced and who within ALEC sponsored them.Last December, ALEC adopted model legislation, based on a law, addressing the public disclosure of chemicals in drilling fluids used to extract through hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. The ALEC legislation, which has since provided the basis for similar bills submitted in five states, has been promoted as a victory for consumers’ right to know about potential drinking water contaminants.A close reading of the bill, however, reveals loopholes that would allow energy companies to withhold the names of certain fluid contents, for reasons including that they have been deemed trade secrets. Most telling, perhaps, the bill was sponsored within ALEC by , one of the largest practitioners of fracking — something not explained when ALEC lawmakers introduced their bills back home.ALEC says that its lawmaker members have the ultimate say over its policy deliberations, and that no model bills are adopted unless its governing board, made up entirely of legislators, approves it. But the organization’s rules give corporations a great deal of influence on the task forces, where model legislation must first clear a preliminary vote before going to the board. As a result, meeting minutes show, draft bills that are preferred by a majority of lawmakers are sometimes killed by the corporate members at the table.In August, the telecommunications task force met and considered a model resolution regarding online piracy that had been introduced by the . Although AT&T, Verizon and could not agree on the details, the lawmakers present overwhelmingly supported the resolution in a 17-to-1 vote. However, because the corporate members deadlocked 8 to 8, the bill failed.ALEC’s bylaws also grant its corporate members greater power over task force appointments. They say lawmakers can be removed from a task force leadership position for any reason, while private-sector members can be removed only “with cause,” like nonpayment of dues.Beyond creating model bills, ALEC keeps careful track of state legislation, as well as national issues, and tries to mobilize its lawmaker members to take action. Aides on ALEC task forces keep detailed, color-coded spreadsheets on “good bills” and “problematic bills” in all 50 states, and they regularly send e-mails to alert legislators about ones that ALEC opposes or supports.ALEC also sends talking points to its lawmakers to use when speaking publicly about issues like ’s . Last month, on the day that arguments on the law began, ALEC sent an e-mail to legislators with a bullet-point list of criticisms of it, to be used “in your next radio interview, town hall meeting, op-ed or letter to the editor.”Alan P. Dye, a lawyer for ALEC, acknowledged that the group’s practice of communicating with lawmakers about specific bills could meet the federal definition of lobbying, if not for an exception that he said applied when such interactions were a result of “nonpartisan research and analysis.” ALEC simply offers independently produced material for elected officials to consider, Mr. Dye said.“If you look at the ALEC method of operating, it’s all based on nonpartisan research and analysis,” he said. “They have consensus building, pros and cons, everyone has a say.”Critics dismiss that argument as misleading. Lisa Graves, the executive director of the Center for Media and Democracy, which teamed up with The Nation magazine to publicize a cache of 800 ALEC model bills last year, said that as of last August, all but one of 104 leadership positions within the organization were filled by Republicans and that the policies ALEC promoted were almost uniformly conservative.“They talk a good game about being bipartisan,” Ms. Graves said, “but the record shows the opposite.”Mr. Seitz, the Ohio state senator, said concerns about partisanship, lobbying and the shaping of model bills were beside the point, because whatever emerged from the ALEC process would be subjected to “endless public vetting” in legislatures before becoming law.As for his decision to write a memo raising objections to the Ohio false-claims bill, Mr. Seitz, a lawyer and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that occurred after he attended an ALEC task force meeting and talked about it with his co-chairman, a Washington lawyer and lobbyist who represents the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other businesses. He said he learned that the bill, as originally written, would have been “a trial lawyer’s bonanza,” and so he has been working with the state attorney general to draft legislation more acceptable to himself — and to ALEC.“I expect there could be hearings on it within the next month,” Mr. Seitz said.'"

"'12-04-22,'0','It was not immediately clear if the accusations were part of the divorce action or if she — or anyone else — had notified authorities about her accusation.Reached by telephone at his home in Hollywood, Fla., on Saturday, Mr. Miller’s stepson, Jason C. Webley, 54, said he never heard of any rape accusations against his stepfather but maintained that if Mr. Miller’s ex-wife made such accusations it was probably because of jealousy. He also said he did not believe that his stepfather had anything to do with Etan’s disappearance.In Tampa, Fla., relatives of a woman believed to be the daughter of Phyllis and Othniel Miller said they were aware of the focus on Mr. Miller in the Patz investigation but declined to comment further. The woman, Angela Miller, was not home on Saturday afternoon.The rape accusation — along with other information that led investigators to focus on Mr. Miller — were contained in an affidavit in support of a search warrant for the basement recently presented to a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan, people briefed on the case said. The judge authorized the search — an effort that F.B.I. agents and city police officers began Thursday.The interest of investigators was also piqued by a review of old case files and the fact that the basement floor was uneven or not a uniform color, a person briefed on the case has said. The affidavit was prepared by prosecutors, based on information provided by F.B.I. agents and police detectives, said several people briefed on the case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. It was sworn to by Jed Salter, an F.B.I. special agent, one of them said.Michael C.

"'12-04-22,'0','For example, if you focus on the economy and find that it’s weak, you might think it wise to lighten the risk in your portfolio and concentrate on protecting your assets. On the other hand, if you focus on the market’s momentum and believe stocks are likely to keep climbing, you might try to ride that wave until it crests.But if you look at both the economy and the market, and believe both that the economy is weak and that the market’s momentum is upward, you may not be entirely comfortable with any course of action. Yet if you’re fortunate enough to have money to invest, you must do something. In a report last week, Ned Davis, founder of Ned Davis Research, an investment research firm in Venice, Fla., put the problem this way: What’s more important, he asked, “being right or making money?” He lands squarely on the side of making money, and says stocks are likely to rise over the next six months or so. But he acknowledged that he must balance his short-term views against his longer-term convictions about the state of the economy.As a “secular bear,” he says he is convinced that the economy is plagued by deep-seated maladies that will take years to clear up and that, at some point, the stock market will resume a long-term downward trend. But as a close analyst of technical market indicators, he is advising clients that by year-end the market is likely to rise, though with some caveats.There may well be a correction — a relatively modest decline — in the next few months, his firm has concluded. But it is telling clients that a cyclical bull market is in place — a strong upturn within the longer downward trend.This may well seem confusing. Mr. Davis said as much, reassuring clients: “I remain a secular bear. I am concerned about the long-term consequences of the Fed’s zero interest rate and easy credit policies and exploding government deficits.”Despite these worries, he also said that it didn’t make sense, at least right now, to “fight the Fed and fight the tape.”In a telephone conversation, Ed Clissold, United States market strategist for Ned Davis Research, explained the firm’s analysis, which has a wide following among money managers. Much of the apparent paradox is a question of timing, he said. “Four years from now, you may find that the stock market is trading in the same range as it is today,” he said. But, he added, it is likely to cycle up and down in the interim. And over a much longer time frame, “global deleveraging still needs to be completed, and that will have negative effects for the stock market.”While the market may consolidate in the weeks ahead, two main factors argue in favor of a continuing upward trend this year, the firm has concluded. The first of these is “the Fed” — meaning the Federal Reserve and other central banks around the world, which have adopted extraordinarily accommodative monetary policies and committed to redoubling their efforts if economic growth falters. The stock market generally responds favorably to loose money.The second is “the tape,” the momentum of the market and its individual sectors, which continue to show favorable patterns. In essence, what goes up tends to keep going up — until it no longer does.And there are certainly many factors weighing on the market, both technical and economic.A short-term consolidation might be in order after a stock market rise as sharp as the recent one; in a benign forecast, a modest decline would prepare the way for a bigger run upward for several months, which Ned Davis Research sees as the likeliest outcome. Stock valuations are already elevated, the firm says, and while that may not be an immediate problem, it implies that some excesses will need to be wrung out of the market down the road.ENORMOUS problems remain for the global economy. The European financial crisis has been contained but not solved; further flare-ups are quite possible and could derail the market. Longer term, Mr. Clissold said, reversing the credit expansion and reducing debt loads are likely to have negative effects on riskier assets.Buy-and-hold investors who maintain diversified portfolios and rigorously reinvest dividends and interest can try to ride out these cycles, Mr. Clissold said, and “have what will probably be modest returns” in the years ahead. Market professionals who try to do better than that will need to be nimble indeed.'"
"'12-04-22,'0','Many people might let this one go, were it not for all those other worrisome things at Google. The company has been accused of flouting copyrights, leveraging other people’s work for its benefit and violating European protections of personal privacy, among other things. “Don’t be evil” no longer has its old ring. And Google, an underdog turned overlord, is no humble giant. It tends to approach any controversy with an air that ranges somewhere between “trust us” and “what’s good for Google is good for the world.”But ascribing what’s going on here solely to the power or arrogance of a single company misses an important dimension of today’s high-technology business, where there are frequent assaults, real or perceived, on various business standards and practices.Mark Zuckerberg has apologized multiple times for Facebook’s changing policies on privacy and data ownership. Last year, he agreed to a 20-year audit of Facebook’s practices.Jeffrey P. Bezos has been criticized for how Amazon.com shares data with other companies, and what information it stores in its browser. And Apple, even before it drew fire for the labor practices at Foxconn in China, had trouble over the way it handled personal information in making music recommendations.When such problems arise, executives often stare blankly at their accusers. When a company called Path was recently found to be collecting the digital address books of its customers, for instance, its founder characterized the process as an “industry best practice.” He reversed the policy after a storm of criticism.WHAT’S going on, when business as usual in such a dynamic industry makes the regulators — and the public — nervous?Part of Google’s problem may be no more than an ordinary corporate quandary. “With ‘Don’t be evil,’ Google set itself up for accusations of hypocrisy anytime they got near the line,” says Roger McNamee, a longtime Silicon Valley investor. “Now they are on the defensive, with their business undermined especially by Apple. When people are defensive they can do things that are emotional, not reasonable, and bad behavior starts.”But “Don’t be evil” also represents the impossibility of a more nuanced social code, a problem faced by many Internet companies. Nearly every tech company of significance, it seems, is building technologies that are producing an entirely new kind of culture. EBay, in theory, can turn anyone on the planet into a merchant. Amazon Web Services gives everyone a cheap supercomputer. Twitter and Facebook let you publish to millions. And tools like Google Translate allow us to transcend old language barriers.“You want a company culture that says, ‘We are on a mission to change the world; the world is a better place because of us,’” says Reid Hoffman, founder of LinkedIn and a venture capitalist with Greylock Partners. “It’s not just ‘we create jobs.’ A tobacco company can do that.”“These companies give away a ton of value, a public good, with free products like Google search, that transforms cultures,” Mr. Hoffman says. “The easy thing to say is, ‘If you try to regulate us, you’ll do more harm than good, you’re not good social architects.’ I’m not endorsing that, but I understand it.”The executives themselves don’t know what their powerful changes mean yet, and they, like the rest of us, are dizzied by the pace of change. Sure, automobiles changed the world, but the roads, gas stations and suburbs grew over decades. Facebook was barely on the radar five years ago and now has a community of more than 800 million, doing things that no one predicted. When the builders of the technology barely understand the effect they are having, the regulators of the status quo can seem clueless.Moreover, arrogance can come easily to phenomenally well-educated people who have always been at the top of the class. Success, though sometimes fickle, comes fast, and is registered in millions and billions of dollars. The world applauds, so it’s easy to see yourself as a person who can choose well for the world.In the “people like us” haze of the rarefied realms of tech, it’s easy to forget that, well, not everyone is like us. Not everyone is comfortable with the idea of sharing personal information, of living in full view on the Web. And, of course, ordinary people have more downside risk than a 26-year-old Harvard dropout billionaire.Another hazard is also one of the great strengths of the Silicon Valley: a tolerance of failure. Failing at an interesting project is seen as an important kind of learning. In the most famous case, Steve Jobs was driven from Apple, then failed in his NeXT Computer venture and for a while floundered at Pixar. But he picked up vital skills in management and technology along the way. There are a thousand lesser such stories.If tech is building a new culture, with new senses of the private and the shared, the failure of overstepping boundaries is also the only way to learn where those boundaries have shifted.It is a self-serving point, but that doesn’t mean it’s entirely wrong. To the outsiders, it can look a lot as if the companies are playing “catch us if you can” by continually testing, and sometimes exceeding, boundaries.IS there a better way? Mr. Hoffman says he thinks the tech industry has to acknowledge how much its products are shaping society. “We need something more than, ‘We’re good guys, trust us,’ ” he says. “There should be an industry group that discusses overall issues around data and privacy with political actors. Something that convinces them that you are good guys, but gives them a place to swoop in.”'"
"'12-04-22,'0','“How the Parade Passed Sony By” (April 15) provided much food for thought, not all of it specific to the situation at Sony.One nugget seemed particularly germane to the Washington discussion about possible tax increases on capital gains. The article said: “In the United States, new technologies are often developed by young companies not held back by their past. These upstarts eventually replace slow-to-adapt giants.”Cultural differences with Japan aside, this can happen here in part because under the current American tax structure, capital moves easily to growth companies from “ex-growth” companies. Higher capital gains taxes would likely hinder this flow of capital to young, dynamic businesses by keeping more investor dollars in the slow-to-adapt giants.Surely this potential negative side effect should be considered.

"'12-04-22,'0','The government’s case is simple: Mr. Edwards knowingly accepted the money from two wealthy donors and used it to keep information from the public that would have surely torpedoed his presidential campaign. Thus, the money was a campaign contribution and its use a conspiracy.Mr. Edwards’s legal team rejects that argument entirely: the money was a gift from two friends and was intended to help a candidate they believed in deal with a personal problem. Mr. Edwards, his lawyers say, was not aware of the donations.They will try to characterize the case as being politically motivated. It began under the tenure of George Holding, a Republican appointee of President George W. Bush who stayed on as a United States attorney under the Obama administration to bring the case to trial.Mr. Holding had long been politically hostile to Mr. Edwards, the defense lawyers say, and hoped the case would help his political ambitions. Mr. Holding retired last year, a month after securing Mr. Edward’s indictments, and then announced he was running for Congress in 2012.But some political strategists dismiss the defense’s theory as mere posturing. The case has little political relevance, they say, especially so long after the alleged crimes were committed.“Nobody cares about what’s happening to John Edwards anymore — he’s old news,” said Donnie Fowler, a technology and political consultant who has worked for seven presidential candidates and was a senior adviser to President Obama. “He’s not relevant to the Democrats in Washington or state capitals. And attacking John Edwards for the Republicans would be like attacking George McGovern.”Still, students of campaign finance will look to the trial for new interpretations of how money from political action committees and other campaign-related donations can be spent, especially as the growing influence of “super PACs” is playing out in the 2012 presidential election.The government’s legal team, which David V. Harbach II of the Justice Department’s Public Integrity Section is directing, faces a lineup of high-powered white-collar criminal defense lawyers led by Abbe D. Lowell, a former Justice Department official and Washington insider.Although the defense strategy has yet to be fully revealed, Mr. Lowell will certainly be looking to lay the groundwork for a potential appeal. It is not clear whether Mr. Edwards will testify or to what extent will participate in his defense.Mr. Edwards, who deposed Monica Lewinsky during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, was considered such a skilled trial lawyer that others in the profession would rush to catch his closing arguments.Of course, it will be hard for both sides to keep the focus on the intricacies of campaign finance law when the central story of the trial hangs on a dying wife, an illicit affair and an attempted cover-up thought to be so elaborate that Mr. Edwards persuaded a loyal campaign aide, Andrew Young, to claim paternity and go underground with his own family and Rielle Hunter, Mr. Edwards’s paramour.“It’s very hard to look at this in a vacuum,” said Marcellus A. McRae, a former federal prosecutor who now focuses on white-collar defense work and business litigation. “Because of all these other optics about John Edwards, the jury may be moved to return a verdict that is a general no-confidence vote against him, as opposed to a narrow, legal-focused interpretation of what the law is.”The witness list promises several interesting days in court. Ms. Hunter, who now lives in Charlotte, N.C., with her 4-year-old daughter, Frances Quinn Hunter, is on the witness list for both the defense and the prosecution.Starring for the prosecution will be Mr. Young, who has prosecutorial immunity.In a book that Mr. Young wrote about his time with Mr. Edwards, he described his role as “butler, personal shopper and all-around handyman for the entire family.” He also became a go-between for the money in question. Mr. Young has sold the movie rights for his book to Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter behind “The West Wing” and “The Social Network.”The defense is likely to try to discredit Mr. Young and his book, “The Politician,” which is on its list of exhibits. In an earlier civil suit over Mr. Young’s possession of a video that showed Ms. Hunter and Mr. Edwards having sex, lawyers for Mr. Edwards said the book was filled with inaccuracies.The prosecution list includes more than 700 items, among them voice mail from Mr. Edwards to Mr. Young and notes from Ms. Hunter and Rachel Mellon, the 101-year-old banking heiress who provided $750,000 of the money in question. Ms. Mellon, known as Bunny, is too frail to attend the trial and is not on the witness list. The other donor in question, Fred Baron, Mr. Edward’s campaign finance chairman, died in 2008.Mr. Edwards’s eldest daughter, Cate, a lawyer, is listed as a defense witness and could provide information about what the family knew and offer insights into campaign strategy. Her wedding in October prompted one of two postponements of the trial; the other was so that Mr. Edwards could have heart surgery.One potential fallout may be damage to the reputation of Elizabeth Edwards, an accomplished lawyer and political strategist who was adored for her plain-spoken, gutsy demeanor in the face of the affair and in her battle with cancer, both of which were illuminated in her two best-selling books and many interviews.People familiar with the government’s case say testimony could reveal that she was aware of the affair earlier than many believed and that she helped strategize ways to keep it from the public so the presidential campaign could continue.“This will be problematic for her legacy,” said someone who worked closely with Mr. Edwards during the campaign and spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person is on the government’s witness list.The witness was not sure whether Mr. Edwards actually violated campaign finance law, or whether the trial would change the ways candidates channel money through various accounts.But the witness, like other former campaign workers, was looking forward to the resolution of a case that has been a grueling march for those who once supported Mr. Edwards.“The anger has kicked back in,” the witness said.In this town of 60,000, where Mr. Edwards still lives in a sprawling house on about 100 acres with two of his children, Emma Claire, 13, and Jack, 11, people just want it to be over.Bring up the trial with the writers and fans of college basketball and local food who populate much of Chapel Hill and they look down, mutter a few words of sympathy for Mr. Edwards’s children and try to change the subject. The dream is over.“It’s not merely a death, but a death under very embarrassing, shameful conditions, which is why everybody looks away now and doesn’t want to talk about it,” said Perry Deane Young, a Vietnam War correspondent and author who is the uncle of Mr. Young, the prosecution’s star witness.“You have to remember that this is a very small town, and we were all thinking, at one point, that we were going to be the weekend White House,” the elder Mr. Young said during a recent interview here. “He was a charmer. We were all snowed by him.”'"

"'12-04-22,'0','One day, 20 messages appeared in my inbox: notes from Alan’s friends, who had seen my piece last spring and were writing to inform me of “his passing.” There were links to Alan’s Facebook page and to a guest book on Legacy.com. There I found my counterpart passionately praised, in dozens — hundreds — of posts as “the last true society gentleman,” “the Grand Patriarch of New York City balls,” “the Oscar Wilde of our time.”“Alan,” someone wrote, “your Waltz will be danced forever in the lives of all those you have touched with the love of White Gloves and White Ties. Rest in peace, dear friend, and save a dance.”At last, there was only one unopened message in my queue. Saddened, I clicked it. This is what it said:Ever since reading your article about the other Alan Feuer, I have thought about writing to you. I had no desire to disrupt his life while he was alive, but since he has passed away, I am wondering if you would be interested in learning the truth about his background.The writer, I was shocked to find, was the other Alan’s stepniece; she told me she had known him since she was 5. Her letter laid out the family’s relationships — I knew that Alan was estranged — and then concluded on a melancholy note.While the adult life he described to you was certainly true, his background was far from the one he claimed. If you would be interested in further information about this sad and, I think, somewhat troubled man, please feel free to contact me.Needless to say, I did.JUST north of the Bronx, in the suburb of Mount Vernon, a brick row house sits on a side street, indistinguishably fastened to its neighbors. It is plain in every way — from the single-car garage to the old stone staircase leading to its door. A Metro-North train yard hulks two blocks away.Alan Z. Feuer moved here in 1952, when he was 11, possibly from Brooklyn — the documentary evidence is thin — with his twin, Stephan, and his parents, Emma and Nelson. Emma Feuer was a secretary at Mount Vernon City Hall. Nelson Feuer had a law degree, but according to the family, his main source of income was a liquor store he owned. He died in 1960, when Alan was 18.Nelson’s father, Samuel, had, in fact, come from Austria, as Alan claimed, although clearly not as a blueblood: the 1910 census lists his address as a tenement apartment at 88 Sheriff Street, on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. His occupation was recorded as “saloonkeeper.” Though Samuel’s situation gradually improved — 20 years later, he was a “realtor” and owned a house in Brooklyn worth $20,000, not a trivial sum — he did not forget his roots. When asked by the 1930 census what language he spoke before arriving in this country, Samuel said: “Yiddish.”I never asked Alan if he was Jewish; frankly, it didn’t occur to me to ask. Though he never — and I’ve thought about this since — explicitly denied being Jewish, he did communicate a kind of Episcopalian aura through some unspoken alchemy of his social ties, old-world manners and Anglophilic accent.“Let’s put it this way,” said Neil Teicher, Alan’s stepbrother, whose father married Alan’s mother in 1964. “I was very bemused to see his memorial service was at the Church of the Incarnation on Madison Avenue.”In 1963, Alan graduated from Ohio University, and a few years later, during the Vietnam War, he enlisted in the Air Force. He was stationed in England, and when he returned, in 1968, he was — to his family’s astonishment — transformed.“He had turned into a kind of English fop,” Mr. Teicher said. “He had that accent, and was wearing an ascot and carrying a walking stick.”These affectations were apparently not only for public consumption; Alan kept them up at family dinners in Mount Vernon. In 1969, Mr. Teicher briefly moved to England, and Alan went to visit. There he was, in Swinging London, with his canes, cravats and long, skinny filters for his cigarettes. “He was the parody of a British aristocrat,” Mr. Teicher said, “but among real British people.”All I could think of upon hearing this was that vibrating moment when the young Jay Gatz, not yet Gatsby, sees his future arrive in the guise of a yacht dropping anchor on Lake Superior. Alan, too, must have had a moment, one in which my second self, catching sight of his own second self, let go of Mount Vernon and grabbed the hand of the beckoning Edwardian.I never found that moment. One of Alan’s Facebook friends, an Englishwoman, posted that she remembered him fondly in England during Vietnam, but didn’t respond to my many attempts to reach her. Because I was not his relative, the Air Force wouldn’t tell me at which English base Alan served. His real family didn’t know.A society friend, Richard Rabbito, wondered whether it was truly unhappiness that had caused the metamorphosis, as the stepniece suggested. “Alan had a culturally rich perspective just waiting to be harvested,” Mr. Rabbito said. “I don’t like the phrase ‘reinvent yourself.’ I think what really happened is that when Alan got to England, whatever he found there allowed him to discover who he already was.”Mr. Rabbito, a private-equity consultant with a Continental background, met Alan in 1974, through a mutual friend at the English Speaking Union in New York. Alan was at that point working at S. Wyler, an East Side dealer in antique English silver. In 1975, Mr. Rabbito sponsored Alan at his first society ball, the Quadrille Ball. “He took to it like a butterfly leaving the cocoon,” Mr. Rabbito recalled. “It was his stage, his Broadway. It was like he had found his North Star — his bliss.”Soon, there were invitations to the Russian Nobility Ball and the Viennese Opera Ball, so many that Alan made a list of them with the image of a couple dancing on its cover, like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. He enmeshed himself in the life of these events as a planner and a mentor to the young. “Patiently and lovingly, Alan guided generations of young Quadrille Ball dancers not only in the art of the quadrille dance,” its organizers wrote in a tribute, “but also in civility and etiquette, thereby helping them to appreciate the timeless values for which he stood.”When I met Alan, this was his occupation: teaching protocol, organizing table cards, finding deep pockets for charity affairs. It was unpaid work, and I wondered how he managed. His apartment, on 65th Street near Second Avenue, could not have cost him much: it was a dark cave filled with knickknacks. Mr. Rabbito, repeating what I heard from many friends, said, “Alan always told us he had a modest inheritance.”I asked him if he had ever doubted Alan’s story. “We knew or we suspected — or some of us did,” he said. “But we didn’t care.”He continued, misquoting Thoreau: “Most men lead lives of quiet desperation and die with their song still inside them. Well, Alan’s song came out.”Still, I had to wonder if his “inheritance” was the $1,000 that Mr. Teicher said Alan got each month from his mother. Alan worked only occasionally. Beyond S. Wyler, he held jobs at an antiquarian bookstore and a couple of brokerage firms, but none panned out.“Over the years,” his stepniece, Merrie Lipton, told me in a follow-up note, “he became more contemptuous of his mother, although I am sure on some level he loved her. When he told you, ‘Mother lived too long,’ he undoubtedly meant that, though certainly not because she had gone through some imaginary fortune.”When Alan’s mother died, in 2000, he refused to put a death notice in The New York Times. “We were all at the house composing the obituary, and Alan went crazy,” Mr. Teicher said. “He was shouting: ‘You can’t do this! Over my dead body!’ He obviously wanted the secret to remain in Mount Vernon.”Perhaps, I thought, Alan’s brother, Stephan, could help me see the bottom. Stephan was living in Mount Vernon, in his childhood home. I called him one night.When no one answered, I left a message with contact information for my office and my cellphone. Seconds later, using caller ID, Stephan called me back.He was as rough as Alan was polished. The first words out of his mouth were “What do you want?”I told him what I wanted: to know why Alan had felt compelled to reinvent himself.“I know exactly why,” he said, “but I’m not saying nothing. And it’ll stay that way till my grave.”Taken aback, I said tactically, but truthfully, that I also felt responsible for having helped perpetuate a story that wasn’t true.Stephan surprised me with his sensitivity, his protectiveness of Alan.“Listen,” he said, “you didn’t perpetuate nothing that wasn’t true in my brother’s eyes.”EARLY in all this, one of Alan’s closest friends said, “He lived in a fantasy world.” Then again, the longer I spent in Alan’s world, and the more I spoke with members of his social set, the more I came to suspect that, if his world was a fantasy, it was one residing in the larger fantasy of New York society.I talked to experts, and they told me the same thing: Alan’s world of Austro-Hungarian dance steps and small, unheard-of charities was genuine and pleasant, but it had no gravity in New York; it was not, say, Ronald Lauder’s world of rich industrialists supporting the opera or Save Venice Inc.“These are social events, but not necessarily society events,” said David Patrick Columbia, proprietor of the online New York Social Diary, which chronicles the city’s megawealthy. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that. They may be obscure to someone like me, but they’re certainly not obscure to people who attend them.”I tried to picture Alan, in his tails and top hat, among the truly, if crassly, powerful hedge-funders at a soiree for the Costume Institute. Most likely, he would have been laughed off the dance floor. But, of course, he preferred soirees where the dress and etiquette looked away from the crass present toward some antiquated European past. Why? Because he found it more authentic? Because he had mastered, and thus could hide within, the ornate folds of its chivalric code? Because, as Mr. Rabbito said, balls were Alan’s bliss?I didn’t know, but I was told that the person I needed to see was Ivan Obolensky, the one, true society don of Alan’s world. Mr. Obolensky, to use the scientific term, is the real deal: the sixth prince of the Obolensky-Neledinsky-Meletzky family and a grandson of John Jacob Astor IV, who died on the Titanic.He suggested a drink one evening at the New York Yacht Club. I arrived in a tie and blazer, but unfortunately also in what the maître d’ sniffingly referred to as “denim trousers.” I ran, literally, down the block to Brooks Brothers, where, for an exorbitant price, I obtained the world’s fastest pair of ready-to-wear gray slacks.Mr. Obolensky, 86, was waiting in the bar with a vodka. We talked about him for a while — his Navy hitch during World War II, his amateur boxing days, the preposterous burdens of his name. “It still shocks me,” he mused, “that whenever I go to England, I’m seated at the right hand of some Lady I’ve never even met.”When the conversation turned to Alan, he said, “Ah, yes, Alan lived by his wits.” I asked what he meant. Well, Mr. Obolensky told me, it was common knowledge that Alan wasn’t rich — “I heard he had a small trust fund” — but he nonetheless always found a way to attend society balls. Once inside, he added, “Alan was the man right at the door, greeting everybody, even though he didn’t have a reason to be greeting them.”The old social nose had detected something “studied,” something “roguish.” Alan, Mr. Obolensky said, was a great lover of women and was always, without permission, rearranging table placements as favors to his lady friends.Still, Mr. Obolensky told me, Alan could be “useful.”He presented a scenario: Say some “businessman from Podunk” arrives in New York as a chief executive and has to attend a function at the Pierre. “He doesn’t know bags from beans — he’s a fish out of water,” Mr. Obolensky said. “Alan was brought in as a consultant. Someone would send him over, and he’d whisper in their ear: ‘Go to such-and-such a store. Do this, do that.’ He gave them comfort; he provided ease.”There seemed no better moment to ask Mr. Obolensky if he knew about Alan’s history.“Oh no,” he demurred. “I don’t ask about lineage. It’s not done.”“Well,” I said, “what if I was to tell you. ... ” And I told him. Everything.My host sat back in his club chair, silenced, and I worried for a moment that I had made a terrible mistake. But then a look of wild delight sprang into his eyes — the look, I thought, of a man who hadn’t been surprised in 40 years.Slowly, Mr. Obolensky said: “God bless him. That’s fantastic. Some people just need to be on deck, don’t they? There’s nothing wrong with that.“No,” he continued, smiling now, shaking his head. “There’s nothing wrong with that at all — with being a character.”'"
"'12-04-22,'0','WHITE PLAINS — Entering “Sculpture: On and Off the Wall,” the group exhibition that fills both floors of ArtsWestchester’s Arts Exchange, you first encounter Emil Alzamora’s “Spaceman,” an all-white ceramic astronaut the size of a toddler mounted just above eye level. Arms reaching back, knees bent upward, helmeted head facing down, the figure might be hurtling through space, were its back not firmly anchored to the gallery wall.“Spaceman” is one of 66 pieces by 20 locally based artists in the show, which presents a spectrum of sculptural forms, from figurative to abstract and monumental to intimate. In addition to free-standing floor and pedestal pieces, there are site-specific installations, constructions jutting from the balcony and suspended from the ceiling, and works that are, aptly, simultaneously on and off the wall. (Almost all are for sale, priced from $400 to $48,500.)“This is a show about three-dimensional work in a variety of media and approaches,” said Janet T. Langsam, ArtsWestchester’s chief executive officer and one of the curators of the exhibition. “ ‘On and Off the Wall’ is also a double entendre for the contrast in styles of classically inspired work and work that is derived conceptually.”To assemble the exhibition, ArtsWestchester’s first that is exclusively sculpture, Ms. Langsam and the other curator, Kathleen Reckling, ArtsWestchester’s gallery director, solicited recommendations from museum and gallery directors throughout the county, including Neil Watson and Ellen Keiter of the Katonah Museum of Art; Livia Straus of the Hudson Valley Center for Contemporary Art; Castle Gallery’s Katrina Rhein; Kenise Barnes, owner of Kenise Barnes Fine Art; and Ravi S. Rajan, director of the State University of New York Purchase School of Art+Design. The resulting mix of established and emerging artists range in age from their 20s to their 70s, and work with the more traditional metal, clay, wood and stone, as well as fused, fired and blown glass, and found objects like storm-felled tree branches, a car’s exhaust manifold and nylon stockings. “We were aiming to create both diversity and cohesion,” Ms. Reckling said.While diversity is evident in the sculptors’ technical and stylistic choices, the show’s cohesion emerges through several common themes. One is the female body.There are Jo-Ann Brody’s long-legged, larger-than-life women who stand faceless and elegant despite their coarse concrete surfaces. Nearby, Mari Ogihara’s sleeker stoneware women lounge provocatively. With names like “Sweetheart” and “Kneeling Ardor,” these otherwise white figures, each just a few feet long, are adorned with colorful designs applied through patterned pantyhose. “I think of the clay as their skin,” Ms. Ogihara said, “so they’re pretty naked.” As for their poses — seductive but slightly contorted — she said, “It’s a thin line. I think serenity can’t exist without a little bit of hate.”Susan Manspeizer’s series of wall works serves as a metaphor for aging women. These seemingly impossibly folded and looping constructions of bent and painted wood are based on the concept of a shell, which Ms. Manspeizer, one of the show’s older artists, described as “the remainder of an organism that was once something else, and whose primary function is no more.” In some of the pieces, such as “Hidden Shell” and “Occupied,” a smaller form is contained within the larger. “They have become shelters for other living things,” Ms. Manspeizer said. This re-purposing, she noted, is echoed in the wood itself, which was once a living substance, and in the works’ placement inside the one-time vault in the Arts Exchange, which was formerly a bank. “There is so much to be said about aging and how one looks at it,” Ms. Manspeizer said. “I see it very positively.”'"
"'12-04-22,'0','The protagonist of Mark Allen Smith’s weird but transfixing first novel, THE INQUISITOR (Holt, $27), takes great pride in his work. He does his research, attends to details, keeps scrupulous records and, all things considered, gives honest value for his services. The chosen name of this consummate professional is Geiger, and the awkward thing is, he’s in the torture business.Geiger, who has an uncanny gift for separating truth from lies, deals in “information retrieval” for an assortment of corporate clients and shady individuals, but he has little use for electroshock or waterboarding or any of the extreme methods employed by other practitioners of his grim trade. His peculiar specialty is psychological torture — the whispers in the dark, the subtle threats, the promise of punishment — and he’s so good at it that his C.I.A. code name, “the Inquisitor,” elevates him to “the royalty of torture.” Not even Harry Boddicker, the nebbishy guy who serves as his business manager, knows where Geiger came from or how he acquired his skills. But there are broad hints (“Pain had made him who he was”) that he knew violence as a boy, which may explain why he refuses to interrogate children.Geiger’s solitary and compulsively disciplined life is thrown askew when a client who was supposed to drop off a suspected art thief delivers the man’s 12-year-old son instead. In “an act of spontaneous grace,” Geiger thrashes the duplicitous client and takes Ezra Matheson (and the violin case he’s clutching) to the austere home he shares with a one-eyed cat. Man and boy bond over music and cat, and Geiger becomes Ezra’s protector in a nerve-racking race with the villains hunting the boy and his father.The plot device is a clever variant on the sentimental motif of the tough old gunslinger who earns redemption for his sins by becoming the guardian of a defenseless child. But although he successfully transforms Geiger into a sympathetic hero by sending him into battle against extremely nasty foes, Smith isn’t about to give up his original torture scheme. The curious result is something like an X-rated Disney movie — extremely graphic scenes of physical violence and mental suffering embedded in a rather sweet adventure story about a damaged man who heals himself by saving a child from a similar fate.You know the streets are safe when Joseph Wambaugh is on the job. HARBOR NOCTURNE (Mysterious Press/Grove/Atlantic, $27) is the latest in the author’s great (on the way to immortal) police procedurals about the cops at Hollywood Station who take the dangerous shift that begins at sunset. Heat-seeking patrol officers like “Hollywood Nate” Weiss, gutsy Sophie Branson and those surfer dudes, Flotsam and Jetsam, are dismissive of department regulations and indifferent to danger, so every tour is a big thrill.Wambaugh’s trick is to weave actual police shoptalk into a narrative that shows Los Angeles going to the dogs. The melancholy composition heard here is the lament of a young longshoreman named Dinko Babich for the glory days of San Pedro, the old harbor district settled by Croatians and Italians but now overrun with violent gangs and crushed by the drug culture. Dinko’s love for a Mexican girl who is destined for the sex trade triggers a grim story involving human trafficking, prostitution rings and the peculiar sexual fetish of a Russian mobster that gets the attention of the cops. The way Wambaugh tells his politically incorrect tale, if it weren’t so terribly sad, it would be awfully funny.'"
"'12-04-22,'0','This comes after years during which all signs seemed to be suggesting that travel agents would soon go the way of telex operators. And it’s true that the numbers are stark: During the industry’s peak years of the mid-1990s, there were about 34,000 retail locations booking trips. Today, there are 14,000 to 15,000, according to PhoCusWright. In 2009 alone, in the throes of the recession, bookings through traditional agencies plummeted by 23 percent.But now, some green shoots. An improving economy and the corporate travel that goes with it seem to be converging with a population for whom booking travel online has become increasingly onerous and time-consuming. Just how time-consuming? Steve Peterson, the global travel and transportation leader for the Institute for Business Value, set out to answer that very question. In a survey of more than 2,000 travelers worldwide, 20 percent said it took them more than five hours to search and book travel online. Nearly half said it required more than two hours.No one expects agency business to rebound to pre-Internet levels, but recent signs — like the fact that leisure travelers accounted for a 10 percent bump in sales in 2010 (a bit less in 2011) — suggest that agents can still play a relevant role. And though no one has been keeping track of the reasons travelers are turning to actual human beings, Mr. Peterson suspected it might have something to do with the drawbacks of the Web. “It’s come to a point that it’s too much information to be confident that they have the ability to book the lowest fare,” or uncover the best place to stay, he said of the respondents. “Consumers are hungry for that one-and-done shopping experience.”As it turns out, after years of losing ground to online sites, a new breed of tech savvy, specialized and collaborative agent has emerged.“This whole idea that I go to a travel adviser to tell me what to do — those days are long gone,” said Matthew Upchurch, the chief executive of Virtuoso, a network of more than 330 upscale agencies. A contemporary travel agent expects customers to have done their homework, he said: “You’ve done a lot of research, now how do we work together?”Agents today also know they must set themselves apart from the Web by offering special experiences that consumers can’t easily get on their own, like after-hours tours of the Sistine Chapel, tee times on P.G.A. courses normally closed to the public or the ability to pull some strings to get clients into that sold-out hotel or on the next flight out when bad weather strikes.Such services often come with fees that range widely from $25 to book an airline ticket to $12,000 annual retainers. But even for budget travelers, the overall experience can offer better value, as my colleague Seth Kugel found in a recent test of agents versus online search engines. Agents won “nearly every time,” he wrote, “on both price (the objective part of the test) and service (what you might call the essay question). In other words, the agents suggested alternate routes, gave advice on visas and just generally acted, well, more human than their computer counterparts.”Comfortable with technology and accustomed to information on demand, new agents respond to clients around the clock through text, e-mail, cellphone and . And when they are not inspecting new hotels or touring the latest , they are often blogging about recent trips or posting their photos to . Having grown up booking their own travel online, they understand the skepticism new clients may have about whether an agent can do any better and look for opportunities to wow them. Here are a handful of young, up-and-coming agents who have been identified as rising stars by trade publications, peer reviews and the agent community at large for their travel know-how, customer service and budding expertise.Planning Fee Up to $150, depending on the complexity, applied toward the trip’s cost.Back Story Having worked with American Express Platinum card members for the last five years, Ms. Bower is used to handling complex itineraries for demanding clients, and pushing the envelope on their behalf. Take the time she persuaded a hot hotel in the Alps to waive its minimum stay requirement for a client who wanted to stay only a couple of days. “I spent countless hours and days on the phone with the property,” she said. “Luckily, the effort paid off.”Ms. Brower was one of the first agents in 2007 to be hired under the American Express Travel Research Apprentice program, designed to mold young talent into experienced travel counselors. A year after going through the 12-month curriculum, which includes training on everything from customer service to booking systems, she was named an American Express Pacesetter, an award presented to the top 5 percent of performers in sales and customer service; she has received the award every year for the last three years.On Her Radar Croatia. Affordable (compared with Western Europe), with gorgeous beaches, historic architecture, good food, “it’s definitely becoming one of the Mediterranean’s hottest destinations,” she said.Travel Tip The best way to get a quick shot of authentic local culture is to visit an outdoor market or grocery store.  “Markets are a terrific place to see real people, living real lives, and there are tons of interesting foods and packaging to check out,” she said.Planning Fee $75 to $175 an hour or clients can negotiate an annual flat fee.Back Story By focusing on a small portfolio of cruise lines that includes Princess, Cunard, Norwegian, Carnival and Crystal, and by sailing several times a year, Mr. Coleman has come to know many of those ships intimately, sussing out everything from the must-do shore excursions to what the various cabins are like.In college, Mr. Coleman trained for a job in theatrical production and stage management. Although his career took a very different path, he said there were many parallels between producing a show for the theater and advising travelers on their vacations. Travel consulting, he said, is just “producing an enjoyable and entertaining experience for the audience.“For me, that means delivering a memorable and flawless vacation for my clients,” he said.Mr. Coleman’s efforts have not been unrecognized: He was cited as one of the top 25 agents of 2010 by Travel Agent magazine; in the same year he was named the 2010 Young Professional of the Year by the American Society of Travel Agents; and last year he received the 2011 Industry Activist Trendsetter Award from TravelAge West magazine for notable achievements in support of travel agents.On His Radar “The buzz I’m hearing for 2012 is longer, more exotic cruise itineraries, especially South America and Asia,” he said. “I’ve also seen a spike in interest for British Isles and London; lots of interest surrounding the Olympics this summer.”Travel Tip Some ships have tiered decks, like a wedding cake, with lower decks that stick out the farthest, he said. If you like the sun, choose an extended balcony on the lower decks.Planning Fee $250 a couple or family, in addition to hourly fees for concierge services and additional research.Back Story While working as a commercial property broker at Lloyd’s of London, Ms. Douglas earned the nickname Jet Set Julia for her weekend escapes to Berlin, the French Alps, Edinburgh and so on. After becoming the de facto travel adviser for her friends, family and colleagues, she decided to make it her career. In 2005, she moved from London to Chicago and established Jet Set World Travel, which she describes as a luxury travel consultancy and concierge service, often surprising clients with special touches like airport transfers in Bentleys, “triple-room upgrades” and bubble baths drawn upon arrival.She has personally visited 46 countries and is on the road at least seven days out of every month, inspecting new hotels and destinations. Next month she is off for a nine-night trip to Botswana, where she will be staying at eight safari camps to make sure they are up to snuff for her guests. “We won’t unpack,” she said. “Between game drives, we’re moving every afternoon after lunch.”Last year, she was recognized by the Virtuoso luxury travel network with a “rising star” award.On Her Radar Bhutan, where a new domestic airport that opened in the Bumthang Valley offers better access to more of the country.Travel Tip “Build loyalty with an airline or hotel group so you are well taken care of,” she said. “We have many Executive Platinum American Airlines clients, and the reservation agents have been with American for 20-plus years and know the traveler intimately, secure upgrades immediately, always find award availability and accommodate changes while in transit.”Planning Fee $50 and up, depending on the trip’s length and complexity.Back Story Ms. Jenkins, who studied international relations in college, has traveled throughout Mexico and South America and toured Europe while living and studying in Madrid. Though she is the youngest agent in her office by at least 10 years, she knows how to work her travel connections to gain special access for her clients, whether it is setting up an after-hours tour of the Sistine Chapel or getting someone into a sold-out hotel.“Challenging situations are more easily overcome, and demanding clients more easily satisfied, when you have partners on your side,” she said, noting that she always calls a hotel the day before clients check in to confirm that everything is set for their arrival and to see if they can be upgraded.“By touching base,” she said, “I never leave any added benefit on the table that my clients could be receiving.” She was listed among Travel Agent magazine’s top 35 travel agents under 30 in 2011, and is on the steering committee for the Young Leaders Conference at Luxury Travel Expo, an invitation-only event designed to bring high-end travel advisers together with premium hotels, cruises and tour operators.On Her Radar Adventure trips like sky diving in New Zealand or hiking Machu Picchu. “So many of my contemporaries are really looking for experiential travel — to take bigger or more exotic trips before settling down,” she said. “Taking the ‘bucket list’ trips instead of saying we’ll wait until we are older to do it.”Travel Tip When flying to Europe from the United States, book the hotel room a night early. That way, when you arrive at 6 a.m. and your body thinks it is 1 a.m., she said, you can have breakfast delivered to your room, then take a nap to avoid jet lag.Back Story For Mr. McGredy, vacation planning is not just about sending people to great places, but also imagining the most mundane details of his clients’ trips and planning around them. “That means we look at the little things that you don’t tend to think of as a traveler, like the added taxi cost of staying in this place versus that, depending on your itinerary,” he said.With a background in Web development for Fortune 500 companies, Mr. McGredy said he, like many in his generation, believed that “things are faster, easier and a better value when you do all of the work yourself online.” But after trading some Web development work for a stake in a travel agency, he learned that there were advantages to using an agent. “Not only was I saving myself hours of searching and frustration as I tried to find travel that suited my needs and fit within my budget, but I found that all of a sudden I was being treated like a high-value customer wherever I went, with special treatment — like free breakfast or a room upgrade when I checked in. I feel like this is something that my generation is missing out on, and so I want to focus on ways to show this world to them.”Last year, Mr. McGredy was named the Young Professional of the Year by the American Society of Travel Agents.On His Radar Family adventure travel. “We’re seeing a lot more of the family trip to Costa Rica or Peru,” he said. “We’re also finding with high airfares that people are seeing the value in spending a little more to take their vacation someplace exotic. Since going to Hawaii or Cancun can run you anywhere from $800 to $1,000 per person for airfare, many clients are opting to spend an extra $200 to $500 per person and go to Australia, Europe or even Africa.”Travel Tip Buy travel insurance. “I know it makes me sound like the guy at the electronics store trying to push the extended warranty, but I have so many examples where it has saved clients so much money,” he said.Back Story Under the wing of her mentor, Kimberly Wilson-Wetty, a co-president of Valerie Wilson Travel, a well-established luxury agency in New York, Ms. Prentiss plans custom vacations for well-heeled clients looking for V.I.P. attention. Through the company’s deep-rooted connections with airlines, resorts and tour guides, she secures exclusive rates and special treatment for her clients whether it is an overwater bungalow in Bora Bora for less, a private dinner for two in an ancient temple in Cambodia or getting a family of five into a sold-out resort two weeks before Christmas.“It is imperative to keep in touch and maintain good relationships with our representatives because they do so much to assist me and ultimately my clients,” she said.Last year she was named one of the top 35 travel agents under 30 by Travel Agent magazine.On Her Radar Myanmar, as a newer destination that has opened its arms to travelers. “It offers an element of mystery and romance whether visiting sacred sites, river cruising or walking through bustling markets,” she said.Travel Tip Plan ahead for greater flexibility and better rates.  “This advice seems very simple but believe it or not, sometimes even my clients think they can get a better deal by booking last minute,” Ms. Prentiss said.LETTING SOMEBODY ELSE DO THE WORKHow to Find an AgentWord of mouth is often best. If that fails, a number of online matchmaking services connect vacationers with experts in the place they are going or in the kind of trip they want. At Tripology.com, travelers describe their interests through online forms and then receive e-mail alerts with up to three itinerary proposals from competing agents.Additionally, agency groups such as Travel Leaders and Travel Savers offer online databases to help you find an agent. And AmexTravelResources.com allows users to search by destination and interest for American Express agents with corresponding expertise.Travel magazines are another place to look. Travel + Leisure and Condé Nast Traveler each identify top travel agents annually in print and online.What to Look ForIn short: someone who has been where you want to go. Agents flash various credentials around — C.T.C. (certified travel counselor), L.C.S. (luxury cruise specialist), C.L.S. (certified lifestyle specialist) — but, as Tony Gonchar, chief executive of the American Society of Travel Agents, put it, “The three-letter acronym has less influence over the reason why you’d go to one professional over another than their reputation and experience.”It also doesn’t hurt if the agent is a member of a major travel consortium, which often has access to special negotiated rates from partner hotels, airlines or cruises. (Virtuoso, for example, offers guaranteed amenities ranging from free cocktails upon arrival to spa services at more than 900 luxury hotels.)Keep in mind that the relationship between agents and hotels, cruise lines and other travel suppliers is a two-way street. The suppliers benefit from agent referrals and often pass those benefits on to customers. But the agents can benefit, too, with kickbacks or discounts. Nevertheless, good agents won’t risk a client’s experience on one hotel or cruise line just because of some kickback. Feel free to ask whether and how your agent is benefiting from your itinerary.Also, don’t be shy about asking for references from past clients.What Should You Pay?Fees vary widely based on everything from the agent’s experience to the complexity of the trip. But how much travelers pay should generally correspond to the services provided — say, $100 or so to plan a basic weeklong vacation to $500 or more for a major multiweek group trip with detailed custom itineraries, not including the actual cost of the trip.There are exceptions to this rule. Bill Fischer, the New York travel agent with a famously unlisted phone number, charges a $100,000 membership fee for his services and a $25,000 annual retainer. Jacyln Sienna India, 30, commands a $12,000 annual retainer for her personalized travel services, planning every detail of her clients’ trips down to creating a custom soundtrack for their flight.'"
"'12-04-22,'0','From the first slave ship arriving in harbor, America stole and judged blacks. Black life that didn’t fit into white logic was commercially exploited or lynched. Slave bodies lied to their masters. Denied dancing and musical instruments, slaves expressed a hidden tradition of musicality and poetics by tongue and signal. The trickster was born. In his new work of literary and cultural criticism, “The Grey Album: On the Blackness of Blackness,” the accomplished poet Kevin Young unearths, orchestrates, improvises and imagines lies and more lies — in short, American history.Young places the trickster near the axis of black American culture. “A tradition of counterfeit and fiction, of storying,” he writes, “has just as much place in African-­American letters as our rituals of church or prayer or music.” Separated from their families, blacks created a communal story from fragments. Condescended to, suppressed, effaced, ripped off and covered, black artists have resorted throughout American history to subversive styles of artistic expression largely revolving around the “trickster” as mask and music. How much of Young the Author is in the trickster tradition? He’s escaping even as he’s explaining. “The desire to escape America is as American as you can get,” a friend warns him.One rides Young’s groove from slavery to hip-hop, a line that looks like this: the slave poet Phillis Wheatley, whose authorship had to be proved by white “experts” before her book could be published; another slave poet, George ­Moses Horton, who sold his poetry in thwarted attempts to buy his own freedom; the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, in whom Young sees “modernism’s not-so-modest beginnings”; Zora Neale Hurston, who “collected ‘lies’ as a folklorist but lied just to get by”; Robert Johnson, evoked via W. E. B. Du Bois’s description of “two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder”; Louis Armstrong (“entertainer is no less a mask than cool is for those who came later”); bebop, which Young sees as the early flowering of a “postmodern black aesthetic”; the obscured Beat poet Bob Kaufman (“anonymity is not indeterminacy, but rather, namelessness as a state of grace, an acceptance of being part of the unnameable universe”); Otis Redding, who reverse-engineered the Rolling Stones’ “Satisfaction,” laying bare its black influences; Jimi Hendrix, who commandeered the national anthem, turning it into a “benediction”; Afrika Bambaataa, sampler of Kraftwerk, who “renamed himself in order to craft something interplanetary, his earlier identity erased so effectively few if any know it”; Lauryn Hill, whose “Mis­education” album represents “the possibilities of a post-soul aesthetic”; Jay-Z (“the maker as mogul, translating the street game to the corporate one — and making this somehow the stuff of realness”); N.W.A., following in the Jamaican and African-American tradition of “bragging and hyperbole as a form of critique”; Danger Mouse, the D.J. who merged the vocals from Jay-Z’s “Black Album” with the unlicensed beats from the Beatles’ “White Album” to create his own illicit “Grey Album,” which gives Young’s book its name.What does the trickster-curator want? For one thing, to overthrow the literary executor of black writing. To Young, white critics who read slave narratives “simply in terms of authenticity do two quite damaging things: first, they read (white) skepticism back into the slave’s writing and thus limit the ‘freedom’ of black authorship; second, they ignore or downplay the African-American trickster tradition, itself related to black rhetorical strategies like lying.” It is not just creation per se but specifically creation of the counterfeit that “provides a means of black acquisition of authority (even as so-called authenticity is called into question).”The figure in the carpet is “the notion of lying — the artful dodge, faking it till you make it — the forging of black lives and selves in all their forms.” This lying can manifest in the “storying” of Hurston, “the ‘lies’ black folks tell to amuse themselves and to explain their origins,” or in “counterfeiting,” a term Young uses to “discuss ways in which black writers create their own authority in order to craft their own, alternative system of literary currency and value, so to speak, functioning both within and without the dominant, supposed gold-standard system of American culture. . . . For the black author, and even the ex-slave narrator, creativity has often lain with the lie — forging an identity, ‘making’ one, but ‘lying’ about one too.” Young is “interested in the ways in which black folks use fiction in its various forms to free themselves from the bounds of fact.”The problem is, one reads the scholarship and misses the party. A potentially incendiary throw-down gets lost in a redundancy of too-long, too-close readings. Black life has taught America how revolutionary pleasure is against the capitalism of the Pilgrim, the plantation and plagiarism. “Pleasure is a revolutionary act in the face of pain,” Young argues. “Hip-hop at its zenith insists on thinking and dancing simultaneously. In fact, it sees them as synonymous.” The historical remix is in session. Do you hear the thrumming bass line?'"
"'12-04-22,'0','Just One More Game . . .I’m constantly wrestling with the game question. Isn’t there a better way to pass the hours, I wonder? Why can’t I be productive all the time? Or at least pursue higher art with my free time? I don’t know why, but I simply can’t live a happy life without at least some unproductive frivolity. At the end of my day, I’m just not in the mood for Tolstoy. Games are, for me, a form of necessary surrender.Sam Anderson interviewed game designers and others who drank the digital Kool-Aid while providing no counterbalance from psychologists and neuroscientists who could have described the growing body of evidence indicating real concerns about the excessive use of these games. Anderson writes about addiction, O.C.D. and self-destruction, yet somehow concludes that these games are basically harmless fun. Frank Lantz even likens these games to heroin and then has the audacity to suggest that heroin (and these games) can provide a transcendental experience. Not an apt metaphor in either case, as I’m sure heroin addicts would agree.When backed up in three lanes of traffic, I find myself thinking that if that red car would advance next to the two other red ones, they would burst away and I’d get home faster.In order to make its point on hyperaddictive casual games, The New York Times embedded a game that lets players blow up ads, comments and links on its Web site. Brilliant! A bold move, considering the article is a seven-page commentary on the evolution and implications of addictive casual games on our society. While Anderson waxed poetic about the implications of “stupid games,” we were busy shooting ads on the site.An analysis of how Vallejo is received by the Chilean media and her supporters, including a discussion of her looks, could be relevant and quite interesting. Using a headline, however, that called her the “World’s Most Glamorous Revolutionary” and peppering the article with anecdotes about how people are “always debating who is more beautiful” (Vallejo or a Communist Youth leader) and how she was seen “languorously kissing her boyfriend” obscures Francisco Goldman’s point — which is presumably to cover the movement and Vallejo’s role in it — and is also just straight-up sexist.The article does return to her beauty again and again, but isn’t that clearly part of her allure? Don’t the Chileans who support her in part admire her looks? Whether we want it to be so or not, a person’s appearance matters a great deal in getting the attention of others. Vallejo is simply capitalizing on the attention to spread some valid points about inequality in Chile. To ignore her looks would be to ignore one of the main reasons she attracts interest.'"
"'12-04-22,'0','“Exactly,” said Mr. Gomes, who shares a listing in the building with Fredrik Eklund.TriBeCa has become one of the most seductive addresses in the city, and people pay a lot to live here.Apartment 6 at One North Moore, with three bedrooms and three baths and almost 3,000 square feet of space, just sold for $5 million. A penthouse unit with 2,300 square feet of terrace at Nos. 39-41 costs $21.5 million. At the homely Independence Plaza, erected in 1974 as a low-to-middle-income residential complex, even a modest two-bedroom apartment now commands upward of $5,000 a month.“People really want to be here,” Mr. Gomes said. “Everyone, from the single guy to the young couple to the empty nester, gay and straight, black and white. And there are so few choices, we can’t keep up with demand.”While it is no longer the cutting-edge no-man’s-land that drew club life in the ’80s, TriBeCa does manage to hang on to a clandestine aura. North Moore looks much as it did in the late 1800s, when manufacturing — from ice to glass — took place in the five- and six-story warehouse buildings that are so coveted today. Everywhere are steel loading bays, shaftways, cast-iron flourishes, canopies suspended with large-link chains and old signs carved in stone (see Merchants Refrigerating and Ice Manufacture at No. 35).North Moore is also a good example of the transformed neighborhood — from industrial zone to enclave of live/work artists to stomping ground of the rich and famous. (John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette, lived at No. 20.)These days, it mixes an impressive stroller brigade with the workaday scenes of, for instance, a recycling truck siphoning cooking oil out the backdoor of Mr. Chow’s (121 Hudson) and a pediatric practice a few doors from Espasso, the Brazilian design shop at No. 38 North Moore. The tiny Smith & Mills restaurant at No. 71 looks as if it had been decorated with finds from Parisian flea markets, like rickety little metal chairs and frayed upholstery. It shares the street with the Brandy Library, No. 25, a clubby urban place that has strict rules (“As in any library please avoid using loud and/or vulgar language”).There’s not really a bustle but a steady street life that’s equal parts fancy tourists, well-heeled residents, waiters taking smoke breaks, New Yorkers from other parts of town. The top-chef restaurants are a big draw, from Paul Liebrandt’s Corton (239 West Broadway) across the avenue from the eastern end of the street, to Andrew Carmellini’s Locanda Verde (377 Greenwich Street) at the corner of North Moore toward the western end.The Greenwich Hotel, built on an old parking lot and co-owned by the unofficial mayor of TriBeCa, Robert De Niro, has become an anchor of the street, a spot for both the Mercedes dealer’s power breakfast and the film producer’s extended stay in the North Moore duplex suite, where the huge slanting glass window gives a painterly view that skims the street’s rooftops.“In the four years since opening,” said the dashing and wonderfully named Philip Truelove, general manager of the hotel, “the main difference is the movement of people. There’s a lot of life, but it’s still quiet.”Mr. De Niro is also a founder of the TriBeCa Film Festival, which is currently under way.You could argue that residents of North Moore get more for their money. They’ve got Hook and Ladder 8, the iconic firehouse made famous by the “Ghostbusters” movies. You can see authentic memorabilia from the first film on the interior walls when the garage door is open.Residents also have an original work by Frank Gehry, the architect who did the interiors at the Issey Miyake store at the southwest corner of North Moore and Hudson; up close, the curving titanium sheets look like a study for the Guggenheim in Bilbao, Spain. They’ve got Terrarium, a 2006 light sculpture by Grimanesa Amorós in the lobby at the Bayer Building at 54 North Moore. From the street, you can see it change color and effect at intervals throughout the day and night.And they have Lilac, their very own lighthouse tender. A 1933 steam-engine vessel, it is docked against great big black rubber bumpers on Hudson River Park’s Pier 25, which extends North Moore past beach volleyball pitches and a turf playing field way out toward New Jersey. The former Coast Guard ship is now managed by the nonprofit Lilac Preservation Project and will be open a couple of afternoons every week after Memorial Day for free tours, above and below deck.Meanwhile, back at Bubby’s, where a plate of scrambled eggs and toast is $17 (cash only on weekends), they even have stroller parking. The angled lines of the spaces have just received a fresh coat of paint.'"

"'12-04-23,'0','After executing smart mortgage derivatives and diversifying high yield stocks, cash should start flowing freely, leaving the smart investor with even more questions, like “how do I protect my municipal bonds?” and, “should I invest in a C-Share or blend fund?” and, “how much money do I need to create giant floes of gold in a private vault and dive into it like Scrooge McDuck?”In most money circles (insider tip: “money circles” is a term used by only the most elite investors), wealth is measured exclusively by how closely one can recreate this famed animation. It has come to represent success in America and anything less than doing the backstroke amongst a sea of Earth’s rarest metal should be considered an abject failure. A main problem of this measure, however, is that there is no agreed-upon Scrooge McDuck quantity of gold. In order to give the young investor a goal to shoot for, and to clear up this age-old question once and for all, the following is a precise judgment of exactly how money you need to be successful.Looking at some of the best pictorial evidence of the McDuck vault, it is evident that this large pile of gold on the left appears to be five feet tall. This is deduced under the assumption that the average duck 14 inches tall, which is then used comparatively to quantify the pile (5 ft = 4.3 duck heights). With a little calculus and graph-work, the rough integral can pinpointed to y=-x2–1x+5. This equation puts every “x” and every “y” value at exactly one inch, as seen below.When the area under the curve is calculated (from x=-3 to x=5), it yields roughly 46 square inches. The assumption will be made here that one cubic inch is roughly one ounce of gold. To convert that into a dome shape the value is simply cubed, which becomes 97,366 ounces. Given that 1 ounce of gold is roughly $5.00, it can extrapolated that each large pile of gold in the vault is worth $486,830.However, Scrooge McDuck was first drawn in 1947, therefore inflation must be adjusted for which totals a whopping 5.2 billion dollars per pile. In the picture, there are two smaller piles which roughly equal the larger doubling the total to 10.4 billion. However, the shadows in the corner suggest that the room is a least three times as large as it is. Therefore, Scrooge was privy to a cool 31.2 billion dollars.This means that only the six richest people in the world could afford to pull off the Scrooge swim.Swimming in gold truly is a marker for success, but for the world’s big wigs, there are goals beyond even this. Another famous picture of Scrooge McDuck skiing down a mountain of money is even more alluring still.Calculating his velocity (roughly 5 m/s2) suggests that this mountain (of which we cannot see the summit) has a slope of 35 degrees, putting a rough estimate of the entire hill at 73.5 billion. Is it possible that McDuck pushed together his wealth to make this monstrosity? In theory, yes, but the eye line of McDuck (fixed at 8 degrees above the horizon relative to the slope) suggests that there are at least two other such mounds, putting his total wealth at over 210 billion, and well beyond the meager 70 billion of richest man in the world Carlos Slim Helu. It’s also heartening to see cash in this picture, as a diverse portfolio is always a successful one.If you follow the rules of global trends, equity markets, and grizzled anthropomorphic birds, you will be well on your way to a swan (or shall we say “duck”) dive into nearly limitless gold.Matt Powers is in his early twenties-ish. He is also good at making up fake math.'"

"'12-04-23,'0','While my husband was being summoned from inside the theater, I felt a tap on my shoulder. Crouching down beside me was the man I had encountered outside, saying, “Since you’re injured and can’t go to see the opera, please give me your ticket.”My reaction was an equal mixture of disbelief and anger: “I still intend to go, holding an ice pack under my chin.”As he was being hustled out by the manager, my husband, a doctor, arrived. After a quick inspection, he announced that we were going straight to the emergency room.As I was being helped into a waiting taxi, I felt a wave of pity for the forlorn opera buff and said to the manager, “Find that man, and give him my ticket.”I was once an employee at Tower Records on 66th Street and Broadway, back in the day when there were record stores.A customer approached and asked in a very heavy, Eastern European accent whether the store had a CD about a big boat. We were used to vague requests for CDs by “that guy, you know?” but these usually ended in failure. She was persistent.Customer: “Do you have CD? I am looking for, eez about big boat.”Me: “I’m sorry, what is it called?”I shook my head apologetically, no, we do not have that CD — as she no doubt cursed me in her language.Fifteen years later it occurs to me that she was asking me for the soundtrack to “Titanic.”With the recent passing of Mike Wallace, a story came to mind:Seven years ago, I was rushing to an appointment at Lenox Hill Hospital. I was in the lobby waiting for the elevator; standing next to me was Mike Wallace.When the elevator came, about eight people got on. My appointment was on a high floor, and, one by one, we stopped at each floor. Mr. Wallace was beside me.When we stopped at the fifth floor, Joan Rivers was waiting for an elevator down. She called out: “Hi, Mike! How is everything going?” He replied: “Great, Joan. You look great.”On the sixth floor, everyone except for Mr. Wallace and me got off. I turned to him and said, “Mr. Wallace, I have been watching you for years, and you’re terrific!” He replied, “I have been watching you for the last five minutes and you’re terrific!”Mine was the next stop. I thanked him and went on my way with a smile on my face.'"
"'12-04-23,'0','Under federal labor law, employees have the right to join together to seek better pay and working conditions, with or without a union. If an employer tries to punish organizers, employees have the right to seek protection from the National Labor Relations Board. But employees still don’t have the right to be informed of their rights.Last August, the N.L.R.B. issued a rule requiring employers to post a notice in the workplace telling employees of their rights. The rule was prompted by the board’s finding that young employees, recent immigrants and workers in nonunion workplaces were generally unaware of the law’s guarantees and protections.The backlash was furious. The National Association of Manufacturers sued to block the rule in federal court in Washington, D.C. The United States Chamber of Commerce sued in federal court in South Carolina. In both cases, industry claimed that the law did not expressly permit the board to require employers to post a notice.The judge in Washington recently ruled in favor of the board, based on the sound premise that the N.L.R.B.’s broad rule-making authority permits it to impose requirements that are reasonably related to the law. The judge in South Carolina ruled against the board. He did not dispute that the law allows the board to issue rules that are needed to carry out the law, but he said the board had confused a necessary rule with one that is simply “useful.” Last Tuesday, a federal appeals court postponed the April 30 effective date of the rule pending appeals to clarify the issue.At its core this isn’t just about the legality of having to hang a poster in the coffee room. It’s about industry’s attempt to delay rules whenever it cannot derail them outright. It is about preventing workers from gaining knowledge and support to help them press their concerns.The courts will now have their say. The White House and Democratic lawmakers should weigh in with friend-of-the-court briefs supporting the N.L.R.B. — and employees’ right to know their rights.'"

"'12-04-23,'0','The losses could not have come at a worse time for the networks, which are about to enter the television upfronts, the traditional season when advertising dollars are committed for the fall season.“These numbers are going to affect the upfronts,” said Brad Adgate, the senior vice president for research at Horizon Media. “These numbers represent billions of dollars in sales.”Though there seems to be no one reason for the decline, many executives say they are concerned that long-term changes in watching habits are taking a significant toll on viewership.The broadest explanation is the time of year. Each spring, viewership tends to decline because of factors like daylight saving time, which hurts the 8 p.m. shows especially because outdoor light discourages indoor viewing. And many television research executives said “nice weather” this spring may be encouraging people to spend more time outdoors.But the clock changes every year without such a severe decline. As Mr. Adgate asked, “How many more people can be out smelling the roses this year?”Network television, of course, is accustomed to being down. As noted by Michael Nathanson, the United States media analyst for Nomura Securities, the live ratings for network programs (that is, the ratings for people who watch shows when they are first broadcast) have declined for 14 straight quarters.In the past, the network drop usually meant a bonanza for cable networks, which inherited those viewers. But over the same four weeks beginning in March, cable networks combined lost an average of 409,000 viewers, about 2 percent.And yet, overall television viewing is flat this spring, according to Nielsen research. That means viewers are using their television sets just as much this year as last year.So bring on the detectives. What is going on here?Mr. Nathanson suggested one obvious suspect in the overall ratings decline has been the steep ratings drop for “American Idol” this season — more than 30 percent. He contends the struggles of “Idol” have had a disproportionate impact on the overall ratings for the live viewing of prime-time shows. “Idol,” which is a competition show broadcast live, “has in the past gotten you into the live ecosystem,” he said.Many millions of people watched television live on “Idol” nights, he said, and with “Idol” declining, fewer people have the incentive to sit in front of the television on those nights.He cited the much stronger numbers for shows last fall, when the N.F.L. dominated the ratings. “The N.F.L. brings people in live,” Mr. Nathanson said. He suggested that live television benefited from the interest in football in the fall. Spring sports do not have the same impact, he said.Another explanation behind the steep decline in network shows is the way networks now parcel out episodes of their more popular offerings. Around March, they begin inserting strings of repeat, which, more than ever, viewers avoid. Jay Sures, a partner in the United Talent Agency, said his company’s research found that “the disruption of the ordered pattern of episodes is a big issue.”Viewers can go weeks without seeing a new episode of a favorite like the comedy “Modern Family,” he noted, and they do not know when a new episode will be shown. Last week a new episode of “Modern Family” scored the lowest rating of the season.At the same time, viewers who scheduled the show on a “season’s pass” on a DVR will learn later that they have a new episode to watch — and when they do, they will not be watching something else on live television. And that, many television executives say, may indicate a fundamental shift in how viewers consume television programming. They no longer watch nearly as much of it while it is broadcast.Mr. Nathanson said the playback of prerecorded shows is so extensive, no show can be judged fairly by how it fares on its first night. He cited Nielsen figures that indicate recorded playback of shows would average a 4.7 rating in the 18-to-49 category for those four weeks this spring. That would make playback the second-highest-rated show on television for that period, just behind “American Idol” on Fox.Two years ago at this time, Jeff Gaspin, then the head of entertainment at NBC, was trying to find television shows that would attract viewers and advertisers, and perhaps finally turn around the decade-long slump that afflicted the network.Now Mr. Gaspin looks at the recent news of lower and lower ratings across the board and has one conclusion: “We are seeing the cumulative effect of nonlinear viewing.”That is attributable, he said, to what he called the “built-up libraries” viewers can now watch. “I think we are at a tipping point in how people are going to watch shows,” he said.Mr. Gaspin said that this year he and his 13-year-old son decided to try out the AMC series “The Walking Dead.” Hooked by the first two episodes, they set aside an hour at 9 each night to watch the first two years, hour by hour, which Mr. Gaspin had collected through every means available — some episodes from Netflix, some from iTunes, some recorded on the family DVR.“We learned a new behavior,” Mr. Gaspin said. Finally they caught up to this season’s finale.“We watched that live,” he said. “It was not nearly as good. The commercials broke the tension. We had watched the other episodes with blankets over our heads. I hate to say this to the AMC executives and everybody else in the business, but I will never watch ‘Walking Dead’ live again.”'"
"'12-04-23,'0','Investigators are unsure what the current search of the basement at 127B Prince Street will reveal; they remain cautiously hopeful that some forensic evidence will emerge that could lead them to an arrest.Since the 1980s, the prime suspect in the case had been Jose A. Ramos, a junk collector who briefly dated a woman who was hired to walk neighborhood children, including Etan, home from school during a bus strike. Mr. Ramos is in prison in Pennsylvania after a conviction on charges of child molesting. The Patz family filed a wrongful-death suit against him, and in 2000 the police searched the basement of the building in the Lower East Side where Mr. Ramos once lived.More recently, Agent MacDonald, along with investigators from the New York Police Department who are all working jointly with Manhattan prosecutors to examine Etan’s disappearance, looked beyond Mr. Ramos. One law enforcement official described them as “more open to other ideas” as to who was responsible for Etan’s death.Part of their thinking, the official said, is that Mr. Ramos is believed to have spent substantial time trying to elicit the trust of past children he molested, and was often spotted in their company.The F.B.I. has not been able to establish witnesses who could place Mr. Ramos with Etan. Referring to Mr. Ramos’s past behavior in targeting victims, the official said: “If you look at that pattern of behavior and apply it to Etan, you have to assume there will be a prior relationship, and it’s just not there.”Mr. Ramos has claimed that he was with Etan the day he vanished, but he has denied abducting and killing him. Yet Agent MacDonald and others examining the case were skeptical of his account, the official said.At some point, Agent MacDonald’s search for evidence led him to consider Othniel Miller, a neighborhood handyman. Mr. Miller was one of several people who Agent MacDonald believed “had something to answer to,” the official said. Mr. Miller, who worked from the basement of a building at the corner of Wooster and Prince Streets, knew Etan and had in fact given him a dollar the day before his disappearance, for helping him with some small task, officials said. And he had put a new floor of concrete into his workspace shortly after Etan’s disappearance.Agents have repeatedly interviewed Mr. Miller, who is 75 and has had several strokes. They also tracked down his ex-wife, Phyllis, who a second person familiar with the case said told agents that her former husband had raped a 10-year old girl.“Given that recent information, he skyrocketed to the top of the list,” the first law enforcement official said about how agents came to focus on Mr. Miller.During one interview, agents watched Mr. Miller as he grew aroused while he looked through a book of images of children, two law enforcement officials said. At another point during questioning, when agents asked Mr. Miller about the possibility of Etan’s being buried in the basement, he asked back, “What if the body was moved?”Mr. Miller’s stepson, Jason C. Webley, has said he had never heard of any rape accusations against his stepfather. He also said he did not believe that his stepfather had anything to do with Etan’s disappearance.Mr. Miller’s lawyer, Michael Farkas, said his client “has absolutely no responsibility for the terrible tragedy that befell young Etan Patz, and he grieves for Etan’s fate as all New Yorkers have for decades.”In the intervening years, Agent MacDonald chipped away at the case off and on, even as he juggled it with more active cases, like a large gang investigation in Yonkers. He also played a critical role, three law enforcement officials said, in capturing the Boston gangster Whitey Bulger, who was found in Santa Monica, Calif., last year.Agent MacDonald met some resistance from Etan’s family. Stanley K. Patz, Etan’s father, would meet with the new investigator, but Julie Patz had had enough of new investigators over the years. There were a number of meetings between Mr. Patz and Agent MacDonald before she would participate.Etan’s sister, Shira, however, “shut down” under the agent’s direct interview style, the official familiar with the investigation said. The F.B.I. considers her potentially an important witness because they believe that if Etan ever offered any hint of inappropriate advances by Mr. Ramos or other adults in the days preceding his disappearance, Shira might know.With its suspicions of Mr. Miller rising, the F.B.I. brought in a cadaver-sniffing dog to examine the basement less than a month ago, and the dog’s response suggested the possibility that human remains might once have been buried there.The case is at a precarious juncture, as the digging ended its fourth day on Sunday, with investigators expected to begin again at 8 a.m. on Monday.“If they find remains, the case is solvable,” one law enforcement official said. “If none are found, I fear we’re at a dead end.”Mr. MacDonald was transferred to Maine last year and handed over the case to another agent, Jed Salter. But Agent MacDonald has returned for the dig. “He’s hopeful, but realistic as well,” an official said.'"
"'12-04-23,'0','The suffering of livestock became a major focus of Humane Society lobbying in the mid-1970s, soon after Mr. Hoyt met Temple Grandin, the animal behaviorist, who was then developing a stress-reducing corral for young cattle being slaughtered for veal.The Humane Society financed research for a prototype of her famous double-rail restrainer system. “That system is in use in half the slaughterhouses in the country, and it probably would not have existed if not for John Hoyt,” she said in an interview Friday. “He took the practical approach — ‘If we’re gonna eat meat, well, let’s make sure the animals don’t suffer needlessly.’ ”Mr. Hoyt was also an early proponent of laws against organized dogfighting. Lobbying efforts by the Humane Society beginning in the 1980s were instrumental in persuading 40 states to adopt laws making deliberate animal cruelty a felony rather than a misdemeanor. Those laws were considered instrumental in the passage of the 2007 Virginia law under which Michael Vick, the N.F.L. quarterback, was prosecuted for dogfighting.By its own accounting, the Humane Society grew to over 5 million members during Mr. Hoyt’s tenure from 100,000. Its annual budget, which was under $1 million when he became president in 1970, had grown to about $50 million by the time he retired.When confrontational animal rights organizations like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals emerged in the 1980s — criticizing organizations like the Humane Society for being too focused on fund-raising and for not recognizing the inherent equal rights of humans and animals — Mr. Hoyt vigorously defended his group’s approach, which he described as “pragmatic idealism.”He dismissed staff members he considered too sympathetic to the animal liberation movement, and in a speech at the society’s 1988 annual conference refused to accept “censure for our willingness to accept compromise” or for the society’s “organizational growth and financial success.”John Arthur Hoyt was born March 30, 1932, in Marietta, Ohio, one of six children of Claremont and Margaret Hoyt. His father was an itinerant Baptist minister. Mr. Hoyt was ordained a Baptist minister, too, after graduating in 1957 from what is now Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School in Rochester.He was serving as senior minister of the First Presbyterian Church in Fort Wayne, Ind., when he was recruited as president of the Humane Society by a friend who was a board member and an executive in the American Bible Society.At the time, he told his family it was “like leaving one church for another.”Mr. Hoyt’s survivors include his wife, Gertrude, and four daughters. Besides Peggy, they are Karen Willcox, Anne Williams and Julie Dorman. He is also survived by a brother, David, and four sisters, Carolyn Harman, Josephine Bero, Mary Griffes and Margaret Nasemann.The Humane Society was established in 1954 as a result of a schism within the American Humane Association, which was established in 1877 as a loose national federation, based in Denver, of animal rescue groups. While the leaders of the Humane Association were committed to remaining decentralized, the dissidents who founded the Humane Society believed that the cause required a national focus, federal legislation and a headquarters in Washington.During his tenure, Mr. Hoyt commuted to the society’s L Street townhouse headquarters from a small farm in Fredericksburg, where he lived with his family and the many dogs, cats, horses and other animals that he and his daughters brought home on a regular basis, Peggy Hoyt said.Though he had no training in animal welfare when he began the job, Mr. Hoyt told interviewers that he had always loved animals, mainly because of the influence of his grandmother, a vegetarian who lived to be 106. “My grandmother had 40 pet sheep,” he once said, “and each one had a name.”'"
"'12-04-23,'0','Researchers have found that climate change is likely to have far greater influence on the volatility of corn prices over the next three decades than factors that recently have been blamed for price swings — like oil prices, trade policies and government biofuel mandates.The new study, published on Sunday in the journal Nature Climate Change, suggests that unless farmers develop more heat-tolerant corn varieties or gradually move corn production from the United States into Canada, frequent heat waves will cause sharp price spikes.Noah S. Diffenbaugh, a climate scientist at Stanford and an author of the study, said he was surprised by the notable effect of climate change on price volatility for corn, the country’s largest crop. “I really thought climate would be a minor player before we did this analysis,” Professor Diffenbaugh said. “We’re looking at a period over the next three decades or so of moderate global warming, after all.”Instead, the analysis found that a moderate warming trend was likely to increase the number of days of severe heat in the growing season, thus doubling the volatility of corn yields.Using economic, climatic and agricultural data, the study found that if climate change stayed within the internationally accepted range of two degrees Celsius over the next 20 years or so, temperature changes would make those heat waves more common. The study was financed by a grant from the Department of Energy.'"

"'12-04-24,'1','Amina finds sex with George unpleasant or tolerable at best. She often thinks that he doesn’t know who she is, and she comes to believe that much of his past will always remain a mystery. For that matter, both Amina and George turn out to be keeping major secrets from each other — secrets about earlier romantic attachments that they have not completely put behind them.Although Ms. Freudenberger’s account lacks the precision and emotional detail that, say, Jhumpa Lahiri has brought to her descriptions of Bengali immigrants adapting to life in the American suburbs, she works hard to chronicle with sympathy and humor Amina’s efforts to master the new protocols of daily life in Rochester.Amina learns to shovel snow, passes her driver’s test, gets a job at Starbucks, studies for her citizenship exam. She talks to her mother nearly every day and thinks about trying to put off having a baby until her mother arrives to help her.She also thinks about making plans for a proper Muslim wedding — which she’s promised her parents she would have, in addition to the civil ceremony — but keeps putting it off. She has a hard time understanding the American concept of sarcasm, of meaning the opposite of what the words suggest.Where “The Newlyweds” comes alive is in the second half, when Amina returns to Bangladesh to try to obtain American visas for her increasingly unstable mother and her hapless father, who has had one business disaster after another. Writing about a foreign country seems to kick Ms. Freudenberger’s gift for observation into high gear, and she does a visceral job of conjuring the place where Amina grew up: the countryside “so green that you almost expected to look up and see a green sun in the sky; the city streets, hazardous with mobs and rickshaws and pools of black sewage.Here there are roaches in the hospital corridors and the danger of violent assaults in which acid is thrown at an enemy. But here there is also a dense network of extended family, family friends and neighbors, a support system in the face of the swirling whirlpools of fortune.More important, Ms. Freudenberger captures in these later pages Amina’s confusion, her sense of being caught between two cultures, of having become someone who is regarded as an outsider in both her new adopted country and the country she still thinks of as home.In America she is seen as uptight and overly worried about propriety and appearances; in Bangladesh she is seen as the headstrong one “who’d done everything her own way.” She is nostalgic for her girlhood but suffocated by her gossipy, competitive and overprotective relatives; flooded with fond memories of her youth, but also newly aware — as a now cosseted American — of the inconveniences, dangers and frustrations of life in Bangladesh.A cousin congratulates Amina on escaping the provinciality and poverty there and achieving “the dream life in America,” and yet when Amina sees her teenage crush, Nasir, she feels all the ardor and intensity that is lacking in her marriage to George and wonders what sort of life she and Nasir might have had together — might still have, if he reciprocates her feelings.The Amina-Nasir relationship and Amina’s relationship with her aging parents are the nucleus of this novel and reveal the contradictions deep within Amina’s own heart. Unlike her synthetic partnership with George, these are real, complex, deeply felt connections that have both endured and changed over time, and in depicting them Ms. Freudenberger demonstrates her assurance as a novelist and her knowledge of the complicated arithmetic of familial love and the mathematics of romantic passion.'"

"'12-04-24,'1','Now to be clear: When Thiel is talking about a “monopoly,” he isn’t talking about the illegal eliminate-your-rivals kind. He’s talking about doing something so creative that you establish a distinct market, niche and identity. You’ve established a creative monopoly and everybody has to come to you if they want that service, at least for a time.His lecture points to a provocative possibility: that the competitive spirit capitalism engenders can sometimes inhibit the creativity it requires.Think about the traits that creative people possess. Creative people don’t follow the crowds; they seek out the blank spots on the map. Creative people wander through faraway and forgotten traditions and then integrate marginal perspectives back to the mainstream. Instead of being fastest around the tracks everybody knows, creative people move adaptively through wildernesses nobody knows.Now think about the competitive environment that confronts the most fortunate people today and how it undermines those mind-sets.First, students have to jump through ever-more demanding, preassigned academic hoops. Instead of developing a passion for one subject, they’re rewarded for becoming professional students, getting great grades across all subjects, regardless of their intrinsic interests. Instead of wandering across strange domains, they have to prudentially apportion their time, making productive use of each hour.Then they move into a ranking system in which the most competitive college, program and employment opportunity is deemed to be the best. There is a status funnel pointing to the most competitive colleges and banks and companies, regardless of their appropriateness.Then they move into businesses in which the main point is to beat the competition, in which the competitive juices take control and gradually obliterate other goals. I see this in politics all the time. Candidates enter politics wanting to be authentic and change things. But once the candidates enter the campaign, they stop focusing on how to be change-agents. They and their staff spend all their time focusing on beating the other guy. They hone the skills of one-upsmanship. They get engulfed in a tit-for-tat competition to win the news cycle. Instead of being new and authentic, they become artificial mirror opposites of their opponents. Instead of providing the value voters want — change — they become canned tacticians, hoping to eke out a slight win over the other side.Competition has trumped value-creation. In this and other ways, the competitive arena undermines innovation.You know somebody has been sucked into the competitive when they start using sports or war metaphors. Sports and war are competitive enterprises. If somebody hits three home runs against you in the top of the inning, your job is to go hit four home runs in the bottom of the inning.But business, politics, intellectual life and most other realms are not like that. In most realms, if somebody hits three home runs against you in one inning, you have the option of picking up your equipment and inventing a different game. You don’t have to compete; you can invent.We live in a culture that nurtures competitive skills. And they are necessary: discipline, rigor and reliability. But it’s probably a good idea to try to supplement them with the skills of the creative monopolist: alertness, independence and the ability to reclaim forgotten traditions.Everybody worries about American competitiveness. That may be the wrong problem. The future of the country will probably be determined by how well Americans can succeed at being monopolists.'"
"'12-04-24,'1','“I think there’s going to be a lot of pressure to come down hard on them as a company, not entirely because of the actual violations but because of the failure to do anything internally when those violations came to light,” Mr. Feeley said.The uncertainty made investors anxious on Monday. Wal-Mart’s stock lost $2.91 in heavy trading, to $59.54. Wal-Mart de Mexico’s stock, traded separately, fell more than 12 percent to 37.89 pesos.A Wal-Mart spokesman, David Tovar, said in a statement that the audit committee of Wal-Mart’s board had been overseeing an investigation of Wal-Mart’s compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act since the fall, and that outside legal counsel and forensic accountants were reporting regularly to the audit committee about findings.Wal-Mart hired the law firm Jones Day to look into the bribery questions. It also hired the law firm Greenberg Traurig to conduct a worldwide review of the company’s compliance with F.C.P.A., as well as KPMG to handle forensic accounting.In Washington, two Democratic representatives, Elijah E. Cummings, of Maryland, and Henry A. Waxman, of California, said they had requested a meeting with company officials and were contacting other people who might have knowledge of the bribery allegations.Critics of Wal-Mart in New York, including some elected officials, union leaders and small-business groups, said the company’s actions in Mexico cemented their opposition to Wal-Mart’s opening a store in the city.“This is precisely the type of business we do not want in our communities and I remain committed to fighting against Wal-Mart’s corporate poison from entering the five boroughs,” Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said in a statement. Bill de Blasio, the city’s public advocate, and the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, also issued statements criticizing Wal-Mart.Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, asked Wal-Mart to detail all the spending it has done and donations it has made with regard to opening a store in New York.Wal-Mart’s current chief executive, Michael T. Duke, was told about the allegations regarding bribery in Mexico in 2005, when he was given responsibility for all foreign subsidiaries, The Times reported. The internal investigation was ended after the chief executive at the time, H. Lee Scott Jr., now a Wal-Mart board member, rebuked internal investigators for being overly aggressive, the article on Sunday said.Eduardo Castro-Wright, the former head of Wal-Mart’s United States operations who was promoted to vice chairman in 2008, was identified by a former company lawyer in Mexico as the driving force behind years of bribery when he was in charge of Wal-Mart de Mexico.Mr. Tovar declined to comment on whether the board was considering actions against the executives.Mr. Castro-Wright announced in September that he would retire, surprising analysts. The announcement of the retirement was unrelated to Wal-Mart’s query into foreign corrupt practices, Mr. Tovar said. Mr. Castro-Wright had said he would step down on July 1, 2012, and that timing has not changed, Mr. Tovar said.Mr. Castro-Wright has been a board member at MetLife since 2008. John Calagna, a spokesman for MetLife, said in a statement that “MetLife became aware of this situation through recent media reports. Wal-mart has indicated in these reports that it is investigating the matter. Therefore it would not be appropriate for MetLife to comment at this time.”Several executives involved in the inquiry no longer work at Wal-Mart, although there is no indication that their departures were related to the bribery case.Michael Fung, chief financial officer for Wal-Mart’s United States stores, retired effective Feb. 1, Mr. Tovar said. According to the article, Mr. Fung, then an internal auditor, was given a memo with a detailed account of a former executive’s complaints about bribery in 2005.And Joseph R. Lewis, a top internal investigator on the Mexico charges in 2005, also retired recently, Mr. Tovar confirmed.Craig Herkert, who is now the chief of the grocery chain Supervalu, was told about the charges in 2005, according to the article. A Supervalu spokesman, Michael A. Siemienas, said in an e-mail that “based on the information we have, this is strictly a Wal-Mart matter.”And John B. Menzer, a former Wal-Mart vice chairman who is now chief of the craft retailer Michaels Stores, was also involved. Mr. Menzer intervened in a separate investigation regarding an executive who reported to him, taking authority in the inquiry away from Wal-Mart’s corporate-investigations unit and transferring the inquiry to a subordinate of the person being investigated, according to The Times. That subordinate subsequently cleared his boss.Michaels, which filed for an initial public offering in March, said last week that Mr. Menzer had been hospitalized.Allen Questrom, a former chief of J. C. Penney and Federated Department Stores who was on Wal-Mart’s board from 2007 until 2010, said he was surprised to hear of the accusations.“It was never something that was discussed at the board level when I was there,” he said.'"
"'12-04-24,'1','Pemex does not have to follow the regulators’ recommendations, but the commission’s young president, Juan Carlos Zepeda, is speaking out when it does not.“The strength of the commission is in public opinion,” said Mr. Zepeda, 42, an economist who contends that Pemex, officially Petróleos Mexicanos, should be more transparent as it spends $20 billion this year to find and pump oil. “The force of change will come from Congress, from opinion leaders, from national universities, from society.”As a symbol of Mexican nationalism, created in 1938 when the government expropriated foreign-owned oil companies, Pemex occupies a peculiar place in the country’s energy policy. The jobs it generates give it powerful political allies, and its union is so strong that no president risks defying it.The government relies on the company’s oil revenue for as much as 40 percent of the national budget, taxing it so heavily that last year the company lost $6.5 billion on sales of $111.5 billion.As long as oil gushed from Pemex’s giant offshore fields, there seemed little reason for anyone to challenge the status quo. But production has declined since 2004, and the company’s ability to find and exploit new sources of oil has been cast into doubt.The commission has closely tracked the Chicontepec project, on which Pemex has already spent nearly $9 billion. The regulators told the company that in its haste to meet ambitious production goals, it was drilling hundreds of new wells without studying the region’s geology or the best recovery techniques.The criticism was quickly picked up by members of Congress.Mr. Zepeda is also scrutinizing Pemex’s plans to push deeper into the Gulf of Mexico. The memory of the BP disaster there in 2010 is still fresh, and Mr. Zepeda is concerned that Pemex does not have enough experience to drill three new exploratory wells at depths of almost 10,000 feet — more than twice the average depths it has been drilling in the region.David Shields, an independent oil analyst based in Mexico City, said the change in approach was significant. “It was heresy in the past to question whether Pemex was doing things properly,” Mr. Shields said. The commission’s five members all had previously worked for Pemex or for government entities involved in energy. But their decisions have shown independence, said Miriam Grunstein, an oil specialist at the CIDE, a public research university in Mexico City.“They have integrity,” Ms. Grunstein said. “They’re really admirable. It’s completely unexpected.”In the last few weeks, Pemex and the chief of its production and exploration subsidiary, Carlos Morales Gil, have begun responding to the pressure. The company officially reduced its estimate for probable reserves in Chicontepec by about 30 percent, to 6.49 billion barrels of oil equivalent, ending two years of wrangling with Mr. Zepeda’s team.Then, at the end of March, Pemex announced that it had signed a contract with Wild Well Control, a Houston company that handles oil well disasters, including the 2010 BP spill, to provide deepwater containment systems, and it is in talks with a consortium of gulf oil companies to provide additional services. Pemex is also analyzing whether it should buy additional insurance for the deepwater wells, Mr. Morales said.Jeremy Martin, the director of the energy program at the Institute of the Americas in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, said that Mr. Zepeda was right to take his concerns about Pemex public. “He is holding their feet to the fire, especially Carlos Morales. At a minimum, he is forcing Morales to respond.”Mr. Zepeda said he sensed the beginning of a shift at the company but added, “for Pemex to fully recognize an authority, it will take a cultural change that is going to take some time.”Mr. Morales of Pemex expressed exasperation with the commission’s oversight.“It is like being the coach of the national soccer team,” he said in an interview. “Everybody wants to tell the coach what to do.”Mr. Morales suggested that some of the guarantees that the commission wants from Pemex before the company begins drilling in deeper waters reflect the commission’s inexperience.“We have been doing these things for 70 years,” he said.But Ms. Grunstein said that Pemex’s efforts in deep water had little to do with sound business management. “They want to prove to Mexicans and to the world that they can do it,” she said. “It’s a heavily reputational thing.”Although Pemex does not have the experience to easily develop unconventional fields like Chicontepec, where the oil is tightly locked in the rock, it has no choice. The Mexican Constitution prevents Pemex from doing what would be standard practice anywhere else in the world — striking partnerships with private companies to share costs and revenue.Some positive news has occurred. Pemex’s oil production has stabilized at about 2.5 million barrels a day, down from the 2004 peak of 3.4 million. This year, Pemex will finally replace each barrel it produces with a new barrel of proven reserves, a goal that had long eluded it.And a new boss, Antonio Narváez Ramírez, is in charge at Chicontepec, where 2,100 oil wells are spread over low hills covered with orange groves and cattle pastures. Mr. Narváez has spent 18 months overhauling operations and adopting many of the commission’s suggestions.“Pemex is used to doing things in a conventional way because the oil fields were conventional,” he said. “But that’s finished, and we have to go against the conventions.”When Mr. Narváez arrived, he monitored the wells with different colored Post-it notes on a wall. Now he has a computerized system to transmit production information in real time to his tablet computer.Some of his changes are low-tech but effective, including keeping a fleet of maintenance trucks that can be deployed immediately to fix most of the mechanical problems in an oil pump. Others are more complex, including new types of well design to permit horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing.The subsequent impact on the local community is just beginning. “There is more movement, more jobs,” said Marisol Tapia Rodelo, 29, who runs a roadside restaurant in the village of Palma Sola, where giant trucks operated by Pemex and its contractors rumble by and workers turn up every lunchtime.Chicontepec’s production, now about 65,000 barrels of crude oil a day, is rising, although the goal Pemex now cites — 300,000 barrels — is far off.“In the end, we will learn how to produce in the field,” Mr. Zepeda said. “The shame is that it cost a lot of money. The learning curve is too expensive.”'"
"'12-04-24,'1','In another commercial, two couples in their 20s offer more names, including “the buddy system,” “the two-handed tango” and “el cleaño.”In a sequence that concludes the commercials, a roll resting vertically on a table unfurls, then curls around a tub of wipes, as if putting an arm around it. “Nothing leaves you feeling cleaner and fresher than the Cottonelle Care Routine,” says a voiceover. “Try them together. Then name it on Facebook.”The new campaign is by Trisect of Chicago, with the online execution by Biggs-Gilmore Communications of Kalamazoo, Mich. Commercials are scheduled to be introduced on April 30, when what the brand is calling a name generator will appear on its Facebook page.Facebook users may either independently name their two-product toileting routine or have one generated randomly, and can share having done so with Facebook friends.Kurt Simon, the brand manager for Cottonelle, said that while commercials for the brand’s Aloe & E dry toilet paper in 2009 also made mention of its moist products, this is the first time they have been marketed together as “a one-two process.”The name-generating campaign “gives an opportunity for consumers to talk about it, and to make the behavior more routinized,” Mr. Simon said.What Cottonelle does not do in the campaign is suggest to the uninitiated a sequence (like dry-wet, wet-dry or dry-wet-dry), and it avoids doing so not just to be decorous.“To try to get prescriptive begins to cross that line of critical distance, where, ‘You’re telling me that I’m not getting clean enough and I’m not sure that I want to hear that,’ ” Mr. Simon said.Being open-ended, and encouraging consumers to name their approach on Facebook, represents “the democratization of toilet etiquette,” said Dean Suarez-Starfeldt, senior vice president for strategic planning at Biggs-Gilmore. “We don’t as a brand want to push a toilet routine, but we want to activate the conversation.”Its rival Charmin, a Procter & Gamble brand, took a different approach in 2009, when it uploaded a video to the Charmin Web site and to YouTube that promoted using its dry tissue in combination with its wipes, Freshmates. In the video, an actor squirts toothpaste onto the back of his hand, wipes most away with dry tissue, and then uses a wipe for cleaning away the rest.Freshmates has reconsidered that approach, according to Laura Dressman, a P.& G. spokeswoman.“It’s really a consumer choice and I don’t think we need to be that prescriptive about it,” Ms. Dressman said. “The way we’ve positioned it now is it’s really going to be defined by consumers and what their preference is.”To more prominently display Fresh Care, Cottonelle developed a clip that attaches to a wall and to the back of a tub. Nearly 14 million of the hangers were included with wipes in 2010 and 2011, and another seven million will be shipped this year. Installation instructions, unsurprisingly, show it being hung beside the toilet paper holder.Spencer Beck is sales manager at Freshends, a line of individually wrapped flushable wipes distributed primarily at country clubs, spas and hotels (its slogan: “Don’t leave luxury behind.”).Unless the product is dispensed near dry toilet paper, it tends to either be ignored or used for other purposes, like removing makeup, he said.“When you’re sitting down on the toilet, having it in reach is crucial,” Mr. Beck said.Consumers who begin using flushable wipes tend to continue purchasing them as much as dry toilet paper.“We know from our user data that the growth is 100 percent incremental,” said Mr. Simon of Cottonelle. “If you used six squares of dry toilet paper before, you’d still use six squares, and one or two flushable wipes.”Sales of wet toilet paper represents only about 3 percent of all toilet paper sales in the United States, slightly more than Britain, where it represents only 2 percent.That’s far below Austria, with a 16 percent share, Switzerland, with a 13 percent share, and Germany, with a 10 percent share, according to Euromonitor International, a market research firm.In America and Britain, wet toilet paper is associated with baby wipes and marketers have faced difficulty “establishing it as a grown-up product,” said Ian Bell, who is global head of tissue and hygiene research at Euromonitor and based in London.He added that because of similarly packaged flushable hemorrhoidal wipes, products like Fresh Care also might be misconstrued as “a quasi-medical product.”Cottonelle’s efforts to both spur conversations about wipes and to equip consumers to display them more prominently in bathrooms may help remove such stigmas.“Their attempt to normalize this product by getting it out in the open is really a useful tool,” Mr. Bell said.'"
"'12-04-24,'1','WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is revamping its spy operations to focus on high-priority targets like Iran and China in a reorganization that reflects a shift away from the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan that have dominated America’s security landscape for the past decade.Under the plan approved last week by Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta, case officers from the new Defense Clandestine Service would work more closely with counterparts from the Central Intelligence Agency at a time when the military and spy agency are increasingly focused on similar threats.“It will thicken our coverage across the board,” said a senior Defense Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss with a small group of reporters on Monday what he called a “realignment” of the military’s human espionage efforts.Case officers from the Defense Intelligence Agency already secretly gather intelligence on a range of global issues — including terrorism and weapons proliferation — typically working out of C.I.A. stations in American embassies and undercover like their C.I.A. counterparts.But a classified study completed last year by the director of national intelligence found that while the D.I.A. was effectively conducting its traditional, and much larger, mission of providing intelligence to troops and commanders in war zones, it needed to focus more attention outside the battlefields on what is called “national intelligence” — gathering and distributing information on global issues and sharing that intelligence with other agencies.'"
"'12-04-24,'1','Some of the asteroids are icy — up to 20 percent water — and the water could be drawn out by melting the ice. The water could be taken to supply stopovers for future astronauts or broken down into breathable oxygen or propellant for spacecraft on interplanetary missions.Other asteroids are rocky and metallic. A throng of robotic mining spacecraft could grind up pieces of the asteroid and smelt it to capture precious metals within.Platinum — which is used for jewelry, electronics components and automobile catalytic converters — fetches about $1,500 an ounce these days, so a single spacecraft would not have to bring back a lot of it for the enterprise to make money. More common metals like iron could perhaps be used as raw materials in space factories, churning out spacecraft and other structures.Mr. Anderson and Peter H. Diamandis, the other founder of Planetary Resources, are already in the space tourism business with a company called Space Adventures, which has arranged eight trips to the International Space Station. While that venture has been a “reasonably good success story,” Mr. Diamandis said, “the realization, at least for us, was it wasn’t on track to really drive humanity opening the space frontier at the level that we desire.”About three years ago, Mr. Diamandis recalled, he and Mr. Anderson asked the question, “So what’s next?”They set up Planetary Resources a couple of years ago, but have kept quiet about it until now. The president and chief engineer is Christopher A. Lewicki, who previously worked as a manager on Mars missions at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Based in Bellevue, Wash., the company employs about 25 engineers and has development contracts for technologies like laser communications that it believes it will need for prospecting and mining missions.In addition to the leaders of Google, investors include Ross Perot Jr., chairman of Perot Systems; and Charles Simonyi, a former chief software architect for Microsoft and one of the space tourists who has visited the space station. Thomas D. Jones, a former NASA shuttle astronaut and James Cameron, the filmmaker and deep-sea explorer, are advisers.Mr. Anderson declined to say exactly how much money the company has raised. “It’s plenty,” Mr. Anderson said. “The collective net worth of our investors is like $50 billion, and they know what they’re getting into.”The plan is to launch the first spacecraft — a small telescope to find small nearby asteroids — within the next two years. Next, the company would send out a batch of small explorers to visit some of them. Actual mining would begin after that, first targeting water and then platinum.From meteorites that have landed on Earth, scientists know that some asteroids have concentrations of platinum 20 times that of ore in a platinum mine on Earth. But the concentration of the platinum would still be tiny — perhaps a few hundred atoms per million — and the company would need to develop robotic technology to extract the element from the rocks.“To do large, large-scale mining of asteroids, you’re talking about decades,” Mr. Anderson said.One possibility the company is considering is to nudge a small asteroid, perhaps one as long as a football field, into an orbit around Earth closer than the moon. Then Planetary Resources — and possibly other companies — could try out their ideas of how to set up a mining operation. “As one of the many options of how we could start the resource development, that’s certainly among them,” said Mr. Lewicki, the company president.Drawing on nearby asteroids for natural resources is actually a very old idea.In 1926, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, a Russian scientist who worked out many of the basic requirements of rockets and space travel, listed colonization of the asteroid belt as number 12 of 16 steps in his “plan of space exploration.” Other dreamers have come along more recently.“This is actually the fifth or sixth company that has been invented for purpose of doing it,” said John S. Lewis, a retired University of Arizona professor who wrote a 1997 book, “Mining the Sky” (Basic Books), that described much of what Planetary Resources is looking to do.The American Rocket Company in the mid-1980s developed a rocket motor, but Dr. Lewis said George A. Koopman, one of that company’s founders, told him the ultimate destination was the riches of the asteroids. When American went out of business in 1995, James Benson, one of its founders, started another company, SpaceDev.A decade ago, Mr. Benson made promises similar to the ones Planetary Resources has. SpaceDev’s Near Earth Asteroid Prospector was to rendezvous with an asteroid, conduct scientific observations and claim it as private property. It was never built. (While SpaceDev never got to orbit, the company, now part of Sierra Nevada Corp., did have a notable space achievement. Its motors powered the SpaceshipOne, the first privately financed manned flights to space and will also be used in Richard Branson’s upcoming Virgin Galactic spacecraft.)Dr. Lewis thinks that Planetary Resources has a better shot at getting to the asteroids — he was involved with both American and SpaceDev and is also an adviser to Planetary Resources — because unlike previous ventures, “this one has the distinct advantage in that it has technical savvy and adequate capitalization to get started.”'"
"'12-04-24,'1','When today’s parents played in youth leagues about 30 years ago, they typically showed up for games run by the local parks and recreation department, often outfitted with little more than a glove and the clothes on their back. They now register their children for leagues run by independent local boards, which sometimes control huge budgets with little or no municipal oversight.In most parts of the country, the old parks and recreation leagues are long gone. John Engh, the chief operating officer of the National Alliance for Youth Sports, said the combination of slashed municipal budgets and the push to involve children in organized sports at a younger age resulted in the current system.“It’s been a gradual process, driven by the concept of all-stars and travel,” he said.Some parents now pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for youth sports.“I think of it as the global warming of youth sports,” said Mark Hyman, the author of “The Most Expensive Game in Town: The Rising Cost of Youth Sports and the Toll on Today’s Families.”Fran Dicari, the host of the Web site StatsDad.com, said he spent $11,704 on fees, equipment and travel expenses for two children last year, with baseball accounting for about a third of it. “Looking back on it, you would not think that we were sane people,” said Dicari, who lives in the Cincinnati area. “But in the circle we were in, we were normal.”Travel costs for high-level leagues represented a high percentage of Dicari’s expenses, but those costs would be even higher if travel teams were not partly subsidized by the registration fees at lower competition levels. Engh said that it was not unusual for 50 percent of registration fee revenue to be funneled toward travel expenses for all-star teams. Parents of 5-year-old T-ball players are essentially bankrolling out-of-state bus trips for a handful of 12- to 16-year-olds.“It’s very common for boards to look at the budgets of their masses as a way they can support their travel leagues,” Engh said.Budgets for local youth athletic boards, which usually receive operation permits from municipal governments, can swell to more than $1 million for a city of 100,000, all under the direct control of a board described by Engh as “a contractor, a plumber and somebody’s mom, with an accountant as the only paid employee.”Once registration fees are paid, parents rush to the sporting goods store with credit cards at the ready. Some have future scholarships in their eyes.“Increasingly, some parents see their kids’ sports life as a career path,” Hyman said.Others just need to keep up with the Joneses or enhance an already expensive experience in any way possible for their children.“There are a lot of forces nudging you toward the more expensive end of the scale,” Hyman said. “All around, other families are making big investments.”Baseball and softball equipment accounted for $488 million in wholesale sales in 2010, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association.Cleats and uniforms drive the total sales over $1 billion. Youth equipment represents the highest percentage of sales, particularly bat sales, as the parent willing to buy a $200, 28-inch bat for a 9-year-old is likely to pay the same price for a 30-inch bat for a 10-year-old the next season.May, of the sporting goods association, noted that there were alternatives to high-end items, that $40 bats were just as beneficial for casual players as $220 ones and that it was still possible to show up at the field with just a glove and some enthusiasm.“Cost should not be a reason why you do or don’t play baseball,” he said.The National Alliance for Youth Sports recommends that leagues make every effort to recruit across the entire community, even if it means reducing rates for needy families. Many leagues comply. The Greenwich Village Little League in Manhattan charges a $200 registration fee, but the league provides scholarships, paid for by donations and city grants, to any family in its district that applies.“We ask applicants to pay what they can,” the league president, Daniel Miller, said. “If it’s nothing, it’s nothing.”The Greenwich Village Little League also actively recruits disadvantaged families by hanging fliers and holding registration sessions in housing developments. As a result, 10 percent to 20 percent of league members are on scholarship, Miller said.Not all leagues are so inclusive. Engh said some leagues would invite out-of-town players to participate at higher registration fees instead of offering services to disadvantaged local youths.“There’s no loyalty,” Engh said, adding that he believed municipal governments needed to take back some oversight and control. “They need to make sure that the kids who use those fields are really from that community.”With increased expenses inevitably come increased pressures. “The greater the financial investment, the greater the emotional investment,” Hyman said.League schedules have grown longer, sports specialization has increased and overuse injuries and burnout have become problems for some young athletes.For parents like Dicari, youth sports become a way of life. “Some people have vacation houses or boats,” he said. “I don’t. This is how I choose to spend my money.”Dicari has noticed that even parents at his high commitment level are balking at some expenses and canceling costly trips to tournaments.“There’s a lot of people hurting financially and still trying to do this,” he said.When balancing the benefits of organized sports with the rising costs, many parents err on the side of going the extra mile, or dollar.“It’s very difficult to tell whether you are really advancing your kid’s sports life,” Dicari said. “The simple way to solve the problem is to hand over your credit card.”Dicari is not tallying his 2012 expenses, but he has no regrets about the tens of thousands of dollars he has spent during his three children’s formative years. “It comes and goes before you know it,” he said.It is no wonder that some parents stretch the budget in an effort to make the most of the youth sports experience, for their children and themselves.“The accessories make the experience more complete,” May said. “Parents want their kids to look like Derek Jeter.”'"
"'12-04-24,'1','Accidental deaths among children under age 20 declined 29 percent from 2000 to 2009, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but deaths from poisoning and suffocation increased substantially.The analysis, published last week in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, found that the overall injury death rate in this group dropped to 11.0 per 100,000 in 2009 from 15.5 in 2000.Poisoning deaths increased 80 percent, and 57 percent of them involved prescription drugs. Deaths from suffocation rose 30 percent, mostly in infants.Automobile deaths declined sharply because of improvements in seat belt and child safety seat use, stricter licensing requirements, better vehicle design and reductions in drunken driving. But crashes remained the leading cause of injury deaths in children.“While we’ve seen this decline in injuries, we still see one child dying every hour,” said Linda C. Degutis, director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. “We’re concerned about the increase in suffocation deaths among infants and the increase of 91 percent among 15- to 19-year-olds in poisoning deaths, most of which can be attributed to prescription drugs. These deaths are preventable.”Rates declined across the country, but there was wide variation. Mississippi had 25.1 deaths per 100,000; New Jersey and Massachusetts had rates under 4.5.'"
"'12-04-24,'1','For the disability program, as for Social Security over all, tax receipts would be sufficient to pay about 75 percent of promised benefits after the trust fund was exhausted.The estimates, a perennial source of political ammunition in the debate over federal spending, debt and taxes, come as Republicans and Democrats are noisily blaming each other for the problems of the popular programs, which provide benefits to more than 55 million people.The public trustees of the two programs, Charles P. Blahous III and Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, summarized the situation in a joint statement.“The Social Security outlook has worsened significantly relative to last year’s report,” they said. “By almost any objective measure, the financial health of the Social Security system has entered a concerning decline.”The projected gap between Social Security income and costs in the long term is the largest recorded since the last major effort to shore up Social Security, in 1983, the public trustees said.In the past, Congress has occasionally shifted revenue from one trust fund to another to avoid any interruption of benefits. But if the disability trust fund borrowed money from Social Security’s old-age trust fund, the loan would have to be repaid, officials said, and the measure would not solve the programs’ problems.One of the trustees, Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said, “Medicare is in a much stronger position than it was a few years ago, thanks to the Affordable Care Act,” signed by President Obama in 2010.Without that law, Ms. Sebelius said, “the hospital insurance trust fund would expire eight years earlier, in 2016.” The law squeezed nearly $500 billion out of Medicare over 10 years, trimming payments to providers on the assumption that they would become more productive.Richard S. Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, said the projections in the report, based on current law, “are probably poor indicators of the future financial status of Medicare.”First, Mr. Foster noted, the report assumes that payments to doctors treating Medicare patients will be cut 31 percent on Jan. 1. In the past, Congress has usually overridden such cuts.In addition, Mr. Foster restated his view that the savings required by the 2010 health care law “will not be viable in the long range.”The best available evidence indicates that most hospitals, nursing homes and other providers cannot increase their productivity as much as Congress assumed, he said.The trustees themselves said that “future Medicare costs could be substantially larger than shown” in their report, which assumes “unprecedented improvements in health care provider productivity.”The projected date of exhaustion for the Medicare trust fund was the same as estimated last year, and the short-term outlook for Medicare’s finances was similar. But, the public trustees said, “the reported long-term financial outlook has grown worse,” primarily because the government accepted advice from technical experts suggesting faster growth in Medicare costs.The report on Social Security said its finances had weakened for several reasons. The cost-of-living adjustment this year, 3.6 percent, was much larger than the increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent predicted last May.In explaining changes in their Social Security projections, the trustees cited slower growth in average earnings of workers and the persistence of unemployment in the slow recovery from the recession. They lowered their projection of average real earnings in the future, primarily because of a surge in energy prices and “slower assumed growth in average hours worked per week after the economy has recovered.”A bipartisan House-Senate committee on deficit reduction collapsed last fall without any agreement on how to revamp Medicare or Social Security, and the same conflicts were evident on Monday in reactions to the trustees’ report.“The administration has failed to lead, and Congressional Democrats have resorted to demagoguery rather than finding long-term solutions to protect Medicare and Social Security,” said Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the panel’s health subcommittee, said, “Today’s report continues to show Medicare on a sound financial footing,” mainly because of the 2010 health care law. Still, Mr. Stark said, Republicans keep trying to “end Medicare as we know it, not because the program is unsustainable, but because they want government out of the business of guaranteeing health care.”The report shows that Social Security will, for the first time, pay out more than $1 trillion of benefits in 2017, up from $725 billion last year.'"
"'12-04-24,'1','The defense countered that the payment was largely a scam by Mr. Young and his wife, Cheri, to siphon hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ms. Mellon to build a house in Chapel Hill not far from the Edwards family estate.Besides haircuts, payments went to cover the medical expenses of Mr. Edwards’s mistress, Rielle Hunter, who gave birth to their daughter in 2008, and to keep his affair with her secret. Mr. Edwards went along with this plan, a defense lawyer said, to avoid humiliation for himself and his wife.“It never crossed his mind that the money would be in violation of campaign finance law,” Allison Van Laningham, a defense lawyer from Greensboro, told the jury. For Mr. Edwards, she said, the episode has been “the destruction of pride and the birth of humility.”“John Edwards is a man who committed many sins,” she said, “but no crime.”The choice of Ms. Van Laningham, with her sometimes rushed delivery and slight Southern drawl, suggested that Abbe Lowell, the Washington lawyer leading Mr. Edwards’s team, made a strategic choice to rely on a local lawyer to introduce the defense case to the jury, which was seated earlier in the day.The 12 jurors and four alternates include six African-Americans and a few Republican donors, and are almost equally split between men and women. The members come largely from the more rural middle of the state.The trial is likely to come down to whom the jurors believe: Mr. Edwards or Mr. Young. The defense argued that Mr. Young took money from Ms. Mellon without Mr. Edwards’s knowledge and put it in his own bank account, and that many of the facts in the book he wrote, “The Politician” were, by Mr. Young’s own admission, inaccurate.As if to insulate his star witness, Mr. Harbach spent the afternoon showing how an idealistic Mr. Young worked his way into Mr. Edwards’s inner circle, beginning in his Senate office, sometimes serving as his personal aide. They often traveled alone together and, once Mr. Edwards left the Senate to pursue the presidency, Mr. Young became a kind of errand-runner and caretaker for the Edwards family.“You will not like him,” Mr. Harbach said.He urged Mr. Young to explain two alcohol-related driving offenses, and to talk about the moment he realized that Mr. Edwards and Ms. Hunter were having an affair. Mr. Edwards, who usually watched sports with Mr. Young, turned down an offer to watch a game while they were staying at a hotel. Minutes later, Ms. Hunter, who was making videos of the campaign, called to check her schedule for the next day. Mr. Young heard Mr. Edwards in the background.The next morning, Mr. Edwards had Mr. Young drop Ms. Hunter off at the airport before they continued to a lunch with Ms. Mellon.Listening to those details of the budding scandal that destroyed Mr. Edwards’s career and reputation was Mr. Edwards’s eldest daughter, Cate Edwards Upham, a lawyer who was helping advise his defense team. Mr. Edwards’s parents, Bobbie and Wallace, sat next to her, on cushions they brought from home.The trial is expected to last six weeks. If he is convicted on all six counts, Mr. Edwards, 58, faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines.'"

"'12-04-24,'1','LONDON — The British media regulator said Monday that it had begun an investigation into Sky News, a satellite news channel whose parent company is partly owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, following an admission by the broadcaster this month that it had hacked into e-mails in search of scoops.In a statement, the regulator, Ofcom, said it was “investigating the fairness and privacy issues” raised by the announcement that executives at Sky News had authorized a reporter to gain illegal access to e-mail accounts on two occasions. That news opened the latest front in a scandal that has already spread from Mr. Murdoch’s newspapers to the heart of government, public life and the police force.The Ofcom investigation will focus on potential invasion of privacy and will likely take around three months, a spokesman said.Also Monday, Judge Brian Levenson, who oversees an ongoing media ethics inquiry, told the head of Sky News, John Ryley, that hacking into private e-mail accounts for a story was violating the law.“What you were doing wasn’t really invading anyone’s privacy, it was breaching criminal law,” Mr. Levenson told Mr. Ryley, who was scheduled to appear as a witness to the inquiry before the Ofcom investigation. “It was,” Mr. Ryley acknowledged, marking the first time a British television news operation has admitted breaking the law in search of stories.'"

"'12-04-25,'1','The deals with the Universal McCann clients are among several that are closed, or close to being completed, as the introduction of Aspire nears, said Mary Jeanne Cavanagh, executive vice president for ad sales in the New York office of GMC TV. She said she expected to complete at least $10 million in advertising agreements by the premiere in seven to 10 categories that would also include beverages, distilled spirits, domestic beer, fast food, pharmaceuticals, retailing and telecommunications.Aspire is among scores of cable channels and broadcast networks — along with many media outlets outside the realm of television, like Web sites — that are getting ready to present themselves to marketers in what is known as the upfronts, so named because the sales take place ahead of the start of the fall TV season.Aspire will compete for black audiences with channels and networks that include BET, Black Heritage Network, Bounce TV, Centric and TV One. It will be the second cable channel recently started by a celebrity, after OWN, from Oprah Winfrey and Discovery Communications, which has traveled a rocky road since its introduction in January 2011. “Have I had sleepless nights? Yes, at the beginning,” Mr. Johnson said by phone. “I looked at what Oprah was going through and I said, ‘Do I really want to do this?’ ”Although “there’s no question it’s a big challenge, a big undertaking,” he added, “I feel really good about it” now. (He also said he hoped that Ms. Winfrey was “able to turn it around,” describing her as “a role model for me as a great entrepreneur.”)Mr. Johnson says he has enjoyed his work for Aspire, including visits to media agencies to discuss the channel and its plans to provide programming for an “underserved” audience.“My learning curve has been great,” he said, laughing, “but I am so happy I went through the process. I always want to learn.” Mr. Johnson praised the partnership with GMC TV in helping sign the initial advertisers, saying, “So far, knock on wood, we’re off to a good start.”Ms. Cavanagh, for her part, said, “We knew we had something with Magic Johnson,” adding how she was “fortunate to take him to major agencies in New York” on sales calls that were notable for the visual contrast the pair offered.“I’m 5-1 on a good day,” she said, “and he’s 6-9.”The name of Mr. Johnson’s channel is meant to evoke a goal to offer its viewers programs that are upbeat and inspirational.“We responded to the positive intent, the positive messaging, the more aspirational images of the community,” said Yin Woon Rani, North American president for Universal McCann. “It’s right from a business standpoint and right from a community standpoint.”“Magic brings credibility because he’s so focused on being a role model,” she added.“Aspire came to us early in the sales cycle,” Ms. Rani said, and “we saw the possibilities and the potential almost immediately.”“The African-American target is so central to so many of our clients,” she added, “particularly those who signed up” as the initial advertisers.While in New York, Mr. Johnson — who also recently led a group that agreed to buy the Los Angeles Dodgers — helped promote a Broadway play, “Magic/Bird,” that is focused on the relationship between him and Larry Bird. The play is also promoted on the section of Mr. Johnson’s Web site, magicjohnson.com, that is devoted to his company, Magic Johnson Enterprises.A central plot point in “Magic/Bird” concerns the filming of a Converse commercial in 1985 by Mr. Bird and Mr. Johnson. Three decades later, Mr. Johnson owns a channel that sells commercial time.'"

"'12-04-25,'1','HARTFORD (AP) — United Technologies, the big diversified manufacturer, reported Tuesday that its earnings rose more than 19 percent in the first quarter, though it acknowledged some slowing from weak economic growth in the United States, China and Europe.The company posted net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion, or $1.31 a share, if the businesses that it put up for sale are factored out. That compares with earnings for those same operations last year of $1.05 billion, or $1.06 a share. The results beat Wall Street’s expectations for earnings of $1.21 a share.United Technologies, the parent company of the jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney, the Otis elevator business and Carrier heating and cooling systems, said its revenue was $12.42 billion in the quarter from January to March, down 2 percent from the comparable period last year.It was the first drop in revenue since early 2010. The company said the costs of a major restructuring now under way would cost more because of what its chief financial officer, Gregory J. Hayes, said would be a “tough year.”The company last month announced the sale of numerous businesses, including rocket engine and wind power operations, for $3 billion to help finance its $16.5 billion acquisition of the aerospace supplier Goodrich. It also will take on $8 billion to $10 billion in short- and long-term debt, use $3 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in mandatory convertible issues.'"
"'12-04-25,'1','The 3M Company, maker of Post-it notes and fuel system tuneup kits, reported a 4.6 percent increase in its first-quarter profit on Tuesday, beating analysts’ forecasts, as industrial demand in the United States helped offset slowing markets abroad.The company said its profit rose to $1.13 billion, or $1.59 a share, from $1.08 billion, or $1.49, a year earlier. Per-share results included a charge of 4 cents for early retirements. Analysts had projected that 3M, which is based in St. Paul, would earn $1.49 a share, the average of 15 estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.The United States drove sales at 3M’s industrial and transportation unit, its largest division. Operating profit slumped 29 percent at the display and graphics business, which serves manufacturers of liquid-crystal-display televisions with optical films.“The fact that they were able to beat numbers with their technologies business seeing declines in operating income year over year is a good sign the rest of their businesses are operating pretty well,” Mark Demos, a money manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Minneapolis, said in a telephone interview.Shares of 3M rose $1.36, or 1.6 percent, to close at $88.49.The company also raised the low end of its 2012 profit forecast, saying earnings would be in a range of $6.35 to $6.50 a share, from a previous floor of $6.25.Sales rose 2.4 percent to $7.49 billion. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of $7.44 billion. Sales in the United States rose 6.3 percent.

"'12-04-25,'1','“China has grown from a rounding error to a massive new market,” said Robert Cihra, an analyst at Evercore Partners. “Their premium price point clearly has not been any hurdle to them growing there.”Mr. Cook said that enormous numbers of people moving into the middle class in China were creating demand for goods including the iPhone. He said Apple was “doing everything” it could to serve the market. The iPhone 4S went on sale in China on Jan. 13, near the beginning of the last quarter, and starts at nearly $800 without a wireless plan, though it is available free with a multiyear carrier contract.Since becoming chief executive of Apple last fall, Mr. Cook has repeatedly identified China as one of the biggest growth opportunities for Apple. The growing appetite for Apple’s products among Chinese consumers comes at a time when Apple is working with manufacturing partners and parts suppliers to improve working conditions in factories in countries like China, where most Apple products are made.Apple executives also said demand for the newest version of the iPad, released by Apple last month, was outstripping supply of the product, leading to shortages. They said it remained their fastest-growing business and that Apple had sold 67 million of the device since the first model went on sale in 2010.Mr. Cook said it took 24 years for Apple to sell an equivalent number of Macintosh computers. In the education market, one of the strongest for the Mac, Apple said it sold two iPads for every Apple computer. In one example, the San Diego school district bought 10,000 iPads during the last quarter, with plans to buy 15,000 more in the current quarter, according to Apple.Apple previously told Wall Street to expect earnings of $8.50 a share and revenue of $32.5 billion for the quarter. But as they do nearly every quarter, analysts viewed Apple’s official figures as lowball estimates and came up with their own more bullish forecasts. On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected Apple to report earnings of $10.06 a share and revenue of $36.81 billion for the quarter.Investors in Apple had grown increasingly skittish about Apple’s performance in the weeks before the earnings report, sending its shares down from a high of $636.23 on April 9 to $560.28 at the close of regular trading on Tuesday. Among their chief concerns were research data showing weak sales of the Macintosh computer and worries about whether iPhone sales could keep up their momentum.But immediately after the results from Apple came out, its shares shot up nearly 7.4 percent in extended trading. Even after the jitters of the last several weeks, Apple’s shares are up 38 percent for the year and the company remains the world’s most highly valued company.Some investors fear a repeat of a pattern from last year, when Apple said it lost some sales of the iPhone because of a steady escalation of rumors about the release of a new model. Those rumors were accurate; Apple announced the iPhone 4S in early October.There is widespread speculation that Apple will again introduce a new version of the iPhone in the fall and that consumers might wait for its release so they can get the latest gadget. The iPhone has become an engine of Apple’s growth over the last two years, accounting for almost 40 percent of the company’s revenue during the quarter. Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray, said a slowdown in iPhone sales in the months ahead of an expected fall or summer release of a new version remained likely.“You can count on that,” said Mr. Munster.As it does in most quarters, Apple again tempered expectations with analysts. In the company’s current quarter, Apple said it expected to report earnings of $8.68 a share and revenue of $34 billion.The company also said its hoard of cash and cash equivalents rose to more than $110 billion. Apple has said it intends to slow the growth of its cash through investor dividends and share buybacks.'"
"'12-04-25,'1','Filmmakers are not the only ones who sometimes run afoul of artists’ copyright law. In recent weeks Google Art Project, which just expanded its online collection of images to more than 30,000 works from 151 museums, agreed, because of copyright challenges, to remove 21 images it had posted.Artists’ copyright is frequently misunderstood. Even if a painting (or drawing or photograph) has been sold to a collector or a museum, in general, the artist or his heirs retain control of the original image for 70 years after the artist’s death.Think of a novel. You may own a book, but you don’t own the writer’s words; they remain the intellectual property of the author for a time.So while MoMA owns the actual canvas of “Les Demoiselles,” the family of Picasso, who died in 1973, still owns the image. And under existing law, the estate will continue to own the copyright until 2043.If someone wants to reproduce the painting — on a Web site, a calendar, a T-shirt, or in a film — it is the estate that must give its permission, not the museum. That is why, despite the expansion, Google Art Project still does not contain a single Picasso.Indeed, few 20th-century artists are included in the project’s digital collection because copyright owners have not yet given permission. “We don’t want to prevent Google from showing the work, but they won’t enter into negotiations with us,” Mr. Feder said.The Art Project’s position is that it is the responsibility of each museum to get copyright permission. “Google is placing the burden and onus on the museum, which is unfair to them and unfair to the artists,” Mr. Feder said.Robert Panzer, executive director of VAGA, a second company that represents the copyright interests of artists, said that Google was legally responsible for securing the permissions. “It’s a game that they should try to make it someone else’s responsibility,” said Mr. Panzer, whose group represents more than 7,000 artists worldwide.The Toledo Museum of Art recently asked the Google Art Project to remove “Dancer Resting” (1940), by Henri Matisse, as well as 20 other images from its collection that were posted but are still under copyright.“There had been some confusion on all sides,” said Kelly Garrow, director of communications for the Toledo museum. “We want those works on the Art Project, but there needs to be some type of agreement to make that happen.”Mr. Panzer, whose group is currently doing a review of all the work posted on the Art Project, said the underlying question was what Google’s business plans are in the long term: “We have to make sure that the artists’ interests from an aesthetic point of view and a commercial point of view are protected.”Amit Sood, head of the Google Art Project, said it had decided early on to focus on its partnerships with museums. “We have been approached by commercial organizations who wanted to sell us content, but we chose to work directly with the museums,” Mr. Sood said. “We believe they are in the best position to assess rights status and we are happy to work with them to address any concerns.”Groups representing authors and publishers have been trying for years to come to an agreement with Google over its plan to digitize every book published. But after a federal judge threw out a proposed settlement in 2011, citing copyright and monopoly concerns, no agreement is in sight.Raymond Dowd, a lawyer who has represented both sides on copyright questions, said of the Google Art Project: “Every artist is going to have a different view of it. Some will think it’s the greatest thing in the world and others will be horrified, just as the writers were, and just as musicians have been.”Copyright law covers everything from reproductions in books to those used on keychains. “We try to acquire as much information as we can about a project, and then we go to the estate,” Mr. Feder of Artists Right Society explained. His organization, like VAGA, takes a percentage of the fee, which varies depending on the use.Sometimes artists or estates want input. In the 2011 film “Tower Heist,” for example, the estate of Dan Flavin sent an expert to oversee the construction of a Flavin light installation that was recreated on the set.Often celebrated masterpieces end up as nothing more than background scenery. That Alexander Calder you may have noticed in “The Muppets,” the Charles Roka in “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” or the Noguchi in “Friends With Benefits” were all used with the permission of Artists Rights Society. Paul Klee’s “Mask of Fear,” for instance, will make its film debut later this year in “Cloud Atlas” with Tom Hanks, Halle Berry and Natalie Portman.Some news media outlets, including The New York Times, have agreements with the companies that set the terms under which they can make use of copyrighted images from the artists the companies represent.In about 40 percent of its cases, the society ends up trying to prevent the use of an image, Mr. Feder said. Multimillion-dollar movie productions can present a challenge, however. Given the money involved, filmmakers are sometimes willing to risk the expense of a lawsuit and penalties after the movie’s release.When making “Basquiat,” the 1996 biographical film about the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, for example, Mr. Feder said that the film’s director, Julian Schnabel, ignored the objections of the artist’s father and created paintings in Basquiat’s style for his movie. Using these sorts of “derivative” images is also prohibited by copyright law, but Mr. Schnabel used them anyway, Mr. Feder said. In the end, Mr. Basquiat declined to sue.Other filmmakers have tried to comply with family requests. Ismail Merchant and James Ivory sent the Picasso family a script of their 1996 film, “Surviving Picasso,” and then flew to Paris to make their case in person. But the estate was unhappy that Picasso was portrayed as an inconsiderate womanizer, so it refused to grant permission. Instead, to recreate the aesthetic atmosphere, the filmmakers used work by Picasso’s contemporaries, Matisse and Braque.Mr. Feder said that when he went to see “Titanic 3-D” recently, he noticed one revision that he appreciates: A fleeting shot of “Les Demoiselles” going underwater has been replaced by Edgar Degas’s work “L’Étoile” — which was also never on the ship but is at least a painting already in the public domain.'"
"'12-04-25,'1','WHERE WILL THE GAMES BE PLAYED? The model receiving the most support has the semifinal games rotating among the four so-called B.C.S. bowls — Sugar, Orange, Fiesta and Rose — with the site of the national title game determined in a manner similar to that for the Super Bowl.The option remains to have all three playoff games within the bowl system. A more lucrative option would be to have all three outside the bowl system, accepting bids for neutral-site games. Outsourcing lucrative games to the bowls has never made financial sense, but excluding the long-entrenched bowl system could be tricky politically.There is also the option that the higher-seeded teams could host the semifinal games, although that idea is losing steam because of the potential for small sites (Oregon) and remote campuses (Kansas State), which would not maximize profitability.HOW WILL THE MATCHUPS BE DETERMINED? The idea of only conference champions being allowed into the playoff is hotly contested, and the chances appear to be dwindling that that restriction will be put in place. How could Mike Slive, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, which has produced the past six national champions, agree to a rule that would inhibit multiple teams from his conference from playing for the crystal ball trophy just months after an all-SEC national title game?Pacific-12 Commissioner Larry Scott and Big Ten officials have been vocal in their support of only conference champions being eligible because that would maintain the value of the regular season. But television executives would frown on it; they want the four highest-ranked teams and the least amount of controversy, at least in terms of teams being excluded.So what other options are left? Can the unreliable B.C.S. formula — with the built-in conflict of having coaches vote and its relentlessly tweaked computer polls — be used to determine the top four teams? Will that create a similar controversy, just about a different format? Tricky stuff.WHAT’S IN THE WAY? There is still no single person in charge, no commissioner like David Stern or Roger Goodell to push through hard issues with the good of the game in mind. And that is a problem considering the meeting rooms are filled with alpha males who realize their legacies are tied to what will be determined in the next 10 weeks. The issue with leaders like Slive, Scott and Jim Delany of the Big Ten is that their focus is on what is best for their own conference, not necessarily the sport. Delany and Scott, for example, have strong allegiance to the Rose Bowl, which has long matched the champions of their leagues.Different commissioners cling to different plans, and there is no one to mediate, negotiate and pull the group together.To show just how fractured the B.C.S. meeting room can be, consider that the B.C.S. hired two television consultants — Chuck Gerber, who is closely linked to Slive, and the Wasserman Media Group’s Dean Jordan, who is considered an ally of Delany. They are known as Mike’s guy and Jim’s guy. This is not going to be easy.WHAT ABOUT THE N.C.A.A.? The N.C.A.A. has no role in the B.C.S. discussions, meaning that its president, Mark Emmert, has as much say in the future of college football’s postseason as a random fan posting on an Internet message board.WHAT IS THE TIMETABLE? The changes will not be put in place until after the 2014 regular season. The B.C.S. structure is based on a series of four-year television contracts, and the one with ABC/ESPN expires after the 2013 season. So these changes, at their core, are about college football’s leaders positioning themselves to get more money out of a new television contract. Expect the contract to be longer than four years, with preliminary chatter pointing to a period of 8 or 10 years.As for when the format changes will be determined, the goal is to have things completed before July; two meetings are planned for June. Many are pessimistic that the timetable will be met, however, pointing to the differing goals of the conference commissioners. Nothing has been easy through the history of the B.C.S., so why would anything change now?WHO IS GOING TO LOSE OUT? The bowls. It is just a matter of how much. The B.C.S. bowl games have virtually no shot at hosting a national title game. If they are squeezed out of being involved in the semifinals, they will spiral into irrelevancy.WHY WON’T THEY CALL IT A PLAYOFF? Four years ago, going into similar meetings, the idea on the table was a convoluted plus-one system that essentially never received a hearing. The consultants and television executives were careful not to call it a playoff, however, because that word could have scared the university presidents.Given the countless scandals and the financially driven conference realignment that has occurred since then, one would think those in charge of the B.C.S. would not be so skittish as to avoid using the word playoff. Guess again. In a recent B.C.S. document obtained by USA Today, the four-team playoff was called the Four Team Event. Can’t make it up.WHAT WILL THIS ALL BE WORTH? It depends on how it is packaged. For all the B.C.S. games, including the Rose Bowl’s separate contract, ABC/ESPN pays about $160 million. That number could easily double this time.But a lot depends on how much inventory the television networks are paying for, as the number of so-called B.C.S. games is likely to expand.What will probably happen is that the semifinals and the final will still be under the B.C.S. umbrella. But for marketing, advertising and branding purposes, the top-10 teams would still play in so-called B.C.S. bowls, meaning games like the Cotton, Capital One or Chick-fil-A Bowls could be added to the B.C.S. roster.Then, of course, there is the matter of avoiding matchups that most viewers are not interested in watching, like West Virginia against Clemson, and sidestepping controversies like leaving out deserving teams like Boise State and Kansas State.BOTTOM LINE Three playoff games and three other top-tier bowl games would deliver a blockbuster television contract. Expect ESPN or Fox to end up with the rights, with NBC and Turner merely flirting with the idea.'"
"'12-04-25,'1','Even from her prison cell, Ms. Tymoshenko, a populist with a flair for political theatrics, has remained a potent force. Her supporters frequently take to the streets in protest over her treatment, and members of her Fatherland party have turned Ukraine’s Parliament into a platform for promoting her cause.Her allies have accused Ukraine’s president, Viktor F. Yanukovich, of orchestrating her imprisonment in an effort to clear the political playing field. Mr. Yanukovich barely edged Ms. Tymoshenko in the 2010 presidential election. Just months later, she was arrested and put on trial on charges of working against Ukraine’s interests in a 2009 energy deal with Russia. Last fall, she was sentenced to seven years in prison. Several of her former allies in government, including a defense minister and an interior minister, have also been jailed.Her prosecution has darkened relations with the West, particularly the European Union, which has vowed to delay ratification of an association and free trade agreement with Ukraine — one of Mr. Yanukovich’s major policy goals — until she is released from prison.That is unlikely to happen anytime soon. Last week, hearings began in a new trial against Ms. Tymoshenko on charges of tax evasion and embezzlement stemming from her time as head of a private natural gas trading company in the 1990s. She has denied the charges.On Tuesday, Ukrainian news media reported that lawmakers from the Fatherland party held a sit-in at Parliament, demanding that lawmakers with medical training be allowed to visit Ms. Tymoshenko to conduct an independent evaluation of her health.“We will not leave this place until the head of the fascist service that oversees prisoners arrives here,” said Sergei Pashinky, one of the lawmakers, according to the Interfax news agency.Ms. Tymoshenko has complained of severe back pain and other health problems. The authorities have granted her permission to received medical care in a special clinic in Kharkov, in eastern Ukraine. But she has indicated that she wants treatment outside the country.On Tuesday, Germany’s foreign minister, Guido Westerwelle, said in a statement that he was “deeply concerned” about Ms. Tymoshenko’s health, and said his country would “continue to press the Ukrainian authorities for her to finally receive adequate medical treatment.”On Tuesday, Ms. Tymoshenko did not make clear how long she would maintain her hunger strike, saying only that she was prepared to continue “steadfastly and with dignity no matter what.”'"
"'12-04-25,'1','The earnings season so far has been stronger than analysts expected. With results in from 153 S.& P. 500 companies, more than three-fourths have topped analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research.“U.S. corporate earnings are actually coming in pretty strong,” said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Md.“Negatives are being paid attention to more at the moment than the positives, but the positive earnings reports are providing some support here.”The Dow Jones industrial average gained 74.39 points, or 0.58 percent, to close at 13,001.56. The S.& P. rose 5.03 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,371.97. But the Nasdaq composite index slipped 8.85 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,961.60.Adding to weakness in tech, Netflix sank 13.9 percent to $87.68, a day after it forecast slower subscriber growth this quarter.Texas Instruments forecast second-quarter revenue growth above estimates, signaling the end of a prolonged inventory-related decline in demand, but the results were not enough to counter the broader weakness in the technology sector. Its stock slid 1.7 percent to $31.36.Many analysts have cautioned that a correction is near, given the stock market’s sharp rally since October. The S.& P. 500 is up 9.1 percent so far for the year.“When you see the big spread between the Dow and the Nasdaq, you know that there’s a bit of a flight to safety there, so people are leaving the over-the-counter stocks and buying the higher-quality securities. So New York didn’t look as strong as it might have appeared,” said Douglas Davis, chief executive of Davis-Rea in Toronto.AT&T advanced 3.6 percent to $31.72, while 3M gained 1.6 percent to $88.49. Shares of United Technologies, which also reported results that beat forecasts, edged up 0.1 percent to close at $79.85.Single-family home prices rose for the first time in 10 months in an encouraging sign the battered sector was starting to stabilize, according to the latest S.& P./Case-Shiller report.Separately, the government said that single-family home sales sagged to their lowest level in four months, but that sales in the previous three months were revised higher than initially thought. Consumer confidence edged slightly lower in April, according to a report from the Conference Board, a private research group.Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 100 8/32, and the yield rose to 1.97 percent from 1.94 percent late Monday.'"
"'12-04-25,'1','Last week, the Spanish central bank reported that the nation’s nonperforming loans had hit the highest level since 1994. And while the government’s official estimate of mortgages going unpaid is only 3 percent, Mr. Hugh and other economists say the actual numbers are probably much higher — in double digits for some lenders.There is no doubt that the number of new home mortgages has fallen off sharply in Spain. The number of mortgages signed in February was down by 46 percent from a year earlier — the biggest drop since such figures were first published in 2004, Spain’s national statistics institute said Tuesday.The real estate boom, while it lasted, gave Spain the world’s highest rate of homeownership — with more than 8 of every 10 Spanish households owning the places they lived. But lenders are now depending on people like Marta Afuera Pons, who is juggling two mortgages — one on her house, another on an investment property that went sour — and is about 350,000 euros in debt.In late 2010, Ms. Afuera Pons, who had just lost her job as a social security administrator, stopped making payments on the mortgage of 132,000 euros that she and the man she lived with had taken out for their home in Tordera, near Barcelona.Separately, they still owe 185,000 euros to the same bank after receiving further financing in 2007 to buy a house that was never built, because the developer went bankrupt a year later.Like many Spaniards, Ms. Afuera Pons is hitting the two-year limit for receiving unemployment benefits. This month, she will receive her last 1,100-euro unemployment check.Finding no buyers for her Tordera house, Ms. Afuera Pons says she is trying to persuade her lender, the savings banks BMN, to take back the mortgage and the property. She would then probably move in with her mother, because her partner left last summer for Brazil and is now married there.Ms. Afuera Pons says she accepts blame for her financial disaster but considers her lender, BMN, the enabler. She has joined an association of mortgage holders that has been staging demonstrations to demand relief.“It’s now easy to say that wanting this new house was a risky investment, but the bank fully supported this idea,” she said. “Everybody lost any sense of caution, starting with the banks.”BMN said it would not comment on Ms. Afuera Pons’s specific case. But a spokesman, Miguel Portilla, said that the bank’s policy was “always to try to find every way possible to avoid throwing people out of their home and on to the street.”Real estate experts in Spain estimated that about 300,000 properties have been repossessed since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. Unwilling to take losses, banks have mainly held onto these homes. But now, facing pressure to raise more capital, banks are rushing to unload them, offering discounts of up to 60 percent.Many investors also see a warning signal in the deteriorating performance of Spain’s 100 billion euro mortgage-backed securities market.Much as their counterparts did in the United States during the American housing bubble, Spanish banks sold off the mortgages to financial companies, which repackaged them into bundles of securitized mortgages — investment vehicles that paid high yields and were bought by insurance companies and European pension funds and other institutional investors.There was supposed to be a crucial difference, though. In the United States, many of the mortgages underlying the securities bundles that turned bad were subprime, meaning the home-buying borrowers had dubious credit histories. In Spain, the mortgages used as collateral for the bundled securities were considered to be prime — lent only to creditworthy borrowers.But with unemployment nearing 25 percent, the distinction between a prime and subprime borrower can be hazy. Many of these mortgages are now failing, prompting a wave of downgrades by ratings agencies like Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s, which had given the mortgage-backed securities top-notch ratings during the boom, just as they did in the United States.Investors are anxiously monitoring the Web site of a Spanish association of fund managers who deal in the mortgage securities. In some cases, up to 14 percent of the assets in certain mortgage pools are more than 90 days overdue.“It’s really scary,” said an investment banker who buys and sells the securities but who was not authorized by his bank to discuss them publicly. “Every quarter the numbers get worse.”According to the association’s Web site, among the worst performing mortgage securities in investment funds are the ones backed by Bankia, which is now Spain’s largest provider of home loans. Bankia said it does not comment on the performance of such funds.Until recently, banks had been buying back, at full price, some of the worst performing mortgage securities in order to protect the mostly foreign investors that hold them, in hopes of preserving the banks’ investment standing. But as more loans default and capital becomes even more scarce, some banks are now facing up to the inevitable and are offering to buy back these securities at discounts of 10 to 30 percent.Many analysts say that official data on Spanish real estate prices, down by 25 percent according to some measures, do not truly reflect how far prices have actually plummeted. Until price adjustments are made, and banks and securities investors book their losses — as happened in Ireland and the United States — economists say it will be impossible for the Spanish economy to truly recover.As those losses are acknowledged, though, the question then becomes whether Spain can afford to absorb them. The government’s own bank bailout fund is running out of money. In a telling contradiction, Madrid has proposed that the country’s banks lend the government the money to keep the fund going.Borja Mateo, author of a recent book on the Spanish real estate market, said there were now 1.9 million housing units for sale in Spain and about 3.9 million that could go on to the market in the coming years. With current housing demand now at about 175,000 units a year, Mr. Mateo predicted the glut would cause home prices eventually to fall by 60 percent.Because the typical Spaniard has 80 percent of his or her assets tied up in real estate, a plunge in prices of this magnitude would be devastating. “What we are seeing,” he said, “is a massive impoverishment of a country.”'"

"'12-04-26,'1','Early in Raymond De Felitta’s documentary of the 1960s-era South, “Booker’s Place: A Mississippi Story,” a couple of tales are quickly told about black men who were shot or beaten for their transgressions against whites: one for inadvertently brushing his mop against a woman’s foot, another for touching someone’s car. The anecdotes lay down the law as it stood shortly before the time Booker Wright, a black waiter, made the fateful decision to explain to a documentary crew for NBC News not only what he served white customers but also how he felt about their varied treatment of him.He was beaten for his brave, conscientious honesty, and his own business (the Booker’s Place of the title) was torched. Mr. De Felitta’s moody, well-rounded film (which is also playing in the Tribeca Film Festival) is a kind of excavation and investigation of Mr. Wright’s actions as a piece of civil rights history.Mr. De Felitta, whose other films include the New York drama “City Island” and a documentary about a jazz crooner, dredges up the mind-set embedded in Greenwood, Miss., Mr. Wright’s hometown. Without turning into a survey, the film addresses the Delta’s linked heritage of slavery, sharecropping and segregation.To do so Mr. De Felitta orchestrates a rich chorus of family members and wrinkled observers, white and black, whose creased faces seem to reflect the contradictions they have lived through. The film, shot in black and white, features some fine, disarming portraiture. (By contrast, its mawkish piano soundtrack is a blunt and unnecessary tool, an example of a convention that documentaries everywhere should just abandon.)An added facet to this reckoning with the past is that the 1966 NBC documentary was directed by Frank De Felitta, the father of this new film’s director. The elder Mr. De Felitta talks candidly about what he calls his “picture” and his feelings of guilt over the reprisal; excerpts from the broadcast film are shown, at times overshadowing the rest of the new project.Solipsism can be a danger of any personally inflected documentary that retraces a relative’s steps or seeks to crystallize a chosen moment of the past, but Raymond De Felitta makes himself scarce, and “Booker’s Place” has plenty else to say.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','Nobody is gutted in “Sound of My Voice,” a smart, effectively unsettling movie about the need to believe and the hard, cruel arts of persuasion. But over time the men and women who meet in a mysterious house in an anonymous Los Angeles neighborhood — where they shed their clothes and cleanse their bodies in a ritual — are opened up bit by bit, wound by wound, until they’re sobbing and laughing, their insides smeared across the carpet.The hooky story centers on a young couple, Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius), who are clandestinely trying to make a documentary about an apparent cult. The movie opens abruptly, ominously, in the dead of night with the couple being driven — they switch vehicles at one point — to a house where a man instructs them to strip, shower and change into new clothes. (Peter has a tiny spy camera in his eyeglasses.) They do, methodically scrubbing their bodies, and then descend into a sparsely furnished basement. There 10 or so similarly dressed people are waiting for what they believe may be salvation in the ethereal form of a willowy young woman, Maggie (Brit Marling), who, in true star style, knows how to make an entrance: veiled and tethered to an oxygen tank.When Maggie sits down, the party begins in earnest. Without her veil and nasal prongs, dressed in light, loose garments, her long blond hair cascading down her back, she looks like any number of California girls, one of those pretty young women from Kansas or Iowa looking to break into the movies. Maggie is on a different journey, and while the detours and destination of her path are vague, she makes for a mesmerizing traveling companion — or, more rightly, guide. Because Maggie is the reason that Peter, Lorna and the rest are here, and she knows it, feeds on it. Talking in a soft voice she gives them exactly what they need: attention, hope, a break from the past, a bead on the future. Even as Peter and Lorna keep trying to make their film, they’re not immune to her.Is Maggie a Manson, a Madonna or perhaps something else entirely? That’s the question that the director Zal Batmanglij and Ms. Marling, who together wrote the script, keep teasingly open. Peter and Lorna are adamant that they already know the truth, at least before Maggie starts boring into their heads (much as the filmmakers try to do with us). Peter is particularly zealous, confusing belief with knowledge. Whether he can actually see what’s happening, inside the basement and out, plays into the movie’s ideas about the push-pull between reality and the world of appearances. In a nice touch, Peter makes a living as a schoolteacher, which suggests he isn’t exactly an innocent when it comes to indoctrination.From the start, when the word “one” slams on the screen, beginning a count that divides the story into 10 sections, Mr. Batmanglij gives the movie an appreciable air of unease. Like Peter and Lorna, you don’t know whether Maggie’s the real deal — though the better question is what type of deal she is offering. Is she a friend, foe, fool or just another La-La Land guru peddling transcendence? Ms. Marling, raising her voice only occasionally and keeping her gestures largely relaxed, makes restraint work for her, which fits the movie’s increasingly claustrophobic vibe. Maggie erupts only periodically, and when she does it’s always other people’s fault: They are withholding, cowardly. One moment she’s a caring therapist, the next an acting coach and then the personification of a superego.Mr. Batmanglij and Ms. Marling do better when they’re working through the material, especially in the basement sessions, then tying everything together, and their big finish, while pleasingly surprising, is the kind of tricky deus ex machina that needs better finessing. The movie’s ambitions are modest, but within its narrow parameters — with sets that look as if they cost about two bucks and grayish digital visuals that make you yearn for film — they create a plausible, recognizable world about characters engaged in that most fundamental search: for the meaning of life. Ms. Marling, who also starred in and was a writer on the recent independent feature, “Another Earth,” another low budget movie that intelligently made the most of its limited means, appears to be on her way to figuring out that question.'"

"'12-04-26,'1','Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta pushed Brazil on Wednesday to buy $4 billion worth of Boeing-made Super Hornet fighter jets, saying the prospective sale reflected how important Brazil was to the United States. During the first visit by an American defense secretary to the country in seven years, Mr. Panetta used a speech at Superior War College in Rio De Janeiro to focus on smoothing a sometimes thorny relationship and promoting American weapons sales. Brazil is deciding whether to buy 36 fighter jets worth about $4 billion in a competition between Boeing in the United States, Dassault Aviation in France and Saab in Sweden.Mr. Panetta’s appeal was unusually direct and reflected the Pentagon’s new attention to Brazil after President Dilma Rousseff met this month with President Obama at the White House. The two pledged to strengthen defense ties between their nations at a time when the United States is turning from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and trying to build up military relationships in other parts of the world.'"

"'12-04-26,'1','As a result, analysts say, the court is likely to declare Mr. Gilani guilty, a verdict that could carry Pakistan into new legal territory, with potentially stark implications for the Zardari government. Having faced down speculation concerning a military coup in January, the government has bolstered its strength and now hopes to complete its five-year term a year from now, when elections are scheduled.Now its challenge lies with the Supreme Court.Rooting out corruption is an old problem in Pakistan, where bribery, kickbacks and nepotism are endemic among politicians, generals and even cricketers, but the means to prosecute them have become heavily politicized. In politics, and the military, corruption is seen as a way of either feathering one’s own nest or tarring a rival’s. Virtually every political leader — and many military ones — have faced similar accusations.The Supreme Court aims to show that it has the will and power to change that. On Wednesday evening soldiers were posted at checkpoints in Islamabad in anticipation of a day of high political theater, with television stations expected to broadcast coverage.Yet the clash has one strange aspect: The “Swiss letter,” as it is known, at the heart of the affair, could prove to be meaningless. In interviews by phone from Geneva, Swiss lawyers and a senior magistrate who had been involved in the cases said it would be virtually impossible to revive the cases against Mr. Zardari at this point.One obstacle, they said, was his immunity as head of state; another is Switzerland’s 15-year statute of limitations, which expires this year. A third is the exasperation of the Swiss authorities.“Switzerland is not some yo-yo you can play with,” said Daniel Zappelli, a former state prosecutor who drew up charges against Mr. Zardari in the 1990s. “You can’t say one day you will go with the case, and then next day that you won’t. We spent basically 10 years working with the parties in Pakistan to review everything, and we mightn’t be so hot to do all that work again.”Mr. Zappelli resigned as Geneva prosecutor on March 31; a spokeswoman for his successor, Olivier Jornot, would not comment.The Swiss reluctance raises a question: Why are Pakistan’s judges and leaders willing to go toe-to-toe over a potentially meaningless gesture?The conflict stems partly from the aggressiveness of the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, which often challenges the authority of a government it paints as incompetent and corrupt.Critics say the court sometimes goes too far, and may be driven by personal motives. Justice Chaudhry is a bitter rival of Mr. Zardari, who resisted his reinstatement as chief justice in 2009. Some analysts believe that by prosecuting the prime minister, the court has overreached.“The Supreme Court, like the military, thought they could scare this government into compliance,” said Cyril Almeida, a writer at Dawn, a major English-language newspaper. “Now the government has called their bluff.”With a guilty verdict looking more likely, according to analysts, news media speculation has focused on the severity of the prison sentence Mr. Gilani could face on Thursday, and whether the judges would press to have him dismissed from office.Some analysts said the justices could try to save face by sentencing Mr. Gilani for a short time; others said that in an effort to maintain popular support the court might push for his immediate ouster.“If the prime minister emerges with just a slap on the wrist, it will be seen as a major blow to the credibility and prestige of the court,” Mr. Almeida said.The turmoil comes at an awkward time for the Obama administration. American and Pakistani officials are engaged in quiet negotiations over the reopening of NATO supply lines into Afghanistan, closed since November, when 24 Pakistani soldiers were mistakenly killed in a border exchange of fire and American airstrikes last November. A senior Western official said the American government was still debating whether to apologize.Mr. Zardari, for years haunted by the nickname Mister 10 Percent, suffers from an especially poor reputation. Some of this stems from class and ethnic prejudice. As an ethnic Sindhi with relatively liberal views, he is viewed by much of the country’s Punjab-centric establishment as a vulgar arriviste. Still, there is much evidence of his lavish living and mysterious wealth.In the late 1990s, after Mr. Zardari’s wife, Benazir Bhutto, served as prime minister, state prosecutors in Switzerland and Britain produced evidence of a high-rolling international lifestyle: secret bank accounts in the Caribbean, diamond necklaces purchased in Beverly Hills, and a sprawling English country estate worth millions of dollars.In 2003 Swiss prosecutors showed that he had received $12 million in what were suspected to be kickbacks from a Swiss company providing customs services to Pakistan. In addition, $48 million that was frozen in Swiss banks was alleged to have been related to contracts for everything from Polish tractors to French submarines.Back in Pakistan, Mr. Zardari was already in jail. But attempts to convict him foundered due to political interference. Although he spent 11 years in jail from 1990 to 2005, he was never convicted.The military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf dropped all charges in 2007, as part of a political deal with Ms. Bhutto that resulted in the controversial National Reconciliation Ordinance. Months later, the Pakistani government officially withdrew its cooperation in the Swiss cases.The Supreme Court declared that arrangement illegal in 2009. But by then the money had vanished. Mr. Zardari’s Swiss accounts quickly emptied; papers recently obtained by The New York Times from financial authorities on the Isle of Man show that the sales proceeds from his English mansion totaling £3.28 million (about $5.3 million) were transferred to two offshore companies in June 2011.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','“It’s more of a question of steering it back to where it was,” said Mr. Funtleyder, whose fund owns the stock. “I’m not sure you need a total redo. You need a course correction.”Mr. Gorsky also sees major opportunities in global markets. Already, 55 percent of Johnson’s sales come from overseas, but the company can do better, Mr. Gorsky said.Developing markets, he said, are growing at three to five times the rate of markets like the United States and Europe. “And as more people move into the middle class, they represent even more of an opportunity,” Mr. Gorsky said.There is no question that Mr. Gorsky, who is replacing William C. Weldon, has his work cut out for him. Consumer confidence in Johnson & Johnson, once one of the most trusted brands, has dipped in recent years as the company recalled dozens of products, including millions of bottles of children’s Tylenol and other medications, as well as artificial hips and other products.Last week, company officials told analysts that efforts to fix the manufacturing problems that had caused the recalls of over-the-counter brands were taking longer than expected, and that some brands might not return to shelves until 2013.Mr. Gorsky said Wednesday that the company has made changes to its supply chain and quality control procedures and that working with a third-party firm as well as the Food and Drug Administration was taking a long time. “We’re learning as we go through this process,” he said. “We believe we’re starting to see the benefits of some of that, but we still realize that there’s work that we have to do.”When the products return to shelves, Mr. Gorsky said he was confident that customers would continue to buy them. He said this has already happened with some returning brands. “The events over the last couple of years have had a negative impact, but we’ve been, I think, encouraged by how resilient our brands and our company reputation has been,” he said.Mr. Gorsky, who is 51, joined Johnson & Johnson as a sales representative in 1988. He ran the company’s pharmaceutical businesses in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, then left in 2004 to head the North American pharmaceuticals business at Novartis. He returned to Johnson & Johnson four years later.Mr. Gorsky won the chief executive job over Sherilyn S. McCoy, who had led the pharmaceuticals and consumer groups, but resigned to become chief executive of Avon this week. Mr. Weldon will remain as chairman.Manufacturing problems are not the only troubles that the company faces.A judge in Alabama fined the company $1.2 billion over accusations that it had hidden and diminished the risks of Risperdal, an antipsychotic drug, and the company is facing similar lawsuits by state attorneys general across the country. The Alabama case is being appealed, and Mr. Gorsky declined to comment on the matter, citing the litigation.He also declined to comment for similar reasons on his role in an artificial hip implant that has failed in thousands of patients, crippling some of them. Mr. Gorsky was head of the device and diagnostics group at the time that critical decisions were being made about the implants.Although some have criticized Johnson & Johnson for hiring an insider to lead the company during a difficult time, Mr. Gorsky said he has a track record of taking decisive, sometimes counterintuitive, action. He described himself as a “realistic optimist” and cited as an example the company’s decision last year to stop making drug-coated heart stents.Recent research has shown that stents were overused and that drugs might be a better alternative to avoiding heart attacks or strokes. At the same time, he said, he chose to expand the company’s orthopedics business by negotiating the deal to acquire Synthes, a medical device maker.Of the decision on the heart stents, “I think that represents the kind of decisiveness that we’re going to need again, even in an area where I think that few would have felt that Johnson & Johnson would do that,” he said. “That’s the realist in me.”'"
"'12-04-26,'1','Delany’s comments added to the air of inevitability that there would be significant change after the 2014 season, probably resulting in a four-team playoff. But Delany has stressed that the Rose Bowl needs to be an important factor, calling it one of the top “single-day television properties in the world.”“It’s part of the perspective that we bring to the table,” he said. “How that ends up? To be determined.”Delany’s priorities have always caused tension in the meeting room, and the Rose Bowl issue is one of the hottest topics of the meetings.“I don’t need to weigh in on that,” Florida Athletic Director Jeremy Foley said. “You guys can weigh in on that.”He added with a smile: “That’s why we’re meeting. Obviously, there’s a lot to be discussed.”Although Dodds is not here, he told USA Today on Wednesday that the Big Ten and the Pac-12 could keep the Rose Bowl and let the rest of the conferences hold a playoff for the national title.“The only way it’s going to get fixed is for the rest of the country to have a playoff of some kind and let them do their deal,” he said. He added that coaches would go “berserk” and that the two conferences would eventually have to come around.Dodds’s calculated comments reflect how divisive the Rose Bowl is, and the silence of officials from other universities showed how controversial the Rose Bowl is here.While Delany declined to get into specifics on playoff models that were being discussed, the general tone of his comments indicated that he was open to a four-team playoff bowl system if the Rose Bowl were involved.“I think some approaches with four teams are a slipperier slope than others,” Delany said. “Some I think lead more naturally to expectations for future and further growth. Some ways of formatting are what I would describe as more collegiate and less professional, and therefore the slope is less slippery.”Delany pointed out that the first Rose Bowl, between Michigan and Stanford, was temporarily replaced by ostrich races. Those are in no danger of returning, but Delany made it clear he was determined to keep the Rose Bowl relevant.“I just want to make sure that the changes that we make are evolutionary,” he said, “that they support the regular season and from the Rose Bowl perspective they sustain that tradition and that we’re able to produce something that the public appreciates and supports.”'"
"'12-04-26,'1','The decision by the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity to reverse its previously unanimous recommendation to restrict publication of H5N1 bird flu experiments is understandable. Reassurance from one scientist involved in the work that the virus wasn’t so threatening after all and a slam dunk briefing from unidentified intelligence officials refuted prior reservations.Such starkly divergent outcomes leave the distinct impression of a chaotic system. Federal officials say they know they must do better in the future. Unable to either view the evidence or weigh the uncertainties, the public entrusts experts and officials to create mechanisms allowing biosecurity questions to be decided wisely.To maintain public confidence, these decision-making processes must be objective, consistent and free from the influence of special interests.Identifying all individuals possessing the privilege and responsibility to provide the advisory board with the best information available will be a vital step toward a more reliable process.The writer is a professor of microbiology at Midwestern University, Arizona College of Osteopathic Medicine.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','Kudos to Frank Bruni for drawing attention to the anti-Semitic, bigoted Jobbik party of Hungary (“Round Up the Usual Scapegoats,” column, April 24).While a number of far-right parties in Europe run on xenophobic platforms, Jobbik is the only parliamentary party of a European Union member state that campaigns with openly anti-Semitic materials. Its elected officials have made anti-Semitic remarks in Parliament, including a blood libel just this month. The party’s presidential candidate, Krisztina Morvai, has referred to Israeli Jews as “lice-infested, dirty murderers.”Jobbik’s rise in popularity over the last few years — with 17 percent of the population voting for Jobbik in 2010, up from 2 percent in 2006 — parallels a rise in anti-Semitic attitudes among the general population. An ADL opinion poll in February found that 63 percent of Hungarians agreed with three out of four anti-Semitic statements about Jews and money, Jewish disloyalty to the state, and Jews and the Holocaust.Of the 10 European countries we polled for anti-Semitic sentiments, Hungary was by far the worst. By comparison, on the same scale measuring the prevalence of anti-Semitic attitudes, the Netherlands scored just 10 percent and France, 24 percent.Opposition to Jobbik’s anti-Semitism and racism is perhaps the single issue on which the ruling Fidesz party and the opposition Socialist party agree. Mainstream political and civil society leaders must continue to speak out consistently and take action to encourage their fellow citizens to reject Jobbik’s bigotry.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','But he said the company was more confident about its plans for increasing production of the 787, which had more advance sales than any other plane in history.He said that by this summer, Boeing should no longer have to make many small fixes on the 787s after they come off the assembly line. He also said the company still planned to increase production of the planes from three and a half a month now to five a month later this year and 10 a month by the end of 2013.Buoyed by the news, Boeing’s shares jumped 5.3 percent, to $77.08 a share, by the close of trading on Wednesday.Robert Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients that the first-quarter results represented a “very good start to 2012 by Boeing.”Boeing said its net income rose by 58 percent to $923 million, or $1.22 a share, from $586 million, or 78 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2011. Its revenue jumped 30 percent to $19.4 billion from $14.9 billion.On average, analysts had expected Boeing to report a profit of 93 cents a share, according to Bloomberg.Boeing said the latest earnings included 11 cents a share from a reduction of its litigation reserve. Because of that extra money, it increased its earnings forecast for all of 2012 to $4.15 to $4.35 a share from its previous guidance of $4.05 to $4.25 a share.Several analysts asked during the earnings call why Boeing was not increasing the guidance even more in view of the first-quarter results. Greg Smith, Boeing’s chief financial officer, said the company was being cautious and could change the guidance if production increases went smoothly.Boeing also plans to increase production of its highly profitable older models, the 737 and the 777, as the economic recovery spurs worldwide demand for new planes. Over all, Mr. McNerney said, the company expects a 40 percent increase in plane production over the next three years.He said an updated version of the 737 being designed now drew 301 orders in the first quarter, bringing the total to 451 since last summer.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','In a packed British Parliament, Prime Minister David Cameron had to defend his austerity drive against critics like Ed Miliband, head of the opposition Labour Party, who called the economic numbers “catastrophic.”The raucous scene was the latest manifestation of growing popular frustration with the strict fiscal diet that has been prescribed by the European Central Bank and German leaders in response to the euro zone’s sovereign debt crisis. While Britain is not a member of the euro zone, its economic fortunes are closely linked with those of the currency union.The discontent was on view in French elections last weekend and played a role in the collapse of the Dutch government on Monday. Greece, Spain and Italy have been the scene of mass demonstrations for months, but the turmoil now seems to be spreading to countries that were not seen as being at the heart of the crisis.Britain joined Belgium, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain in recession.Except for Germany, most European countries do not have the financial leeway to pump up their economies with public works projects or other government spending, economists say. Leaders are groping for ways to encourage growth with the limited means at their disposal.Mr. Draghi acknowledged Wednesday that such changes were difficult for the citizens affected.Economic reforms “change profoundly the societies in which we live,” he said. “This is a source of pain.”He urged national leaders to take steps to promote long-term growth even when it is politically difficult. Some leaders have raised taxes or cut infrastructure projects, when instead they should be reducing government operating expenses, Mr. Draghi said.Mr. Draghi’s plea for beleaguered Europeans to stay the course came as the central bank released a bank survey showing a sharp decline in demand for credit by borrowers, which analysts said was further evidence that the euro zone is in recession.In Britain, some economists had predicted a small increase in first-quarter gross domestic product after recent surveys had indicated that the economy was recovering, although very slowly. Mr. Cameron’s government had pointed to the recovery as a sign that the austerity measures it implemented were working.“It’s too early to call for a reversal of government policy,” said Azad Zangana, an economist at Schroders. But he added, “These latest results do highlight that the economy will not withstand any further acceleration in cuts.”The British gross domestic product numbers caused bewilderment among some economists, including Andrew Goodwin of Ernst & Young’s economic forecasting unit, the Item Club. “Our reaction to these figures is one of disbelief,” Mr. Goodwin said. “I would be very surprised if these figures were not revised upwards.”Even if the figures are later revised, they could have a negative effect on consumer sentiment and corporate spending, said Howard Archer, an economist at IHS Global Insight. The report could “hit consumer and business hard and make sustainable growth harder to achieve.”Output in the British construction sector fell 3 percent in the first quarter while output from production industries fell 0.4 percent, the government statistics office said Wednesday. Manufacturing shrank 0.1 percent and the services sector grew 0.1 percent.In Parliament, Mr. Cameron conceded that “these are very, very disappointing figures” and that Britain was in a “very tough situation that frankly just got tougher.”Mr. Cameron’s government, a coalition of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, has been losing ground to Labour in recent polls as voters have become disillusioned with the economic outlook and the austerity plan.But Mr. Cameron said the government would stick to its plan to eliminate most of the budget deficit by 2017.“More debt and more spending is what got us into this problem,” Mr. Cameron said. “It can’t be the solution of the problem.”Mr. Draghi took a similar tack, saying countries with a record of deficit spending have not seen benefits; instead their economies have “flatlined,” he said.“If one thinks you can increase demand by increasing deficits,” he said, without naming any countries, “then how come we don’t have higher demand?”As Mr. Draghi spoke, the central bank released its quarterly survey of bank lending, which offered probably the best data yet on the effect of the inexpensive, three-year loans that the central bank issued to commercial banks in recent months.The survey showed that banks continue to tighten the standards they apply to borrowers, but at a more modest rate than in the last survey. In addition, banks said they were having an easier time raising money by issuing their own corporate bonds or borrowing on money markets.Mr. Draghi said the underlying problem was not so much lack of credit as lack of demand by borrowers, which has plunged.“Demand is subdued and therefore demand for credit is subdued,” he said.Under sometimes hostile, sometimes sympathetic questioning in Brussels by members of the European Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr. Draghi avoided commenting directly on the political events of recent days. But he demonstrated he was well-aware of them.The euro zone has arrived at “probably the most difficult phase of our process,” Mr. Draghi said.In the first round of French presidential elections on Sunday, the Socialist candidate, François Hollande, won the most votes after promising to step up such traditional forms of government stimulus as subsidies for industry. On Monday, the Dutch government fell amid an impasse over budget cuts.Mr. Draghi did not rule out the possibility that the European Central Bank might issue to commercial banks another round of cheap loans.He expressed optimism that the central bank cash would begin to have a positive effect.“Given enough time,” he said, “this money will find its way into the economy.”'"
"'12-04-26,'1','The scandal escalated this month when the government said that the wife of Mr. Bo, Gu Kailai, might have had a role in the killing of Neil Heywood, a 41-year-old British businessman, following a dispute over “economic interests.”The government said that because Mr. Bo might have interfered with the case, he was now under investigation for serious disciplinary infractions. In mid-March, he was removed from his post as party secretary of the city of Chongqing in central China, and then he was suspended from his position on the Politburo and the Central Committee.Ms. Gu and a man the authorities described as the family’s 32-year-old “orderly,” are suspects in the murder case. And China’s state-run news media has hinted that the Bo family may have engaged in illegal transfers of assets overseas and other forms of financial corruption.It was a startling fall. Few political families are better-known in China than that of Mr. Bo. He and his wife are children of Communist revolutionary figures, placing them in China’s most elite status. Ms. Gu is a lawyer and businesswoman; Bo Guagua, the couple’s only son, studied at Harrow and Oxford University in Britain and is now a graduate student at Harvard.The case has renewed discussion here about the enormous wealth now held by the families of China’s top leaders, and fueled debate about whether Communist Party officials are using their power to steer government contracts and lucrative business deals to close relatives. Corporate records show that the relatives of Mr. Bo and his wife have amassed at least $160 million in assets over the past decade.The family controls a wide array of companies and offshore investment vehicles, with interests in hotels, banks, real estate, firefighting equipment, printing, Internet social networking, water treatment and even a charitable foundation.Mr. Bo’s son by his first marriage once worked for Citigroup and ran several investment funds. He also co-founded a charitable organization with one of the country’s wealthiest men, Niu Gensheng, who helped found Mengniu Dairy.His younger brother, Bo Xicheng, has made indirect investments in companies that operate in Dalian and Chongqing, where Bo Xilai served as mayor and party secretary.Like several other relatives, Bo Xiyong kept a low profile and, in addition to the alias Li Xueming, he was known as Bo Xiyong in some public appearances.He has also advised a Hong Kong-listed company called HKC Holdings, now run by the family of an Indonesian billionaire. He recently stepped down as a nonexecutive director.Although he is not a day-to-day executive at the company, Bo Xiyong appears to have been a longtime adviser to Everbright. His official biography also says that he has held positions with several other divisions of the China Everbright Group, including deputy general manager of China Everbright Group Limited and China Everbright Holdings Company Limited. He has also served as chairman of the Shanghai Everbright Convention and Exhibition Center Company and vice chairman of China Everbright Industry Group Limited and China Everbright Investment Management Corporation. It is unclear whether he retains any of those positions.In a statement Wednesday, Chen Xiaoping, the chairman of China Everbright International said: “The Board would like to take this opportunity to clarify that recent reports by the media on Mr. Li’s family background have no relationship with the normal business and operations of the Company, and have not affected and will not affect the normal business and operations of the Company and its subsidiaries.”'"
"'12-04-26,'1','Officers have so far identified 195 new items for investigation within the historic material, as well as having developed the new material. A Metropolitan Police spokesman appealed to “anyone who is able to provide direct information as to her whereabouts” to contact the authorities.Madeleine was just nine days shy of her fourth birthday when she was abducted as she was sleeping along with her younger twin siblings while her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, dined with friends in a tapas bar 100 yards away.Rewards totaling millions of dollars were offered by wealthy Britons, including J. K. Rowling, the billionaire author of the Harry Potter series, and Richard Branson, the airline tycoon. But the Portuguese police identified only one suspect, a 33-year-old Briton living with his mother in a nearby apartment. They also scrutinized the parents at one point, though it seemed unlikely to most investigators that they would harm their own child, particularly as the twins went untouched.Despite the publicity created by an international campaign and continued claims of sightings (the latest of which came on the Costa del Sol in Spain last week), the official investigation by the Portuguese police was formally closed in July 2008. At the time, even Portuguese prosecutors faulted the country’s police for failing to uncover any clues in the girl’s disappearance.In May last year, however, a separate Metropolitan Police inquiry, code-named Operation Grange, was established after Prime Minister David Cameron responded to a plea from Madeleine’s parents. The objective has been to present to the Portuguese authorities new avenues of investigation, with a view to having the case reopened.The task force, led by Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, consists of 28 detectives from the Homicide and Serious Crime Command and seven civilian staff members who have been working in “close collaboration” with a senior investigating officer from the Portuguese police.While officers have made two trips to Spain and visited Portugal four times, most recently last week, the thrust of the investigation has been a methodical analysis of more than 40,000 pieces of information already collected.Detectives have been painstakingly sifting through “every single piece of paper” — about 100,000 pages — generated by the original investigation, on the basis that sometimes it takes fresh eyes to see what was always there.It has been an arduous process. Police officers had to wait for the documentation to be provided by the Portuguese police, and then for the material to be translated. They have also reviewed files from the police in Leicestershire, the McCann’s home county, and those of private investigators who have been working on behalf of the family for the past five years. To date, the review has cost taxpayers $3.2 million.“From the outset we have approached this review with a completely open mind, placing Madeleine McCann at the heart of everything we do,” Mr. Redwood said.“We are working on the basis of two possibilities here. One is that Madeleine is still alive, and the second that she is sadly dead. Based on the former we are releasing the age-progression image today with a specific appeal. If you know where Madeleine McCann is now, or you have new direct information or evidence about what has happened to her, then please contact us.”Mr. Redwood rejected the conspiracy theories that have circulated about Madeleine’s parents’ involvement. He said that the girl’s disappearance was the result of “a criminal act by a stranger.”It will come as renewed encouragement to the McCann family, whose ceaseless energy and reluctance to call off the search have been fundamental in keeping the case in the international spotlight. Since their daughter’s disappearance they have traveled to the Vatican for an audience with Pope Benedict XVI, who blessed a photograph of Madeleine, published a book and even appeared on “The Oprah Winfrey Show.”The investigation’s findings will also relieve some of the political pressure that fell on Mr. Cameron when the investigation was restarted last year. Legislators accused the prime minister of bowing to entreaties from the media empire of Rupert Murdoch, who this week is answering questions from Parliament about phone hacking and accusations that his subordinates worked hand in glove with government ministers in his company’s bid to take over BSkyB, a pay-television service that he had long coveted.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','RIO DE JANEIRO — Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta pushed Brazil on Wednesday to buy $4 billion worth of Boeing-made Super Hornet fighter jets, saying the prospective sale reflected how important Brazil was to the United States.During the first visit by an American defense secretary to the country in seven years, Mr. Panetta used a speech at Superior War College here to focus on smoothing a sometimes thorny relationship and promoting American weapons sales.Brazil is deciding whether to buy 36 fighter jets worth about $4 billion in a competition between Boeing in the United States, Dassault Aviation in France and Saab in Sweden. Boeing makes the F/A-18 E/6 Super Hornet, Dassault makes the Rafale and Saab makes the Gripen.Mr. Panetta’s appeal was unusually direct and reflected the Pentagon’s new attention to Brazil after the country’s president, Dilma Rousseff, met this month with President Obama at the White House.Mr. Panetta told an audience of Brazilian military officers at the war college that the Boeing offer had strong support in the United States Congress and “contains an unprecedented advanced technology sharing that is reserved for only our closest allies and partners.”The Boeing sale is a priority for the American government — Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has been pushing it as well — in large part because it will provide jobs. Brazil wants the planes for air defense, including keeping watch over the Amazon, a major route for cocaine coming in from Bolivia.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','Stocks advanced on Wednesday, giving the Nasdaq 100 index its biggest gain this year, as Apple’s earnings almost doubled and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the Fed was prepared to do more to stimulate growth.Apple surged 8.9 percent for the biggest gain since November 2008. Boeing added 5.3 percent as earnings beat estimates after the company delivered more commercial jets while pushing production to record levels. Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction equipment, slumped 4.6 percent as revenue missed projections.The Nasdaq composite index rose 68.03 points, or 2.30 percent, to 3,029.63. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index added 18.72 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,390.69. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89.16 points, or 0.69 percent, to 13,090.72.“It’s encouraging,” James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston, said in a telephone interview. “The earnings season shows that companies can have good profitability in a low-growth environment. As long as these earnings hold up, I’d say that’s a bright sign for the market.”The S.& P. 500 has risen 11 percent in 2012 on better-than-estimated economic and corporate data. Companies in the United States are beating earnings estimates at the highest rate in two years as growth at home helps counter a drag from Europe. Profits have topped forecasts at 80 percent of S.& P. 500 companies reporting since April 10.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','Using inaccuracies in the book Mr. Young wrote about his time with Mr. Edwards as well as his national media appearances and a paid speech, Mr. Lowell attacked him on even the seemingly smallest of inaccuracies and contradictions.Did he leave his job with Mr. Edwards’s Senate office because he was unhappy in Washington or because he was bad at it? Did he first meet Rielle Hunter, Mr. Edwards’s mistress, at an airport, as he asserted in earlier testimony, or at a hotel, or perhaps a Dave Matthews concert? And how much did he really know about the tense triangle involving Ms. Hunter, Mr. Edwards and his wife?“Didn’t you purposely exaggerate so many of these stories to tell a better story about yourself?” Mr. Lowell asked.Mr. Young, who has been granted immunity in exchange for testifying for the prosecution, turned from a cooperative if not subdued witness for the prosecution into one whose refrains were “I don’t recall” and “I would be guessing, sir.”By the end of the day, Mr. Lowell suggested that the Edwards-Young relationship was akin to a love affair, and Mr. Young was the political version of a scorned lover.He ingratiated himself into Mr. Edwards’s life for personal gain and prestige, Mr. Lowell said. And then Mr. Edwards turned his back on him.“You really hate him, don’t you?” Mr. Lowell said.It was the third day on the witness stand for Mr. Young, who was the first to testify when the trial began Monday.Earlier in the week, Mr. Young described how he and Mr. Edwards found money to support Ms. Hunter so the affair could continue, how they hid it, and how the relationship between the men began to crumble.As it became clear that Mr. Edwards was about to be exposed and the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination slipped from his grasp, Mr. Edwards sought to hold on to his slim hopes of a vice-presidential selection by seeking to distance himself from his aide, Mr. Young testified.Mr. Young said he had become increasingly angry and concerned that he would be left legally liable for a cover-up that involved taking nearly $1 million from a Texas millionaire, Fred Baron, and Rachel Mellon, an elderly banking heiress. Mr. Baron died in 2008.When Mr. Young finally managed to get a secret meeting in the summer of 2008, the two men nearly came to blows because Mr. Edwards was not willing to admit he was the father and clear Mr. Young’s name, he said.But Mr. Edwards defused the situation, Mr. Young testified, saying “that he loved me and that I knew he would never abandon me.”The last time the two men talked, Mr. Young said Wednesday, was in August 2008, when they met in a car on a rural road not far from Mr. Edwards’s home in Chapel Hill, N.C.There, Mr. Young said, Mr. Edwards broke a final piece of bad news: a long-promised job at a foundation financed by Ms. Mellon was no longer in the cards.Mr. Edwards went on to complain that “his life was hell” and that his wife had taken to waking him up at night to scream at him about the affair, Mr. Young testified.“It was surreal,” he said.Mr. Young said he finally told Mr. Edwards that if he did not publicly acknowledge the child’s paternity soon he would release details about the affair himself.Mr. Edwards, he said, had seemed unfazed.“He looked at me and said, ‘You can’t hurt me, Andrew. You can’t hurt me,’ ” Mr. Young said.'"
"'12-04-26,'1','ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Pakistan successfully tested an improved intermediate-range ballistic missile early on Wednesday, according to a statement by the Pakistani military.Six days before the launching, India, the country’s regional archrival, test-fired an Agni 5, a long-range ballistic missile that is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Pakistani military and defense analysts said their missile test was not in response to India’s, which was seen as focused on China. The Agni 5 tested last week is capable of reaching Beijing and Shanghai.Khalid Ahmed Kidwai, a retired lieutenant general who leads the Pakistani military’s Strategic Plans Division, said the improved version of his country’s missile, which can carry a nuclear warhead, would “further strengthen and consolidate Pakistan’s deterrence capabilities.”Pakistani officials said Wednesday’s test was witnessed by senior military authorities, scientists and engineers involved in the country’s missile program. The impact point of the missile was said to be in the Indian Ocean.Mansoor Ahmed, a defense analyst in Islamabad, the capital, said Wednesday’s launching appeared to be of an improved intermediate-range missile, with a possible range of 466 to 620 miles. The missile could be equipped with warheads designed to evade missile-defense systems, he added.'"

"'12-04-27,'1','SEOUL, South Korea — April has not been a great month for North Korea’s image-makers.First, they invited dozens of journalists to chronicle the 100th anniversary of the birth of the country’s revered founder, Kim Il-sung, only to see their signature event — the launching of a satellite — go bust.Now, a pair of German missile experts have gone public with evidence suggesting that new missiles that the North rolled out with much pomp at a parade just days later were mock-ups, and clumsy ones at that.After a close analysis of photographs from the parade, the missile experts, Markus Schiller and Robert Schmucker, found what they said were tell-tale signs of fakery. The warhead’s surface, they wrote in a paper posted on a respected arms control Web site, is undulated, “as if a thin metal sheet was fixed onto a simple inner frame.” The missiles were slightly different from each other, with covers mounted horizontally on one missile and vertically on another, and they did not even fit the launchers they were carried on, the analysts said.“It is therefore clear that the presented missiles are only mock-ups of low quality,” they wrote in a post on the Web site, armscontrolwonk.com. “It remains unknown if they were designed this way to confuse foreign analysts, or if the designers simply did some sloppy work.”One thing is clear, they said. There is still no evidence that North Korea has a functional intercontinental ballistic missile, and the parade was just “a nice dog and pony show.”'"
"'12-04-27,'1','There are also signs of new cooperation on Syria. Only weeks after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called China’s veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution “despicable,” China is supporting Kofi Annan’s peace plan for the strife-torn country and is deploying monitors to help oversee it. Even on North Korea, which China has long sheltered from tougher international action, the Chinese government quickly signed on to a United Nations statement condemning the North’s recent attempt to launch a satellite.And there is progress on the economic front: American officials said China recently loosened trading on its currency, the renminbi, which could help close a valuation gap with the dollar that has stoked trade tensions between China and the United States during an election year.To some seasoned observers of China, these developments are less a harbinger of a new era of cooperation between Beijing and Washington than evidence that, at least for now, the interests of the two countries coincide in some important areas. And these positive signs come despite new American efforts to bolster its troop presence and military alliances to counter China’s dominance in the region.“Over time, there are interests that overlap to some degree and differ to some degree,” said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Obama. “The relationship tends to move up and down over time, as if along a sine curve. But the recent story is mostly a positive one.”With American and Chinese officials preparing for high-level consultations in Beijing next week, the Obama administration is accentuating these positive developments and playing down potential sources of friction like the recent announcement that it would station 2,500 Marines in Australia and the talks it has begun with the Philippines to conduct more joint military exercises and allow more frequent visits by American warships, which both prompted public rebukes from China.The White House has also thrown a blanket of silence over the role an American consulate played in briefly harboring a former associate of the deposed Communist Party official Bo Xilai.Speaking at the Brookings Institution last week, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said, “The cumulative effect of what China has done is very significant and very promising.” At the Naval Academy earlier in the month, Mrs. Clinton declared, “Geopolitics today cannot afford to be a zero-sum game; a thriving China is good for America and a thriving America is good for China.”Mrs. Clinton’s choice of words was noteworthy. A new appraisal of the American-Chinese relationship by Brookings concludes there is deep-seated distrust between the two countries. Beijing, in particular, views the relationship as a “long-term zero-sum game,” the report said.American officials are realistic about the limits to cooperation between China and United States. Though China joined in the United Nations’ rebuke of North Korea after its missile launching, President Hu Jintao later welcomed a top official of the ruling Workers’ Party to Beijing, while another senior Chinese official hailed the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang as a “precious gem.”And North Korea may carry out its vow to conduct a nuclear test. In the aftermath of the failed satellite launching, North Korea staged a military parade featuring a missile-launching vehicle that administration officials say they think was sold to the North by a Chinese manufacturer. While the United States does not believe the Chinese government willfully violated a United Nations ban on military sales to Pyongyang, officials say the sale demonstrates China’s inconsistent approach to enforcing it. “I don’t think China is going to do anything to stop, or get to know, which companies are involved in this,” said Victor Cha, who negotiated with North Korea during the administration of President George W. Bush. “We should identify a few of these companies, and sanction them.”China’s calculations on Iran are just as complex. It is Iran’s biggest energy customer, accounting for more than a fifth of its oil exports. But under American sanctions law, it will be subject to punitive measures at the end of June, unless it shows a “significant reduction” in its imports from Iran or wins a waiver from Mr. Obama on national security grounds.The Chinese government wants to avoid those punitive measures, American officials and Western diplomats said. Given Iran’s isolation, analysts said China might also have concluded that it should diversify its sources of supply. And American officials said China shares the urgency of the United States and Europe in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.The Chinese, said Clifford Kupchan, the Middle East director for the Eurasia Group, a Washington consultancy, “have been bad actors” in the years of diplomacy over Iran, though in recent weeks “their diplomatic rhetoric is tougher and their oil purchases are lower,” he said.The question is whether China is simply waiting out Iran to extract a better price. With Japan and South Korea also cutting purchases to avoid American sanctions, Iran is being forced to stockpile oil in tankers anchored in the Persian Gulf. Unless it shuts down its oil wells, analysts say Iran will run out of storage capacity by summer.That is when China’s intentions will become clearer. By then, however, Mr. Obama will have had to make a critical decision on whether to exempt China from the new sanctions.'"
"'12-04-27,'1','“The White House believes the government ought to control the Internet, government ought to set standards and government ought to take care of everything that’s needed for cybersecurity,” said Speaker John A. Boehner. “They’re in a camp all by themselves.”“We can’t have the government in charge of our Internet,” Mr. Boehner added.The Senate is working on a more comprehensive bipartisan bill that directs the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to issue regulations to protect “critical infrastructure,” including the electric power grid, water and sewer systems, transportation hubs and financial service networks.In confidential briefings on Capitol Hill, administration officials have expressed alarm about the damage that could be done by malicious attacks on computer systems and networks that have become an indispensable part of everyday life. Supporters of the bill said China was stealing jobs by pilfering proprietary information and valuable trade secrets stored in American computers.The House bill was written by Representatives Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the House intelligence committee, and C. A. Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the panel.They accepted many amendments to protect privacy, but not enough to satisfy advocacy groups like the American Civil Liberties Union or the Center for Democracy and Technology. The civil liberties union criticized the bill as “a privacy disaster.”However, Mr. Rogers said the sharing of information with the government was “all voluntary,” and he added, “There is no government surveillance, none, not any in this bill.”The bill says that “cyber threat information” shared with the federal government by the private sector can be used for five purposes: to protect computer systems; to investigate cybersecurity crimes; to protect people from “serious bodily harm”; to protect “the national security of the United States”; and to prevent the sexual exploitation or kidnapping of children.Some members of both parties said they worried that the bill could lead to violations of privacy.“We do have a real cyberthreat in this country, and this bill is an honest attempt to deal with it,” said Representative Joe L. Barton, Republican of Texas, who voted against the legislation.“But the absence of explicit privacy protections for individuals is, to me, a greater threat to democracy and liberty than the cyberthreats that face America.”The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said, “The threat of cyberattack is a real one, but the response must balance freedom and security.”'"
"'12-04-27,'1','Television stations have been making a lot more money from campaign ads since the helped lift the limits on contributions to political groups. The public, though, has been kept in the dark about how much these groups and the so-called are spending, and where they are spending it, because the stations don’t want to make it easy to find out how much they are being paid for those ads.On Friday, the Federal Communications Commission will have an opportunity to make this murky process far more transparent. By voting to require broadcasters to report their political ad sales on a national database — rejecting the stations’ claim that this is too burdensome or expensive — the commission can help the public get a far broader sense of the powerful financial forces driving today’s politics.Stations are now required by the F.C.C. to keep a paper log of all ads they run for candidates and independent political groups, showing how much was charged for each ad. Members of the public can request the logs, but only in person at the offices of each station. That makes it extremely difficult and expensive to compile a full record of how much each candidate or political group is spending.The obvious solution in a digital age is to require the stations to post this information on the Internet, where anyone can see it, and where it can be tallied up.That’s what the F.C.C. has proposed doing, even offering to host all the data on its Web site so the public and the press do not have to go from one station’s Web site to another for all the information. “Physically going to a station and sifting through documents is time-consuming, travel-intensive and difficult,” said a member of the commission, Mignon Clyburn. “Creating a meaningful way for the public to view these files with an online engagement is, to quote a popular commercial, ‘priceless.’ ”'"
"'12-04-27,'1','“His assertion that I ‘took charge of a cover-up’ in relation to phone hacking is a shameful lie, ” Mr. Crone, longtime legal manager of News International, News Corporation’s British newspaper arm, said in a statement.But his former employees were not the only ones Mr. Murdoch laid into on Thursday, in concluding testimony that touched on hacking, newspaper regulation, whether he uses his papers to advance his commercial interests (no, he said) and how a common way to secure a subject’s cooperation, in his view, is for a “journalist to do a favor in return for a favor back.”The targets of his disapproval included The News of the World itself; people he said impeded the phone hacking investigation; and people whose assessments of his hands-on newspaper approach were read aloud to him by Robert Jay, chief lawyer for the inquiry, in an effort to determine how involved Mr. Murdoch was in the paper’s news operations (not very, he said).There was Andrew Neil, a former Times of London editor, who Mr. Murdoch said did not know “the first thing he’s talking about.” There was a former housekeeper of Mr. Murdoch’s, who once leaked a story about him and whom Mr. Murdoch called “a very strange bird.” There was John Major, a former Conservative prime minister whom Mr. Murdoch called bitter and unpopular, and the former Labour prime minister, Gordon Brown, who he said had not always behaved rationally. David Yelland, a former editor of the Murdoch-owned Sun tabloid, wrote a “very strange autobiography,” Mr. Murdoch said, and was drunk on the job.Meanwhile, the Metropolitan Police Department’s seizure of phone hacking evidence, Mr. Murdoch declared, thwarted The News of the World’s initial efforts to investigate itself. As for Harbottle & Lewis, an outside law firm hired by News International, Mr. Murdoch said it failed to inform him that “hey, you’ve got some big problems.”Mr. Murdoch implicitly criticized even his longtime friend Les Hinton, former chief executive of News International, saying it was Mr. Hinton who made the bad decision to hire Mr. Myler as News of the World editor and faulting him as having failed to press Mr. Myler to find out “what the hell was going on.”Employing a version of the “one rogue reporter” defense that News Corporation initially used in dismissing the phone hacking allegations, Mr. Murdoch used a “one rogue newspaper” defense, saying that The News of the World was an “aberration” and that he would have “closed it years before” if its readers had not liked it so much.Mr. Murdoch said he was guilty of “not paying enough attention to The News of the World at any time I was in charge of it” and that he was sorry his company had been “far too defensive” and “disrespectful” of Parliament.Even as their onetime proprietor was disassociating himself from the newspaper he owned for 31 years, former News of the World employees were expressing disbelief at what Hayley Barlow, a former News of the World publicist, called his “black sheep strategy.”“Is this the same man who once stormed into our editorial conference after we had won a raft of industry awards, fawning all over NOTW execs,” Ms. Barlow asked on Twitter, saying he had praised the “great paper,” and “great journalists.” Another former employee, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of jeopardizing a severance package, said of Mr. Murdoch: “He will say whatever he thinks is the best thing to say at a given moment.”Mr. Myler, the editor Mr. Murdoch accused of participating in the cover-up with Mr. Crone, is now editor of The New York Daily News, rival of the Murdoch-owned New York Post. Mr. Myler did not respond to e-mails or phone messages to his office seeking a comment. He and Mr. Crone told a parliamentary committee last summer that in 2008, they told Mr. Murdoch’s son James of allegations that phone hacking might be widespread at The News of the World. James Murdoch has consistently maintained that the pair did no such thing and that he knew nothing about it.Speaking of Rupert Murdoch, Mr. Crone said: “It is perhaps no coincidence that the two people he has identified in relation to his cover-up allegations are the same two people who pointed out that his son’s evidence to the parliamentary select committee last year was inaccurate.”'"
"'12-04-27,'1','The global treks have produced some of the ordinary aches and pains known to long-distance runners. But Olsen’s second trek has also included episodes of dysentery, malaria and dehydration. Olsen and his accompanying drivers have experienced extreme desert heat, the chill of high altitudes, robbery and the loss of three shipments of running shoes in the Argentine postal system.He has stayed in huts and hotels, and eaten cuisine from Sudan and 7-Eleven. He cut down trees in Siberia in exchange for food — “Your money doesn’t matter” — and has fended off swarms of insects. While he normally rejects tea, in the Middle East he partakes, seeing it as part of the cultural immersion.Bespectacled, clean-shaven and with a fair complexion, Olsen looks more like a cubicle refugee than a globe trekker. He is a political scientist, though he is not currently employed. He talks fast and with animation, even enthusiasm, about disease, insects and running in unkind weather.“For me, every single day is different,” he said. “It’s like if you had a route near where you live and every day you step out and you don’t know what’s going to be like there. What people are going to be there, what the landscape is going to be like, the weather. The scenery, the mountains, it changes. Every single day is a new world.”Olsen, whose pace varies depending on the terrain, usually has a support car in front or behind him. When traffic is an issue, such as on his route through parts of Europe and the United States, he separates from his car and pushes his food, water and other supplies in a stroller-like contraption. Also inside his pack: a stopwatch, a small laptop, a notebook, two pairs of glasses, three or four pairs of running shoes, two sets of running clothes and a smartphone.When there are no hotels — in the Sahara, for example — Olsen pitches a tent.His fuel is whatever food is in the area he is running through, he said, and he travels light — no sports drinks or energy bars. “It’s part of experiencing the cultures,” he said. “Step by step.”Because he often does not have regular access to a doctor and cannot carry many medical supplies, he says he tries to research potential diseases at his destinations before setting off. But even with advance warning, Olsen avoids prescriptions whenever possible. “I would rather risk malaria than fill my body with chemicals every day for more than a year,” he said.Somewhere in Tanzania, Olsen caught malaria, “but it was one of the milder ones,” he said. He took pauses between fever spells and ran when he could. “You can have malaria and be O.K.,” he said.Then, there was the snakebite in North Carolina. “That was plain stupidity,” he said. “We don’t have snakes in Denmark.”On Saturday, Olsen will continue his journey north, through New England and then across the Canadian border. If you pass him on the road, you’ll see a long-distance runner free of headphones, or an iPod, or any electronic device that could distract from the natural surroundings.“I want the full experience, the sounds,” Olsen said. “If it’s a rainforest, I want the sounds of the birds whizzing around and the insects, just the whole ambience. If I’m running on the highway, I also want that noise. Also, I need it for safety. I need to know when they are trying to hit me.”'"
"'12-04-27,'1','Celebrating aimless adults who prefer to sponge off the hard work of others is a dispiritingly persistent trend in American entertainment. In HBO’s much-yammered-about “Girls,” the lead character is stunned when her fed-up parents refuse to donate $1,100 a month to support her two-year quest for self-knowledge, and in “The Giant Mechanical Man,” underachieving paves the road to romantic bliss.Pleasantly charming but instantly forgettable, this debut feature from Lee Kirk cradles its woebegone heroine, Janice (Jenna Fischer, who is also Mr. Kirk’s wife), like a wounded bird. A lost soul unfit for even temporary work, Janice is forced to move in with her half-sister (Malin Akerman) and brother-in-law (Rich Sommer), whose material success requires that they be shallow, grating and unsympathetic.Far preferable — at least to his director — is Tim (Chris Messina), a mime whose girlfriend has finally tired of financing his desire to mount stilts, paint his face silver and hang around on street corners silently begging for loose change. Thrown together by menial jobs at a sad-looking zoo, Tim and Janice are a match made in loser heaven.Replete with eye-roll-inducing contrivances and heavy-handed symbolism — both lovers share dreams of their teeth falling out — this arrested-development comedy panders to the work-averse by taking easy aim at ambitious careerists. A cartoonishly self-involved writer with pretentious hair (Topher Grace) is written and performed so flippantly that he’s never a credible obstacle to true love, and Mr. Kirk seems unaware that lacking direction in your 30s is more sad than funny.Without the assistance of those who chose to embrace maturity instead of fleeing it, our lovebirds would have been too busy Dumpster diving to whine about their sorry lives.'"
"'12-04-27,'1','WASHINGTON — In the hours after a Secret Service employee got into a dispute with a prostitute at a hotel in Colombia two weeks ago, high-ranking officials with the agency pored over hotel records.The officials determined that a dozen agents and officers had had women in their rooms the previous nights, and they ordered the employees to return to the United States for questioning.But one employee was particularly adamant that no one else had been in his room the previous night and that he had done nothing wrong.“He was much more animated than anyone else,” said a government official who has been briefed on the investigation.Despite the employee’s denials, agency officials did not believe him. The hotel kept records of which guests had had women in their rooms and required the women to leave copies of their identification cards at the front desk before going to a room.'"
"'12-04-27,'1','“Levon had deep Southern roots, a graciousness and infectious quality that played out in his life and music,” Happy Traum, a longtime Woodstock musician, said in an interview this week. “I think these were the happiest days of his life, that he could invite all these people into his living room and treat them like houseguests for the evening.”And so those guests, and many who wish that they had been, came out — all, it seemed, with their own story.The Caligiures had seen Mr. Helm perform 50 to 60 times and brought the collection of drumsticks that he had given them and their 6-year-old daughter, Samantha, who went to about eight of the shows. Marc Sheff of Bayside, Queens, said he had been to more than 200 of the Rambles. Ione Crenshaw, the wife of the musician Marshall Crenshaw, a Ramble veteran who was away on tour, was there with a bouquet of lilacs. Chad and Janet Shearer had flown in from Terranora, Australia, hoping to get to a Ramble this weekend.Jeanne Weiss, from nearby Saugerties, who plays in a group called the Bluestone Trio, was a big fan who had lived next door to the house that provided the name for the Band’s first album, “Music From Big Pink.” (“It was more like salmon,” she said.)Inevitably, along with the reverence for Mr. Helm and his work were questions about what happens now, and how much of Woodstock and its music may die with him.Mark McKenna, who came to Woodstock in the 1970s to work for Albert Grossman, the manager and entrepreneur who first brought Mr. Dylan to town, said in a phone interview on Wednesday that “in the long reach” of the town’s musical history, Mr. Helm was second only to Mr. Dylan as an influential figure. He said that in many ways the town had gone from a creative hub to “a kind of second-home paradise for exurbanites from New York.”“Not to sound negative or pessimistic,” he said, “but I felt as if someone were pulling a door closed when I heard how serious his illness was, and then that he had passed. I just thought, wow, that is really the end of an era.”But others, while saying it is far too early to contemplate what comes next, noted that Mr. Helm had put together a remarkable house band that was led by Mr. Dylan’s longtime associate, Larry Campbell, and included his daughter, Amy Helm, as a featured singer. And they said that what Mr. Helm had built meant too much to the music and the town he had loved to let it simply disappear.“What started as this second act, like an afterthought, almost a footnote to this tremendous career, became this thing that Woodstock came to depend on, at the center of this remarkable musical community,” John Sebastian, the former leader of the Lovin’ Spoonful and now one of Woodstock’s leading musical elders, said in an interview this week.“So what happens next?” he added. “I have asked this question at dinnertime three days running, and I ask it of all the brothers and sisters, who are part of this thing. We really as a community are holding our breath hoping that what Levon has created doesn’t have to evaporate the minute he’s not there. Some really deep foundations have been drilled on that little hill, and it’s going to be our challenge to see how we can keep this spirit going.”'"
"'12-04-27,'1','BRUSSELS — The European Union pressed Ukraine on Thursday to allow “independent medical specialists” to visit the country’s jailed former prime minister, Yulia V. Tymoshenko, after she claimed to have been beaten by prison guards last week.Adding to the diplomatic pressure, the German president, Joachim Gauck, confirmed on Thursday that he would not travel to Ukraine next month to attend a meeting of Central European presidents because of concerns over Ms. Tymoshenko’s treatment. And the Russian Foreign Ministry, in an unusual move, called on the Ukrainian authorities to “demonstrate humanity” toward Ms. Tymoshenko.Ms. Tymoshenko, 51, went on a hunger strike last Friday after being forcibly removed from her prison cell and taken to a hospital, according to her lawyer. In a statement published on her Web site on Tuesday, Ms. Tymoshenko, who suffers from chronic back pain, said she refused treatment and was returned to prison on Sunday, covered with bruises.The authorities in the Kharkov region, where Ms. Tymoshenko is imprisoned, have said there is no evidence that she has been beaten. Faced with the growing international criticism, President Viktor F. Yanukovich said Thursday that he had ordered a thorough investigation into Ms. Tymoshenko’s allegations, The Associated Press reported.The European Union’s foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, urged the Ukrainian authorities to allow the European Union ambassador in Ukraine, José Manuel Pinto Teixeira, to visit Ms. Tymoshenko in prison “as a sign of their political will to clarify the situation.” He should be allowed to take an independent medical team and stood ready to go “at the earliest opportunity,” Ms. Ashton said.'"
"'12-04-27,'1','PepsiCo, the Hatfield of the country’s cola wars to Coca-Cola’s McCoy, used higher prices to eke out slightly better first-quarter earnings than analysts expected despite essentially flat revenue.The company, which is also the parent of the snack food giant Frito-Lay, earned $1.13 billion, or 71 cents a share, compared with $1.14 billion, or 71 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.Excluding various items related to acquisitions and other one-time activities, PepsiCo earned 69 cents a share, 2 cents more than analysts had predicted, according to Thomson Reuters.Revenue was $12.4 billion, up from $11.9 billion in the period a year earlier.Indra Nooyi, PepsiCo’s chief executive, has compared the company in this year to a racecar taking a pit stop as it seeks to regain momentum in its flagship Pepsi business, which fell to No. 3 in the cola wars last year, overtaken by Diet Coke.Earlier this year, Ms. Nooyi announced that PepsiCo would devote $500 million to $600 million to market its powerhouse brands, which include Mountain Dew, Lays and Tropicana, and cut thousands of jobs. It also created a clear line of succession to calm investor jitters.On a call with analysts after the earnings were announced on Thursday, Ms. Nooyi said the company had established a good foundation from which to move forward this year. “We’ve made good progress in Q1,” she said, referring to the first quarter. “We expect momentum to continue building throughout the year.”'"
"'12-04-27,'1','Early in Raymond De Felitta's documentary of the 1960s-era South, ''Booker's Place: A Mississippi Story,'' a couple of tales are quickly told about black men who were shot or beaten for their transgressions against whites: one for inadvertently brushing his mop against a woman's foot, another for touching someone's car. The anecdotes lay down the law as it stood shortly before the time Booker Wright, a black waiter, made the fateful decision to explain to a documentary crew for NBC News not only what he served white customers but also how he felt about their varied treatment of him.He was beaten for his brave, conscientious honesty, and his own business (the Booker's Place of the title) was torched. Mr. De Felitta's moody, well-rounded film (which is also playing in the Tribeca Film Festival) is a kind of excavation and investigation of Mr. Wright's actions as a piece of civil rights history.Mr. De Felitta, whose other films include the New York drama ''City Island'' and a documentary about a jazz crooner, dredges up the mind-set embedded in Greenwood, Miss., Mr. Wright's hometown. Without turning into a survey, the film addresses the Delta's linked heritage of slavery, sharecropping and segregation.To do so Mr. De Felitta orchestrates a rich chorus of family members and wrinkled observers, white and black, whose creased faces seem to reflect the contradictions they have lived through. The film, shot in color and black and white, features some fine, disarming portraiture. (By contrast, its mawkish piano soundtrack is a blunt and unnecessary tool, an example of a convention that documentaries everywhere should just abandon.)An added facet to this reckoning with the past is that the 1966 NBC documentary was directed by Frank De Felitta, the father of this new film's director. The elder Mr. De Felitta talks candidly about what he calls his ''picture'' and his feelings of guilt over the reprisal; excerpts from the broadcast film are shown, at times overshadowing the rest of the new project.Solipsism can be a danger of any personally inflected documentary that retraces a relative's steps or seeks to crystallize a chosen moment of the past, but Raymond De Felitta makes himself scarce, and ''Booker's Place'' has plenty else to say.Opens on Friday in Manhattan. Directed by Raymond De Felitta 1 hour 30 minutes; not ratedPHOTO: Booker Wright in his restaurant, about 1970. (PHOTOGRAPH COURTESY OF BOOKER WRIGHT FAMILY)'"

"'12-04-28,'0','When his organization, Good Friends, released photographs of the bodies of North Koreans who had drowned in the river, too exhausted to complete the last leg of their desperate journey for food, it provided some of the first documentation of what was later recognized as one of the most horrific famines of the late 20th century. As many as three million people out of a population of 22 million died of hunger or hunger-related diseases.WHAT shook Pomnyun was not only the tales that refugees told of families trying to live on pine tree bark and wild roots, but also the outside world’s ignorance of their plight.“World leaders and the media talked obsessively about Kim Jong-il and his nuclear weapons and missiles,” Pomnyun said. “But what about the North Korean people?”Pomnyun’s group began to chronicle the disaster, interviewing more than 5,000 refugees as they arrived in China and publishing a series of reports and books on their struggles. When Good Friends began publishing its newsletter in 2004, it quickly became a must-read among South Korean policy makers and journalists.The first of its kind, the newsletter provided timely accounts of life in North Korea from anonymous informers inside the country, some of whom had returned home after being aided by the charity. They communicated via smuggled cellphones and other means that Pomnyun refused to disclose.When the newsletter, North Korea Today, also went online, it became a prototype for other Web sites. Together, the sites have helped breach what had been a near-total information blackout on North Korea for decades. They monitor the price of food and carry running, though sometimes conflicting, updates on floods and epidemics.Pomnyun leads his own temple in a provincial town, as well as study programs in meditation and Buddhist scripture across the country. Born to a rural farming family, Pomnyun grew up with older brothers who were religiously and politically active; one was sentenced to death under the military dictatorship of the time for antigovernment activity, but was later released.The younger Pomnyun at first hoped to become a physicist or an astronomer. But when he was in high school, a chance meeting with a revered monk named Domun persuaded him to become an activist, starting campaigns for environmental protection, religious reform, aid for the hungry and unification of the two Koreas. He was arrested and tortured by government agents cracking down on dissidents during the military rule.Today, Pomnyun pursues his mission very much amid the secular world. His office in Seoul is in a back alley crammed with restaurants, bars and “love hotels,” where people meet for trysts. Government officials call to compare notes on North Korea. He travels to the United States to give lectures attended by academics and government analysts.His writings and appearances — he gives an average of 12 lectures a week on a range of topics, including how to be a good mother — have made him among the country’s best-known monks. “Pomnyun quotes” are widely shared online. A recent one went: “Even if the North Koreans are said to be our enemy, they are fellow Koreans. While we are turning our surplus rice into animal feed, North Korean children are dying of hunger. What would our ancestors say of this?”His social activism has even drawn him into the tumult of South Korean politics, especially after lectures that he organized for young audiences on topics like how to fight for social justice provided a platform for Ahn Cheol-soo, a software developer and a vocal critic of the governing New Frontier Party. Mr. Ahn is now cited in opinion polls as a leading contender in the presidential election in December, should he choose to run.Allinkorea.net, a rightist news outlet, has made Pomnyun a favorite target, calling him a “political demagogue wearing the mask of religion.”POMNYUN’S tireless appeals for more aid for North Koreans have not always been popular in the South, where sentiment toward the North vacillates between compassion and fear.In 2006 and 2009, his group’s reports on destructive floods and an outbreak of swine flu in North Korea prompted the South Korean government to set aside politics and send aid. But his appeals have gone largely unheeded under President Lee Myung-bak’s conservative administration, which has accused Pomnyun of exaggerating the latest food crisis. Pomnyun has countered that the government is playing politics with people’s welfare. In 2008, he went on a 70-day hunger strike to highlight North Koreans’ plight.Good Friends’ statistical methods in its early studies led even some relief experts to accuse the group of exaggerating the famine, either unwittingly or to promote its case for aid. But Rajiv Narayan, a researcher on North Korea at Amnesty International, said the early work, even if flawed, “helped us understand what was going on in North Korea.” He added of Pomnyun, “People in our circles listen to him.”Pomnyun says he takes the criticism in stride. “Progressives criticize me for drawing attention to human rights violations in the North, and conservatives attack me for calling for aid for the North,” Pomnyun said, adding that he had also, depending on the critic, been accused of working for the C.I.A. or the North Korean government. “My aim is neither to support nor to oppose North Korea. I am just drawing attention to the humanitarian crisis.”For that reason, Pomnyun is deeply skeptical not only of his own country’s policies toward North Korea, but also of the United States’ focus on the threat the country poses.“The problem,” Pomnyun said, “is the more you squeeze the North Koreans, the more desperate they become to develop nuclear weapons. The Americans keep asking, ‘Why do the North Koreans make nuclear weapons while their people are starving?’ That may be a good way of criticizing North Korea, but it’s not a good way of influencing a paranoid regime whose overriding priority is self-preservation.”'"

"'12-04-28,'0','A former Bloomberg official asked a real estate company to help her domestic partner find an apartment just weeks after her agency sharply reduced the firm’s tax burden, and she was romantically involved with two subordinates, according to the results of a city investigation released on Friday.The 111-page report from the Department of Investigation also found that the subordinates to the official, Martha E. Stark, a finance commissioner who resigned in April 2009 amid numerous investigations into her conduct, received sizable salary increases during the relationships.The report found evidence that “contradicted her denials of personal relationships with subordinates and of never using her position to obtain any advantage for relatives or personal relations.” The report added, “The extent of Stark’s misconduct was compounded by multiple misrepresentations made after her conduct came under scrutiny.”The report, released under a Freedom of Information request, was the bookend of a dismal professional week for Ms. Stark, a lecturer at Baruch College. On Tuesday, she was fined $22,000 by the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board, which reviewed the same accusations and primarily cited her for using a city computer account to send e-mails related to her paid service as a board member of a different real estate company.In an interview on Friday, Ms. Stark’s lawyer, Richard W. Mark, questioned the findings. He noted that the city’s report was dated last June and suggested that the accusations, which were referred to the Manhattan district attorney for possible action, did not rise to the level of a criminal offense. He also argued that the Conflicts of Interest Board largely ignored many of the personal allegations that permeated the Department of Investigation report.“Martha Stark led the Department of Finance for seven years with distinction,” he said. “She led the department into the 21st century. This report has personal and private information in it that really should not be part of any legitimate investigation.”'"
"'12-04-28,'0','Now — finally — we have tumbled into my central point. We have turned school testing into a huge corporate profit center, led by Pearson, for whom $32 million is actually pretty small potatoes. Pearson has a five-year testing contract with that’s costing the state taxpayers nearly half-a-billion dollars.This is the part of education reform nobody told you about. You heard about accountability, and choice, and innovation. But when was passed 11 years ago, do you recall anybody mentioning that it would provide monster profits for the private business sector?It’s not just the tests. No Child Left Behind has created a system of public-funded , a growing number of which are run by for-profit companies. Some of them are completely online, with kids getting their lessons at home via computer. The academic results can be abysmal, but on the plus side — definitely no classroom crowding issues.Pearson is just one part of the picture, albeit a part about the size of Mount Rushmore. Its lobbyists include the guy who served as the top White House liaison with Congress on drafting the No Child law. It has its own nonprofit foundation that sends state education commissioners on free trips overseas to contemplate school reform.An American child could go to a public school run by Pearson, studying from books produced by Pearson, while his or her progress is evaluated by Pearson standardized tests. The only public participant in the show would be the taxpayer.If all else fails, the kid could always drop out and try to get a diploma via the good old G.E.D. The General Educational Development test program used to be operated by the nonprofit American Council on Education, but last year the Council and Pearson announced that they were going into a partnership to redevelop the G.E.D. — a nationally used near-monopoly — as a profit-making enterprise.“We’re a capitalist system, but this is worrisome,” said New York Education Commissioner King.The Obama administration has been trying to tackle the astronomical costs of 50 different sets of standardized tests by funding efforts by states to develop shared models — a process you will be stunned to hear is being denounced by conservatives like Gov. of Texas as “a federal takeover of public schools.”Education Secretary has also begun giving out waivers from the requirement that children in failing public schools be given after-school tutoring. Idea sounded great. Hardly helped the kids at all. But no for-profit tutoring company was left behind.The pushback against privatization isn’t easy. We’re now in a world in which decisions about public education involve not just parents and children and teachers, but also big profits or losses for the private sector. Change the tests, or the , or the charters, or even the rules for teacher certification, and you change somebody’s bottom line.It’s a tough world out there. Ask the talking pineapple.'"

"'12-04-28,'0','In Argentina, Charly García, 60, is the kind of nationally renowned rock superstar who performs in arenas and brings out multigenerational audiences who can sing dozens of his songs all the way through. He played a rare United States concert, his first New York City show since 2002, on Wednesday night at the Best Buy Theater, where the opening guitar lines of his songs immediately inspired shouts of recognition and la-la singalongs.He cuts an odd figure for a rock star. He’s tall, gawky, scraggly and bespectacled, with a mustache that’s brown on one side, gray on the other. When he got up from behind his piano, he didn’t have anything that qualified as a stage move beyond occasionally playing conductor to a string trio that was part of his 10-member band, the Prostitution.Mr. García’s voice has a lot of rough patches. During the 2000s he has fought mental illness and drug addiction, bottoming out and going through rehab in 2008 before returning to eager audiences. He has just released “60 x 60” (DSX Films), a live collection — three CDs and three DVDs — recorded at Buenos Aires concerts in 2001.The first words he sang on Wednesday night were “No voy a parar” — “I’m not going to stop” — from a funky 1989 song called “Fanky.” What he has are the songs he has been writing and performing since he emerged in the 1970s to become a pioneer in Latin American rock. He has looked especially to the Beatles and their willingness to try all sorts of styles.In the course of a two-hour concert Mr. García’s songs encompassed chunky hard rock, chamber-pop with string arrangements, jazz-tinged ballads, funk vamps and synthesizer lines. He also sang his Spanish translations of songs from the Byrds and Todd Rundgren.But the music didn’t turn its back on Argentina; the band included a bandoneón, the Argentine tango accordion, which threaded through many of the instrumental passages. In one song, “No Soy un Extraño” (“I’m Not a Stranger”), a pair of tango dancers appeared onstage.For Mr. García, rock and the Beatles have spurred not only musical ideas but also broader ambitions: a willingness to sing about personal and social matters, to mix the straightforward and the sidelong. In his lyrics, which are often poetic enough to resist translation, he has been lovelorn, sarcastic, lonely, prayerful, surreal, glancingly political and conscious of mortality. Humor often brushes up against despair, mockery against sorrow.'"
"'12-04-28,'0','At first glance, the program that the pianist Richard Goode played at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday evening seemed dispiritingly constricted. The two composers whose works he performed, Schumann and Chopin, were born in the same year, 1810, and the works he chose were all composed within a decade, from 1838 to 1847.But anyone who has followed Mr. Goode’s five-decade career knows that a program’s apparent limitations amount to little if he is in an exploratory mood, and more often than not, he is. Here his fluid, often tempestuous performances had the twin virtues of fidelity to the scores and the sense of freshness that comes of an in-the-moment approach to phrasing.That was especially true of the Chopin works in the second half of the program. Over the last dozen years, Mr. Goode said in a recent interview, he has been especially drawn to Chopin’s distinctive approach to the piano and the spirit of improvisation that his works embody.He conveyed that quality in his rhythmically restless rendering of the Nocturne No. 16 (Op. 55, No. 2), an impetuous, dramatic reading of the Ballade No. 3 (Op. 47) and a performance of the Scherzo No. 3 (Op. 39) that began stormily and melted into a graceful but assertive account of the choralelike central section, with its layers of sparkling filigree.And in several waltzes (Op. 64, Nos. 2 and 3, and Op. 34, No. 3), as well as the Mazurka No. 15 (Op. 24, No. 2), which he offered as his first encore, Mr. Goode probed the flexibility of Chopin’s dance rhythms convincingly and affectingly.Earlier Mr. Goode had lifted the curtain on Schumann’s fantastical inner vision in thoughtfully shaped performances of “Kinderszenen” and “Kreisleriana.” These works describe different universes. In “Kinderszenen” Schumann puts us into a child’s world, and Mr. Goode’s considered phrasing and subtle coloration suited both the painterly surfaces and the frequent temperamental shifts that drive the picturesque miniatures that make up the work.'"
"'12-04-28,'0','“Even if everybody in Switzerland isn’t perhaps happy about what we do, there’s nothing they can do about it because we follow the rules,” Mr. Chan said in an interview last month at Baselworld, the world’s biggest watch fair. “I would personally be interested to know whether all the smaller Swiss companies respect the rules as well as us.”Most of the approximately 500 members of the watch federation support the demand for tighter rules, which would raise the percentage of Swiss-made components to 80 percent of a watch’s total value — not just the movement, or time-keeping mechanism, covered by the current rules, which were established four decades ago.But some smaller Swiss companies oppose the proposed rules change. They warn that the country’s watch sector risks undermining itself by wiping out smaller Swiss players that buy components from China and elsewhere to remain competitive. The small companies say they can probably not afford to invest more in local production because of Switzerland’s strong currency and high labor costs.Mr. Pasche predicted the opposition could be overcome. “We’re aware that stricter rules could hurt some of our companies,” he said. “But the problem can be limited if a transition period is provided for them to adjust to new rules.”Swatch, based in Biel, is the world’s biggest watch maker, with revenue last year of $7.8 billion. Its products include its ubiquitous Swatch watches and luxury brands like Breguet, Blancpain, Omega and Longines. Almost all of the company’s production is in Switzerland. Swatch does produce some watch components in China, Thailand and Malaysia, but the company says they are only minor parts.“I’ve got no problem with the Chinese and others buying in Switzerland,” said Nick Hayek, the chief executive of Swatch, “as long as everybody plays by the rules and helps protect the value of what is being made in Switzerland.”The watch federation draws inspiration from the so-called Swissness bill that passed in one of Switzerland’s two parliamentary houses in March and is meant to protect virtually everything produced in the country — whether machine tools or Emmentaler cheese — against counterfeiting or misleading use of the Swiss brand. A vote in the other legislative chamber is expected before the end of the year.Parliamentary endorsement of the Swissness bill would be “a good first step,” Mr. Pasche said. But updating the 50 percent rule would require the Swiss government to approve a new decree specifically for the watch sector.There is little question that few manufactured products derive more value from their association with a specific country than do Swiss watches.Switzerland makes only about 3 percent of the world’s watches, but it so dominates the luxury end of the industry that Swiss watches account for more than half of the monetary value of the $40 billion global watch market, according to René Weber, an analyst at Bank Vontobel.Some smaller Swiss companies argue that the one certain outcome of stricter labeling rules would be increasing Swatch’s dominance. They say that Swatch is already cutting back the supply of movements — where its manufacturing market share is about 70 percent — and the sale of other components to smaller rivals.“I think this Swiss-made campaign is more about weakening rivals within Switzerland than about protecting against a Chinese invasion or unfair competition from outside,” said Laurent Alaimo, chief executive of Technotime, a privately held Swiss maker of movements. The company sells part of its production outside Switzerland and has a Chinese shareholder, Chung Nam, that owns 80 percent of its equity.China is both a rising rival and a growing market. A surge in Chinese consumer demand helped the Swiss watch industry report record exports last year of 19.3 billion Swiss francs, or about $21.2 billion. Exports to China and elsewhere by Swiss component makers have climbed 37 percent in the last three years, with most of that increase attributable to rivals of Swatch.Chinese investors have recently acquired a handful of Swiss watch companies, like Eterna and Emile Chouriet, which are still members of the Swiss industry federation.Jean Depéry, the Geneva-based director of Emile Chouriet, said his company had long relied on some components from China. What the new Chinese ownership has done, he said, is “completely carve open their consumer market for us.”As a result, Emile Chouriet plans to make 70,000 watches next year — selling 90 percent of them in China — compared with only 9,000 watches in 2010.“Everybody proudly displays Swiss-made on its facade, but if you scratch below the surface, you will often find a lot of surprises,” Mr. Depéry said. “If everything in a watch really had to be Swiss-made, a large part of the Swiss industry would already have been destroyed.”Several companies that exhibited their watch wares in March at Baselworld also displayed inventive ways to tap into the value of being associated with Switzerland.One was Xetum, a San Francisco company started in 2009 by Jeffrey Kuo, a former management consultant and a full-time watch aficionado. Xetum, he said, sells “California-designed but Swiss-made watches.”Because the company buys its movements from ETA, a subsidiary of Swatch, Xetum watches can be labeled Swiss-made.“For a new brand, it really helps to have the quality associated with Switzerland,” he said. “But of course we’re not in any way trying to out-Swiss the Swiss.”'"

"'12-04-28,'0','The bank recently stepped up its long battle against deflation, in February setting a target of 1 percent for inflation and pumping tens of billions of dollars into the economy by buying up assets and giving out loans.The action was taken after criticism from Japanese politicians, who charged that the bank was not doing enough to combat falling prices.Some economists have questioned whether monetary policy can propel Japan to higher growth without a redress of the country’s other economic problems, like its burgeoning public debt and much-needed changes in its tax and pension systems.“If the government is trying to bolster growth through monetary easing and intends to postpone tax and other necessary reforms, that would be an unadvisable and in fact impossible strategy,” Ryutaro Kono, chief economist for Japan at BNP Paribas, said in a note to clients after the bank’s announcement.On Friday, the central bank said it would buy another ¥10 trillion worth of government bonds, while reducing a pool of funds set aside for fixed-rate market operations by ¥5 trillion.That bumped up the overall size of the bank’s asset-buying and loan program to ¥70 trillion.The bank also pushed back the scheduled end to its purchase operations by six months, to June 2013.Japan’s finance minister, Jun Azumi, called the bank’s actions “another bold easing step” and urged the bank to continue to take similar steps.The Bank of Japan’s governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said the steps were aimed at strengthening the “positive momentum” in the Japanese economy.But in a shot to government officials pressing the bank to loosen monetary policy further, Mr. Shirakawa urged caution against reckless action that would “destabilize price moves.”Mr. Shirakawa offered few clues on the outlook for monetary policy but signaled his hope that no action would be needed for a while, saying the central bank would “carefully and calmly” assess the effect of its recent steps in guiding policy.“We’d like to achieve 1 percent inflation in Japan as soon as possible. But it takes quite a long time for the effect of monetary easing to appear on the economy,” Mr. Shirakawa told a news conference after the policy meeting.But some analysts questioned the scale of the actions on Friday, telling Reuters the central bank actually had not committed to expanding its balance sheet or accelerating the pace of asset purchases that much.The central bank’s decision to buy more exchange-traded funds and funds linked to real estate pushed the yen lower and helped lift Tokyo shares Friday.But the yen later crept back up and stocks slipped as some market players saw the bank’s move to give itself more time to hit the bond-buying goal as a sign that central bankers had doubts about how much good their actions would do for the struggling economy.'"

"'12-04-29,'0','The broader fear that Syria will truly be torn apart, spreading chaos in a combustible region and giving jihadis a new playground to nurture terrorists, has helped cement a stasis that seems to work fine for everyone involved except the Syrian opposition, with hundreds of members killed since the peace plan took effect.The West, Turkey and the Arabs want time to shape the opposition, divided by bickering and lacking a solid constituency within Syria, into a credible alternative government. They also hope to convince Russia, Syria’s main ally, that the government is to blame for the violence.The Russians, dragging China in their shadow, want time for the plan to work. Their revived prestige as a superpower rests partly on its success. Both Russia and Iran also want to preserve enough of the current government to maintain their strategic relations, analysts said, which could mean their pushing President Bashar al-Assad toward political compromise.The Assad government evidently wants more time to try to crush the opposition before being forced into the political negotiations that are part of the agreement brokered by Kofi Annan, the United Nations and Arab League special envoy.“What is obvious and indisputable is that the Kofi Annan plan has failed,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said Thursday at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “Assad has not abided and will not abide by a cease-fire.”Since the Syrian government accepted the plan a month ago, at least 1,000 Syrians have died and thousands more have been displaced, Mr. McCain said. “The United States and the world are failing the people of Syria, and every day that we refuse to lead, more Syrians will die,” he said.Derek Chollet, President Obama’s nominee to be an assistant secretary of defense, and Kathleen Hicks, nominated to be principal deputy defense secretary for policy, agreed with Mr. McCain at the hearing that the Annan plan was “failing.”But supporters insist the plan is better than the alternative.“The desired outcome is not collapse and civil war and a failed state and a couple lost decades for Syria,” said Paul Salem, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, adding that resolving the crisis requires time for both raising the pressure and providing an exit.“Without pressure the regime will not look for an exit, but without an exit they are going to fight to the death,” Mr. Salem said.Supporters also hope an increase in United Nations cease-fire monitors, from about 15 in Syria now to 300 when the full complement arrives over the next few months, will deter the violence.Mr. Annan and others have said the unarmed monitors have already had an effect. But Syrian government forces have attacked cities as soon as monitors have left them, and the opposition has accused the government of assassinating nine activists in Hama who had met with the United Nations team.How much impact even 300 observers can have is a gamble. Numerous analysts pointed out that the short-lived international observer mission in Kosovo more than a decade ago had 2,000 observers for an area one-seventeenth the size of Syria and with about one-tenth of Syria’s population of 23 million.In public and privately, senior administration officials made clear that they had no expectation that Syria would implement the Annan plan. Instead, Washington hopes to rely on sanctions; diplomatic pressure; increased engagement with the opposition, including nonlethal aid like bulletproof vests for peaceful activists; and the looming threat of prosecution — all the tools at its disposal short of military intervention.Stronger action by the United Nations Security Council would require Russian acceptance, but there is no sign that the problems implementing the peace plan are leading in that direction. Although the Russian Foreign Ministry called on Syria last week to “carry out in full its obligations,” it also continued to blame the opposition for the violence. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov told state television on Friday that the truce had yet to jell “for the most part because armed opposition groups are engaging in provocations, explosions, terrorist attacks and shootings.”That echoed the attitude in Damascus. The Syrian Foreign Ministry sent a letter to Mr. Annan detailing 1,149 “documented and verifiable violations, by armed elements, of the Annan plan,” said Jihad Makdissi, the ministry spokesman. Security Council members should act “evenhandedly toward violations” and refrain from using the Council as a platform to pursue the policies of individual states, he said without naming any.Mr. Annan is scheduled to make his next report on the situation byMay 7, and update the Council every 15 days. The United States has said it will not extend the observers’ mandate past the original 90 days if Syria flouts the truce.A senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of diplomatic negotiations, said Washington would not wait the full 90 days to try to end the mission if there was no sign of compliance.Another, Ms. Hicks, said at the Senate hearing that the Pentagon was doing “a significant amount of planning for a wide range of scenarios, including our ability to assist allies and partners along the borders.”The administration official alluded to a “basket” of options for the next step, but not humanitarian corridors, which would require military enforcement. “Right now it is not part of our strategy,” said the official, because armed protection would need international approval.There is a basic consensus among the nations supporting the opposition that arming it is too risky while it lacks a command and control structure. Just where the money and arms might end up remains murky.But there has undoubtedly been some cross-border smuggling. Lebanese intelligence and judicial sources reported the seizure overnight Saturday of three containers crammed with weapons, including machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. Discovered near a port outside the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, the cargo was believed bound from Libya for Syria. In addition, the Syrian military foiled an attempted infiltration from the sea near Turkey, with a number of soldiers killed or wounded in a firefight, state-run media reported.In the midst of an election campaign, the Obama administration will try to avoid getting entangled in a new Middle East war. But one plan believed under consideration is a short, sharp airstrike on tanks or other limited targets, a kind of shot over the bow warning the Assad military that it cannot act with impunity forever, said George Lopez, a professor at the University of Notre Dame and longtime United Nations adviser.While few expect the Annan plan to succeed alone, supporters hope it can create the conditions that allow change.Louay Hussein, a leader of a nascent opposition party still in Damascus, said the closer that Russia and the West were on a Syria strategy, the less wiggle room for the government. “I don’t place any hope on Bashar to do anything,” he said. “We have to try to force this regime to accept the political solution.”The monitors will not solve the problem, he said, nor is there yet any likely blueprint for peaceful change, but the more the monitors “calm the violence on the streets, the more we will see peaceful activists emerging.”'"
"'12-04-29,'0','Apple serves as a window on how technology giants have taken advantage of tax codes written for an industrial age and ill suited to today’s digital economy. Some profits at companies like Apple, , Amazon, and derive not from physical goods but from royalties on intellectual property, like the patents on software that makes devices work. Other times, the products themselves are digital, like downloaded songs. It is much easier for businesses with royalties and digital products to move profits to low-tax countries than it is, say, for grocery stores or automakers. A downloaded application, unlike a car, can be sold from anywhere.The growing digital economy presents a conundrum for lawmakers overseeing corporate taxation: although technology is now one of the nation’s largest and most valued industries, many tech companies are among the least taxed, according to government and corporate data. Over the last two years, the 71 technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index — including Apple, Google, and Dell — reported paying worldwide cash taxes at a rate that, on average, was a third less than other S.& P. companies’. (Cash taxes may include payments for multiple years.)Even among tech companies, Apple’s rates are low. And while the company has remade industries, ignited economic growth and delighted customers, it has also devised corporate strategies that take advantage of gaps in the tax code, according to former executives who helped create those strategies.Apple, for instance, was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed them to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes, according to former executives. Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the “Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,” which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the . Today, that tactic is used by hundreds of other corporations — some of which directly imitated Apple’s methods, say accountants at those companies.Without such tactics, Apple’s federal tax bill in the most likely would have been $2.4 billion higher last year, according to a recent study by a former economist, Martin A. Sullivan. As it stands, the company paid cash taxes of $3.3 billion around the world on its reported profits of $34.2 billion last year, a tax rate of 9.8 percent. (Apple does not disclose what portion of those payments was in the United States, or what portion is assigned to previous or future years.)By comparison, Wal-Mart last year paid worldwide cash taxes of $5.9 billion on its booked profits of $24.4 billion, a tax rate of 24 percent, which is about average for non-tech companies.Apple’s domestic tax bill has piqued particular curiosity among corporate tax experts because although the company is based in the United States, its profits — on paper, at least — are largely foreign. While Apple contracts out much of the manufacturing and assembly of its products to other companies overseas, the majority of Apple’s executives, product designers, marketers, employees, research and development, and retail stores are in the United States. Tax experts say it is therefore reasonable to expect that most of Apple’s profits would be American as well. The nation’s tax code is based on the concept that a company “earns” income where value is created, rather than where products are sold.However, Apple’s accountants have found legal ways to allocate about 70 percent of its profits overseas, where tax rates are often much lower, according to corporate filings.Neither the government nor corporations make tax returns public, and a company’s taxable income often differs from the profits disclosed in annual reports. Companies report their cash outlays for income taxes in their annual Form 10-K, but it is impossible from those numbers to determine precisely how much, in total, corporations pay to governments. In Apple’s last annual disclosure, the company listed its worldwide taxes — which includes cash taxes paid as well as deferred taxes and other charges — at $8.3 billion, an effective tax rate of almost a quarter of profits.However, tax analysts and scholars said that figure most likely overstated how much the company would hand to governments because it included sums that might never be paid. “The information on 10-Ks is fiction for most companies,” said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College who specializes in multinational taxation. “But for tech companies it goes from fiction to farcical.”Apple, in a statement, said it “has conducted all of its business with the highest of ethical standards, complying with applicable laws and accounting rules.” It added, “We are incredibly proud of all of Apple’s contributions.”Apple “pays an enormous amount of taxes, which help our local, state and federal governments,” the statement also said. “In the first half of fiscal year 2012, our U.S. operations have generated almost $5 billion in federal and state income taxes, including income taxes withheld on employee stock gains, making us among the top payers of U.S. income tax.”The statement did not specify how it arrived at $5 billion, nor did it address the issue of deferred taxes, which the company may pay in future years or decide to defer indefinitely. The $5 billion figure appears to include taxes ultimately owed by Apple employees.The sums paid by Apple and other tech corporations is a point of contention in the company’s backyard.A mile and a half from Apple’s Cupertino headquarters is De Anza College, a community college that , one of Apple’s founders, attended from 1969 to 1974. Because of California’s state budget crisis, De Anza has cut more than a thousand courses and 8 percent of its faculty since 2008.Now, De Anza faces a budget gap so large that it is confronting a “death spiral,” the school’s president, Brian Murphy, wrote to the faculty in January. Apple, of course, is not responsible for the state’s financial shortfall, which has numerous causes. But the company’s tax policies are seen by officials like Mr. Murphy as symptomatic of why the crisis exists.“I just don’t understand it,” he said in an interview. “I’ll bet every person at Apple has a connection to De Anza. Their kids swim in our pool. Their cousins take classes here. They drive past it every day, for Pete’s sake.“But then they do everything they can to pay as few taxes as possible.”In 2006, as Apple’s bank accounts and stock price were rising, company executives came here to Reno and established a subsidiary named Braeburn Capital to manage and invest the company’s cash. Braeburn is a variety of apple that is simultaneously sweet and tart.Today, Braeburn’s offices are down a narrow hallway inside a bland building that sits across from an abandoned restaurant. Inside, there are posters of candy-colored iPods and a large Apple insignia, as well as a handful of desks and computer terminals.When someone in the United States buys an , or other Apple product, a portion of the profits from that sale is often deposited into accounts controlled by Braeburn, and then invested in stocks, bonds or other financial instruments, say company executives. Then, when those investments turn a profit, some of it is shielded from tax authorities in California by virtue of Braeburn’s Nevada address.Since founding Braeburn, Apple has earned more than $2.5 billion in interest and dividend income on its cash reserves and investments around the globe. If Braeburn were located in Cupertino, where Apple’s top executives work, a portion of the domestic income would be taxed at California’s 8.84 percent corporate income tax rate.But in Nevada there is no state corporate income tax and no capital gains tax.What’s more, Braeburn allows Apple to lower its taxes in other states — including , and — because many of those jurisdictions use formulas that reduce what is owed when a company’s financial management occurs elsewhere. Apple does not disclose what portion of cash taxes is paid to states, but the company reported that it owed $762 million in state income taxes nationwide last year. That effective state tax rate is higher than the rate of many other tech companies, but as Ms. Clausing and other tax analysts have noted, such figures are often not reliable guides to what is actually paid.Dozens of other companies, including , and Microsoft, have also set up Nevada subsidiaries that bypass taxes in other states. Hundreds of other corporations reap similar savings by locating offices in .But some in California are unhappy that Apple and other California-based companies have moved financial operations to tax-free states — particularly since lawmakers have offered them tax breaks to keep them in the state.In 1996, 1999 and 2000, for instance, the California Legislature increased the state’s research and development tax , permitting hundreds of companies, including Apple, to avoid billions in state taxes, according to legislative analysts. Apple has reported tax savings of $412 million from research and development credits of all sorts since 1996.Then, in 2009, after an intense lobbying campaign led by Apple, Cisco, , Intel and other companies, the California Legislature reduced taxes for corporations based in California but operating in other states or nations. Legislative analysts say the change will eventually cost the state government about $1.5 billion a year.Such lost revenue is one reason California now faces a budget crisis, with a shortfall of more than $9.2 billion in the coming fiscal year alone. The state has cut some health care programs, significantly raised tuition at state universities, cut services to the disabled and proposed a $4.8 billion reduction in spending on kindergarten and other grades.Apple declined to comment on its Nevada operations. Privately, some executives said it was unfair to criticize the company for reducing its tax bill when thousands of other companies acted similarly. If Apple volunteered to pay more in taxes, it would put itself at a competitive disadvantage, they argued, and do a disservice to its shareholders.Indeed, Apple’s decisions have yielded benefits. After announcing one of the best quarters in its history last week, the company said it had net profits of $24.7 billion on revenues of $85.5 billion in the first half of the fiscal year, and more than $110 billion in the bank, according to company filings.Every second of every hour, millions of times each day, in living rooms and at cash registers, consumers click the “Buy” button on iTunes or hand over payment for an Apple product.And with that, an international financial engine kicks into gear, moving money across continents in the blink of an eye. While Apple’s Reno office helps the company avoid state taxes, its international subsidiaries — particularly the company’s assignment of sales and patent royalties to other nations — help reduce taxes owed to the American and other governments.For instance, one of Apple’s subsidiaries in Luxembourg, named iTunes S.à r.l., has just a few dozen employees, according to corporate documents filed in that nation and a current executive. The only indication of the subsidiary’s presence outside is a letterbox with a lopsided slip of paper reading “ITUNES SARL.”Luxembourg has just half a million residents. But when customers across , or the — and potentially elsewhere — download a song, television show or app, the sale is recorded in this small country, according to current and former executives. In 2011, iTunes S.à r.l.’s revenue exceeded $1 billion, according to an Apple executive, representing roughly 20 percent of iTunes’s worldwide sales.The advantages of Luxembourg are simple, say Apple executives. The country has promised to tax the payments collected by Apple and numerous other tech corporations at low rates if they route transactions through Luxembourg. Taxes that would have otherwise gone to the governments of , , the United States and dozens of other nations go to Luxembourg instead, at discounted rates.“We set up in Luxembourg because of the favorable taxes,” said Robert Hatta, who helped oversee Apple’s iTunes retail marketing and sales for European markets until 2007. “Downloads are different from tractors or steel because there’s nothing you can touch, so it doesn’t matter if your computer is in France or . If you’re buying from Luxembourg, it’s a relationship with Luxembourg.”An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the Luxembourg operations.Downloadable goods illustrate how modern tax systems have become increasingly ill equipped for an economy dominated by electronic commerce. Apple, say former executives, has been particularly talented at identifying legal tax loopholes and hiring accountants who, as much as iPhone designers, are known for their innovation. In the 1980s, for instance, Apple was among the first major corporations to designate overseas distributors as “commissionaires,” rather than retailers, said Michael Rashkin, Apple’s first director of tax policy, who helped set up the system before leaving in 1999.To customers the designation was virtually unnoticeable. But because commissionaires never technically take possession of inventory — which would require them to recognize taxes — the structure allowed a salesman in high-tax , for example, to sell computers on behalf of a subsidiary in low-tax . Hence, most of those profits would be taxed at Singaporean, rather than German, rates.In the late 1980s, Apple was among the pioneers in creating a tax structure — known as the Double Irish — that allowed the company to move profits into tax havens around the world, said Tim Jenkins, who helped set up the system as an Apple European finance manager until 1994.Apple created two Irish subsidiaries — today named Apple Operations International and Apple Sales International — and built a glass-encased factory amid the green fields of . The Irish government offered Apple tax breaks in exchange for jobs, according to former executives with knowledge of the relationship.But the bigger advantage was that the arrangement allowed Apple to send royalties on patents developed in California to Ireland. The transfer was internal, and simply moved funds from one part of the company to a subsidiary overseas. But as a result, some profits were taxed at the Irish rate of approximately 12.5 percent, rather than at the American statutory rate of 35 percent. In 2004, Ireland, a nation of less than 5 million, was home to more than one-third of Apple’s worldwide revenues, according to company filings. (Apple has not released more recent estimates.)Moreover, the second Irish subsidiary — the — allowed other profits to flow to tax-free companies in the Caribbean. Apple has assigned partial ownership of its Irish subsidiaries to Baldwin Holdings Unlimited in the British Virgin Islands, a tax haven, according to documents filed there and in Ireland. Baldwin Holdings has no listed offices or telephone number, and its only listed director is Peter Oppenheimer, Apple’s chief financial officer, who lives and works in Cupertino. Baldwin apples are known for their hardiness while traveling.Finally, because of Ireland’s treaties with European nations, some of Apple’s profits could travel virtually tax-free through the Netherlands — the Dutch Sandwich — which made them essentially invisible to outside observers and tax authorities.Robert Promm, Apple’s controller in the mid-1990s, called the strategy “the worst-kept secret in Europe.”It is unclear precisely how Apple’s overseas finances now function. In 2006, the company reorganized its Irish divisions as unlimited corporations, which have few requirements to disclose financial information.However, tax experts say that strategies like the Double Irish help explain how Apple has managed to keep its international taxes to 3.2 percent of foreign profits last year, to 2.2 percent in 2010, and in the single digits for the last half-decade, according to the company’s corporate filings.Apple declined to comment on its operations in Ireland, the Netherlands and the British Virgin Islands.Apple reported in its last annual disclosures that $24 billion — or 70 percent — of its total $34.2 billion in pretax profits were earned abroad, and 30 percent were earned in the United States. But Mr. Sullivan, the former Treasury Department economist who today writes for the trade publication Tax Analysts, said that “given that all of the marketing and products are designed here, and the patents were created in California, that number should probably be at least 50 percent.”If profits were evenly divided between the United States and foreign countries, Apple’s federal tax bill would have increased by about $2.4 billion last year, he said, because a larger amount of its profits would have been subject to the United States’ higher corporate income tax rate.“Apple, like many other multinationals, is using perfectly legal methods to keep a significant portion of their profits out of the hands of the I.R.S.,” Mr. Sullivan said. “And when America’s most profitable companies pay less, the general public has to pay more.”Other tax experts, like Edward D. Kleinbard, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, have reached similar conclusions.“This tax avoidance strategy used by Apple and other multinationals doesn’t just minimize the companies’ U.S. taxes,” said Mr. Kleinbard, now a professor of tax law at the . “It’s German tax and French tax and tax in the U.K. and elsewhere.”One downside for companies using such strategies is that when money is sent overseas, it cannot be returned to the United States without incurring a new tax bill.However, that might change. Apple, which holds $74 billion offshore, last year aligned itself with more than four dozen companies and organizations urging Congress for a “repatriation holiday” that would permit American businesses to bring money home without owing large taxes. The coalition, which includes Google, Microsoft and , has hired dozens of lobbyists to push for the measure, which has not yet come up for vote. The tax break would cost the federal government $79 billion over the next decade, according to a Congressional report.In one of his last public appearances before his death, , Apple’s chief executive, addressed Cupertino’s City Council last June, seeking approval to build a new headquarters.Most of the Council was effusive in its praise of the proposal. But one councilwoman, Kris Wang, had questions.How will residents benefit? she asked. Perhaps Apple could provide free wireless Internet to Cupertino, she suggested, something Google had done in neighboring Mountain View.“See, I’m a simpleton; I’ve always had this view that we pay taxes, and the city should do those things,” Mr. Jobs replied, according to a video of the meeting. “That’s why we pay taxes. Now, if we can get out of paying taxes, I’ll be glad to put up Wi-Fi.”He suggested that, if the City Council were unhappy, perhaps Apple could move. The company is Cupertino’s largest taxpayer, with more than $8 million in property taxes assessed by local officials last year.Cupertino, Ms. Wang said in an interview, has real financial problems. “We’re proud to have Apple here,” said Ms. Wang, who has since left the Council. “But how do you get them to feel more connected?”Other residents argue that Apple does enough as Cupertino’s largest employer and that tech companies, in general, have buoyed California’s economy. Apple’s workers eat in local restaurants, serve on local boards and donate to local causes. Silicon Valley’s many millionaires pay personal state income taxes. In its statement, Apple said its “international growth is creating jobs domestically, since we oversee most of our operations from California.”“The vast majority of our global work force remains in the U.S.,” the statement continued, “with more than 47,000 full-time employees in all 50 states.”Moreover, Apple has given nearby more than $50 million in the last two years. The company has also donated $50 million to an African aid organization. In its statement, Apple said: “We have contributed to many charitable causes but have never sought publicity for doing so. Our focus has been on doing the right thing, not getting credit for it. In 2011, we dramatically expanded the number of deserving organizations we support by initiating a matching gift program for our employees.”Still, some, including De Anza College’s president, Mr. Murphy, say the philanthropy and job creation do not offset Apple’s and other companies’ decisions to circumvent taxes.

"'12-04-29,'0','In response to requests for comment on the company’s tax practices, Apple provided this statement to The New York Times:Over the past several years, we have created an incredible number of jobs in the United States. The vast majority of our global work force remains in the U.S., with more than 47,000 full-time employees in all 50 states. By focusing on innovation, we’ve created entirely new products and industries, and more than 500,000 jobs for U.S. workers — from the people who create components for our products to the people who deliver them to our customers. Apple’s international growth is creating jobs domestically since we oversee most of our operations from California. We manufacture parts in the U.S. and export them around the world, and U.S. developers create apps that we sell in over 100 countries. As a result, Apple has been among the top creators of American jobs in the past few years.Apple also pays an enormous amount of taxes which help our local, state and federal governments. In the first half of fiscal year 2012 our U.S. operations have generated almost $5 billion in federal and state income taxes, including income taxes withheld on employee stock gains, making us among the top payers of U.S. income tax.We have contributed to many charitable causes but have never sought publicity for doing so. Our focus has been on doing the right thing, not getting credit for it. In 2011, we dramatically expanded the number of deserving organizations we support by initiating a matching gift program for our employees.Apple has conducted all of its business with the highest of ethical standards, complying with applicable laws and accounting rules. We are incredibly proud of all of Apple’s contributions.'"

"'12-04-29,'0','“His escape is nothing less than a miracle,” said Zeng Jinyan, a human rights campaigner who also spent time with Mr. Chen last week.Mr. Chen’s flight could not have come at a worse time for China’s leaders, who were already struggling to limit the fallout from the case of Bo Xilai, the center of a cascading scandal that cost him his seat in the Politburo and exposed internal divisions among top officials in the one-party state.News of Mr. Chen’s improbable odyssey has electrified China’s rights activists, scores of whom had sought for months to draw attention to his plight and to challenge his extralegal detention by flocking to Dongshigu village in futile attempts to see him. The journeys, many of them publicized through social media, always ended the same way: The guards paid to keep Mr. Chen and his family incommunicado would use violence to drive visitors away.Mr. Chen, 40, has long been a cause célèbre among human rights advocates both in China and abroad. A self-taught lawyer who was illiterate well into his 20s, Mr. Chen earned renown by defending disenfranchised peasants and the disabled. But he infuriated local officials in Shandong Province after filing a class-action lawsuit on behalf of women forced to undergo abortions and sterilizations under the country’s strict family-planning policy.In 2006, he was convicted on charges that many legal experts say were trumped up. After serving his 51-month sentence, he was escorted back to Dongshigu, where local officials were determined to keep him silent. They turned his home into a makeshift prison, surrounding it with guards, surveillance cameras and a jamming device to ensure that he could not communicate with the outside world. His wife and young daughter were also confined to the house, although the daughter was later allowed to attend school accompanied by guards.Many details of the escape remain murky, but supporters say Mr. Chen may have been aided by a sympathetic guard. They also say that the night before his escape, he was able to discuss his plans with supporters via cellphone — a remarkable detail given how hard the guards had worked to keep him isolated.Friends said Mr. Chen’s subterfuge was months in the making. In recent weeks, they said, he stayed in bed continuously to convince his minders that he was too weak to walk, or to try to leave.As part of the plan, his wife stayed behind to distract the guards stationed outside the front door.After he scaled the wall outside his home, he hid somewhere before making his way to a predetermined pickup spot almost a day after leaving home. It was then that He Peirong, a rights activist from Nanjing, arrived in her car and drove Mr. Chen to Beijing, according to the account she posted on her microblog account.“Now Chen Guangcheng is either in a safe place or in the hands of State Security in Beijing,” she wrote Friday morning, shortly before the authorities in Nanjing arrived at her home and took her away, according to a fellow activist who was on the phone with her at the time. Ms. He remained unreachable on Saturday, and her microblog account has been disabled.According to Hu Jia, a well-known dissident and AIDS activist who met with him in Beijing last week, Mr. Chen, who had arrived in the capital on Monday, spent the subsequent three days protected by a loose network of supporters who made sure he slept in a different apartment each night.Mr. Hu, who has been under constant surveillance, said the network consisted of five people. After several frantic days, he said, “It was decided that there was only one place in China that is absolutely safe, and that’s the U.S. Embassy.”He said he was certain that Mr. Chen had made it to the embassy, because on Friday he received a predetermined coded message confirming that Mr. Chen had made it there.China Aid, a Christian organization in Texas that has a network of supporters here, said it was willing to help Mr. Chen leave the country, but he was determined to stay in China, according to Bob Fu, the group’s president. “I tried to offer him the underground railroad, but the offer was declined,” he said.Even as they celebrated Mr. Chen’s flight, activists worried about the backlash that appeared to be building. On Thursday night, Mr. Chen’s brother was taken away by the local authorities, his family said, and state news media reported that his son was also being sought. Human rights advocates say they fear that Mr. Chen’s wife and mother may also be in grave danger.Several of those who assisted Mr. Chen or publicly advocated on his behalf apparently have also been detained. In addition to Ms. He, the activist who drove him to Beijing, Guo Yushan, a scholar in Beijing, has been missing since Friday, after telling friends he was being trailed by security agents. And shortly after talking to a reporter on Saturday, Mr. Hu, the AIDS activist, was taken away by the police, his wife said.Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said Mr. Chen’s escape highlighted the organizational prowess of Chinese rights activists in the face of increasingly sophisticated surveillance. But he acknowledged that the success came at a price.“It’s hard to call this a victory if everyone involved in his escape ends up detained, arrested and imprisoned,” he said.'"
"'12-04-29,'0','Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.Political endorsements say as much about the endorser as they do about the endorsee.Helping someone in a tough race — or even appearing to lend support — is a basic form of political trading.That’s why Comptroller Susan Combs, Attorney General Greg Abbott, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples and Gov. Rick Perry have been so busy this spring. Ms. Combs and Mr. Staples each want to be the next lieutenant governor of Texas, assuming Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst wins the United States Senate race. Mr. Abbott is not so secretly angling for the governor’s job, hoping ever so gently that Mr. Perry will move on when that post is on the ballot again in 2014.Mr. Perry is trying to stay alive after appearing as a paper tiger in the presidential primaries. He looked great before that race, appealing to social conservatives, the Tea Party folks, fiscal conservatives and evangelicals. He’s got a twang that’s familiar in the Southern states dear to Republican officeseekers. Nice-looking guy, able to raise money. It all seemed just right on the drawing board.Unfortunately for the governor, it didn’t work anywhere else.Now he’s back, with a legislative session before him and a herd of lawmakers and lobbyists who suspect they’re working with a lame duck. Mr. Perry is responding with the usual gambits. He let it be known that he’s thinking about running for re-election. He publicly didn’t rule out the idea of another presidential run in 2016. He presented candidates and officeholders with a “budget compact” — a set of promises against new taxes and spending and in favor of protecting the state’s Rainy Day Fund. And he started handing out endorsements.'"
"'12-04-29,'0','Vocal soloists; John Kirkpatrick, pianist; Buffalo Philharmonic, conducted by Michael Tilson Thomas; other ensembles. Other Minds OM 1020/21-2; two CDs.FOR collectors of 20th-century American music Michael Tilson Thomas’s survey of the music of Carl Ruggles has been a landmark from the moment that CBS Masterworks (now Sony Classical) released it in 1980, nine years after that composer’s death at 95. The set’s prestige value notwithstanding, Sony never saw fit to reissue it on CD. Now Other Minds, the San Francisco new-music organization, has done these recordings proud in a superb transfer, with all the original liner notes as well as an expansive overview by the composer Lou Harrison.Though Ruggles never achieved the renown of his close friend Charles Ives, his best scores are as gripping and durable as anything Ives wrote. They include the muscular orchestral essays “Sun-Treader” (1931) and “Men and Mountains” (1924); the chillingly angular vocal-chamber work “Vox Clamans in Deserto” (1923); the rugged but lyrical “Organum” (1947), with its open fourths and fifths; and the long-lined “Evocations” (1943), in either its piano or orchestral guise.Ruggles was more conservative than Ives, or businesslike. You don’t find dueling marching bands (or tonal systems) or sarcastic renderings of hymns and patriotic songs, just fresh musical ideas worked out with concision and directness. His mildly dissonant neo-Romantic pieces were often years in the making, and even completion, subject to reconsideration. “Angels” (1921, 1940) and “Evocations” (reworked in 1954) are included in alternative scorings showing how thorough his revisions could be.A few of the works here can be found in better recordings: most notably, Mr. Thomas’s more vividly tension-filled 1970 account of “Sun-Treader” with the Boston Symphony Orchestra on Deutsche Grammophon. But others are unavailable elsewhere, and the performances here capture the power and originality of Ruggles’s spirit.'"
"'12-04-29,'0','Klein’s observation that boys feel pressured to display “flamboyant heterosexuality” is quite interesting, but the causal link to bullying is elusive. Are the bullies nursing secret insecurities, or are they so hopped up on masculinity that they’re offended by weaklings who aren’t? Or is it a little of each? Or are there two classes of bullies operating from opposite masculinity-induced drives? No clue in this account.Klein takes a great deal at face value. Mean girls dismiss outcasts for failing to wear Coach or Prada, and Klein dutifully classifies the motive as economic. Is it really about the Coach bag, though, or are the bullies just exploiting fashion inferiority to ridicule a girl they’ve already marked for exclusion? There is a class component, surely — this stuff is complicated. Yet Klein settles for simple, overt answers. She trusts the bullies to understand their own motives and divulge them openly with each insult.The book swerves further out of the field of logic when Klein conflates the motivations of bullies and school shooters. Her argument is grounded in a powerful truth: a bona fide link between bullies and many school shooters. In recent years, two exhaustive studies of shooters were conducted by the F.B.I. and a joint project of the Secret Service and the Department of Education. The Secret Service study found that 71 percent of shooters had been bullied, threatened, attacked or injured. But the report also found that far more shooters had experienced a profound sense of failure or loss — a staggering 98 percent. This included the loss of loved ones or romantic relationships (51 percent) and “loss of status” (66 percent). It is possible these losses coincided with bullying. Klein, however, claims “nearly all” the shooters she studied were “reacting to oppressive social hierarchies.” I found this puzzling, until I discovered her heavy reliance on press reports.The most interesting question this book raises concerns the fragility of certain scholarship in the social sciences. Early reports of tragedies are notoriously wrong, speculating about motive months or years before officials release most of the relevant evidence. Reporters and “witnesses” — schoolmates who often never knew the killers — bend their accounts to fit a profile of shooters that both the Secret Service and the F.B.I. have concluded is fiction. Klein perpetuates this imaginary profile, including the portrait of shooters as outcasts. The Secret Service said 41 percent of shooters belonged to the mainstream, while only 34 percent thought of themselves or were characterized by others as “loners,” and 12 percent had “no close friends.”The reporting problem gets camouflaged by repeated layers of “scholarship.” One scholar bases a paper on faulty reporting, which gets cited by another scholar, then another — until a book like this appears with a bibliography full of academic citations. Academic weight increases as the research grows farther from the source, which is rotten at the core.Klein’s first chapter begins on a start­lingly false note, asserting that Seung-Hui Cho staged his 2007 attack at Virginia Tech in response to bullying. The overwhelming consensus is that unlike most shooters, Cho appeared to be deeply mentally ill — a condition that dwarfed external factors. This goes unmentioned here.Worse, Klein positions the 1999 Columbine massacre as her prime example. She regurgitates botched reporting that was debunked years ago, exhuming resilient myths about jock-targeting and the Trench Coat Mafia. The shooters, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, left journals and videos to explain themselves, in which they complain about every petty topic imaginable, from slow drivers to the WB network, but not once, mysteriously, about bullies. The closest Harris comes is complaining about feeling left out, in a brief passage contradicting nearly every­thing else he wrote. Yet Klein cherry-picks to present the boys as bullied outcasts hunting jocks.Her most potent testimony arrives in Harris’s “suicide note,” which she features prominently. The note was a hoax, discredited shortly after the massacre. Klein also claims Harris and Klebold were enraged at jocks for gay-bashing them, and quotes the soccer player Ben Oakley stating that most of the Trench Coat Mafia were “gay.” Her use of the gay-bashing quotation is symptomatic of her overreach. I know how badly out of context it’s taken because she drew it from an article I wrote on the fallacy of the gay rumors. Oakley’s statement illustrated the flimsiness of “witness” accounts: he didn’t even know the killers.Klein isn’t the first to be misled by the Columbine myths or the weak case that bullying drove Harris and Klebold. Harder to understand is the logic her book is built on. Victims of bullying who respond with gunfire are a tiny minority, and unrepresentative of the larger population of the bullied.“The Bully Society” does raise some profound questions. Klein shows, convincingly, that a hypermasculine imperative haunts many boys and drives some to violence. Yet a vast majority of them don’t bully, at least not habitually. Why are they immune? Or what causes bullying to ignite violence in the few? Is there a predisposition in those kids, or are their motives bound up tightly with other drives? We await that analysis.'"
"'12-04-29,'0','The New York Times published a swell piece that, as such pieces must, made it clear that Caro is the most unusual and perhaps the best biographer of our age. If it is madness to spend nearly 40 years writing about L.B.J., then it is a special and useful madness. . . . “The Years of Lyndon Johnson” has become such an unusual quest that the obsession gains value independent of the finished product. Actually, that should be “published product,” not “finished.” Caro never finishes a book; he has it taken away from him. Eventually.Robert Caro was an inspiration to younger reporters at The Daily Princetonian (me being one of them). We looked forward, with trepidation, to the comments he would make on each day’s production. Known as his “bitch sheet,” he would post a copy of the paper on the wall with acerbic, handwritten observations for all to view. Words of praise could make a reporter’s day. More frequently a single word — “ugh!” — would signify turgid prose or some other stylistic or grammatical boo-boo. Some great reporters and writers emerged from that tutelage, among them William Greider, James Ridgeway and Don Kirk.Read Charles McGrath’s take on Caro, if only because he somehow made engaging the profile of a guy who spends most of his hours sitting in an office writing on a legal pad.

"'12-04-29,'0','Amail grimaced, uncertain how to respond. “Don’t call yourself that,” she snapped. “Do you want to die, too?”Rahila was the name used by a young poet, Zarmina, who committed suicide two years ago. Zarmina was reading her love poems over the phone when her sister-in-law caught her. “How many lovers do you have?” she teased. Zarmina’s family assumed there was a boy on the other end of the line. As a punishment, her brothers beat her and ripped up her notebooks, Amail said. Two weeks later, Zarmina set herself on fire.Like Meena, Zarmina lived in Gereshk, a little less than 400 miles from Kabul. She, too, wasn’t allowed to leave her home. She first found the literary group by listening to the radio, her only link to the outside world. One day, on Radio Azadi — Radio Liberty — she heard a Mirman Baheer member reading poems. With no way to contact the group, she phoned another radio program, a popular show that mostly connects refugees to family members or friends they haven’t seen in decades. Zarmina asked for help in finding Mirman Baheer. One of the station’s employees was a member. “Oh, so you thought we were lost, too!” she told the aspiring poet, before sharing the phone number.Zarmina soon became a regular caller. Whenever she could, she phoned into Mirman Baheer’s Saturday-afternoon meetings at the Ministry of Women’s Affairs in Kabul. Zarmina would ask Amail if she could read her poems aloud to the group. But the Kabul meetings were crowded with eager poets, vying to be heard. Amail often had to tell Zarmina to wait her turn. “I’d say, ‘No, I’ll call you,’ but she’d call back within a few minutes.”Sometimes Zarmina couldn’t stand to wait for a meeting to call Amail. When Amail said she was too busy to talk, Zarmina would respond with a landai:“How sweet it would have been if we’d only recorded her voice while she was reading poems,” Amail said. She picked bits of caramelized sugar and almonds from a glass dish. “Now, when any girl calls, I note down everything — the dates of the poems, the phone numbers, every single thing she says.” (The group still can’t afford a tape recorder.)In her poems, Zarmina described “the dark cage of the village.” Her work was impressive, according to Amail, not only for its distinctive language but also for its courage to question God’s will. “That’s what our poems had in common,” Amail said. “We complained to God about the state of our lives.” Zarmina’s poems posed questions: “Why am I not in a world where people can feel what I’m feeling and hear my voice?” She asked, “If God cares about beauty, why aren’t we allowed to care?” She asked: “In Islam, God loved the Prophet Muhammad. I’m in a society where love is a crime. If we are Muslims, why are we enemies of love?”As Amail and Zarmina grew closer, they would talk several times a day whenever Zarmina could sneak access to a phone; but there were periods when they managed to speak only once a month. During the two weeks between her brothers’ beating and her suicide, Zarmina gave Amail no indication of how desperate she was when she called. She did, however, recite another landai:“Stupid, don’t say that,” Amail recalls saying. “You’re too young to die.”To the women of Mirman Baheer, Zarmina is only the most recent of Afghanistan’s poet-martyrs. “She was a sacrifice to Afghan women,” Amail told me. “There are hundreds like her.”Mirman Baheer, Afghanistan’s largest women’s literary society, is a contemporary version of a -era literary network known as the Golden Needle. In Herat, women, pretending to sew, gathered to talk about literature. In Kabul, Mirman Baheer has no need for subterfuge. Its more than 100 members are drawn primarily from the Afghan elite: professors, parliamentarians, journalists and scholars. They travel on city buses to their Saturday meetings, their faces uncovered, wearing high-heeled boots and shearling coats. But in the outlying provinces — Khost, Paktia, Maidan Wardak, Kunduz, Kandahar, Herat and Farah — where the society’s members number 300, Mirman Baheer functions largely in secret.Of Afghanistan’s 15 million women, roughly 8 out of 10 live outside urban areas, where U.S. efforts to promote women’s rights have met with little success. Only 5 out of 100 graduate from high school, and most are married by age 16, 3 out of 4 in forced marriages. Young poets like Meena who call into the hot line, Amail told me, “are in a very dangerous position. They’re behind high walls, under the strong control of men.” Herat University’s celebrated young poet, Nadia Anjuman, died in 2005, after a severe beating by her husband. She was 25.Pashtun poetry has long been a form of rebellion for Afghan women, belying the notion that they are submissive or defeated. Landai means “short, poisonous snake” in Pashto, a language spoken on both sides of the Afghanistan- border. The word also refers to two-line folk poems that can be just as lethal. Funny, sexy, raging, tragic, landai are safe because they are collective. No single person writes a landai; a woman repeats one, shares one. It is hers and not hers. Although men do recite them, almost all are cast in the voices of women. “Landai belong to women,” Safia Siddiqi, a renowned Pashtun poet and former Afghan parliamentarian, said. “In Afghanistan, poetry is the women’s movement from the inside.”Traditionally, landai have dealt with love and grief. They often railed against the bondage of forced marriage with wry, anatomical humor. An aging, ineffectual husband is frequently described as a “little horror.” But they have also taken on war, exile and Afghan independence with ferocity. In the 1880 Battle of Maiwand, when Afghan forces were losing to the British, a Pashtun heroine named Malalai is said to have seized the Afghan flag and shouted this landai:Malalai died on the battlefield, but Afghan forces were ultimately victorious.More recently, landai have taken on the Russian occupation, the hypocrisy of the Taliban and the American military presence. One landai that came into circulation during the Russian occupation is still uttered today:Like most folk literature, landai can be sorrowful or bawdy. Imagine the Wife of Bath riding through the Himalayan foothills and uttering landai so ribald that they curled the toes of her fellow travelers. She might tease her rival: “Say hello to my sweetheart/If you are a farter [tizan, one who farts a lot], then I can fart louder than you.” She might make a cutting political joke: “Your black eyelashes are Israel/and my heart is under your attack.” She might utter an elegiac couplet: “My beloved gave his head for our country/I will sew his shroud with my hair.”“A poem is a sword,” Saheera Sharif, Mirman Baheer’s founder, said. Sharif is not a poet but a member of Parliament from the province of Khost. Literature, she says, is a more effective battle for women’s rights than shouting at political rallies. “This is a different kind of struggle.”On a recent afternoon in Kabul, Amail looked over her reading glasses at two dozen poets and writers, 15 to 55 years old, convened around a U-shaped conference table at the Ministry for Women’s Affairs. Sharif held her 7-year-old daughter, Zala, in her lap. Zala clutched a white fur pony purse loaded with markers. She unzipped its belly, colored distractedly and played with an during a brief lecture on the nature of the soul given by Alam Gul Sahar, one of President ’s speechwriters and the author of 15 books of poems. As Sahar droned on, the women yawned, their exhales forming puffs of gray breath in the room’s freezing air. As soon as Sahar finished, the workshop began. A young woman stood and raced through a reading of her short story in an anxious monotone: a girl whose mother died in childbirth ends up going to college and having to choose between two potential lovers. One suitor attempts suicide but is miraculously revived. The end. The critique started. One of the group’s more senior members pointed out two problems. First, Pashto stories don’t feature two lovers, because that would sully a woman’s honor. Second, the story’s diction was monotonous.“Since your character is educated, she should speak in a more sophisticated way,” the woman told the downcast author. In judging a work’s merit, members consider the writer’s recitation. Sharif believes that the group’s mission is to teach young women not just to write but also to speak aloud and with confidence.The meeting turned to poetry next. The women had brought contemporary landai with them. Traditionally, the poems were traded at henna night, the evening before a wedding when women gather around the bride to decorate her body. The landai are sometimes sung to the beat of a small hand drum. (Because singing is associated with loose morals, poetry can be seen as shameful for women, a notion that the Taliban’s conservatism helped foster.) Landai once focused on the godar — the place where village women went to fetch water and where men, who were not allowed to approach them, tried to steal looks at their beloveds from a distance. These educated women used landai to speak of larger issues, like Mullah Omar, the Taliban’s one-eyed spiritual leader who is rumored to be dead, not a guest of Pakistan: “Grass is growing on the blind man’s tomb/Stupid Talibs still believe that he’s alive.” Amail read one about America’s failing military efforts: “Here, they fight the Taliban/Behind the mountains, they train them.”When I asked who brought this one, Zamzama, 17, raised her hand amid nervous giggles. She seemed both embarrassed and emboldened to be criticizing America to an American. Along with her 15-year-old cousin, , Zamzama joined the group two years earlier. Lima had recently won the group’s literary prize. When she was 11, she began writing poems addressed to God.“I started reading them to my father,” Lima said. She smiled and glanced around at the others who were suddenly listening. “My father doesn’t know much about poetry.” An engineer, he heard about Mirman Baheer from a colleague and now sends his daughters here weekly to learn to write. “He gave me this,” she said. She held up a blue plastic notebook embossed with the words “Healthnet — Enabling People to Help Themselves.” Lima stood to recite her latest poem: a rubaiyat, the Arabic name for a quatrain, addressed to the Taliban.Following Zarmina’s story meant traveling to Gereshk. I wanted to see how she’d lived, and I wondered what, besides her brothers’ anger, led her to take her life. It seemed impossible that I would find the family of one dead girl among 50,000 people or that, if I did, they would speak about her, but I went anyway, as there was also the slight chance of meeting Meena Muska, the teenager who called Mirman Baheer and invoked Zarmina’s name. I began my search in Helmand’s embattled capital, Laskhar Gah, of which Gereshk is a suburb. Government sources and a local network of traditional leaders called maliks (they belong to an Afghan organization, Wadan, the Welfare Association for the Development of Afghanistan) helped me gather a list of reported cases of women and girls who died violent deaths in Gereshk in the past two years. The list was brief but grim. Was I looking for the girl who was found drowned in the Helmand River in a sack? No. The girl who had her head shaved and then was chopped into pieces by her husband’s brothers? No. Well, then, there was only one left: a girl who in 2010 set herself on fire and died in the Kandahar hospital.“Ten years ago, no one heard about these problems,” Fauzia Olemi, Helmand’s minister of Women’s Affairs, told me when we met. “Now we have a network of organizations that investigate them.”It was a balmy afternoon in Lashkar Gah, and Olemi wanted to show me some of Helmand’s modest successes for women’s education, which included a three-day workshop on the health benefits of eating , okra and other vegetables. Because Helmand is among the largest poppy producers in the world, there’s a special effort to encourage farmers to plant other crops.In a squat, cement-block government building, about 50 women sat in front of a whiteboard, which read, “If you eat two kilograms of tomatoes a day, you will be cured of .” This group was very different from the one in Kabul. Many of the women were in their 20s and 30s, their faces deeply lined from working in the fields. It was nearing midday, when the insurgents would begin to explode I.E.D.’s along the road, and the lesson was almost over. As the women gathered their things to leave, I asked if any of them liked poetry. As soon as the question was translated, a wisp of a woman leapt to her feet and began what looked like freestyle rapping in Pashto. She shook her bony shoulders to four-beat lines that ended in a rhyme of “ma” or “na.” Gulmakai was 22 but looked 45. She made up poems all the time, she explained, as she cooked and cleaned the house. She said,The women roared with surprised laughter, which I, hearing the poem in translation, took a minute to understand (the first, sanitized version offered to me was something like “Being married is like corn”). “I know this is true,” she announced. “My father married me to an old man when I was 15.” She tried to say something else, but the workshop leader, a man, silenced her. was up. The participants needed to go home, or their families would worry.A few days later, I arranged to travel to Gereshk and meet with Zarmina’s parents with the help of a local women’s advocate. Under the Taliban, the advocate worked as a physician assistant in Gereshk Hospital, where her services were in high demand. Paradoxically, since their fall, her life had grown more dangerous: being a women’s advocate linked her to Karzai’s government and to seemingly Western notions of women’s rights. Like almost every local women’s leader I met, she’d survived several botched assassination attempts. “I have six or seven colored so the Taliban doesn’t know who I am,” the advocate told me on the phone. She laughed. “The burqas keep me safe.” Yet she agreed with Olemi that, for most women, violence was more likely to come from home. “Now that Afghan women are aware of their rights, they fight for them in their family,” she said. “If they get their rights, that’s good. If they don’t, they kill themselves or get beaten up.”The night before we left Lashkar Gah, I dialed Meena Muska’s number, hoping she would be able to meet me the following day.She couldn’t leave the house without raising suspicion. She also had reservations based on her family’s code of honor. “Because of the war, it’s dishonorable for a Pashtun to meet an American,” she said. “Please don’t take it personally,” she added. “I didn’t mean to insult you.” Suddenly, in the silence, she changed her mind. “Meet me at the hospital,” she said. “I’ll be waiting.” Her only stipulation was that I and my translator come alone.The next morning, our miniconvoy — two white sedans flanked by two green police pickup trucks — left town for the 50-mile drive north along Helmand’s main highway to Gereshk. We’d been driving less than five minutes when an oversize rickshaw catapulted out of an intersection and rammed into our . Within seconds, a swarm of onlookers surrounded the car, looking at the smashed headlight. It wasn’t a great place to be trapped in a crowd — two weeks earlier, a suicide bomber blew up a truck only yards away. There were sure to be Taliban informants among the onlookers; if anyone hadn’t known we were coming along the road that day, they did now.We drove on past young boys raking patches of blown-up road, the mangled rebar gnarled like hair; past America’s surveillance blimps hanging cartoonishly low above the salt plain; past a line of camels cruising under industrial power lines. The electric lines were a legacy of a U.S.-sponsored midcentury hydropower project, the Kajaki dam, which, for a while, earned this stretch the nickname “little America.”An hour and a half later, we arrived at the mud-walled compound of Fatima Zurai, a member of Gereshk’s local women’s council, through whom I hoped to meet Zarmina’s parents. An elderly couple, they were seated in the corner of the room. Zurai ran a women’s business collective that sold heart-shaped, beaded rainbow purses for 10 U.S. dollars to foreign soldiers. Over tea and caramels, Zurai spoke of the losses she and her family suffered, caught between American forces and the insurgents. Zurai sent her daughter to fetch a bundle of cloth, which she unwrapped, holding up a white, blood-soaked shalwar kameez.“My husband was wearing this shirt when the Taliban murdered him two years ago,” she said. Her husband, Mir Ahmad, was on the Taliban hit list because he worked with the local government as a malik.Then she shook out a small pair of brown muslin trousers from the cloth pile. Muddy and torn, they smelled like rot, and Zurai’s small daughter held her chador against her nose to block the stench. The trousers, Zurai said, belonged to her 12-year-old son, Ihsanullah. He was walking home from school in the spring of 2011 when a military vehicle driven by a U.S. Marine struck and killed him. The U.S. Marine commander, Zurai said, brought the driver to her house to make amends.“God gave me this son 12 years ago, before the Americans came,” she recalled telling the commander. Zurai said that, yes, she forgave the driver. This was less a personal decision than a cultural one. Forgiveness was part of the honor code known as Pashtunwali. (The U.S. military said it did not have enough information to verify the incident; payments for accidental civilian deaths, which Zurai said her family received, are common.)From her seat on a floor cushion, Zarmina’s mother, Simin Gula, a maroon burqa pulled back from her face to reveal a mouth devoid of teeth, leaned into my translator and pointed to me. “Do they have the custom of marriage where she comes from?” she asked. “Is she married?”Zarmina’s father, Kheyal Mohammad, remained silent. Zarmina burned to death two years earlier, her mother said. “It was an accident. She was trying to get warm after a bath, but the firewood was wet, so she poured gasoline on it and caught herself on fire.” Zarmina’s father nodded assent. No, their daughter absolutely did not like writing, reading or poetry. “She was a good girl, an uneducated girl,” Zarmina’s mother said. “Our girls don’t want to go to school.”The parents agreed to take us to see where Zarmina was buried, a five-minute drive away. A maze of rocky hummocks marked the graves. We passed three women kneeling over three smaller, fresh plots. Zarmina’s parents stopped before a grave covered in loose black gravel with no headstone.Walking briskly back to the cars, we passed the three kneeling women again. Behind me, one murmured Zarmina’s name. “She set herself on fire because her family wouldn’t let her marry the man she loved,” she said, then returned to grieving over the plot that held her son, who was killed in a recent suicide attack.The early-afternoon sun had swung above us. The local council members urged us to hurry. But before we left Gereshk, we had one final stop to make — to meet Meena. Leaving the entourage behind at the district governor’s office, we drove through the bazaar’s crowded warren of streets and pulled up under the dusty, red-lettered sign of Gereshk District Hospital. A handful of people milled in the parking lot. Meena Muska hadn’t come after all, I thought, my heart sinking. Then the phone rang.“Why did you bring the police?” a high voice demanded. She was suspicious of our armed government guard. Through the windshield, I saw a woman in cerulean blue glide past. Her burqa was an awkward shape; she was on the telephone. Without glancing our way, she breezed around the edge of the whitewashed clinic. I tumbled out of the car, unaccustomed to the tangle of fabric engulfing me, and shuffled after her. Behind the corner of the building stood a young woman with a diamond stud in her nose. She wore thick black socks and open-toed rhinestone slippers. The rest of her face remained behind a piece of woolen fabric. There was no need for introductions. We embraced. Next to her stood a shorter, rounder woman, with a heavily wrinkled face. She was the girl’s meira: her second mother and her father’s second wife.“I told my father I was sick and had to go to the doctor,” she explained. But she told her mother and her meira the truth; both women support her writing, at least for now. She led us into a winter , where we four — Meena Muska, her meira, my translator and I — knelt facing one another on the faded grass. Our blue, crimson, jade and dove burqas were the only colors in the gray garden. From her plastic purse, Meena pulled out her notebook. The forearms of her dress were black mesh, her fingernails carefully painted. For a girl who couldn’t leave the house, her latest Indian-inspired fashions were surprising. But this was a special occasion, and Meena had dressed in her finest. At my request, she took a notebook and began to transcribe some of her new poems line by line in sloppy, schoolgirl script. She copied a ghazal, a sophisticated form of Persian poetry, then scribbled the following landai:This was her protest against being torn from her dead fiancé, she said. She asked that translations of her more formal poems go unpublished in this article. “My poems don’t deserve this much attention,” she said. “I am just learning to write.” Meena had little hope for her future. She would be marrying one of her fiancé’s two surviving brothers whenever her father and brothers decided it was time. She wrinkled her nose and let the cloth drop from her face, then pulled two mobile phones from her purse. Her brothers, who ran successful irrigation-pipe factories, bought her the phones; they also monitor her call log to make sure she isn’t speaking to boys. I wanted to give her something, but I feared that a book of my own poems might endanger her. If her brothers found it, how would she explain where this American’s poems had come from? Having nothing else, I tugged a scarf from my neck. She reached into her purse and handed me a rhinestone butterfly comb. Then she tugged the burqa’s soft grille back over her face, took her chaperon by the hand and disappeared into the crowd.In the parking lot, one of the hospital’s doctors, Dr. Asmatullah Heymat, was waiting to speak to me. “I know of this girl you are looking for,” he said. “Her name was Zarmina, and she set herself on fire because her parents would not let her marry the man she loved.” That was all he knew.“Zarmina’s mother couldn’t tell you the truth in front of her husband,” the girl’s aunt told me by phone once we returned to Lashkar Gah that evening. Zarmina loved to dance and sing. “She loved fashion,” her aunt said. “She loved a good burqa, nice shoes.” She also played the hand drum at weddings and loved to recite landai. “She’d say landai in front of her mother, but never in front of her father,” the aunt said. As for being able to write, “She knew some Koran, but only had a childhood madrassa education.” The aunt could recall little else about her poetry: “I’ve had so many of my own problems, I’ve forgotten the landai she used to say.”From childhood, Zarmina was engaged to marry her first cousin, whom she’d grown to love. Yet when the time came, the boy couldn’t afford the bride price of about $12,500. Zarmina’s father refused the match, knowing that he would have to support the couple. The boy visited Zarmina’s home several times hoping to win her father’s approval, her aunt said.Zarmina took solace in writing love poems and reading to the women of Mirman Baheer by phone. Then came the spring day in 2010 when Zarmina got caught reading these poems and her brothers beat her. A couple of weeks later, according to her aunt, when the girl was cleaning the house, she locked a door behind her and set herself alight, a common means of suicide among women in Afghanistan and elsewhere. The custom can be linked to the outlawed Indian practice suttee, when a wife climbs on a funeral pyre. The practice and even the Hindi word — suttee — exist in Pashto, too. In this sense, it is possible that Zarmina saw her choice to die for love as romantic and honorable.Her sister-in-law tried to break into the room to reach Zarmina, then called her husband, who was working as a contractor for the Canadian military, stationed at the time in Gereshk. Zarmina’s father was at his factory. Her mother was at her aunt’s house fetching water. A young girl came racing into the compound, crying that Zarmina had tried to kill herself. By the time her aunt and mother reached her, Zarmina was nearly unrecognizable.“Give me water, give me water,” she said.With one of her brothers as a chaperon, Zarmina traveled by helicopter to a hospital in Kandahar more than 100 miles away. But there was little the doctors could do. Zarmina had severe burns over most of her body. A week later, she died.After Zarmina’s death, her fiancé tried to commit suicide by stabbing himself multiple times. His friends managed to stop him, Zarmina’s aunt said. (Local leaders confirmed this.) Later, he married and moved to Kandahar.Zarmina’s family had also dispersed. One brother escaped to Herat after receiving threats for working with foreign soldiers. The day after I met them, Zarmina’s parents were scheduled to join him there. There is little evidence of Zarmina’s life left in Gereshk. After she died, her father gathered up her belongings, including some books and some scrawled-on pieces of paper. “I don’t know if he hid them or burned them,” her aunt said.But the whole village remembered Zarmina’s story. Her two neighbors, 15- and 17-year-old girls, confirmed details, as did the local women’s leader who recorded the case two years ago. “She was such a good poet,” the 15-year-old neighbor said. “We were the ones who encouraged her to start calling the radio. We were the ones who told her to write down her poems.”When I returned to Kabul, I went to see Ogai Amail in Microrayon, a row of concrete Russian-era apartment blocks in northeast Kabul. For $200 a month, Amail shares a single room with an older poet and member of Mirman Baheer who took Amail in after a family argument. She had nowhere else to go. Still unmarried at 40, Amail has no husband or children to ensure her position in society. Although she cherishes her independence, she said, hers is a difficult freedom. She has made the women and girls of Mirman Baheer into her family. She calls the younger poets her “little sisters.” Amail was nearly ecstatic to hear that I’d met Meena Muska face to face and that I’d found Zarmina’s parents.Amail recalled how she learned that Zarmina set herself on fire: shortly after the incident, Zarmina managed to call from her hospital bed in Kandahar. She told Amail that she had burns over 75 percent of her body. “She sounded so normal, I didn’t think she was dying,” Amail said. Zarmina wanted Amail to call her brother and impersonate a doctor offering treatment in Kabul, Amail told me. She thought if she could make it to the city, she could start a new life. Amail did what Zarmina asked, but she knew Zarmina would not make it to Kabul. The next phone call she received from Kandahar came from Zarmina’s sister, who told Amail: “All you can do is pray for her now. She is dead.”When I told Amail the story of Zarmina and her fiancé, she wasn’t surprised.“Her poetry was all about broken love,” Amail said. “She asked me, ‘Do you love anyone?’ I said: ‘Why not? Am I not a human being? Do I not have eyes?’ Zarmina only said: ‘I have so many problems, I don’t want to worry you. I’ll tell you when we meet.’ ”Amail assumed that someday the resourceful young poet would reach the relative freedom of Kabul. “She used to say you are the luckiest people since you can meet with your friends openly,” Amail said. “You can learn from your mistakes and write better poems.”Flipping through her notebook, she found a poem she wrote after Zarmina’s suicide, called “The Poet Who Died Young”:'"

"'12-04-30,'0','The administration’s effort to contain the crisis — the State Department declined to confirm that Mr. Campbell was in China, even though he was photographed in a Marriott hotel in Beijing — underscored the political challenge facing President Obama, at home and abroad.“This is the greatest test in bilateral relations in years, probably going back to ’89,” said Christopher K. Johnson, until recently a senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, referring to the year of the crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square. He noted that the relationship had weathered tense moments since then, like the forced landing of a Navy spy plane on Hainan Island in 2001 after a midair encounter with a Chinese fighter jet.Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called for the administration to “take every measure” to protect Mr. Chen and his family. While he did not address the handling of the case, he said the matter demonstrated the need for unflinching American support for human rights in China.“Any serious U.S. policy toward China must confront the facts of the Chinese government’s denial of political liberties, its one-child policy and other violation of human rights,” Mr. Romney said in a statement on Sunday, his first remarks on the issue since Mr. Chen’s escape was reported Friday.Mr. Chen, 40, became famous because of his strong opposition to forced abortions and sterilizations conducted as part of China’s policy of limiting families to one child per couple. “Our country must play a strong role in urging reform in China and supporting those fighting for the freedoms we enjoy,” Mr. Romney said.The administration’s only public comment so far on Mr. Chen’s case came from an unexpected source: Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan. Asked about the matter on “Fox News Sunday,” he declined to discuss Mr. Chen’s whereabouts in any detail, but he acknowledged that “we are working very closely with the individuals involved in this.”He went on to say that the administration sought “an appropriate balance” when advocating for human rights in strategically important countries like China.“I think, in all instances, the president tries to balance our commitment to human rights, making sure that the people throughout the world have the ability to express themselves freely and openly,” Mr. Brennan said, “but also that we can continue to carry out our relationships with key countries overseas.”The two days of talks to be held in Beijing this week — known as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue — will be overshadowed by the diplomatic complications surrounding Mr. Chen’s daring escape, which took American officials by surprise. Still, both sides suggested that the talks would go ahead. In the only comment by a Chinese official so far, Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said Saturday that he did not believe the Chen case would “occupy much time” at the talks.The meetings have been an important element of the administration’s policy to manage America’s increasingly complex relations with China through regular discussions on a wide spectrum of issues, though they were not expected to yield any specific results this week. In recent months, administration officials say they have seen signs of greater Chinese flexibility on security issues involving Iran, Syria and North Korea and on economic concerns like China’s exchange rate.Mr. Cui’s statement did not preclude the possibility that a senior Chinese leader would meet with Mrs. Clinton separately from the planned sessions and deliver a sharp message about American involvement in Mr. Chen’s case, or a broader condemnation of American support for dissidents in China.The Chinese government regards foreign criticism of its human rights policies and practices as undue interference in its internal affairs, and it will almost certainly use the occasion of the talks to drive that point home, diplomats in Beijing said. In fact, the Chinese might go forward with the planned talks specifically to have the chance to confront Mrs. Clinton about it.Mr. Chen’s case is the second in recent months that has drawn the Obama administration into the affairs of the Chinese government without any intention on Washington’s part. In February a provincial official showed up at the American Consulate in Chengdu, seeking protection from a powerful party leader, Bo Xilai. The State Department instead arranged for him to be transferred to the national authorities in Beijing. Evidence that the provincial official claimed to possess apparently caused Mr. Bo’s political downfall and prompted an investigation of Mr. Bo’s wife in the killing of a British businessman.Mr. Chen’s case is different. A self-taught lawyer, he has called attention to human rights abuses against the disabled and women who have been forcibly sterilized. In 2006 he was sentenced to 51 months in prison on charges of destroying property and assembling a crowd to disrupt traffic, charges his supporters say were trumped up.After he was released from prison, the local authorities held him under an extralegal form of house arrest, with cordons of police officers surrounding his family’s farmhouse. In an audacious video released Friday, Mr. Chen did not call for a change of government, but rather appealed to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to investigate and halt the abuse of his family. Other advocates who have spoken to him since he fled say he does not want asylum that would force him to leave China.That could create an opening for resolving a standoff with the United States, the officials said.“The federal government doesn’t have to take this as a threat,” the senior American official said Sunday, noting that Mr. Chen had not escaped from official detention, but rather from harassment at the hands of the local authorities.Mr. Chen’s supporters and Chinese officials have said that he is now in the American Embassy. More than the usual number of security vehicles, containing men in uniform and plain clothes patrolled the area near the embassy over the weekend, but there was no sign of a major security presence at the gates or entrances to the compound.It was possible, however, that Mr. Chen was not in the fortresslike embassy, but in an apartment or some other building, and thus still vulnerable to arrest, diplomats in Beijing said. That could explain the administration’s refusal to discuss his case or his precise whereabouts.Officials in Washington and Beijing refused Sunday to talk about Mr. Campbell’s mission or any negotiations he may be conducting. The senior American official said that much remained unclear, including China’s response to what has become a major embarrassment to Beijing. “It’s not something that’s going to be resolved quickly,” the official said.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','Illustrating how visceral the debate has become, and how entwined it is with politics in both Israel and the United States, some in the crowd peppered Mr. Olmert with shouts of “Naïve!” and “Neville Chamberlain!” and booed loudly when he called for a less confrontational stance toward President Obama, whose political opponents Mr. Netanyahu has openly courted.“You have to respect him,” Mr. Olmert said of Mr. Obama. “He is the president of the most powerful nation on earth, and happens to be a friend of Israel.” When boos rang through the conference room in response, he joked, “I can see that this hall is full of Democrats.”Mr. Olmert was booed again when he declared that while Israel should prepare the military ability to strike Iran’s nuclear program as a last resort, it should first push for American-led international action against Iran, including sanctions and possible joint military action.“As a concerned Israeli citizen who lives in the state of Israel with his family and all of his children and grandchildren,” he said, “I love very much the courage of those who live 10,000 miles away from the state of Israel and are ready that we will make every possible mistake that will cost lives of Israelis.”Israeli politics suffused Sunday’s conference. Mr. Olmert noted that critics of Mr. Netanyahu have ascribed the prime minister’s urgent rhetoric on Iran to political considerations. His remarks on the Palestinian issue may add to recent pressure on Mr. Netanyahu to tack to the left before the next election, which is now expected as early as the fall.Mr. Netanyahu plans to call this week for a renewal of talks with the Palestinians, proposing direct negotiations with no preconditions, according to The Israel Project, an advocacy group that promotes the positions of the Israeli government.Although Mr. Olmert is embroiled in a corruption scandal at home and faces a possible prison term, Israel is a country where political comebacks are common, so his remarks in New York on Sunday may reflect domestic political calculations of his own.His Kadima Party was formed to offer a center-right alternative to Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud bloc.Gilad Erdan, the Israeli environment minister, defended the government’s policy on Sunday, saying that Iranian nuclear weapons could provide an umbrella to militant groups like Hamas and Hezbollah or even “find their way into terrorist hands,” calling that scenario “too terrifying to even consider.”In an interview after his appearance at the conference, Mr. Olmert said he was expressing legitimate concerns shared by most people in the Israeli security establishment, “present and past,” including many who have not spoken publicly.Two such former officials, Gabi Ashkenazi, the former chief of staff of the Israeli Defense Forces, and Eliezer Shkedy, the former air force commander, told the conference on Sunday that an international approach to Iran was preferable.In the past, Mr. Shkedy has, like Mr. Netanyahu, compared the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran to the Holocaust.At the conference, The Jerusalem Post released results of a recent poll indicating that most Israelis would back a military strike on Iran by an American-led coalition but fewer than half by Israel alone.Mr. Olmert said in the interview that Israel should quietly build American support behind the scenes, and not publicly declare that it will act with or without America, given its dependence on American military aid and hardware.“America is not a client state of Israel — maybe the opposite is true,” he said. “Why should we want America to be put in a situation where whatever they do will be interpreted as if they obeyed orders from Jerusalem?”Mr. Olmert warned that Mr. Netanyahu and his defense minister, Ehud Barak, having likened Iran to Nazi Germany, may find themselves unable to back down from military action.“They talk too much, they talk too loud,” he said in the interview. “They are creating an atmosphere and a momentum that may go out of their control.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. (AP) — Merck & Company says it won two patent infringement lawsuits against Mylan Pharmaceuticals, a leading generic drug maker, which is seeking to make generic versions of Merck’s lucrative cholesterol pills, Zetia and Vytorin.Judge Jose L. Linares of Federal District Court in Newark ruled on Friday against Mylan, Merck said in a statement.Both lawsuits concern the patent for ezetimibe, Zetia’s active ingredient and a part of Vytorin, which also includes generic Zocor. That is an older Merck cholesterol pill that works differently.The judge ruled the patent, which runs until April 2017, is valid, so Mylan cannot make generic versions of the drugs until then.“The court appropriately ruled that the patent for Zetia and Vytorin in the U.S. is valid and enforceable,” Bruce N. Kuhlik, executive vice president and general counsel of Merck, said in the company’s statement.In the first quarter, Zetia had sales of $614 million and Vytorin had sales of $444 million.

Pepsi already had about 90 percent of the business in Applebee’s restaurants but represented less than half the drinks sold in IHOP outlets.About 130 Applebee’s restaurants are expected to shift to PepsiCo products from Coca-Cola by 2016. But Coca-Cola is expected to keep supplying products to those Applebee’s restaurants under a separate agreement.PepsiCo declined to confirm the report. Coca-Cola, meanwhile, had no comment.This month, Coca-Cola announced that it had ousted PepsiCo from Dunkin Donuts’ 9,400 shops and Baskin-Robbins stores, and analysts have been worried that the two companies were on the brink of a price war.PepsiCo also announced this month that it had wrested business in the 7,100 Family Dollar stores from Coca-Cola, in large part because of the popularity of its Mountain Dew brand.And in January, Papa John’s began serving PepsiCo products, ending a quarter century relationship the pizza restaurant chain had with Coca-Cola.“Literally in the cola wars, they are fighting not for every case but for every ounce,” said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','OTTAWA — The Swiss police have arrested a former senior executive of SNC-Lavalin, a Canadian construction company that did considerable business with the regime of Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan dictator.In a joint interview released Sunday, Jeannette Balmer, an official with the Swiss federal prosecutors office, told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and Radio Télévision Suisse that Riadh Ben Aissa, who was executive vice president of the company’s construction and infrastructure division, has been held in Bern, Switzerland, since the middle of the month.She said that his arrest stemmed from an investigation that began almost a year ago into “suspicion of corrupt practices, fraud and money laundering in connection with dealings conducted in North Africa.”Ms. Balmer did not name the country or countries involved. But under Mr. Ben Aissa, SNC-Lavalin landed several lucrative contracts in Libya, including the construction of a prison. Mr. Ben Aissa cultivated a close friendship with Saadi el-Qaddafi, a son of the former dictator, who was responsible for several infrastructure projects in the country.In February SNC-Lavalin fired Mr. Ben Aissa and Stéphane Roy, the chief financial officer of the construction unit. An internal investigation was subsequently unable to trace $56 million in payments made to unknown agents working on behalf of the company that came from the construction unit. Pierre Duhaime, the company’s chief executive who had approved those payments, resigned in March.Cynthia Vanier, a Canadian consultant who was hired by Mr. Roy to travel to Libya during the uprising last year to produce a report critical of the military campaign led by NATO, remains jailed in Mexico, accused of trying to smuggle Saadi el-Qaddafi and his family into that country. Mr. Roy was traveling to meet Ms. Vanier in Mexico at the time of her arrest. She denies the accusations and has said she was working with Mr. Roy on a water contract in Mexico.'"

"'12-04-30,'0','Calling Bynum, 24, “an absolute beast down there,” Brown added, “If he continues to play like that, being the type of monster he was controlling the paint, we’re going to be playing a long time.”It has been a long time between dominations for the Lakers, who once gave fans T-shirts proclaiming multi-title runs.On Sunday, they handed out T-shirts that read, “One at a Time,” after a bumpy season when they started 10-8 and finished by overtaking the resurgent Los Angeles Clippers to win the Pacific Division by one game.Nevertheless, this was a vintage Lakers game, played over the head of a smaller foe that had Kenneth Faried, listed at 6-8 but measured at 6-6 at the 2012 predraft camp, guarding 7-foot Pau Gasol.The Nuggets actually campaigned for this mismatch, finishing 8-2 to climb to No. 6 and a matchup with their longtime nemesis.“I’m a nervous guy,” Nuggets Coach George Karl said, all but vibrating in excitement before the game.“So, you think you have a chance?” a reporter said.“The first question, the arrogance of L.A. comes forth?” Karl said.Unfortunately for Karl, his players tiptoed in as if trying not to awake anyone in the land of the giants, never leading and trailing by as many as 21.Bynum was a minor factor in the teams’ last playoff meeting, in the 2009 Western Conference finals, coming off another in a series of knee injuries.This season, Bynum missed only six games and, with Brown making him the No. 2 option ahead of Gasol, also replaced Gasol on the West All-Star team.In a behind-the-scenes tug of war with several players questioning Brown’s strategies or challenging his authority, Bynum critiqued the offense, was benched for shooting a 3-pointer, promised to shoot more 3s, and was fined by the team for skipping a meeting with General Manager Mitch Kupchak.After last spring’s furor over Bynum’s flagrant foul against Dallas’s J. J. Barea, bad press mounted for Bynum, who nonetheless continued to make great strides, posting career-best averages of 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds, and finishing No. 6 in blocks at 1.93 a game.If the Lakers’ dreams come true, that’s just warming up.“He only got one illegal defense,” Karl said. “I saw about 30 of them.”With Karl conceding that the violation is not often called, the Nuggets should be seeing that many more a game. At least, the Lakers hope they will.“I view his game as being Willie Roaf, a great offensive lineman, or Anthony Munoz,” Brown said of Bynum. “You don’t know what they do down in the trenches.”He added: “That’s why I mentioned all the shots Andrew changed that aren’t in the stat sheet. Andrew is so skilled, teams would be crazy just to cover him with one guy. He could get 30 easy. Andrew just has to get the mind-set, teams are going to come at him really hard.”Yet to be determined is whether Bynum wants to be a great offensive tackle, laboring in the trenches.“Bottom line is wins,” Bynum said. “Obviously, I want to score more points, but sometimes that’s not what’s available to you so you have to do the next best thing.”'"

"'12-04-30,'0','As the museum was preparing to open late last week, with workmen hauling around ladders and a staff member stocking the gift-shop shelves with Mr. Pamuk’s books, the author himself was going full tilt, giving orders and making last-minute tweaks as he walked a reporter through the displays.He said the museum cost him about what he received for the Nobel — roughly $1.5 million — including what he paid for the house 12 years ago, when he had the idea for the project. Then there is the amount of time he has devoted to it on and off over the past dozen years: by his estimate about half a book’s worth, a lot considering that his novels tend to run to 500 pages or more.The museum’s displays are organized according to the story line of “The Museum of Innocence,” which opens as a wealthy, self-centered young man is making love with Fusun, a distant relative and store clerk he has met while shopping for his soon-to-be fiancée.“And as I softly bit her ear, her earring must have come free and, for all we knew, hovered in midair before falling of its own accord,” an opening line reads. Mr. Pamuk paused in front of the first of 83 display cases — there is one for each chapter of the book — and pointed to a single earring. Then he moved along to other vitrines, talking about how items were chosen and how a few displays were still works in progress even after all these years of preparation.“As far as I know this is the first museum based on a novel,” he said. “But it’s not that I wrote a novel that turned out to be successful and then I thought of a museum. No, I conceived the novel and the museum together.”While writing the book he collected more than a thousand artifacts that reflect the story, from a tricycle to dozens of ceramic dogs, from lottery tickets to news clippings of women with black lines drawn across their eyes (once standard in Turkish newspaper coverage of women connected to scandal).Mr. Pamuk’s protagonist and narrator, Kemal Basmaci, becomes more and more obsessed with Fusun as other aspects of his life fall apart, and eventually he begins collecting things — and stealing them from Fusun’s home — in what will ultimately become his life’s work: the building of a museum in tribute to his onetime lover. For a time Mr. Pamuk became Kemal, looking for pieces that reflected each chapter as he wrote it, searching the junk shops of Istanbul and other parts of the world. The collection he assembled reflected not only the plot of “The Museum of Innocence,” but also Istanbul during Turkey’s halting movement into the modern era.“We remembered how the Istanbul bourgeoisie had trampled over one another to be the first to own a electric shaver, a can opener, a carving knife, and any number of strange and frightening inventions, lacerating their hands and faces as they struggled to learn how to use them,” Kemal says in the book.Such items too are in the museum, along with old clocks, film clips, soda bottles and clothes of the era.At the top of the house Mr. Pamuk sat down on a bench in front of the bed where Kemal is meant to have slept in the last years of his life as he assembled the museum. It was lonely-looking piece of furniture.The Museum of Innocence opened to a small crowd on Saturday morning, after a packed news conference on Friday at one of Istanbul’s fanciest restaurants. Most of the visitors seemed to be fans of the book who wanted to match their vision with Mr. Pamuk’s. There was Latife Koker, who had traveled an hour and a half by bus that morning; Renata Lapanja, who lives in Slovenia; and Erdogan Solmaz, who, like Mr. Pamuk in his youth, is an architecture student at a university in Istanbul. He said Mr. Pamuk’s efforts had made this collection starkly different from others in the city, which has some of the finest museums in the world.“This one is about people,” Mr. Solmaz said. “This is much more personal and dramatic.”Personal, yes, but only to a point, Mr. Pamuk said. “This is not Orhan Pamuk’s museum,” he said. “Very little of me is here, and if it is, it’s hidden. It’s like fiction.” In his view both the book and the museum are largely about sadness, and in particular the “melancholy of the period.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','The administration’s effort to contain the crisis — the State Department declined to confirm that Mr. Campbell was in China, even though he was photographed in a Marriott hotel in Beijing — underscored the political challenge facing President Obama, at home and abroad.“This is the greatest test in bilateral relations in years, probably going back to ’89,” said Christopher K. Johnson, until recently a senior China analyst at the Central Intelligence Agency, referring to the year of the crackdown on student protests in Tiananmen Square. He noted that the relationship had weathered tense moments since then, like the forced landing of a Navy spy plane on Hainan Island in 2001 after a midair encounter with a Chinese fighter jet.Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, called for the administration to “take every measure” to protect Mr. Chen and his family. While he did not address the handling of the case, he said the matter demonstrated the need for unflinching American support for human rights in China.“Any serious U.S. policy toward China must confront the facts of the Chinese government’s denial of political liberties, its one-child policy and other violation of human rights,” Mr. Romney said in a statement on Sunday, his first remarks on the issue since Mr. Chen’s escape was reported Friday.Mr. Chen, 40, became famous because of his strong opposition to forced abortions and sterilizations conducted as part of China’s policy of limiting families to one child per couple. “Our country must play a strong role in urging reform in China and supporting those fighting for the freedoms we enjoy,” Mr. Romney said.The administration’s only public comment so far on Mr. Chen’s case came from an unexpected source: Mr. Obama’s top counterterrorism adviser, John O. Brennan. Asked about the matter on “Fox News Sunday,” he declined to discuss Mr. Chen’s whereabouts in any detail, but he acknowledged that “we are working very closely with the individuals involved in this.”He went on to say that the administration sought “an appropriate balance” when advocating for human rights in strategically important countries like China.“I think, in all instances, the president tries to balance our commitment to human rights, making sure that the people throughout the world have the ability to express themselves freely and openly,” Mr. Brennan said, “but also that we can continue to carry out our relationships with key countries overseas.”The two days of talks to be held in Beijing this week — known as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue — will be overshadowed by the diplomatic complications surrounding Mr. Chen’s daring escape, which took American officials by surprise. Still, both sides suggested that the talks would go ahead. In the only comment by a Chinese official so far, Vice Foreign Minister Cui Tiankai said Saturday that he did not believe the Chen case would “occupy much time” at the talks.The meetings have been an important element of the administration’s policy to manage America’s increasingly complex relations with China through regular discussions on a wide spectrum of issues, though they were not expected to yield any specific results this week. In recent months, administration officials say they have seen signs of greater Chinese flexibility on security issues involving Iran, Syria and North Korea and on economic concerns like China’s exchange rate.Mr. Cui’s statement did not preclude the possibility that a senior Chinese leader would meet with Mrs. Clinton separately from the planned sessions and deliver a sharp message about American involvement in Mr. Chen’s case, or a broader condemnation of American support for dissidents in China.The Chinese government regards foreign criticism of its human rights policies and practices as undue interference in its internal affairs, and it will almost certainly use the occasion of the talks to drive that point home, diplomats in Beijing said. In fact, the Chinese might go forward with the planned talks specifically to have the chance to confront Mrs. Clinton about it.Mr. Chen’s case is the second in recent months that has drawn the Obama administration into the affairs of the Chinese government without any intention on Washington’s part. In February a provincial official showed up at the American Consulate in Chengdu, seeking protection from a powerful party leader, Bo Xilai. The State Department instead arranged for him to be transferred to the national authorities in Beijing. Evidence that the provincial official claimed to possess apparently caused Mr. Bo’s political downfall and prompted an investigation of Mr. Bo’s wife in the killing of a British businessman.Mr. Chen’s case is different. A self-taught lawyer, he has called attention to human rights abuses against the disabled and women who have been forcibly sterilized. In 2006 he was sentenced to 51 months in prison on charges of destroying property and assembling a crowd to disrupt traffic, charges his supporters say were trumped up.After he was released from prison, the local authorities held him under an extralegal form of house arrest, with cordons of police officers surrounding his family’s farmhouse. In an audacious video released Friday, Mr. Chen did not call for a change of government, but rather appealed to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to investigate and halt the abuse of his family. Other advocates who have spoken to him since he fled say he does not want asylum that would force him to leave China.That could create an opening for resolving a standoff with the United States, the officials said.“The federal government doesn’t have to take this as a threat,” the senior American official said Sunday, noting that Mr. Chen had not escaped from official detention, but rather from harassment at the hands of the local authorities.Mr. Chen’s supporters and Chinese officials have said that he is now in the American Embassy. More than the usual number of security vehicles, containing men in uniform and plain clothes patrolled the area near the embassy over the weekend, but there was no sign of a major security presence at the gates or entrances to the compound.It was possible, however, that Mr. Chen was not in the fortresslike embassy, but in an apartment or some other building, and thus still vulnerable to arrest, diplomats in Beijing said. That could explain the administration’s refusal to discuss his case or his precise whereabouts.Officials in Washington and Beijing refused Sunday to talk about Mr. Campbell’s mission or any negotiations he may be conducting. The senior American official said that much remained unclear, including China’s response to what has become a major embarrassment to Beijing. “It’s not something that’s going to be resolved quickly,” the official said.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','But senior aides to Mr. Obama said the campaign was preparing for the laws to be upheld and in force this fall — just in case.“We have to assume that these laws will be in effect in November,” Jeremy Bird, the field director for the campaign, said in an interview. “We are not allowing laws that are challenging and put in our way to stop us from doing what we need to do.”Advocates of the new laws, which have been passed in about 30 states since the last presidential election, say they are necessary to prevent voter fraud. They include tougher voter identification requirements and more rules about where and how groups can register new voters.Mark Cole, a Virginia lawmaker who sponsored a bill requiring voters to show identification, told Virginia Statehouse News that it was “a good ballot integrity measure” that would “increase confidence in the electoral process.”Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, is an advocate of the push by Republican-controlled legislatures to toughen the laws.“For centuries our electoral process is based on one person, one vote, and for anyone to politicize the issue reeks of desperation and represents the worst in modern politics,” Mr. Priebus said.Senior advisers to Mr. Obama’s campaign say many of the new laws put a heavy burden on the registration process, making it more difficult to recruit first-time voters. Other laws shorten the early-voting period in states that had tried to expand the voting window.“They are clearly put forward for partisan political gains,” Mr. Bird said. “They are trying to change the rules in the middle of the game.”The new Florida law requires that voter registration drives be conducted by third-party groups that are certified by the state and requires the groups to account for all forms that are checked out from the election division. Those rules were the centerpiece of a training effort over the weekend by the Obama for America staff in the state.All volunteers and staff members in Florida are required to attend a mandatory session on the new laws, campaign officials said. Those who go through the training must pass a quiz administered by the campaign before they can attempt to register voters on the president’s behalf.Those who pass are registered with Florida’s election officials and are provided with additional instruction on how to meet the state’s 48-hour rule.“This is the reality,” Mr. Bird said. “We are going to make sure that we have a very tight, very sophisticated program to follow that law.”The same is true in Pennsylvania, officials for Mr. Obama’s campaign said. In that state, voters must now present photo identification to vote on Election Day or to pick up an absentee ballot. In the 2008 campaign, the rule applied only to first-time voters.Now, Mr. Obama’s campaign in Pennsylvania includes information about the new requirement in all materials they pass out to voters. Volunteers who canvass neighborhoods are instructed to ask potential supporters whether they have photo identification to take to their precinct.Campaign officials declined to put a price tag on the new efforts to comply with voter identification laws, saying the extra time and expense were being built into the budgets for each state’s campaign.Four years ago, Mr. Obama’s campaign used novel approaches to expand the pool of voters, including registration drives at barbershops and beauty salons in African-American neighborhoods. The campaign plans to expand those efforts, setting up voter registration outposts in those settings.But the real impact of the new laws may not be the financial cost. Mr. Bird said the campaign had identified the number of voters it believes must turn out in each state for Mr. Obama to win in November.If the new state laws prevent the campaign from reaching those goals, it could cost Mr. Obama a second term.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','Fred Hakim’s family owned a hole-in-the-wall hot-dog counter in Times Square that was the last of its kind when New York decided to revitalize the area in the 1990s by condemning dozens of establishments like it. It was a seven-seat, 250-square-foot piece of Edward Hopper streetscape at 229-31 West 42nd Street, which Mr. Hakim’s father had opened in 1941 and wryly named the Grand Luncheonette.Mr. Hakim (pronounced HAY-kim) tried to keep the place open as a sort of living museum of the golden age of hawkers and honky-tonks in Times Square. But the city had other ideas, and after a two-year fight, he was evicted on Oct. 19, 1997.He died on April 25 at age 83.Mr. Hakim seemed stumped by the economics of the Times Square redevelopment. In conversations with family members, and in interviews with the many reporters who crowded his joint in its last days, he often asked, “Where are the people who just want a hot dog and a knish?”Working for his father from age 13, Mr. Hakim was witness to a New Yorker’s version of the history of the world. From the counter, he saw bobby-soxers rounding the corner to swoon over Frank Sinatra at the Paramount. He watched the crowds flood the street like a dam burst on V-E Day — May 8, 1945 — which also marked the end of the wartime brownout, when the lights in Times Square — the billboards, the marquees, the windows in every building that had been dark for three years — blazed once again.He met a world of shoeshine men, longshoremen, sailors, drug dealers, prostitutes and policemen in the gritty years. “He called it a symbiotic relationship,” his son Mark said. “You depended on each other, and no one was in anybody’s business.”'"

"'12-04-30,'0','Responding to criticism that the administration had not pushed China forcefully enough on Mr. Chen’s case, Mr. Obama said that “every time we meet with China the issue of human rights comes up,” though he refused to discuss the matter at all.“It is our belief that not only is that the right thing to do, because it comports with our belief in freedom and human rights, but also because we actually think China will be stronger as it opens up and liberalizes its own system,” Mr. Obama said as he appeared at the White House with ’s prime minister, . “We want China to be strong, and we want it to be prosperous.”The handling of Mr. Chen’s fate is so sensitive that American officials and diplomats have refused even to confirm whether Mr. Chen is inside the embassy, as supporters and Chinese officials have said, or somewhere else in American hands. Mr. Obama went so far as to decline to discuss what he called “press reports” about Mr. Chen’s case.Administration officials have made clear they hoped silence on the matter was the best chance to resolve the case, given the embarrassment Mr. Chen’s escape has already caused Chinese leaders, who bristle at anything they perceive as foreign interference.Mr. Chen, in a videotaped appeal to Premier , outlined his preferred solution: a deal that would allow him to be free and guarantee that he and his family are protected from the persecution that prompted his flight from a severe and extralegal house arrest.Mr. Chen’s supporters say he does not want the one thing American officials may be able to provide him — asylum — because he knows his influence will quickly diminish to the people who matter most to him if he leaves China.China’s leaders, however, are unlikely to allow Mr. Chen, a blind lawyer who became a media-savvy advocate, to have the freedom to continue his crusading legal defense work. Any major concession on such a sensitive internal affair seems especially unlikely during China’s once-in-a-decade leadership succession process, now under way.For the White House, handing Mr. Chen back over to Chinese authorities would leave it vulnerable to election-year criticism that it had abandoned him. “This administration has made a calculated decision not to challenge the Chinese regime on its dismal human-rights record,” the Republican chairwoman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of , said in a statement after Mr. Obama’s remarks. “This is an opportunity to correct that mistake.”With Secretary of State and other American officials scheduled to arrive in Beijing on Wednesday, China and the United States both appear to be under enormous pressure to find a resolution that does not overshadow the talks, known as the Strategic and Economic Dialogue, or derail the broader relationship.On Sunday, Kurt M. Campbell, an assistant secretary of state, arrived in Beijing to discuss the matter with Chinese officials. A deputy secretary of state, William J. Burns, also traveled there on Monday ahead of Mrs. Clinton’s arrival, but administration officials would discuss neither the negotiations now under way nor any potential solution.“We’ve worked hard to build an effective, constructive, comprehensive relationship that allows us to find ways to work together,” Mrs. Clinton said at the State Department hours before departing, also refusing even to utter Mr. Chen’s name, though she has in the past. “Now a constructive relationship includes talking very frankly about those areas where we do not agree, including human rights. That is the spirit guiding me as I take off for Beijing tonight.”Representative , a Republican from and one of Congress’s most outspoken critics of Chinese abuses, urged Mrs. Clinton in a letter released on Monday to raise not only Mr. Chen’s demands, but also the fate of others facing repression. “I would request that you raise the issue of all harassed, arrested, disappeared and disbarred human-rights lawyers and defenders with the Chinese government on an ongoing basis and link this issue with the United States’s interest in the rule of law and respect for human rights generally in China,” he wrote.Even if American diplomats could persuade Mr. Chen to accept political asylum in the United States, it is not clear whether Beijing would allow him — and his family — to leave. For one, Chinese officials are loath to set a precedent that could encourage other dissidents to seek protection in foreign embassies.Still, if Mr. Chen were willing to leave, diplomats would find it easier to work out the logistics of a solution than if he insists on staying. Indeed, one Chinese figure who has knowledge of the attitudes of top leaders, said the government would probably be happy to see Mr. Chen leave, even if it meant a temporary loss of face.But absent that, one veteran Chinese diplomat who works for the Foreign Ministry said, “I predict that if Chen is in the embassy then he won’t get out for years.”There are few historical precedents for resolving a case like this. The last Chinese dissident to find refuge in an American diplomatic compound was Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist, who walked into the embassy in Beijing with his wife in 1989, the day after the People’s Liberation Army crushed pro-democracy protests in . China finally allowed him to leave, ostensibly for medical treatment in , after a year living on the compound.China now is in a far different position than it was two decades ago, when it was subjected to international censure for the bloody crackdown. And the United States is now far more reluctant to alienate a rising economic powerhouse whose diplomatic heft makes its cooperation crucial on many security matters, including and .On the contrary, Mr. Obama said on Monday that he hoped China would grow stronger and prosper, calling on it to “be a partner with us in a set of international rules and norms that everybody follows.”So far, the Chinese government has suppressed any news of Mr. Chen’s escape by aggressively blocking and deleting posts on popular microblog services. Nonetheless, many people have already been swept up by his cause, said Murong Xuecun, a well-known Chinese writer who joined a grass-roots effort last year to break through the blockade around the farmhouse where Mr. Chen was held after being released from prison.“People have been willing to take such risks for him because more and more people are so outraged by his mistreatment,” he said. “He has become a figure for people, a representative of their own grievances.”If past news coverage of other dissidents is any guide, Mr. Murong said he expected propaganda officials to spin a new narrative once news of his predicament becomes impossible to tamp down, criticizing Mr. Chen as an enemy of the nation. In recent years, the government has used a similar playbook for , the artist and government critic, and , the essayist and political reform advocate who won the Nobel Peace Prize while serving an 11-year sentence for subversion. Both men were portrayed in the official press as self-serving elitists seeking to tear the nation apart.That could prove difficult in his case. “A blind person and peasant as a destabilizing threat to the government?” Mr. Murong asked. “That would be a joke.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','“Clouds really are the biggest uncertainty,” said Andrew E. Dessler, a climate researcher at A&M. “If you listen to the credible climate skeptics, they’ve really pushed all their chips onto clouds.”Richard S. Lindzen, a professor of meteorology at the , is the leading proponent of the view that clouds will save the day. His stature in the field — he has been making seminal contributions to climate science since the 1960s — has amplified his influence.Dr. Lindzen says the earth is not especially sensitive to greenhouse gases because clouds will react to counter them, and he believes he has identified a specific mechanism. On a warming planet, he says, less coverage by high clouds in the tropics will allow more heat to escape to space, countering the temperature increase.His idea has drawn withering criticism from other scientists, who cite errors in his papers and say proof is lacking. Enough evidence is already in hand, they say, to rule out the powerful cooling effect from clouds that would be needed to offset the increase of greenhouse gases.However, politicians looking for reasons not to tackle climate change have embraced Dr. Lindzen and other skeptics, elevating their role in the public debate.Dr. Lindzen has obliged by assuring them that they are running no risks by refusing to enact emission limits. “There’s been a lot of scare stuff put out that just doesn’t make sense,” he said in an interview.Some politicians have welcomed that message, regularly calling Dr. Lindzen and a handful of other contrarian scientists before Congressional committees. During a hearing before a House subcommittee, Representative Dana Rohrabacher, a Republican and vocal global warming skeptic, complained that “in the scientific community, there are people trying to tell us that we have got to accept draconian changes in our way of life mandated by law because the CO2 that we are emitting is going to cause drastic consequences to the planet’s climate.”He repeatedly sought affirmation from Dr. Lindzen for his views, and got it.At gatherings of climate change skeptics on both sides of the Atlantic, Dr. Lindzen has been treated as a star. During a debate in over carbon , his work was cited repeatedly. When he appears at conferences of the Heartland Institute, the primary American organization pushing climate change skepticism, he is greeted by thunderous applause.While the scientific majority acknowledges that the lingering uncertainty about clouds plays into the hands of skeptics like Dr. Lindzen, they say that he has gone beyond any reasonable reading of the evidence to provide a dangerous alibi for inaction.Dr. Lindzen is “feeding upon an audience that wants to hear a certain message, and wants to hear it put forth by people with enough scientific reputation that it can be sustained for a while, even if it’s wrong science,” said Christopher S. Bretherton, an atmospheric researcher at the . “I don’t think it’s intellectually honest at all.”With climate policy nearly paralyzed in the , many other governments have also declined to take action, and worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases are soaring.Clouds are so familiar they are easy to take for granted, but scientists point out that they have an enormous effect on the climate.The energy that drives life on earth arrives as sunlight. To remain at a steady temperature, the earth has to return the energy it receives back to space, primarily as heat. Clouds alter the energy flow in both directions.On balance, in today’s climate, clouds cool the earth. Dense, low-lying clouds are responsible for most of that effect, because they reflect considerable sunlight back to space. Many high, thin clouds have the opposite influence, allowing incoming sunshine to pass through but effectively trapping heat that is trying to escape.“It’s like putting a lid on a pot on the stove,” said Andreas Muhlbauer, a cloud researcher at the University of Washington.Humans are perturbing the earth’s heat balance by releasing greenhouse gases. Chemists proved in the 19th century that these gases, especially the carbon dioxide that results from burning fossil fuels, work like an invisible blanket in the atmosphere, blocking some heat that is attempting to escape to space. In the mid-20th century, as it became clear how fast carbon dioxide levels were rising, some scientists began to predict a warming of the planet. But they also realized that an exact forecast was difficult for several reasons, especially the question of how clouds would react.Researchers are virtually certain the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere will rise with temperature, and evidence suggests this is already happening. But that does not say much about the type or location of clouds that will condense from the vapor.Scientists use sophisticated computer programs to forecast future climate, but the computers are not yet powerful enough to predict the behavior of individual clouds across the whole earth over a century, which forces the researchers to use rough approximations.The most elaborate computer programs have agreed on a broad conclusion: clouds are not likely to change enough to offset the bulk of the human-caused warming. Some of the analyses predict that clouds could actually amplify the warming trend sharply through several mechanisms, including a reduction of some of the low clouds that reflect a lot of sunlight back to space. Other computer analyses foresee a largely neutral effect. The result is a big spread in forecasts of future temperature, one that scientists have not been able to narrow much in 30 years of effort.The earth’s surface has already warmed about 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, most of that in the last 40 years. Modest as it sounds, it is an average for the whole planet, representing an enormous addition of heat. An even larger amount is being absorbed by the oceans. The increase has caused some of the world’s land ice to melt and the oceans to rise.By midcentury, the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is expected to double compared with the value that prevailed before the Industrial Revolution. At the low end, computers predict that the earth could warm in response by another 2 degrees Fahrenheit. The likelier figure, the analyses say, is 4 degrees. At the high end of projections, the warming could exceed 8 degrees. In all possible outcomes, the warming over land would be roughly twice the global average, and the warming in the greater still.Even in the low projection, many scientists say, the damage could be substantial. In the high projection, some polar regions could heat up by 20 or 25 degrees Fahrenheit — more than enough, over centuries or longer, to melt the ice sheet, raising sea level by a catastrophic 20 feet or more. Vast changes in  rainfall, heat waves and other weather patterns would most likely accompany such a large warming.“The big damages come if the climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases turns out to be high,” said Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, a climate scientist at the . “Then it’s not a bullet headed at us, but a thermonuclear warhead.”A major goal of climate research is to improve the way clouds are represented in the computer analyses, which should narrow the range of predicted temperatures. And some of the most important data that researchers need to do so are streaming from a hilltop in rural , near the town of Lamont, where the Department of Energy runs the world’s largest facility for measuring the behavior of clouds.Accuracy is an overriding goal there. One recent morning, Patrick Dowell, a technician, worked his way across the hill with a rag in hand, carefully dusting dozens of instruments pointed at the sky. When his fingers knocked one gauge off kilter, tiny motors whirred and the device snapped back to position, as though annoyed with him.“When you clean it,” Mr. Dowell said, “it kind of fights you.”The questions that scientists still need to answer are voluminous. For instance, they want a better idea of how clouds form at a microscopic scale, how their behavior varies under different atmospheric conditions, and how sensitive they are to higher temperatures.Recently, $30 million worth of new radars have been installed in Oklahoma and at other research facilities, promising a better view of the innards of clouds. Satellites are also supplying better data, and theories of the atmosphere are improving. “I feel like we’re on our way to doing a lot better,” said Anthony D. Del Genio, a researcher with .But the problem of how clouds will behave in a future climate is not yet solved — making the unheralded field of cloud research one of the most important pursuits of modern science.Among the many climate skeptics who plaster the Internet with their writings, hardly any have serious credentials in the physics of the atmosphere. But a handful of contrarian scientists do. The most influential is Dr. Lindzen.Dr. Lindzen accepts the elementary tenets of climate science. He agrees that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, calling people who dispute that point “nutty.” He agrees that the level of it is rising because of human activity and that this should warm the climate.But for more than a decade, Dr. Lindzen has said that when surface temperature increases, the columns of moist air rising in the tropics will rain out more of their moisture, leaving less available to be thrown off as ice, which forms the thin, high clouds known as cirrus. Just like greenhouse gases, these cirrus clouds act to reduce the cooling of the earth, and a decrease of them would counteract the increase of greenhouse gases.Dr. Lindzen calls his mechanism the iris effect, after the iris of the eye, which opens at night to let in more light. In this case, the earth’s “iris” of high clouds would be opening to let more heat escape.When Dr. Lindzen first published this theory, in 2001, he said it was supported by satellite records over the Pacific Ocean. But other researchers quickly published work saying that the methods he had used to analyze the data were flawed and that his theory made assumptions that were inconsistent with known facts. Using what they considered more realistic assumptions, they said they could not verify his claims.Today, most mainstream researchers consider Dr. Lindzen’s theory discredited. He does not agree, but he has had difficulty establishing his case in the scientific literature. Dr. Lindzen published a paper in 2009 offering more support for his case that the earth’s sensitivity to greenhouse gases is low, but once again scientists identified errors, including a failure to account for known inaccuracies in satellite measurements.Dr. Lindzen acknowledged that the 2009 paper contained “some stupid mistakes” in his handling of the satellite data. “It was just embarrassing,” he said in an interview. “The technical details of satellite measurements are really sort of grotesque.”Last year, he tried offering more evidence for his case, but after reviewers for a prestigious American journal criticized the paper, Dr. Lindzen published it in a little-known Korean journal.Dr. Lindzen blames groupthink among climate scientists for his publication difficulties, saying the majority is determined to suppress any dissenting views. They, in turn, contend that he routinely misrepresents the work of other researchers.“If I’m right, we’ll have saved money” by avoiding measures to limit emissions, Dr. Lindzen said in the interview. “If I’m wrong, we’ll know it in 50 years and can do something.”But mainstream scientists counter that society’s impulse to wait only heightens the risks.Ultimately, as the climate continues warming and more data accumulate, it will become obvious how clouds are reacting. But that could take decades, scientists say, and if the answer turns out to be that catastrophe looms, it would most likely be too late. By then, they say, the atmosphere would contain so much carbon dioxide as to make a substantial warming inevitable, and the gas would not return to a normal level for thousands of years.Researchers are trying various shortcuts to get a rapid answer. One of those is to use short-term natural variations, such as the El Niño cycle, to see how clouds react to higher ocean temperatures. Dr. Dessler, the researcher, did that recently. His analysis, while not definitive, offered some evidence that clouds will exacerbate the long-term planetary warming, just as many of the computer programs have predicted. Most, but not all, papers relying on the historical cloud record have come to similar conclusions.In his Congressional appearances, speeches and popular writings, Dr. Lindzen offers little hint of how thin the published science supporting his position is. Instead, starting from his disputed iris mechanism, he makes what many of his colleagues see as an unwarranted leap of logic, professing near-certainty that climate change is not a problem society needs to worry about.“You have politicians who are being told if they question this, they are anti-science,” Dr. Lindzen said. “We are trying to tell them, no, questioning is never anti-science.”Among the experts most offended by Dr. Lindzen’s stance are many of his colleagues in the M.I.T. atmospheric sciences department, some of whom were once as skeptical as he about climate change.“Even if there were no political implications, it just seems deeply unprofessional and irresponsible to look at this and say, ‘We’re sure it’s not a problem,’ ” said Kerry A. Emanuel, another M.I.T. scientist. “It’s a special kind of risk, because it’s a risk to the collective civilization.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Mayor Angel Taveras had been in office for two months last year when he announced that this capital city was in dire financial shape — not the Category 3 hurricane he had expected, he said at the time, but a full-on Category 5.Since then, Mr. Taveras has repeatedly said that the only way Providence can avoid bankruptcy — a fate that has already befallen one Rhode Island city, Central Falls, and threatens others — is to scale back the pension benefits granted to city retirees.On Monday, Mr. Taveras celebrated an initial victory when the Providence City Council signed off on a plan to end, for now, annual cost-of-living increases for about 3,000 retired police officers, firefighters and other employees getting city pensions. The change would save about $16 million in the 2013 fiscal year, the mayor said; cost-of-living increases would be reinstated once the retirement system is 70 percent financed, which could take well over a decade. The change would also apply to current city workers once they retire.In an interview at City Hall last week, Mr. Taveras, a first-term Democrat, said he “absolutely” expected a lawsuit to delay the freeze on cost-of-living increases for pensioners. But he said he saw no alternative for the city of 178,000 short of receivership, which would allow for a bankruptcy filing.“It could drag out,” the mayor said of the expected legal battle. “But if we can’t reform our pensions, I don’t see how we can move this city forward. You could raise taxes, but I don’t think you can raise taxes enough to cover the cost of this.”Gov. Lincoln Chafee, an independent, and the state legislature last year scaled back pension benefits for state workers and retirees but did not address the problem of unfunded pension liability at the municipal level. Mr. Taveras estimates Providence’s liability at $900 million; freezing the cost-of-living increases, which range from 5 percent to 6 percent per year, would reduce it by $236 million, he said.'"

"'12-04-30,'0','For Ms. Quinn — who stalked away from a celebratory rally on the steps of City Hall because she proclaimed herself outraged that a demonstrator, in something closer to a mutter than a yell, said “Pharaoh Bloomberg” — the victory is considerable. She champions a bill she neutered, and this all-but-declared mayoral candidate takes a salute from labor leaders on her left side.Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, claims a victory, which sets him apart from the otherwise moribund grouping known as the city’s labor leadership. He pulled together a sometimes unruly coalition. But his claims that the bill is the nation’s most far-reaching measure sound far-fetched. Boston and Los Angeles have ordinances that encompass far more workers. And San Francisco’s minimum wage, covering all of its workers, now stands at $10.24.New York’s bill carries carefully devised exemptions, not the least for development on Midtown’s western flank. So the bill will apply, say, to deepest Queens but spares the vastly more profitable acreage in Midtown.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg spent months humming bars from “Back in the U.S.S.R.” This reasonably subtle plutocrat appears to lose his bearings entirely on this subject. He warned that a cloud of Soviet-style centralism would descend upon the world’s financial capital. He has vowed a veto, and a court battle. “If you think about it, the last time we really had a big, managed economy was the U.S.S.R., and that didn’t work out so well,” he said.If you think about it, very little about this makes sense. The mayor, after all, has walked this path. Early in his first term, he signed a provision that extended a living wage to 50,000 home health care workers and 9,000 child care workers.This bill shines a light on New York City’s curious subsidized economy, in which some corporations hit the tax-cut daily double for no particular strategic reason other than that some other state casts a covetous eye at them. So Fresh Direct gets a $120 million tax subsidy for what still appears to be a modestly profitable business. (The mayor’s proposed tech campus on Roosevelt Island, in fairness, seems a far better example of carefully targeted city subsidies, the difference perhaps between thinking and reacting.)Business leaders grumble about the measure, although most agree that it would cost them but marginally.The Lend Lease fiasco that was disclosed by prosecutors last week, meanwhile, points to where business and Mr. Bloomberg might far more profitably concentrate their fire: Construction unions routinely demand no-show jobs, and overtime for imaginary hours. And some minority contracting firms take cuts of lucrative public contracts, for very little work in return.In the end, you can’t help wondering if all of this cacophonous debate and battle might have gone more productively toward raising the state’s minimum wage, which sits at a rock-bottom $7.25 an hour. The state’s unemployment benefits are also far lower than in, say, New Jersey.“We do not want a city for the very, very rich with enclaves for the very poor,” the Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, said. In a city where less than 1 percent of the population earns more than 40 percent of the income, this is no doubt a problem. Less clear is whether giving raises to 500 workers a year much turns the dial.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','Ovechkin’s goal came four seconds after a strict call against Brad Richards. The referees Stephen Walkom and Dan O’Halloran, who had made other debatable calls that worked in the Rangers’ favor, sent Richards off for holding after Capitals defenseman John Carlson crossed in front of him at the Rangers’ blue line and fell.“He just came across right in front of me,” Richards said. “I just put my hand up there — can’t have my hand up there.”Nicklas Backstrom won the ensuing face-off, directing the puck to Ovechkin, whose drive beat Lundqvist cleanly.“First I saw it, then I didn’t see it, and then I saw it,” said Lundqvist, who finished with 22 saves. “It was a hard shot, a good shot. Unfortunately someone got tied up, and he got a free lane. It’s the wrong guy to get that opportunity.”The Rangers almost forced overtime with 50 seconds remaining when Del Zotto took a shot from the blue line that nicked a Washington stick and hit the crossbar behind the rookie goaltender Braden Holtby. Earlier in the period, he hit a goal post.“You look at the difference in the two games,” Holtby said. “We hit two posts last game, and they hit two this game. That’s how close it is. The hockey gods were on our side tonight.”Trailing by 2-1 in the third period, the Rangers tied the score on a power play when a shot by Del Zotto deflected off a Washington stick and Callahan’s leg at 6:58.Del Zotto had a productive night, finishing with two assists and a game-high 13 shot attempts, 4 of which hit the net.After learning the hard way in Game 1, when a long pass from Derek Stepan to Chris Kreider led to the decisive Rangers goal, the Capitals blocked lanes and kept defenders in the neutral zone. That eliminated the effectiveness of stretch passes to the Rangers’ fast forwards.“With the Rangers having those quick young guys, we can’t allow any more stretch passes,” Washington right wing Troy Brouwer said before the game. “If we can take those away them, we should have a better result.”The Rangers’ only breakaway came when Kreider, who was celebrating his 21st birthday, emerged from the penalty box late in the first period after serving a team bench minor.Holtby made the stop at 17:03 — one of 26 — and the Capitals immediately broke the other way. Lundqvist tried to play the puck along the end boards, but the speedy winger Jason Chimera barged in and took it away. He passed it to the front of the empty Rangers net, where Matt Hendricks backhanded it between his legs. In a momentary scramble, Chimera touched it again and Ryan McDonagh wound up kicking it into his own net at 17:14 for a 2-0 Washington lead. Chimera was credited the goal, his third in three playoff games at the Garden.The Rangers got back into the game, with help from some odd refereeing by O’Halloran and Walkom. Capitals defenseman Carlson was slashed by Staal after the whistle, but was given a minor penalty along with Staal.On the subsequent four on four, Del Zotto and Gaborik made beautiful passes that allowed Richards to direct the puck home at 19:17, halving the deficit.The Rangers clawed back to 2-2, but Ovechkin’s winner negated the comeback.“All year we responded to losses,” Callahan said. “It’s a tough place to play in Washington. We’re going to have to be ready.”Brian Boyle returned Monday after sustaining a concussion in Game 5 of the Ottawa series. He played 15:20 and was credited with six body checks.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','The electrical shock delivered to the chest by a Taser can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death, according to a new study, although it is unknown how frequently such deaths occur.The study, which analyzed detailed records from the cases of eight people who went into cardiac arrest after receiving shocks from a Taser X26 fired at a distance, is likely to add to the debate about the safety of the weapons. Seven of the people in the study died; one survived.Advocacy groups like Amnesty International have argued that Tasers, the most widely used of a class of weapons known as electrical control devices, are potentially lethal and that stricter rules should govern their use.But proponents maintain that the devices — which are used by more than 16,700 law enforcement agencies in 107 countries, said Steve Tuttle, a spokesman for Taser — pose less risk to civilians than firearms and are safer for police officers than physically tackling a suspect. The results of studies of the devices’ safety in humans have been mixed.Medical experts said on Monday that the new report, published online on Monday in the journal Circulation, makes clear that electrical shocks from Tasers, which shoot barbs into the clothes and skin, can in some cases set off irregular heart rhythms, leading to cardiac arrest.“This is no longer arguable,” said Dr. Byron Lee, a cardiologist and director of the electrophysiology laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco. “This is a scientific fact. The national debate should now center on whether the risk of sudden death with Tasers is low enough to warrant widespread use by law enforcement.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','Mr. Vitale is finishing a 10-city study of interactions between protesters and the police since last fall, which he said showed a lack of overall “militarization” in police response in major cities. (New York is an exception, said Mr. Vitale, who organized a demonstration against police tactics in Zuccotti Park last fall but said he did not consider himself part of the Occupy movement.) Other researchers are doing ethnographic studies, crunching survey data, recording oral histories and analyzing material by and about the movement, all at lightning speed compared with the usual pace of scholarship.“Academics are used to taking forever, but we don’t have to,” said Theda Skocpol, a sociologist at Harvard and author, with Vanessa Williamson, of “The Tea Party and the Remaking of Republican Conservatism,” a study of Occupy’s right-wing counterpart published in January.That book, which combines in-depth interviews with quantitative analysis of the Tea Party movement, is a model for the kind of ambitious work that could emerge in studies of the Occupy movement, some social scientists say. But getting a handle on Occupy, with its amorphous structure and aims, could be more challenging, Ms. Skocpol said.“The Tea Party from the beginning saw themselves as leveraging and changing the Republican Party, while the Occupy people are much more ambivalent,” she said. “That makes them harder to pin down.”Some researchers also say that the sympathy many academics feel for the movement risks undermining objective research.Edward Maguire, a criminologist at American University who is leading a study of attitudes toward the police and the law among Occupy protesters in six cities, cited an incident in which one research assistant at a demonstration in Washington in March “handed in her ID, turned in her clipboard and within minutes got arrested.”“Part of where our research is heading is making recommendations to police departments,” he said. “When they look at our research, I want them to trust it. Having people involved in the movement wouldn’t work for us.”Yet scholars in disciplines with a long tradition of participant-observer research say that direct involvement can offer a better understanding of a movement’s internal dynamics.“Everybody I know doing this is an activist of some sort,” said Jeffrey Juris, an associate professor of anthropology at Northeastern University who is organizing strategy workshops for Occupy Boston while also studying it. “But Occupy is so open and broad based, it doesn’t take much to consider yourself an activist.”Dr. Juris and other activist scholars started an online clearinghouse called Occupy Research last fall to share research methods, tools and data sets. So far the network has hosted two “hackathons” using data gathered on the site as well as facilitated collaborative research like an accounting of Occupy encampments worldwide and analyses of Occupy-related Twitter posts.But that kind of research, however valuable, is “low-hanging fruit,” said Todd Gitlin, a professor of sociology and communications at Columbia and the author of “Occupy Nation,” a sympathetic account of the movement published this week as an e-book. The most pressing unanswered question, he said, doesn’t concern Occupy’s activist core but the nature of what he called “the outer movement,” those people who may have showed up for big marches but don’t attend general assemblies or other meetings.“They are the political means by which the movement grows,” Mr. Gitlin said. “And there are a lot more of them.”Last fall the Occupy organizers in New York asked Héctor Cordero-Guzmán, a sociologist at Baruch College, to devise an online survey, which was then posted at occupywallst.org. The first wave of results, published in October, is widely credited with cementing the picture of the movement as representing what Mr. Cordero-Guzmán, in an interview, called “a decent cross-section of the population.”“This wasn’t just young single people with nothing to do at age 22,” he said. “These were people who had done all the right things and things weren’t working out for them so well.”Many scholars, however, question the value of Internet surveys, which can skew toward respondents who are more committed and more comfortable with technology. “I think it’s terrific that he did it, and did it so quickly,” said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York who is planning a randomized survey of Occupy participants. “But it’s not representative. No one quite knows who is excluded.”Some researchers studying local Occupy groups see a movement struggling with the question of just who is and is not part of it. Jesse Klein, a graduate student in sociology at Florida State University who has been studying Occupy Tallahassee since October, said divisions have emerged between activists who have time for long, consensus-based meetings and those who don’t but feared being criticized as lacking commitment. “There’s a strain,” she said.In the meantime the group has disbanded its camp near the capitol in favor of sit-ins, legislative actions and other conventional political activity. “Just being physically present didn’t get them the results they wanted,” she said.In an article in the May issue of the journal American Ethnologist, Dr. Juris argues that Occupy’s social-media-driven “logic of aggregation” may make it less durable than the anti-globalization movement of a decade ago, which mobilized existing activist groups according to a “logic of networks.”“Occupy has been about aggregating large numbers of individuals who have never been active before,” he said. But people who are easily aggregated, he said, can also be easily disaggregated.At a panel discussion at American Ethnological Society’s annual meeting in New York last month Dr. Juris warned against what he called a troubling “fetishization of occupation itself.”“It’s critical to broaden tactics,” he said. “But how do you do that when the movement is called Occupy?”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','If all you know about Jesse Owens is Hitler, four gold medals and, oh yeah, didn’t he run against a horse?, then the “American Experience” documentary “Jesse Owens” (Tuesday night on PBS stations) will fill some gaps in brisk and entertaining fashion.The sections about Owens’s pre-Olympic career will introduce you to his epochal day at the Big Ten track and field championships in 1935, when he set or tied four world records in less than an hour, an achievement that dwarfs, in purely athletic terms, what he achieved at the Berlin Olympics the next year.They also give some much deserved attention to Eulace Peacock, a fellow African-American sprinter who beat Owens in 7 of 10 head-to-head races in 1935 and was favored by some to best Owens in several Olympic events. If not for a bad hamstring, the histories of sports and World War II might read differently. The Eulace Peacock story cries out for its own film.“Jesse Owens,” directed by Laurens Grant and written by the frequent PBS collaborator Stanley Nelson (“Freedom Riders”), is a smooth and handsome production that suffers from its brevity: about 52 minutes, after credits and promos. There’s not much time to get below the surface, and Owens’s troubled post-Olympic life gets particularly quick treatment.That may also reflect a desire to stay on message, the message being that Owens represents, as the sociologist Harry Edwards puts it, the shoulders on which Jackie Robinson stood. No doubt Owens is an almost preternaturally graceful and heroic figure, asserting his will despite isolation and scorn even greater than Robinson had to face.But a more interesting and complex documentary would take a closer look at Owens’s accommodations with the systems that both celebrated and oppressed him, and his lifelong reluctance to be seen as a spokesman for change, issues that are noted briefly in “Jesse Owens.” Mr. Edwards appears frequently on screen, but no mention is made of the public battle between him and Owens over Owens’s criticism of the black-power salutes delivered at the 1968 Olympics, or of the Owens quotation, “The only time the black fist has significance is when there’s money inside.”What Ms. Grant does put on screen, though, is unimpeachable. Perhaps no athlete has looked as beautiful in motion as Owens, and the copious film of him running and jumping is mesmerizing, even when his opponent is a horse.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','A new advertising campaign highlights new fruit flavors of Newtons, as well as Newtons Fruit Thins, a line of crispy cookies introduced last year.“And now, another Newtonism,” begins the voiceover in one ad, which shows fresh strawberries, raspberries and blueberries. “Never beat around the bush — you’ll just squash the berries.” The ad, for a new triple berry filling, emphasizes it is made with whole grain and closes with the tagline, “One unique cookie.”Another commercial, for a new flavor of the crispy variety, apple cinnamon oat, says, “Being the apple of someone’s eye — is easier with cinnamon.”The campaign, by McGarryBowen, part of Dentsu, was introduced on television on Monday. It is not aimed at children, to whom cookies are typically pitched, or even mothers, who typically pack their lunchboxes, but rather to baby boomers.Tim Scott, president of the Chicago office of McGarryBowen, says the campaign forgoes conventions of ads directed at children.“You see a lot of animation and characters, and kids asking for cookies and eating cookies,” Mr. Scott said of other advertising in the category. “We thought, let’s stay away from cute, let’s stay away from silly and let’s do something a little more cerebral, a little more adult.”Newtons spent $14.8 million on advertising in 2011, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.First produced by a bakery in Cambridge, Mass., in 1891, the cookies are named for Newton, another city that borders Boston.In 2010, after four year-over-year declines in sales and market share for the brand, it conducted consumer research with boomers who were both devotees and detractors.“For people who loved us there was heritage there, and they had eaten them most of their lives,” said Tara Rutan, the brand manager for Newtons. “But the opposite was true with the people that didn’t love us — they knew the brand as Fig Newtons, but they really disliked figs.”Like prunes, which similarly are recognized for their laxative effect, “to a lot of people a fig means ‘geriatric’ and that’s not good,” said Jeff Hilton, co-founder of the Integrated Marketing Group, an agency that works with natural brands.Ms. Rutan said that consumers also associated the brand with “real fruit, and at the end of the day that’s what we’ll always stand for is real fruit.”On packages beginning last May, the logos became simply Newtons, with the flavor relegated to smaller text printed across an illustration of fruit.At the same time, the brand introduced the Newtons Fruit Thins line of crisp cookies, a version of which Kraft has marketed in Canada since 2005 as Lifestyle Selections, under the Peek Freans brand.Declines were swiftly reversed, primarily because of the new Fruit Thins.Revenue for the 52 weeks that ended April 15 totaled $106.4 million for traditional Newtons, up 0.6 percent, while the fruit thins, which were not widely available for the entire 52 weeks, totaled $47.7 million, according to data from the SymphonyIRI Group, whose totals do not include Walmart stores.Newtons has a 3.2 share of the American cookie segment, up nearly a point over a year ago.Early in 2011, fig varieties accounted for 75 percent of sales for the brand, but now account for about 60 percent, according to the company.“We needed to let fruit be the core of the brand as opposed to the fig,” said Gary Osifchin, who has the enviable title of senior director of wholesome sweet snacks at Kraft. “It was going to be hard for us to advance the Newtons brand with the baggage of the fig.”Still, marketing a cookie as both a healthy option and marketing it to boomers is somewhat counterintuitive. When asked if they considered 22 different types of snacks healthy, only 9 percent of consumers said they considered cookies healthy, a tie for last place with potato chips, and less than those who consider chocolate (13 percent), ice cream (12 percent) and meat snacks (12 percent) to be healthy, according to Mintel, a market research firm.Boomers, meanwhile, are among the shoppers least apt to turn into the cookie aisle once their children are grown, and they are satisfying their own between-meal cravings with such adult-oriented items as cereal bars and snack bars.Kraft, therefore, will soon feature Newtons beyond the cookie aisle in stand-alone displays in the produce sections of major retailers, including Walmart stores.“When you have a consumer looking for healthy fruits and vegetables, you’re putting your product in a whole new context that consumers haven’t seen before,” he said. “It’s ingenious.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','A CHILD in Mexico soon learns that corruption is a way of life, and that to get ahead in school, work and politics, “El que no transa, no avanza” — loosely, “You’re not going anywhere if you don’t cheat.”When I was in junior high school, my history teacher sold us lottery tickets, promising that the more we bought, the higher our grades would be. The winning number, he said, would coincide with the National Lottery winner. I happened to buy that number and received the highest grade, but because he kept the tickets, I never got the money.Years later, as president of an environmental activist organization called the Group of 100, I was offered visits to Las Vegas (chips provided), cars (drivers included), cash and even prostitutes in exchange for staying silent. But my most uncomfortable experience was in 1988, when I met with the secretary of Fisheries to protest the killing of dolphins by tuna fishers. He asked me, “What’s your problem?” “I don’t have any problems,” I replied. “How can I help you?” “Make the tuna fleet stop killing dolphins.” He reached for his checkbook. “Let’s talk money, how much do you want?”So the news that Walmart may have paid $24 million in bribes for permits to open stores in Mexico was no surprise to me. When President Felipe Calderón declared he was “very indignant,” I thought of Claude Rains in Casablanca: “I’m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!”Walmart already had a history of controversial behavior in Mexico. Most notably, in November 2004, despite widespread opposition, the company opened a 72,000-square-foot store within the boundaries of the 2,000-year-old city of Teotihuacán, which features the Pyramids of the Sun and the Moon (“the place where men became gods” — or consumers?). Walmart has also built a supermarket on forested land in the resort town of Playa del Carmen, in Quintana Roo — though the permit for the building later turned out to have been granted for another site, on the island of Cozumel. The question now is who allows this, and in exchange for what?'"
"'12-04-30,'0','PARIS — Stocks fell modestly in Europe on Monday, after confirmation that Spain had slumped back into recession in the first three months of 2012.The Spanish economy contracted by 0.3 percent in the January-March quarter, the same rate of contraction as in the last quarter of 2011, the National Statistics Institute said in Madrid. The common definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of real economic decline.The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks euro zone blue-chip shares, fell 1.6 percent by the close of trading. The FTSE 100 index in London was down 0.7 percent.The Spanish economic news was not quite as bad as anticipated — a Reuters poll had found a market consensus for a quarterly contraction of around 0.4 percent. Compared with the first quarter a year earlier, the Spanish economy shrank by 0.4 percent.Still reeling from the collapse of a property market bubble, Spain is seeking to enact austerity measures to restore government finances, even as it grapples with an unemployment rate of 24.4 percent. The market reaction was muted, with Spanish and other bond yields — the subject of intense scrutiny since the euro crisis began — essentially unchanged.The data suggested that “the Spanish economy is not shrinking as rapidly as the other southern European economies,” Ben May, an economist in London with Capital Economics, noted in a report. But he cautioned that “the full effects of the recent fiscal measures on economic growth will not have yet been fully felt.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','“The ‘C-word’ in American journalism is Conspiracy,” writes Edward Jay Epstein in his short, new e-book, “Three Days in May,” about l’affaire .By the time we reach this sentence, toward the end, Epstein has taken us — practically moment by moment — through the series of events that culminated with D.S.K.’s arrest for allegedly forcing himself sexually on a hotel maid in . The charges were later dropped when prosecutors concluded that, even though the assault likely took place, the maid’s credibility was a problem. Still, Strauss-Kahn was forced to resign as the managing director of the . And his political career — he was the favorite to challenge President of in the election that will be decided on Sunday — was destroyed.The day before the alleged assault, Epstein writes, Strauss-Kahn had participated in a sex party in . He then flew to New York and got a room at the , whose parent company employed an executive close to Sarkozy’s intelligence coordinator, according to Epstein. After dinner, D.S.K. returned to the hotel with a woman who was seen exiting the ground-floor elevator at 3:56 a.m. Whenever he was visible on one of the hotel’s security cameras, a certain hotel executive could also be seen. Coincidence? Or was Strauss-Kahn being followed?The actions of the 32-year-old maid, Nafissatou Diallo, the next day added to the mystery. Several times she went in and out of a certain room on D.S.K.’s floor. She entered his suite twice without her cleaning equipment. After the alleged assault, D.S.K. left the hotel to have lunch with his daughter — while Diallo inexplicably re-entered his suite.It then took an hour for hotel security and Diallo to report the assault to the police. A few minutes after the call was made, two hotel officials were caught on camera doing a brief “victory dance.” (Epstein has included the hotel videos as part of his e-book.) When D.S.K. later realized that one of his cellphones was missing — a phone, Epstein notes ominously, that has never been found and whose GPS was turned off 23 minutes after he lost it — he called the hotel to see if it had been retrieved. That call led to his arrest.What does one make of all this? In the immediate aftermath of Strauss-Kahn’s arrest, French journalists flocked to the idea that he had somehow been set up by his enemies. But that thinking has largely faded, especially after it was revealed that D.S.K. had been involved in sex parties that included prostitutes and that were paid for by wealthy businessmen friends of his. The Washington orgy he attended the night before his alleged assault was part of that ring; it has since morphed into a bona fide scandal, and D.S.K. is once again in trouble with the law thanks to his sexual appetite.'"

"'12-04-30,'0','“There is a very toxic atmosphere between Republican legislators and the Dayton administration on this issue,” said Kate Johansen, manager of health policy at the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, which wants the state to establish its own exchange.In an interview, Mr. Dayton said that while some moderate Republicans would like to work with him, the Republican caucus in the Legislature had balked because it was dominated by “extreme right-wingers.”“For reasons of ideology and politics, they want to bash our effort to establish an exchange, rather than join it,” Mr. Dayton said, lamenting the power of “vitriolic antigovernment, anti-Obama” forces.State Representative Mary D. Franson, a conservative freshman Republican, said: “We have an ultraliberal governor who thinks he can do things by executive order like President Obama.”Ms. Franson said that if Mr. Dayton tried to establish an exchange without legislative approval, “he will have a fight on his hands because I’m like a mama bear; I’ll protect our citizens from the overreach of government.”The federal divide over health care is reflected at the state level, even in Minnesota, which has a progressive tradition and a long history of innovation and bipartisan cooperation on health policy.The exchange is the centerpiece of the new health care system envisioned by Mr. Obama. In the exchange, people who do not have insurance from employers will be able to get comparative information on health plans, insurers will compete on price and benefits, and the federal government will offer subsidies to lower- and middle-income people buying insurance.Mr. Dayton and his team are trying to carry out the new federal law over objections from Republicans, who control both houses of the Legislature for the first time in 38 years.“Health care reform is going ahead full speed in this state,” said Lawrence R. Jacobs, a political scientist at the .Mr. Jacobs said the governor was relying on an expansive concept of executive power to circumvent Republican opposition and apparently saw no need to compromise because he was confident that the Democrats would regain control of the Legislature in the November elections.Minnesota starts from an enviable position, with 91 percent of its population having health insurance — more than all but three or four states.For decades, Minnesota has been a health care innovator. The nonprofit , which traces its roots to 1864, pioneered the team-based approach to medical care now espoused by many health policy experts. A Minnesota doctor, Paul M. Ellwood Jr., was an early proponent of managed care and coined the term “health maintenance organization.” Minnesota expanded eligibility and was already covering most low-income children before Congress created the in 1997.The state’s top insurance regulator, Commerce Commissioner Michael Rothman, said the exchange would simplify the purchase of insurance for consumers and pool their purchasing power so they could get better prices.Minnesota has spent $1.4 million in federal money planning an exchange through which one-fifth of state residents — more than one million people — are expected to obtain coverage. That includes 450,000 people who will get subsidized private insurance and 600,000 who will enroll in Medicaid or other public insurance programs.State officials who speak fluently about arcane technical details of the insurance exchange — like risk adjustment, adverse selection and actuarial value — seem nonplused but undeterred by the Republicans’ resistance.When asked what was lost as a result of the Republicans’ absence, Mr. Rothman fell silent for a minute, then said, “We would like to keep an open dialogue with Republicans and all stakeholders.”Republicans object to both what is being done and how the governor is doing it.State Senator David W. Hann, a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee, said the exchange would “absolutely not create a true insurance marketplace” because it would control what products could be offered and might have a say over prices.“The exchange centralizes power in the hands of bureaucrats and is a step to single-payer health care that has been the dream of the political left for decades,” Mr. Hann said.Moreover, Mr. Hann said, Republicans are irked because “the governor has shown a propensity to act by executive order, as if he could establish an exchange by some kind of fiat or diktat.”Officials in the Dayton administration decline to say how far they can go in setting up an exchange without authority from the Legislature.Time is running out. Legislative leaders hope to adjourn the 2012 session this week. Federal officials must decide by Jan. 1 whether the state is able to run its own exchange.Republican legislators declined an invitation to participate in a Dayton administration task force guiding the development of the exchange. Twila Brase, president of the Citizens’ Council for Health Freedom, a free-market group mobilizing opposition to the exchange in Minnesota, sees little difference between one established by the state and one run by the federal government.“All exchanges must follow the Obamacare law and the Obamacare regulations,” Ms. Brase said.In his first official act after taking office in January 2011, Mr. Dayton issued an executive order expanding Medicaid to cover 95,000 low-income adults who would not otherwise have qualified until 2014.The reaction was a portent of things to come. Supporters cheered the governor’s action, while protesters packed the signing ceremony to denounce the new federal health care law as costly and unconstitutional.Minnesota takes pride in its culture of collaboration, fostered by civic-minded employers like and Target, which have worked together for more than two decades to improve health care and limit its cost.When , a Republican, was governor, he liked the idea of an exchange. “We will reduce costs by creating the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange, to allow uninsured individuals access to health insurance that will lower premium costs by roughly 30 percent,” Mr. Pawlenty said in his State of the State address in 2007.But State Representative Douglas G. Wardlow, a freshman Republican, said the creation of an exchange “in the context of Obamacare is an entirely different question.” The new law, he said, imposes so many requirements that it “turns the state into an instrumentality of the federal government and limits our ability to innovate.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','On Friday evening Bloom! Dance Collective, a group of five dancer-choreographers with roots in Hungary, Italy and Spain, made its American debut at Abrons Arts Center. If the piece it presented, “City,” is an indication, this group isn’t coy when it comes to addressing social issues. Even though these artists, based in London and Budapest, welcome humor and convey a decidedly casual vibe, “City” is political dance. End of story.Created and performed by Viktoria Danyi, Csaba Molnar, Timea Sebestyen, Moreno Solinas and Igor Urzelai, this 2010 evening-length work is Bloom’s first collaboration.Its “City” is less an urban milieu than a microcosm of the world where power games are led by a dogmatic leader with a computer-generated voice. Individualism is cause for mortification. Prejudice is rampant. It’s easy material for a dance, but it’s not exactly original: in essence, “City” is a choreographic version of Simon Says.Under Kata Dezsi’s bright lights, the five dancers formed a triangle and immediately disrobed. As the dancers stood in third position, with their arms held behind their backs — the stance was curiously bold and submissive — the mood shifted dramatically when circus music filled the theater. (The sound design is by Alberto Ruiz Soler.) The main attraction? Bouncing breasts and genitals. Linking arms, the dancers formed a long line that rotated as they pranced like trick horses.This was all about the power of the group, and it was over in a flash. After dressing, the performers retreated to chairs placed in rows on either side of the stage. Here, they grew restless, unconvincingly shifting their legs while sighing and crossing their arms.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','I USED to hate business travel. For six years, I flew so much that I was in the top tier of mileage for all the major airlines. At one point, I was flying to Europe nearly every week for most of a year.There was a woman in security at La Guardia who started to recognize me. One time she actually asked me if I was an air marshal. I think it’s because I had this special way of going through security. I could take off my shoes and belt and then put my computer on the belt in this really fluid move.I’m glad those days are over. I now think of myself as a recovered frequent flier, even though I still fly a lot to find beautiful objects for our site. I lost my special moves to get through security. I fumble like everyone else. Most of my mileage perks are gone, and I usually fly coach.And now, I love talking to seatmates. I can’t stop myself. I’ve learned a lot about all different kinds of careers.  I’ve met horse breeders, combat engineers, garbage men and one guy who was a commercial tank cleaner. I even talked fashion with a seamstress who worked a lot of fashion shows. She told me that there were about 20 different stitches she could use for a ripped hem. Who knew?Being more open can also lead to some incredible kindnesses. I was leaving Macau after a conference and I had three hours to catch my flight. The problem was there was a long boat trip and long taxi ride between me and the airport in Hong Kong. I wasn’t going to make it.  If I missed the flight, I would have to stay another day.I have young children and I wanted to get home. As I was checking out of the hotel, I was telling the woman behind the desk my troubles. She said that family was important and I should get home as soon as possible to tuck my children into bed. She then asked me if I wanted to take their helicopter.'"
"'12-04-30,'0','The tough talk makes Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak seem increasingly isolated in the international arena, where predictions of war in the near future have all but disappeared amid a focus on the negotiations scheduled to continue in Baghdad this month. American officials believe the looming threat of tighter sanctions July 1 has made the Iranians take the talks more seriously, and that the government has begun to prepare the people for a deal.In Israel, the dissent that burst into public view in recent days has been simmering here for some time, so it may actually have less of an effect.A poll conducted last week by Smith Research for The Jerusalem Post showed that fewer than half of Israelis back an independent strike on Iran. But about half disagreed with the harsh critique of Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Barak by Yuval Diskin, who retired last May as head of Shin Bet, Israel’s equivalent of the F.B.I.,  according to a poll conducted by Dahaf Institute.Other recent surveys show that about three-quarters consider a nuclear Iran an existential threat, and almost as many support a strike with American backing. Mr. Netanyahu’s popularity is strong, with polls showing his Likud Party would pick up seats in the next election, which is now expected in late summer or early fall.“Israelis like the hawkish rhetoric,” said Mina Zemach, director of the Dahaf Polling Institute. “Netanyahu is very strong now. What the public hopes is that Netanyahu prepares us just in case, if no one will stop Iran, then we have to attack.”Several political and security experts said that they did not expect to see a change in policy or tone from Mr. Netanyahu or Mr. Barak, but that the move to elections indicates that they do not believe a strike is imminent. And campaign season is likely to push the issue aside in favor of domestic concerns.“The minute we have a date set for elections, you have to assume that Bibi and Barak are not going to risk their electoral chances by taking some dramatic military initiative which could go wrong,” said Yossi Alpher, a strategic analyst who is an editor of BitterLemons.net, a Web site about the Middle East. “The Palestinian issue and Iran are not the first issues. This is not what preoccupies the public.”Iran insists that its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, but Israel says that Tehran must be prevented from developing the capacity to build a nuclear weapon.Despite the move toward early elections, and what many here believe is a commitment Mr. Netanyahu made to President Obama in March not to attack before the American elections, a senior intelligence official said the military option remains very much a live possibility. “It is affecting the regime,” he said of the international pressure. “We don’t think it will bring the regime to change the strategy.”In his speech, Mr. Barak said that sanctions had “forced the Iranians to take note, sit down and talk,” but that “actions speak louder than words.” He repeated his view that Iran is “approaching what I have termed the immunity zone,” in which the enrichment of uranium to weapons grade could not easily be stopped.“Just imagine the most unstable elements in the hands of the most unstable regime in one of the most unstable regions of the world,” he warned. “It is well understood in Washington, D.C., as well as in Jerusalem that as long as there is a future existential threat to our people, that all options to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons should stay on the table, and they will.”Yehuda Ben Meir, one of the directors of the national security and public opinion project at the Institute for National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, said that there was some discomfort among Israelis with Mr. Netanyahu’s comparing the Iranian threat to the Holocaust, but that “there’s a consensus about the severity of the threat and there’s a consensus that Israel should do whatever it can.”David Horovitz, a veteran journalist here who runs the new Web site The Times of Israel, said many Israelis view the strident tone as a “successful effort to create the sense in the international community that there needs to be more dramatic action in a nonmilitary sense.”“I don’t think what’s unfolding is deemed by Netanyahu and Barak to justify, ‘O.K., we can tone down the process,’ ” Mr. Horovitz said of the international pressure. “Quite the reverse.”'"
"'12-04-30,'0','New Yorkers have been trying to describe the color of the new taxis for the outer boroughs. Mayor Michael Bloomberg says it’s “apple green.” David Yassky, the taxi and limousine commissioner, calls it mint, instead of Shrek or bile or sea-foam green.This light-ish, lime-ish green, as it turned out, was about the only color left for official city vehicles. Red is best for firetrucks; blue is mostly reserved for the police. Orange wouldn’t work because, as Mr. Yassky explained, it is hard to get an orange that doesn’t look like yellow in some light. Black is mostly for limos and hearses. Forget white or gray; those are the favorite colors for private vehicles (which could cause confusion). So green it is.The first of these 18,000 cabs should start appearing on the streets in June. Under an agreement worked out in Albany last year, the new cabs will not be allowed to pick up customers in most of Manhattan or at the city airports. Those areas will be exclusively yellow cab territory for pickups. If the city moves rapidly, up to 6,000 of the new verdurous taxis will be on the streets by the end of the year, with 20 percent of them outfitted especially for the disabled.The green taxis are still controversial in the yellow cab world. The Metropolitan Taxicab Board of Trade, which represents the yellow cab industry, has filed suit arguing that their million-dollar medallions give them the exclusive right to operate in the city. The problem is that they can’t be easily found everywhere (just ask anybody in the Bronx or Queens). For millions of New Yorkers outside Manhattan, the green cabs will be a welcome sight.'"
